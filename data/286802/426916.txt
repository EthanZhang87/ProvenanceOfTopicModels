title: Model year
id: 426916
The model year sometimes abbreviated as MY is a method of describing the version of a product which has been produced over multiple years The model year may or may not be the same as the calendar year in which the product was manufactured br br br Automobiles br br br United States and Canada br br Automobiles in the United States and Canada are identified and regulated by model year whereas other markets use production date month year to identify specific vehicles and model codes in place of the year model year in the North American make model year identifier br In technical documents generated within the auto industry and its regulating agencies such as the U S National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and United States Environmental Protection Agency and Transport Canada and Environment Canada the letters MY often precede the year as in MY or MY Even without this prefix however in the North American context it is usually the model year rather than the vehicle s calendar year of production that is being referred to br The new model year typically begins in August to September of the preceding calendar year though can be as early as February such being the case for the fourth generation Acura MDX which started production in January This was partly due to the advertising of a new model being coordinated with the launch of the new television season in late September because of the heavy dependence between television to offer products from automakers to advertise and the car companies to launch their new models at a high profile time of year Imported cars use the model year convention in the U S and Canada even when this system is not used for the same cars when sold in other countries br The concept of yearly styling updates a practice adopted from the fashion industry was introduced to General Motors range of cars by Alfred P Sloan in the s This was an early form of planned obsolescence in the car industry where yearly styling changes meant consumers could easily discern a car s newness or lack of it Other major changes to the model range usually coincided with the launch of the new model year for example the model year of the Ford Model A began production in October and the model year of the Ford Thunderbird began production in September br Model year followed with calendar year until the mid s until then president Franklin D Roosevelt signed an executive order to release vehicle model years in the fall of the preceding year in order to standardize employment in the automotive industry The practice of beginning production of next year s model before the end of the year has become a long standing tradition in America br For purposes such as VINs and emissions control regulations allow cars of a given model year to be sold starting on January of the previous calendar year For example a model year vehicle can legally go on sale starting January This has resulted in a few cars in the following model year being introduced in advertisements during the NFL Super Bowl in February A notable example of an early model year launch would be the Ford Mustang introduced as an early model informally referred to as in April br at the World s Fair several months before the usual start of the model year in August br For recreational vehicles the U S Federal Trade Commission allows a manufacturer to use a model year up to two years before the date that the vehicle was manufactured br br br Other countries br br In other countries it is more common to identify specific vehicles by their year and month of production and cars of a particular type by their generation using terms such as Mark III or by the manufacturer s code for that kind of car such as BL being the code for a Mazda built between November and June br In Europe the lesser use of model years as a descriptor is partly because since the s many vehicles are introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in March the Frankfurt Motor Show in September or the Paris Motor Show in September New models have increasingly been launched in June or July br As with the rest of Europe the motor industry in the United Kingdom did not regularly make use of model years in the way common in the US since cars were not as regularly updated or altered Some exceptions existed for instance in the s and s the Rootes Group deliberately copied American practice and performed annual small alterations to its key models such as the Hillman Minx and the Humber Super Snipe However these were still not identified by model years but by Series numbers sometimes with alphabetical designations such as the Minx Series IIIA IIIB and IIIC to distinguish what were mostly cosmetic updates rather than mechanical or structural improvements As in America the British motor industry did generally announce new models or updates to existing ones in September However this was the norm long before it became practice in the US and did not originate with the television season Instead it began because the long established practice in the manufacturing industries of the English Midlands especially Coventry and Birmingham where the British car industry developed out of the established bicycle and machine tool trades was to close factories and give workers a two week holiday in August or September This was used as a chance to renew tooling in the factory and was an ideal time to introduce new products which would begin production when the workers returned and the factory restarted Thus the working year in the car industry ran from September to September New or improved models would be announced in the summer and would be displayed at the British Motor Show which was held in October Here they would be seen by the wider industry and buying public for the first time just as the cars produced in the previous weeks began reaching the dealerships ready for sale Therefore car models intended for sale during say would be announced and displayed in the third quarter of with sales beginning before the end of the year and any improvements intended for would be announced in September and displayed at the Motor Show in October br This convention was not absolute for instance the original Vauxhall Victor was officially announced in February with sales beginning later the same month and subsequent additions and updates to the Victor range were all introduced in February notably Vauxhall s factory was outside the traditional centre of the industry being in Luton and so did not follow the common working calendar Being owned by General Motors Vauxhall also generally made minor changes to its cars year by year even referring to model years in some of its literature but these did not have the same official weight or significant to buyers as they did in America During the s British car makers began giving journalists access to upcoming models earlier in the year to get announcements out ahead of their rivals and clear of the busy September period This developed into increasingly lavish and sophisticated media and marketing events happening earlier and earlier in the year Changes to working practices the in roads made to the British market by car makers from other countries and the decline in market share by British firms finally led to the tradition of new models being introduced in September being abandoned although the British Motor Show continued to be held in October br br br VIN encoding br br The standardized format of the vehicle identification number VIN used in the United States and Canada includes the model year of the vehicle as the th digit The actual date that the vehicle was produced is not part of the VIN but it is required to be shown on the vehicle safety certification label br br br Other products br In addition to automobiles some other products that often have model years include br br br See also br Car model br Vehicle emission standard br br br
