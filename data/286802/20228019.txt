Carl Donald Keith May November was a chemist who was inventor of the three way catalytic converter which has played a dramatic role in reducing pollution from motor vehicles since their introduction in the mid s br Keith was born on May in Stewart Creek West Virginia to Howard a steelworker and Mary Rawson Keith who worked in a bakery He received a bachelor s degree from Salem College in North Carolina in earned a master s degree in chemistry from Indiana University in and was awarded a doctorate from DePaul University in br From to Keith was a chemist at Sinclair Oil He later was hired by Engelhard Industries br From until his retirement from Engelhard in Keith was an executive vice president president and finally chairman of the company br br br Catalytic converter br br The amendments to the Clean Air Act required significant reductions in hydrocarbon carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide emissions The converters available at the time were oxidation catalysts which could handle hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide but were ineffective in reducing nitrogen oxides Car manufacturers and catalyst companies were trying to develop a multiple step process that would address hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in one process while reducing nitrogen oxides in another br The three way catalyst developed by Keith and chemical engineer John J Mooney with their team at Englehard allowed all three exhaust pollutants to be remediated using a single catalyst bed Their solution to addressing the variations in air fuel mixtures was to combine rare earth oxides and base metal oxide components in the catalyst together with Platinum and Rhodium in a ceramic honeycomb with tiny passages coated with the catalytic material This design ensured that the oxygen needed in the reactions was absorbed up when it was in excess and released when it was needed allowing all three pollutants to be removed in a single catalytic component The three way catalytic converter reduces nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and oxygen oxidizes carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and oxidizes unburnt hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water br The initial catalytic converters were installed in cars in the model year In the three way catalyst was introduced which after updates has been able to eliminate of tailpipe hydrocarbon emissions of carbon monoxide and of nitrogen oxides produced in automobile engines and those used in light trucks and sport utility vehicles A statement cited by The New York Times from the United States Environmental Protection Agency showed that cars today produce less nitrogen oxide emissions than cars from the s and the three way catalytic converter is the greatest contributor to that reduction br br br Awards br In Keith and Mooney received the Walter Ahlstrom Prize awarded in conjunction with the Finnish Academies of Technology for their work in inventing and commercializing the three way catalytic converter Estimates were that by the time the award was received the converters developed by Keith were installed in of new cars manufactured worldwide and had prevented million tons of hydrocarbons million tons of nitrogen oxides and billion tons of carbon monoxide from being emitted as pollution in the years since their introduction br Together with Mooney Keith was honored by the United States Patent and Trademark Office with the National Medal of Technology awarded For the invention application to automobiles and commercialization of the three way catalytic converter Through their persistent efforts this technology is the key emission control component in all new light duty vehicles in the United States and throughout the world br br br Death br Keith was a resident of Marco Island Florida He died at age on November while visiting one of his daughters in New Bern North Carolina The cause of death was not immediately disclosed br br br
