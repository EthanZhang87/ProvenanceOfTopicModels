Kerosene or paraffin is a combustible hydrocarbon liquid which is derived from petroleum It is widely used as a fuel in aviation as well as households Its name derives from k r s meaning wax and was registered as a trademark by Nova Scotia geologist and inventor Abraham Gesner in before evolving into a generic trademark It is sometimes spelled kerosine in scientific and industrial usage br Kerosene is widely used to power jet engines of aircraft jet fuel as well as some rocket engines in a highly refined form called RP It is also commonly used as a cooking and lighting fuel and for fire toys such as poi In parts of Asia kerosene is sometimes used as fuel for small outboard motors or even motorcycles World total kerosene consumption for all purposes is equivalent to about barrels per day as of July br The term kerosene is common in much of Argentina Australia Canada India New Zealand Nigeria and the United States while the term paraffin or a closely related variant is used in Chile East Africa South Africa Norway and the United Kingdom The term lamp oil or the equivalent in the local languages is common in the majority of Asia and the Southeastern United States although in Appalachia it is also commonly referred to as coal oil br Confusingly the name paraffin is also used to refer to a number of distinct petroleum byproducts other than kerosene For instance liquid paraffin called mineral oil in the US is a more viscous and highly refined product which is used as a laxative Paraffin wax is a waxy solid extracted from petroleum br To prevent confusion between kerosene and the much more flammable and volatile gasoline petrol some jurisdictions regulate markings or colourings for containers used to store or dispense kerosene For example in the United States Pennsylvania requires that portable containers used at retail service stations for kerosene be colored blue as opposed to red for gasoline or yellow for diesel br The World Health Organization considers kerosene to be a polluting fuel and recommends that governments and practitioners immediately stop promoting its household use Kerosene smoke contains high levels of harmful particulate matter and household use of kerosene is associated with higher risks of cancer respiratory infections asthma tuberculosis cataracts and adverse pregnancy outcomes br br br Properties and grades br Kerosene is a low viscosity clear liquid formed from hydrocarbons obtained from the fractional distillation of petroleum between and C and F resulting in a mixture with a density of g cm It is miscible with petroleum solvents but immiscible with water It is composed of hydrocarbon molecules that typically contain between carbon atoms per molecule predominantly containing to carbon atoms br Regardless of crude oil source or processing history kerosene s major components are branched and straight chain alkanes hydrocarbon chains and naphthenes cycloalkanes which normally account for at least of volume Aromatic hydrocarbons such as alkylbenzenes single ring and alkylnaphthalenes double ring do not normally exceed by volume of kerosene streams Olefins are usually not present at more than by volume br The heat of combustion of kerosene is similar to that of diesel fuel its lower heating value is MJ kg around Btu lb and its higher heating value is MJ kg Btu lb br The ASTM International standard specification D Archived August at the Wayback Machine recognizes two grades of kerosene grades K less than sulfur by weight and K sulfur by weight K grade kerosene burns cleaner with fewer deposits fewer toxins and less frequent maintenance than K grade kerosene and is the preferred grade of kerosene for indoor kerosene heaters and stoves br In the United Kingdom two grades of heating oil are defined BS Class C is the lightest grade used for lanterns camping stoves and wick heaters and mixed with petrol in some vintage combustion engines as a substitute for tractor vaporizing oil BS Class C is a heavier distillate which is used as domestic heating oil Premium kerosene is usually sold in or litre containers from hardware camping and garden stores and is often dyed purple Standard kerosene is usually dispensed in bulk by a tanker and is undyed br National and international standards define the properties of several grades of kerosene used for jet fuel Flash point and freezing point properties are particularly interesting for operation and safety the standards also define additives for control of static electricity and other purposes br br br Melting freeze and flash points br Kerosene is liquid around room temperature C F The flash point of kerosene is between C F and C F and its autoignition temperature is C F The freezing point of kerosene depends on grade with commercial aviation fuel standardized at C F br K grade kerosene freezes around C F K br br br History br br The process of distilling crude oil petroleum into kerosene as well as other hydrocarbon compounds was first written about in the ninth century by the Persian scholar R zi or Rhazes In his Kitab al Asrar Book of Secrets the physician and chemist Razi described two methods for the production of kerosene termed naft abyad white naphtha using an apparatus called an alembic One method used clay as an absorbent and later the other method using chemicals like ammonium chloride sal ammoniac The distillation process was repeated until most of the volatile hydrocarbon fractions had been removed and the final product was perfectly clear and safe to burn Kerosene was also produced during the same period from oil shale and bitumen by heating the rock to extract the oil which was then distilled During the Chinese Ming Dynasty the Chinese made use of kerosene through extracting and purifying petroleum and then converted it into lamp fuel The Chinese made use of petroleum for lighting lamps and heating homes as early as BC br br br Illuminating oil from coal and oil shale br br Although coal oil was well known by industrial chemists at least as early as the s as a byproduct of making coal gas and coal tar it burned with a smoky flame that prevented its use for indoor illumination In cities much indoor illumination was provided by piped in coal gas but outside the cities and for spot lighting within the cities the lucrative market for fueling indoor lamps was supplied by whale oil specifically that from sperm whales which burned brighter and cleaner br Canadian geologist Abraham Pineo Gesner claimed that in he had given a public demonstration in Charlottetown Prince Edward Island of a new process he had discovered He heated coal in a retort and distilled from it a clear thin fluid that he showed made an excellent lamp fuel He coined the name kerosene for his fuel a contraction of keroselaion meaning wax oil The cost of extracting kerosene from coal was high br Gesner recalled from his extensive knowledge of New Brunswick s geology a naturally occurring asphaltum called albertite He was blocked from using it by the New Brunswick coal conglomerate because they had coal extraction rights for the province and he lost a court case when their experts claimed albertite was a form of coal In Gesner moved to Newtown Creek Long Island New York There he secured backing from a group of businessmen They formed the North American Gas Light Company to which he assigned his patents br Despite clear priority of discovery Gesner did not obtain his first kerosene patent until two years after James Young s United States patent Gesner s method of purifying the distillation products appears to have been superior to Young s resulting in a cleaner and better smelling fuel Manufacture of kerosene under the Gesner patents began in New York in and later in Boston being distilled from bituminous coal and oil shale Gesner registered the word Kerosene as a trademark in and for several years only the North American Gas Light Company and the Downer Company to which Gesner had granted the right were allowed to call their lamp oil Kerosene in the United States br In Scottish chemist James Young experimented with oil discovered seeping in a coal mine as a source of lubricating oil and illuminating fuel When the seep became exhausted he experimented with the dry distillation of coal especially the resinous boghead coal torbanite He extracted a number of useful liquids from it one of which he named paraffine oil because at low temperatures it congealed into a substance that resembled paraffin wax Young took out a patent on his process and the resulting products in and built the first truly commercial oil works in the world at Bathgate in using oil extracted from locally mined torbanite shale and bituminous coal In he took out a United States patent for the same invention These patents were subsequently upheld in both countries in a series of lawsuits and other producers were obliged to pay him royalties br br br Kerosene from petroleum br In Samuel Martin Kier began selling lamp oil to local miners under the name Carbon Oil He distilled this from crude oil by a process of his own invention He also invented a new lamp to burn his product He has been dubbed the Grandfather of the American Oil Industry by historians Kier s salt wells began to be fouled with petroleum in the s At first Kier simply dumped the oil into the nearby Pennsylvania Main Line Canal as useless waste but later he began experimenting with several distillates of the crude oil along with a chemist from eastern Pennsylvania br Ignacy ukasiewicz a Polish pharmacist residing in Lviv and his Hungarian partner Jan Zeh had been experimenting with different distillation techniques trying to improve on Gesner s kerosene process but using oil from a local petroleum seep Many people knew of his work but paid little attention to it On the night of July doctors at the local hospital needed to perform an emergency operation virtually impossible by candlelight They therefore sent a messenger for ukasiewicz and his new lamps The lamp burned so brightly and cleanly that the hospital officials ordered several lamps plus a large supply of fuel ukasiewicz realized the potential of his work and quit the pharmacy to find a business partner and then traveled to Vienna to register his technique with the government ukasiewicz moved to the Gorlice region of Poland in and sank several wells across southern Poland over the following decade setting up a refinery near Jas o in br The petroleum discovery at the Drake Well in western Pennsylvania in caused a great deal of public excitement and investment drilling in new wells not only in Pennsylvania but also in Canada where petroleum had been discovered at Oil Springs Ontario in and southern Poland where Ignacy ukasiewicz had been distilling lamp oil from petroleum seeps since The increased supply of petroleum allowed oil refiners to entirely side step the oil from coal patents of both Young and Gesner and produce illuminating oil from petroleum without paying royalties to anyone As a result the illuminating oil industry in the United States completely switched over to petroleum in the s The petroleum based illuminating oil was widely sold as Kerosene and the trade name soon lost its proprietary status and became the lower case generic product kerosene Because Gesner s original Kerosene had been also known as coal oil generic kerosene from petroleum was commonly called coal oil in some parts of the United States well into the th century br In the United Kingdom manufacturing oil from coal or oil shale continued into the early th century although increasingly overshadowed by petroleum oils br As kerosene production increased whaling declined The American whaling fleet which had been steadily growing for years reached its all time peak of ships in By just two years later the fleet had dropped to ships The Civil War cut into American whaling temporarily but only whaling ships returned to sea in the first full year of peace and that number dwindled until only American ships set out to hunt whales in Kerosene made first from coal and oil shale then from petroleum had largely taken over whaling s lucrative market in lamp oil br Electric lighting started displacing kerosene as an illuminant in the late th century especially in urban areas However kerosene remained the predominant commercial end use for petroleum refined in the United States until when it was exceeded by motor fuels The rise of the gasoline powered automobile in the early th century created a demand for the lighter hydrocarbon fractions and refiners invented methods to increase their output of gasoline while decreasing their output of kerosene In addition some of the heavier hydrocarbons that previously went into kerosene were incorporated into diesel fuel Kerosene kept some market share by being increasingly used in stoves and portable heaters br br br Kerosene from carbon dioxide and water br A pilot project by ETH Zurich used solar power to produce kerosene from carbon dioxide and water in July The product can be used in existing aviation applications and can also be blended with fossil derived kerosene br br br Production br br Kerosene is produced by fractional distillation of crude oil in an oil refinery It condenses at a temperature intermediate between diesel fuel which is less volatile and naphtha and gasoline which are more volatile br Kerosene made up percent by volume of petroleum refinery output in in the United States of which nearly all was kerosene type jet fuel percent br br br Applications br br br As fuel br br br Heating and lighting br The fuel also known as heating oil in the UK and Ireland remains widely used in kerosene lamps and lanterns in the developing world Although it replaced whale oil the edition of Elements of Chemistry said The vapor of this substance kerosene mixed with air is as explosive as gunpowder This statement may have been due to the common practice of adulterating kerosene with cheaper but more volatile hydrocarbon mixtures such as naphtha br Kerosene was a significant fire risk in nearly two of every five New York City fires were caused by defective kerosene lamps br In less developed countries kerosene is an important source of energy for cooking and lighting It is used as a cooking fuel in portable stoves for backpackers As a heating fuel it is often used in portable stoves and is sold in some filling stations It is sometimes used as a heat source during power failures br br Kerosene is widely used in Japan and Chile as a home heating fuel for portable and installed kerosene heaters In Chile and Japan kerosene can be readily bought at any filling station or be delivered to homes in some cases br In the United Kingdom and Ireland kerosene is often used as a heating fuel in areas not connected to a gas pipeline network It is used less for cooking with LPG being preferred because it is easier to light Kerosene is often the fuel of choice for range cookers such as Rayburn Additives such as RangeKlene can be put into kerosene to ensure that it burns cleaner and produces less soot when used in range cookers br The Amish who generally abstain from the use of electricity rely on kerosene for lighting at night br More ubiquitous in the late th and early th centuries kerosene space heaters were often built into kitchen ranges and kept many farm and fishing families warm and dry through the winter At one time citrus growers used a smudge pot fueled by kerosene to create a pall of thick smoke over a grove in an effort to prevent freezing temperatures from damaging crops Salamanders are kerosene space heaters used on construction sites to dry out building materials and to warm workers Before the days of electrically lighted road barriers highway construction zones were marked at night by kerosene fired pot bellied torches Most of these uses of kerosene created thick black smoke because of the low temperature of combustion br A notable exception discovered in the early th century is the use of a gas mantle mounted above the wick on a kerosene lamp Looking like a delicate woven bag above the woven cotton wick the mantle is a residue of mineral materials mostly thorium dioxide heated to incandescence by the flame from the wick The thorium and cerium oxide combination produces both a whiter light and a greater fraction of the energy in the form of visible light than a black body at the same temperature would These types of lamps are still in use today in areas of the world without electricity because they give a much better light than a simple wick type lamp does Recently a multipurpose lantern that doubles as a cook stove has been introduced in India in areas with no electricity br br br Cooking br br In countries such as Nigeria kerosene is the main fuel used for cooking especially by the poor and kerosene stoves have replaced traditional wood based cooking appliances As such increase in the price of kerosene can have a major political and environmental consequence The Indian government subsidizes the fuel to keep the price very low to around U S cents per liter as of February as lower prices discourage dismantling of forests for cooking fuel In Nigeria an attempt by the government to remove a fuel subsidy that includes kerosene met with strong opposition br Kerosene is used as a fuel in portable stoves especially in Primus stoves invented in Portable kerosene stoves earn a reputation of reliable and durable stove in everyday use and perform especially well under adverse conditions In outdoor activities and mountaineering a decisive advantage of pressurized kerosene stoves over gas cartridge stoves is their particularly high thermal output and their ability to operate at very low temperature in winter or at high altitude Wick stoves like Perfection s or wickless like Boss continue to be used by the Amish and off grid living and in natural disasters where there is no power available br br br Engines br In the early to mid th century kerosene or tractor vaporizing oil TVO was used as a cheap fuel for tractors and hit n miss engines The engine would start on gasoline then switch over to kerosene once the engine warmed up On some engines a heat valve on the manifold would route the exhaust gasses around the intake pipe heating the kerosene to the point where it was vaporized and could be ignited by an electric spark br In Europe following the Second World War automobiles were similarly modified to run on kerosene rather than gasoline which they would have to import and pay heavy taxes on Besides additional piping and the switch between fuels the head gasket was replaced by a much thicker one to diminish the compression ratio making the engine less powerful and less efficient but able to run on kerosene The necessary equipment was sold under the trademark Econom br During the fuel crisis of the s Saab Valmet developed and series produced the Saab Petro that ran on kerosene turpentine or gasoline The project codenamed Project Lapponia was headed by Simo Vuorio and towards the end of the s a working prototype was produced based on the Saab GL The car was designed to run on two fuels Gasoline was used for cold starts and when extra power was needed but normally it ran on kerosene or turpentine The idea was that the gasoline could be made from peat using the Fischer Tropsch process Between and Saab Petros and Talbot Horizons a version of the Chrysler Horizon that integrated many Saab components were made One reason to manufacture kerosene fueled cars was that in Finland kerosene was less heavily taxed than gasoline br Kerosene is used to fuel smaller horsepower outboard motors built by Yamaha Suzuki and Tohatsu Primarily used on small fishing craft these are dual fuel engines that start on gasoline and then transition to kerosene once the engine reaches optimum operating temperature Multiple fuel Evinrude and Mercury Racing engines also burn kerosene as well as jet fuel br Today kerosene is mainly used in fuel for jet engines in several grades One highly refined form of the fuel is known as RP and is often burned with liquid oxygen as rocket fuel These fuel grade kerosenes meet specifications for smoke points and freeze points The combustion reaction can be approximated as follows with the molecular formula C H dodecane br br C H l O g CO g H O g H kJ br In the initial phase of liftoff the Saturn V launch vehicle was powered by the reaction of liquid oxygen with RP For the five meganewton sea level thrust F rocket engines of the Saturn V burning together the reaction generated roughly watts J s gigawatt or million horsepower br Kerosene is sometimes used as an additive in diesel fuel to prevent gelling or waxing in cold temperatures br Ultra low sulfur kerosene is a custom blended fuel used by the New York City Transit Authority to power its bus fleet The transit agency started using this fuel in prior to the widespread adoption of ultra low sulfur diesel which has since become the standard In the suppliers of the custom fuel failed to tender for a renewal of the transit agency s contract leading to a negotiated contract at a significantly increased cost br JP for Jet Propellant a kerosene based fuel is used by the United States military as a replacement in diesel fueled vehicles and for powering aircraft JP is also used by the U S military and its NATO allies as a fuel for heaters stoves tanks and as a replacement for diesel fuel in the engines of nearly all tactical ground vehicles and electrical generators br br br Chemical processes br Aliphatic kerosene is a type of kerosene which has a low aromatic hydrocarbon content the aromatic content of crude oil varies greatly from oil field to oil field However by solvent extraction it is possible to separate aromatic hydrocarbons from aliphatic alkane hydrocarbons A common method is solvent extraction with methanol DMSO or sulfolane Aromatic kerosene is a grade of kerosene with a large concentration of aromatic hydrocarbons an example of this would be Exon s Solvesso br Kerosene is commonly used in metal extraction as the diluent for example in copper extraction by LIX it can be used in mixer settlers br Kerosene is used as a diluent in the PUREX extraction process but it is increasingly being supplanted by dodecane and other artificial hydrocarbons such as TPH Hydrogenated Propylene Trimer Traditionally the UK plants at Sellafield used aromatic kerosene to reduce the radiolysis of TBP while the French nuclear industry tended to use diluents with very little aromatic content The French nuclear reprocessing plants typically use TPH as their diluent In recent times it has been shown by Mark Foreman at Chalmers that aliphatic kerosene can be replaced in solvent extraction with HVO which is a second generation biodiesel made by Neste br In X ray crystallography kerosene can be used to store crystals When a hydrated crystal is left in air dehydration may occur slowly This makes the color of the crystal become dull Kerosene can keep air away from the crystal br It can be also used to prevent air from re dissolving in a boiled liquid and to store alkali metals such as potassium sodium and rubidium with the exception of lithium which is less dense than kerosene causing it to float br br br In entertainment br Kerosene is often used in the entertainment industry for fire performances such as fire breathing fire juggling or poi and fire dancing Because of its low flame temperature when burnt in free air the risk is lower should the performer come in contact with the flame Kerosene is generally not recommended as fuel for indoor fire dancing as it produces an unpleasant to some odor which becomes poisonous in sufficient concentration Ethanol was sometimes used instead but the flames it produces look less impressive and its lower flash point poses a high risk br br br In industry br As a petroleum product miscible with many industrial liquids kerosene can be used as both a solvent able to remove other petroleum products such as chain grease and as a lubricant with less risk of combustion when compared to using gasoline It can also be used as a cooling agent in metal production and treatment oxygen free conditions br In the petroleum industry kerosene is often used as a synthetic hydrocarbon for corrosion experiments to simulate crude oil in field conditions br br br Solvent br Kerosene can be used as an adhesive remover on hard to remove mucilage or adhesive left by stickers on a glass surface such as in show windows of stores br It can be used to remove candle wax that has dripped onto a glass surface it is recommended that the excess wax be scraped off prior to applying kerosene via a soaked cloth or tissue paper br It can be used to clean bicycle and motorcycle chains of old lubricant before relubrication br It can also be used to thin oil based paint used in fine art Some artists even use it to clean their brushes however it leaves the bristles greasy to the touch br br br Others br It has seen use for water tank mosquito control in Australia where a temporary thin floating layer above the water protects it until the defective tank is repaired br br br Toxicity br The World Health Organization considers kerosene to be a polluting fuel and recommends that governments and practitioners immediately stop promoting its household use Kerosene smoke contains high levels of harmful particulate matter and household use of kerosene is associated with higher risks of cancer respiratory infections asthma tuberculosis cataract and adverse pregnancy outcomes br Ingestion of kerosene is harmful Kerosene is sometimes recommended as a folk remedy for killing head lice but health agencies warn against this as it can cause burns and serious illness A kerosene shampoo can even be fatal if fumes are inhaled br People can be exposed to kerosene in the workplace by breathing it in swallowing it skin contact and eye contact The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has set a recommended exposure limit of mg m over an hour workday br br br See also br br br br br br Notes br br br External
