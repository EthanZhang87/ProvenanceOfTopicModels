id: 10934212
Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances called pollutants in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings or cause damage to the climate or to materials It is also the contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment either by chemical physical or biological agents that alters the natural features of the atmosphere There are many different types of air pollutants such as gases including ammonia carbon monoxide sulfur dioxide nitrous oxides methane and chlorofluorocarbons particulates both organic and inorganic and biological molecules Air pollution can cause diseases allergies and even death to humans it can also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and crops and may damage the natural environment for example climate change ozone depletion or habitat degradation or built environment for example acid rain Air pollution can be caused by both human activities and natural phenomena br Air quality is closely related to the Earth s climate and ecosystems globally Many of the contributors of air pollution are also sources of greenhouse emission i e burning of fossil fuel br Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution related diseases including respiratory infections heart disease chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD stroke and lung cancer Growing evidence suggests that air pollution exposure may be associated with reduced IQ scores impaired cognition increased risk for psychiatric disorders such as depression and detrimental perinatal health The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching but principally affect the body s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to the degree of exposure and the individual s health status and genetics br Air pollution is the largest environmental risk factor for disease and premature death and the fourth largest risk factor overall for human health Air pollution causes the premature deaths of around million people worldwide each year or a global mean loss of life expectancy LLE of years and there has been no significant change in the number of deaths caused by all forms of pollution since at least Outdoor air pollution attributable to fossil fuel use alone causes million deaths annually making it one of the top contributors to human death Anthropogenic ozone causes around premature deaths a year and fine particulate PM pollution around another million The scope of the air pollution crisis is large In WHO estimated that out of people breathe air containing high levels of pollutants Although the health consequences are extensive the way the problem is handled is considered largely haphazard or neglected br The World Bank has estimated that welfare losses premature deaths and productivity losses lost labour caused by air pollution cost the world economy trillion per year The costs of air pollution are generally an externality to the contemporary economic system and most human activity although they are sometimes recovered through monitoring legislation and regulation br Many different technologies and strategies are available for reducing air pollution Although a majority of countries have air pollution laws according to UNEP percent of countries lack a legal definition of air pollution percent lack outdoor air quality standards percent restrict their definition to outdoor pollution only and just percent have laws for tackling pollution originating from outside their borders National air quality laws have often been highly effective notably the Clean Air Act in Britain and the US Clean Air Act introduced in Some of these efforts have been successful at the international level such as the Montreal Protocol which reduced the release of harmful ozone depleting chemicals and the Helsinki Protocol which reduced sulfur emissions while others such as international action on climate change have been less successful br br br Sources of air pollution br There are many different sources of air pollution Some air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides originate mainly from human activities while some notably radon gas come mostly from natural sources However many air pollutants including dust and sulfur dioxide come from a mixture of natural and human sources br br br Anthropogenic human made sources br br Stationary sources include br fossil fuel power plants and biomass power plants both have smoke stacks see for example environmental impact of the coal industry br Oil and gas sites that have methane leaks br burning of traditional biomass such as wood crop waste and dung In developing and poor countries traditional biomass burning is the major source of air pollutants It is also the main source of particulate pollution in many developed areas including the UK New South Wales Its pollutants include PAHs br manufacturing facilities factories br a study found that in China equipment machinery and devices manufacturing and construction sectors contributed more than of air pollutant emissions This high emission is due to high emission intensity and high emission factors in its industrial structure br construction br waste incineration incinerators as well as open and uncontrolled fires of mismanaged waste making up about a fourth of municipal solid terrestrial waste br furnaces and other types of fuel burning heating devices br Mobile sources include motor vehicles Trains particularly diesel locomotives and DMUs marine vessels and aircraft as well as rockets and re entry of components and debris The air pollution externality of cars enters the air from the exhaust gas and car tires including microplastics Road vehicles make a significant amount of all air pollution typically for example around a third to a half of all nitrogen dioxide emissions and are a major driver of climate change br Agriculture and forest management strategies using controlled burns Practices like slash and burn in forests like the Amazon cause large air pollution with the deforestation Controlled or prescribed burning is a practice used in forest management agriculture prairie restoration and greenhouse gas reduction Foresters can use controlled fire as a tool because fire is a natural feature of both forest and grassland ecology Controlled burning encourages the sprouting of some desirable forest trees resulting in a forest renewal br There are also sources from processes other than combustion br br Fumes from paint hair spray varnish aerosol sprays and other solvents These can be substantial emissions from these sources was estimated to account for almost half of pollution from volatile organic compounds in the Los Angeles basin in the s br Waste deposition in landfills produces methane and open burning of waste releases harmful substances br Nuclear weapons toxic gases germ warfare and rocketry are examples of military resources br Agricultural emissions and emissions from meat production or livestock contribute substantially to air pollution br Fertilized farmland may be a major source of nitrogen oxides br br br Natural sources br br Dust from natural sources usually large areas of land with little vegetation or no vegetation br Methane emitted by the digestion of food by animals for example cattle br Radon gas from radioactive decay within the Earth s crust Radon is a colorless odorless naturally occurring radioactive noble gas that is formed from the decay of radium It is considered to be a health hazard Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings especially in confined areas such as the basement and it is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer after cigarette smoking br Smoke and carbon monoxide from wildfires During periods of active wildfires smoke from uncontrolled biomass combustion can make up almost of all air pollution by concentration br Vegetation in some regions emits environmentally significant amounts of volatile organic compounds VOCs on warmer days These VOCs react with primary anthropogenic pollutants specifically NOx SO and anthropogenic organic carbon compounds to produce a seasonal haze of secondary pollutants Black gum poplar oak and willow are some examples of vegetation that can produce abundant VOCs The VOC production from these species result in ozone levels up to eight times higher than the low impact tree species br Volcanic activity which produces sulfur chlorine and ash particulates br br br Emission factors br br Air pollutant emission factors are reported representative values that aim to link the quantity of a pollutant released into the ambient air to an activity connected with that pollutant s release The weight of the pollutant divided by a unit weight volume distance or time of the activity generating the pollutant is how these factors are commonly stated e g kilograms of particulate emitted per tonne of coal burned These criteria make estimating emissions from diverse sources of pollution easier Most of the time these components are just averages of all available data of acceptable quality and they are thought to be typical of long term averages br The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants identified pesticides and other persistent organic pollutants of concern These include dioxins and furans which are unintentionally created by combustion of organics like open burning of plastics and are endocrine disruptors and mutagens br br The United States Environmental Protection Agency has published a compilation of air pollutant emission factors for a wide range of industrial sources The United Kingdom Australia Canada and many other countries have published similar compilations as well as the European Environment Agency br br br Pollutants br br An air pollutant is a material in the air that can have many effects on humans and the ecosystem The substance can be solid particles liquid droplets or gases and often takes the form of an aerosol solid particles or liquid droplets dispersed and carried by a gas A pollutant can be of natural origin or man made Pollutants are classified as primary or secondary Primary pollutants are usually produced by processes such as ash from a volcanic eruption br Other examples include carbon monoxide gas from motor vehicle exhausts or sulfur dioxide released from factories Secondary pollutants are not emitted directly Rather they form in the air when primary pollutants react or interact Ground level ozone is a prominent example of a secondary pollutant Some pollutants may be both primary and secondary they are both emitted directly and formed from other primary pollutants br br br Primary pollutants br br Pollutants emitted into the atmosphere by human activity include br br Ammonia Emitted mainly by agricultural waste Ammonia is a compound with the formula NH It is normally encountered as a gas with a characteristic pungent odor Ammonia contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to foodstuffs and fertilizers Ammonia either directly or indirectly is also a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals Although in wide use ammonia is both caustic and hazardous In the atmosphere ammonia reacts with oxides of nitrogen and sulfur to form secondary particles br Carbon dioxide CO Carbon dioxide is a natural component of the atmosphere essential for plant life and given off by the human respiratory system It is potentially lethal at very high concentrations typically times normal atmospheric levels Although the World Health Organization recognizes CO as a climate pollutant it does not include the gas in its Air Quality Guidelines or set recommended targets for it Because of its role as a greenhouse gas CO has been described as the worst climate pollutant Statements such as this refer to its long term atmospheric effects rather than shorter term effects on such things as human health food crops and buildings This question of terminology has practical consequences for example in determining whether the U S Clean Air Act which is designed to improve air quality is deemed to regulate CO emissions That issue was resolved in the United States by the Inflation Reduction Act of which specifically amended the Clean Air Act to define the carbon dioxide produced by the burning of fossil fuels as an air pollutant CO currently forms about parts per million ppm of Earth s atmosphere compared to about ppm in pre industrial times and billions of metric tons of CO are emitted annually by burning of fossil fuels CO increase in Earth s atmosphere has been accelerating CO is an asphyxiant gas and not classified as toxic or harmful in general Workplace exposure limits exist in places like UK ppm for long term exposure and ppm for short term exposure Natural disasters like the limnic eruption at Lake Nyos can result in a sudden release of huge amount of CO as well br Carbon monoxide CO CO is a colorless odorless toxic gas It is a product of combustion of fuel such as natural gas coal or wood Vehicular exhaust contributes to the majority of carbon monoxide let into the atmosphere It creates a smog type formation in the air that has been linked to many lung diseases and disruptions to the natural environment and animals br Chlorofluorocarbons CFCs Emitted from goods that are now prohibited from use harmful to the ozone layer These are gases emitted by air conditioners freezers aerosol sprays and other similar devices CFCs reach the stratosphere after being released into the atmosphere They interact with other gases here causing harm to the ozone layer UV rays are able to reach the Earth s surface as a result of this This can result in skin cancer eye problems and even plant damage br Nitrogen oxides NOx Nitrogen oxides particularly nitrogen dioxide are expelled from high temperature combustion and are also produced during thunderstorms by electric discharge They can be seen as a brown haze dome above or a plume downwind of cities Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula NO It is one of several nitrogen oxides One of the most prominent air pollutants this reddish brown toxic gas has a characteristic sharp biting odor br Odors Such as from garbage sewage and industrial processes br Particulate matter particles PM also known as particulates atmospheric particulate matter APM or fine particles are microscopic solid or liquid particles suspended in a gas Aerosol is a mixture of particles and gas Volcanoes dust storms forest and grassland fires living plants and sea spray are all sources of particles Aerosols are produced by human activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels in automobiles power plants and numerous industrial processes Averaged worldwide anthropogenic aerosols those made by human activities currently account for approximately of the atmosphere Increased levels of fine particles in the air are linked to health hazards such as heart disease altered lung function and lung cancer Particulates are related to respiratory infections and can be particularly harmful to those with conditions like asthma br Persistent organic pollutants which can attach to particulates Persistent organic pollutants are organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation due to chemical biological or photolytic processes POPs As a result they ve been discovered to survive in the environment be capable of long range transmission bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue biomagnify in food chains and pose a major threat to human health and the ecosystem br Persistent free radicals connected to airborne fine particles are linked to cardiopulmonary disease br Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons PAHs a group of aromatic compounds formed from the incomplete combustion of organic compounds including coal and oil and tobacco br Radioactive pollutants Produced by nuclear explosions nuclear events war explosives and natural processes such as the radioactive decay of radon br Sulfur oxides SOx particularly sulfur dioxide a chemical compound with the formula SO SO is produced by volcanoes and in various industrial processes Coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds and their combustion generates sulfur dioxide Further oxidation of SO usually in the presence of a catalyst such as NO forms H SO and thus acid rain is formed This is one of the causes for concern over the environmental impact of the use of these fuels as power sources br Toxic metals such as lead and mercury especially their compounds br Volatile organic compounds VOC VOCs are both indoor and outdoor air pollutants They are categorized as either methane CH or non methane NMVOCs Methane is an extremely efficient greenhouse gas which contributes to enhanced global warming Other hydrocarbon VOCs are also significant greenhouse gases because of their role in creating ozone and prolonging the life of methane in the atmosphere This effect varies depending on local air quality The aromatic NMVOCs benzene toluene and xylene are suspected carcinogens and may lead to leukemia with prolonged exposure butadiene is another dangerous compound often associated with industrial use br br br Secondary pollutants br Secondary pollutants include br br Ground level ozone O Ozone is created when NOx and VOCs mix It is a significant part of the troposphere It s also an important part of the ozone layer which can be found in different sections of the stratosphere Photochemical and chemical reactions involving it fuel many of the chemical activities that occur in the atmosphere during the day and night It is a pollutant and a component of smog that is produced in large quantities as a result of human activities mostly the combustion of fossil fuels br Peroxyacetyl nitrate C H NO similarly formed from NOx and VOCs br Photochemical smog particles are formed from gaseous primary contaminants and chemicals Smog is a type of pollution that occurs in the atmosphere Smog is caused by a huge volume of coal being burned in a certain region resulting in a mixture of smoke and sulfur dioxide Modern smog is usually caused by automotive and industrial emissions which are acted on in the atmosphere by UV light from the sun to produce secondary pollutants which then combine with the primary emissions to generate photochemical smog br br br Other pollutants br There are many other chemicals classed as hazardous air pollutants Some of these are regulated in the USA under the Clean Air Act and in Europe under numerous directives including the Air Framework Directive EC on ambient air quality assessment and management Directive EC on risks related to chemical agents at work and Directive EC covering heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in ambient air br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Exposure br The risk of air pollution is determined by the pollutant s hazard and the amount of exposure to that pollutant Air pollution exposure can be measured for a person a group such as a neighborhood or a country s children or an entire population For example one would want to determine a geographic area s exposure to a dangerous air pollution taking into account the various microenvironments and age groups This can be calculated as an inhalation exposure This would account for daily exposure in various settings e g different indoor micro environments and outdoor locations The exposure needs to include different ages and other demographic groups especially infants children pregnant women and other sensitive subpopulations br For each specific time that the subgroup is in the setting and engaged in particular activities the exposure to an air pollutant must integrate the concentrations of the air pollutant with regard to the time spent in each setting and the respective inhalation rates for each subgroup playing cooking reading working spending time in traffic etc A little child s inhaling rate for example will be lower than that of an adult A young person engaging in strenuous exercise will have a faster rate of breathing than a child engaged in sedentary activity The daily exposure must therefore include the amount of time spent in each micro environmental setting as well as the kind of activities performed there The air pollutant concentration in each microactivity microenvironmental setting is summed to indicate the exposure br For some pollutants such as black carbon traffic related exposures may dominate total exposure despite short exposure times since high concentrations coincide with proximity to major roads or participation in motorized traffic A large portion of total daily exposure occurs as short peaks of high concentrations but it remains unclear how to define peaks and determine their frequency and health impact br In the WHO halved its recommended guideline limit for tiny particles from burning fossil fuels The new limit for nitrogen dioxide NO is lower Growing evidence that air pollution even when experienced at very low levels hurts human health led the WHO to revise its guideline from g m to g m for what it considers a safe level of exposure of particulate pollution bringing most of the world percent of the global population into the unsafe zone br br br Indoor air quality br br A lack of ventilation indoors concentrates air pollution where people often spend the majority of their time Radon Rn gas a carcinogen is exuded from the Earth in certain locations and trapped inside houses Building materials including carpeting and plywood emit formaldehyde H CHO gas Paint and solvents give off volatile organic compounds VOCs as they dry Lead paint can degenerate into dust and be inhaled br Intentional air pollution is introduced with the use of air fresheners incense and other scented items Controlled wood fires in cook stoves and fireplaces can add significant amounts of harmful smoke particulates into the air inside and out Indoor pollution fatalities may be caused by using pesticides and other chemical sprays indoors without proper ventilation Also the kitchen in a modern produce harmful particles and gases with equipment like toasters being one of the worst sources br Carbon monoxide poisoning and fatalities are often caused by faulty vents and chimneys or by the burning of charcoal indoors or in a confined space such as a tent Chronic carbon monoxide poisoning can result even from poorly adjusted pilot lights Traps are built into all domestic plumbing to keep sewer gas and hydrogen sulfide out of interiors Clothing emits tetrachloroethylene or other dry cleaning fluids for days after dry cleaning br Though its use has now been banned in many countries the extensive use of asbestos in industrial and domestic environments in the past has left a potentially very dangerous material in many localities Asbestosis is a chronic inflammatory medical condition affecting the tissue of the lungs It occurs after long term heavy exposure to asbestos from asbestos containing materials in structures Those with asbestosis have severe dyspnea shortness of breath and are at an increased risk regarding several different types of lung cancer As clear explanations are not always stressed in non technical literature care should be taken to distinguish between several forms of relevant diseases According to the World Health Organization these may be defined as asbestosis lung cancer and peritoneal mesothelioma generally a very rare form of cancer when more widespread it is almost always associated with prolonged exposure to asbestos br Biological sources of air pollution are also found indoors as gases and airborne particulates Pets produce dander people produce dust from minute skin flakes and decomposed hair dust mites in bedding carpeting and furniture produce enzymes and micrometre sized fecal droppings inhabitants emit methane mold forms on walls and generates mycotoxins and spores air conditioning systems can incubate Legionnaires disease and mold and houseplants soil and surrounding gardens can produce pollen dust and mold Indoors the lack of air circulation allows these airborne pollutants to accumulate more than they would otherwise occur in nature br br br Health effects br Even at levels lower than those considered safe by United States regulators exposure to three components of air pollution fine particulate matter nitrogen dioxide and ozone correlates with cardiac and respiratory illness In pollution including air pollution was a contributing factor to one in eight deaths in Europe and was a significant risk factor for pollution related diseases including heart disease stroke and lung cancer The health effects caused by air pollution may include difficulty in breathing wheezing coughing asthma and worsening of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions These effects can result in increased medication use increased doctor or emergency department visits more hospital admissions and premature death br The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching but principally affect the body s respiratory system and the cardiovascular system Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to the degree of exposure and the individual s health status and genetics The most common sources of air pollution include particulates ozone nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide Children aged less than five years who live in developing countries are the most vulnerable population in terms of total deaths attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution Under the Clean Air Act U S EPA sets limits on certain air pollutants including setting limits on how much can be in the air anywhere in the United States New research demonstrates that the biological and health outcomes of mixed exposures Example PM Ozone could be significantly greater than individual exposures br Air pollution has both acute and chronic effects on human health affecting a number of different systems and organs It ranges from minor upper respiratory irritation to chronic respiratory and heart disease lung cancer acute respiratory infections in children and chronic bronchitis in adults aggravating pre existing heart and lung disease or asthmatic attacks Short and long term exposures have been linked with premature mortality and reduced life expectancy Diseases that develop from persistent exposure to air pollution are environmental health diseases which develop when a health environment is not maintained br br br Mortality br br The World Health Organization estimated in that every year air pollution causes the premature death of some million people worldwide Studies published in March indicated that the number may be around million A review concluded that air pollution was responsible for million premature deaths in It concluded that since little real progress against superordinate pollution which remained at million earlier deaths can be identified Causes of deaths include strokes heart disease COPD lung cancer and lung infections br Urban outdoor air pollution is estimated to cause million deaths worldwide per year Children are particularly at risk due to the immaturity of their respiratory organ systems In outdoor air pollution mostly by PM was estimated to lead to CI million premature deaths per year worldwide predominantly in Asia br In the WHO reported that outdoor air pollution was estimated to cause million premature deaths worldwide in br A study indicates that the global mean loss of life expectancy LLE similar to YPLL from air pollution in was years substantially more than for example years from all forms of direct violence albeit a significant fraction of the LLE is unavoidable Communities with the most exceptional aging have low ambient air pollution suggesting a link between air pollution levels and longevity br A study published in in GeoHealth concluded that eliminating energy related fossil fuel emissions in the United States would prevent premature deaths each year and provide billion in benefits from avoided PM related illness and death br A study published in in Science focused on sulfur dioxide emissions by coal power plants coal PM and concluded that exposure to coal PM was associated with times greater mortality risk than exposure to PM from all sources From to a total of deaths in the US were attributed to coal PM br br br By region br India and China have the highest death rate due to air pollution India also has more deaths from asthma than any other nation according to the World Health Organization In million deaths in India were caused by air pollution In December air pollution was estimated to kill people in China each year There is a positive correlation between pneumonia related deaths and air pollution from motor vehicle emissions br Annual premature European deaths caused by air pollution are estimated at to An important cause of these deaths is nitrogen dioxide and other nitrogen oxides NOx emitted by road vehicles In a consultation document the UK government disclosed that nitrogen dioxide is responsible for premature UK deaths per annum Across the European Union air pollution is estimated to reduce life expectancy by almost nine months br br br Guidelines br br The US EPA has estimated that limiting ground level ozone concentration to parts per billion ppb would avert to premature deaths nationwide in compared with the ppb standard The agency projected the more protective standard would also prevent an additional cases of aggravated asthma and more than a million cases of missed work or school Following this assessment the EPA acted to protect public health by lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standards NAAQS for ground level ozone to ppb br A economic study of the health impacts and associated costs of air pollution in the Los Angeles Basin and San Joaquin Valley of Southern California shows that more than people die prematurely approximately years earlier than normal each year because air pollution levels violate federal standards The number of annual premature deaths is considerably higher than the fatalities related to auto collisions in the same area which average fewer than per year A study found that outdoor air pollution is associated with substantially increased mortality even at low pollution levels below the current European and North American standards and WHO guideline values shortly before the WHO adjusted its guidelines br br br Major causes br br The largest cause is air pollution generated by fossil fuel combustion mostly the production and use of cars electricity production and heating A study by Greenpeace estimates there are million annual premature deaths worldwide because of pollutants released by high emission power stations and vehicle exhausts br Diesel exhaust DE is a major contributor to combustion derived particulate matter air pollution In several human experimental studies using a well validated exposure chamber setup DE has been linked to acute vascular dysfunction and increased thrombus formation br A study concluded that PM air pollution induced by the contemporary free trade and consumption by the G nations causes two million premature deaths annually suggesting that the average lifetime consumption of about people in these countries causes at least one premature death average age while developing countries cannot be expected to implement or be able to implement countermeasures without external support or internationally coordinated efforts br br br Primary mechanisms br The WHO estimates that in of outdoor air pollution related premature deaths were due to ischaemic heart disease and stroke The mechanisms linking air pollution to increased cardiovascular mortality are uncertain but probably include pulmonary and systemic inflammation br br br Contemporary annual deaths br A study by scientists of U K and U S universities that uses a high spatial resolution model and an updated concentration response function concluded that million global excess deaths in and million in or a fifth were due to air pollution generated by fossil fuel combustion significantly higher than earlier estimates and with spatially subdivided mortality impacts br According to the WHO air pollution accounts for in deaths worldwide br br br Cardiovascular disease br According to the Global Burden of Disease Study air pollution is responsible for percent of all cardiovascular deaths A review of over studies carried out between and found strong evidence linking both short and long term exposure to air pollution with cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity stroke blood pressure and ischemic heart diseases IHD br Air pollution is a leading risk factor for stroke particularly in developing countries where pollutant levels are highest A systematic analysis of different risk factors in countries found air pollution is associated with nearly one in three strokes percent worldwide percent of strokes in developing countries versus percent in developed countries A study found that in women air pollution is not associated with hemorrhagic but with ischemic stroke Air pollution was found to be associated with increased incidence and mortality from coronary stroke in a cohort study in Associations are believed to be causal and effects may be mediated by vasoconstriction low grade inflammation and atherosclerosis Other mechanisms such as autonomic nervous system imbalance have also been suggested br br br Lung disease br Research has demonstrated increased risk of developing asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD from increased exposure to traffic related air pollution Air pollution has been associated with increased hospitalization and mortality from asthma and COPD COPD includes diseases such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema The risk of lung disease from air pollution is greatest for the following groups of people infants and young children whose normal breathing is faster than that of older children and adults the elderly those who work outside or spend a lot of time outside and those who have heart or lung disease br A study conducted in in the wake of the Great Smog of compared London residents with residents of Gloucester Peterborough and Norwich three towns with low reported death rates from chronic bronchitis All subjects were male postal truck drivers aged to Compared to the subjects from the outlying towns the London subjects exhibited more severe respiratory symptoms including cough phlegm and dyspnea reduced lung function FEV and peak flow rate and increased sputum production and purulence The differences were more pronounced for subjects aged to The study controlled for age and smoking habits so concluded that air pollution was the most likely cause of the observed differences br More studies have shown that air pollution exposure from traffic reduces lung function development in children and lung function may be compromised by air pollution even at low concentrations br It is believed that much like cystic fibrosis by living in a more urban environment serious health hazards become more apparent Studies have shown that in urban areas people experience mucus hypersecretion lower levels of lung function and more self diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and emphysema br COPD comprises a spectrum of clinical disorders that include emphysema bronchiectasis and chronic bronchitis COPD risk factors are both genetic and environmental Elevated particle pollution contributes to the exacerbation of this disease and likely its pathogenesis br br br Cancer lung cancer br br Around lung cancer deaths were attributed globally in to exposure to fine particulate matter PM contained in air pollution br A review of evidence regarding whether ambient air pollution exposure is a risk factor for cancer in found solid data to conclude that long term exposure to PM fine particulates increases the overall risk of non accidental mortality by per a g m increase Exposure to PM was also associated with an increased risk of mortality from lung cancer range per g m increase and total cardiovascular mortality range per a g m increase br The review further noted that living close to busy traffic appears to be associated with elevated risks of these three outcomes increase in lung cancer deaths cardiovascular deaths and overall non accidental deaths The reviewers also found suggestive evidence that exposure to PM is positively associated with mortality from coronary heart diseases and exposure to SO increases mortality from lung cancer but the data was insufficient to provide solid conclusions Another investigation showed that higher activity level increases deposition fraction of aerosol particles in human lung and recommended avoiding heavy activities like running in outdoor space at polluted areas br In a large Danish epidemiological study found an increased risk of lung cancer for people who lived in areas with high nitrogen oxide concentrations In this study the association was higher for non smokers than smokers An additional Danish study also in likewise noted evidence of possible associations between air pollution and other forms of cancer including cervical cancer and brain cancer br A study presented in outlined the biological basis for how air pollution causes cancer br br br Kidney disease br In a study of Taiwanese residents over the period of estimated that every g m decrease in the ambient concentration of PM was associated with a reduced risk of chronic kidney disease development According to a chord study involving atherosclerosis patients higher PM exposure is associate with increased albuminuria br br br Fertility br br br NO br In women undergoing IVF treatment increases in NO both at the patient s address and by the IVF lab were significantly associated with a lower live birth rate br In the general population there is a significant increase in miscarriage rate in women exposed to NO compared to the non exposed group br br br CO br CO exposure is significantly associated with stillbirth in the second and third trimester br br br Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons br Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs have been associated with reduced fertility Benzo a pyrene BaP is a well known PAH and carcinogen which is often found in exhaust fumes and cigarette smoke PAHs have been reported to administer their toxic effects through oxidative stress by increasing the production of Reactive Oxygen Species ROS which can result in inflammation and cell death More long term exposure to PAHs can result in DNA damage and reduced repair br Exposure to BaP has been reported to reduce sperm motility and increasing the exposure worsens this effect Research has demonstrated that more BaPs were found in men with reported fertility issues compared to men without br Studies have shown that BaPs can affect folliculogenesis and ovarian development by reducing the number of ovarian germ cells via triggering cell death pathways and inducing inflammation which can lead to ovarian damage br br br Particulate matter br Particulate matter PM refers to the collection of solids and liquids suspended in the air These can be harmful to humans when exposed to in day to day life and more research has shown that these effects may be more extensive than first thought particularly on male fertility Within the spectrum of PM there are different weights such as PM which are tiny particles of microns in width or smaller compared with PM which are classified as microns in diameter or less br In a study based in California it was found that as exposure to PM increased sperm motility decreased and morphology became more abnormal Similarly in Poland exposure to PM and PM lead to an increase in the percentage of cells with immature chromatin DNA that has not fully developed or has developed abnormally br In Turkey a study looked at the fertility of men who work as toll collectors and are therefore exposed to high levels of traffic pollutants daily Traffic pollution often has high levels of PM alongside carbon monoxide and nitrous oxides In this study group there were significant differences in sperm count and motility when compared to a control group with limited air pollution exposure br In women whilst overall effects on fertility did not seem significant there was an association was found between increased exposure to PM and early miscarriage Exposure to smaller particulate matter PM was seen to have an effect on conception rates in women undergoing IVF but not with live birth rates br br br Ground level ozone pollution br Ground level ozone O when in high concentrations is regarded as an air pollutant and is often found in smog in industrial areas O is largely produced by chemical reactions involving NOx gases nitrous oxides especially from combustion and volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight br There is limited research about the effect that ozone pollution has on fertility At present there is no evidence to suggest that ozone exposure poses a deleterious effect on spontaneous fertility in either females or males However there have been studies which suggest that high levels of ozone pollution often a problem in the summer months exert an effect on in vitro fertilisation IVF outcomes Within an IVF population NOx and ozone pollutants were linked with reduced rates of live birth br While most research on this topic is focused on the direct human exposure of air pollution other studies have analysed the impact of air pollution on gametes and embryos within IVF laboratories Multiple studies have reported a marked improvement in embryo quality implantation and pregnancy rates after IVF laboratories have implemented air filters in a concerted effort to reduce levels of air pollution Therefore ozone pollution is considered to have a negative impact on the success of assisted reproductive technologies ART when occurring at high levels br Ozone is thought to act in a biphasic manner where a positive effect on live birth is observed when ozone exposure is limited to before IVF embryo implantation Conversely a negative effect is demonstrated upon exposure to ozone after embryo implantation br Retrospective and prospective studies evaluating the effect of several traffic pollutants of which ground level ozone is one highlighted a significant decrease in live birth rates and miscarriages br In terms of male fertility ozone is reported to cause a significant decrease in sperm concentration measured in semen after exposure Similarly sperm vitality the proportion of alive spermatozoa in a sample was demonstrated to be diminished in a handful of studies This demonstrates that ozone air pollution exhibits a significantly negative effect of air pollution on this parameter However findings on the effect of ozone exposure on male fertility are somewhat discordant highlighting the need for further research br br br Children br In the United States despite the passage of the Clean Air Act in in at least million Americans were living in non attainment areas regions in which the concentration of certain air pollutants exceeded federal standards These dangerous pollutants are known as the criteria pollutants and include ozone particulate matter sulfur dioxide nitrogen dioxide carbon monoxide and lead Protective measures to ensure children s health are being taken in cities such as New Delhi India where buses now use compressed natural gas to help eliminate the pea soup smog A study in Europe has found that exposure to ultrafine particles can increase blood pressure in children In a WHO report polluted air leads to the poisoning of millions of children under the age of resulting in the death of some six hundred thousand children annually br br br Prenatal exposure br Prenatal exposure to polluted air has been linked to a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders in children For example exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAH was associated with reduced IQ scores and symptoms of anxiety and depression They can also lead to detrimental perinatal health outcomes that are often fatal in developing countries A study found that PAHs might play a role in the development of childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ADHD br Researchers have begun to find evidence for air pollution as a risk factor for autism spectrum disorder ASD In Los Angeles children who were living in areas with high levels of traffic related air pollution were more likely to be diagnosed with autism between three five years of age The connection between air pollution and neurodevelopmental disorders in children is thought to be related to epigenetic dysregulation of the primordial germ cells embryo and fetus during a critical period Some PAHs are considered endocrine disruptors and are lipid soluble When they build up in adipose tissue they can be transferred across the placenta Air pollution has been associated with the prevalence of preterm births br br br Infants br Ambient levels of air pollution have been associated with preterm birth and low birth weight A WHO worldwide survey on maternal and perinatal health found a statistically significant association between low birth weights LBW and increased levels of exposure to PM Women in regions with greater than average PM levels had statistically significant higher odds of pregnancy resulting in a low birth weight infant even when adjusted for country related variables The effect is thought to be from stimulating inflammation and increasing oxidative stress br A study by the University of York found that in exposure to PM was strongly associated with of preterm births globally which was approximately million premature births The countries with the highest air pollution associated preterm births were in South and East Asia the Middle East North Africa and West sub Saharan Africa In ambient particulate matter pollution in Africa resulted in at least early deaths according to new estimates of the cost of air pollution in the continent This increased from in to around of all premature deaths in the area br The source of PM differs greatly by region In South and East Asia pregnant women are frequently exposed to indoor air pollution because of wood and other biomass fuels being used for cooking which are responsible for more than of regional pollution In the Middle East North Africa and West sub Saharan Africa fine PM comes from natural sources such as dust storms The United States had an estimated preterm births associated with exposure to PM in br A study between and found a correlation between sulfur dioxide SO and total suspended particulates TSP and preterm births and low birth weights in Beijing A group of pregnant women in four separate regions of Beijing were monitored from early pregnancy to delivery along with daily air pollution levels of sulfur Dioxide and TSP along with other particulates The estimated reduction in birth weight was g for every g m increase in SO and g for each g m increase in TSP These associations were statistically significant in both summer and winter although summer was greater The proportion of low birth weight attributable to air pollution was This is the largest attributable risk ever reported for the known risk factors of low birth weight Coal stoves which are in of homes are a major source of air pollution in this area br Brauer et al studied the relationship between air pollution and proximity to a highway with pregnancy outcomes in a Vancouver cohort of pregnant woman using addresses to estimate exposure during pregnancy Exposure to NO NO CO PM and PM were associated with infants born small for gestational age SGA Women living less than meters away from an expressway or highway were more likely to give birth to a SGA infant br br br Clean areas br br Even in areas with relatively low levels of air pollution public health effects can be significant and costly since a large number of people breathe in such pollutants A study published in found that even in areas of the U S where ozone and PM meet federal standards Medicare recipients who are exposed to more air pollution have higher mortality rates br A scientific study for the British Columbia Lung Association showed that a small improvement in air quality reduction of ambient PM and ozone concentrations would produce million in annual savings in the Metro Vancouver region in This finding is based on health valuation of lethal death and sub lethal illness affects A study published in found that rural population in India like those in urban areas are also exposed to high levels of air pollution br In scientists found that the boundary layer air over the Southern Ocean around Antarctica is unpolluted by humans br br br Central nervous system br br Data is accumulating that air pollution exposure also affects the central nervous system br Air pollution increases the risk of dementia in people over years old Childhood indoor air pollution may negatively affect cognitive function and neurodevelopment Prenatal exposure may also affect neurodevelopment Studies show that air pollution is associated with a variety of developmental disabilities oxidative stress and neuro inflammation and that it may contribute to Alzheimer s disease and Parkinson s disease br br Researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center found that early exposure to air pollution causes the same changes in the brain as autism and schizophrenia This study was published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives in June It also showed that air pollution also affected short term memory learning ability and impulsivity Lead researcher Deborah Cory Slechta said that When we looked closely at the ventricles we could see that the white matter that normally surrounds them hadn t fully developed It appears that inflammation had damaged those brain cells and prevented that region of the brain from developing and the ventricles simply expanded to fill the space Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that air pollution may play a role in autism as well as in other neurodevelopmental disorders br Exposure to fine particulate matter can increase levels of cytokines neurotransmitters produced in response to infection and inflammation that are also associated with depression and suicide Pollution has been associated with inflammation of the brain which may disrupt mood regulation According to a study of Washington DC s American University heightened PM levels are linked to more self reported depressive symptoms and increases in daily suicide rates br In a study of mice air pollution also has a larger negative impact on males than on females br In experimental studies reported the detection of significant episodic situational cognitive impairment from impurities in indoor air breathed by test subjects who were not informed about changes in the air quality Researchers at the Harvard University and SUNY Upstate Medical University and Syracuse University measured the cognitive performance of participants in three different controlled laboratory atmospheres that simulated those found in conventional and green buildings as well as green buildings with enhanced ventilation Performance was evaluated objectively using the widely used Strategic Management Simulation software simulation tool which is a well validated assessment test for executive decision making in an unconstrained situation allowing initiative and improvisation Significant deficits were observed in the performance scores achieved in increasing concentrations of either volatile organic compounds VOCs or carbon dioxide while keeping other factors constant The highest impurity levels reached are not uncommon in some classroom or office environments Higher PM and CO concentrations were shown to be associated with slower response times and reduced accuracy in tests br br br Agricultural effects br Various studies have estimated the impacts of air pollution on agriculture especially ozone A study showed that ozone pollution in California may reduce yields of certain perennial crops such as table grapes by as much as per year translating into economic damages of more than billion per year After air pollutants enter the agricultural environment they not only directly affect agricultural production and quality but also enter agricultural waters and soil The COVID induced lockdown served as a natural experiment to expose the close links between air quality and surface greenness In India the lockdown induced improvement in air quality enhanced surface greenness and photosynthetic activity with the positive response of vegetation to reduce air pollution was dominant in croplands On the other hand agriculture in its traditional form is one of the primary contributors to the emission of trace gases like atmospheric ammonia br br br Economic effects br Air pollution costs the world economy trillion per year as a result of productivity losses and degraded quality of life in a joint study by the World Bank and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME at the University of Washington These productivity losses are caused by deaths due to diseases caused by air pollution One out of ten deaths in was caused by diseases associated with air pollution and the problem is getting worse The problem is even more acute in the developing world Children under age in lower income countries are more than times as likely to die from exposure to air pollution as children in high income countries The report states that additional economic losses caused by air pollution including health costs and the adverse effect on agricultural and other productivity were not calculated in the report and thus the actual costs to the world economy are far higher than trillion A study published in found a strong and significant connection between air pollution and construction site accidents and that a ppb increase in NO levels increases the likelihood of an accident by as much as percent br br br Other effects br Artificial air pollution may be detectable on Earth from distant vantage points such as other planetary systems via atmospheric SETI including NO pollution levels and with telescopic technology close to today It may also be possible to detect extraterrestrial civilizations this way br br br Historical disasters br The world s worst short term civilian pollution crisis was the Bhopal Disaster in India Leaked industrial vapours from the Union Carbide factory belonging to Union Carbide Inc U S A later bought by Dow Chemical Company killed at least people and injured from to The United Kingdom suffered its worst air pollution event when the December Great Smog of formed over London In six days more than died and more recent estimates put the figure at nearer br An accidental leak of anthrax spores from a biological warfare laboratory in the former USSR in near Yekaterinburg formerly Sverdlovsk is believed to have caused at least deaths The worst single incident of air pollution to occur in the US occurred in Donora Pennsylvania in late October when people died and over were injured br br br Reduction and regulation br Global depletion of the surrounding air pollution will require valiant leadership a surplus of combined resources from the international community and extensive societal changes Pollution prevention seeks to prevent pollution such as air pollution and could include adjustments to industrial and business activities such as designing sustainable manufacturing processes and the products designs and related legal regulations as well as efforts towards renewable energy transitions br Efforts to reduce particulate matter in the air may result in better health br The Euro Ticket scheme in Germany which allowed people to buy a monthly pass allowing use on all local and regional transport trains trams and busses for euro for one month of unlimited travel saved million tons of CO emissions during its three month implementation from June to August br br br Pollution control br br Various pollution control technologies and strategies are available to reduce air pollution At its most basic level land use planning is likely to involve zoning and transport infrastructure planning In most developed countries land use planning is an important part of social policy ensuring that land is used efficiently for the benefit of the wider economy and population as well as to protect the environment Stringent environmental regulations effective control technologies and shift towards the renewable source of energy also helping countries like China and India to reduce their sulfur dioxide pollution br Titanium dioxide has been researched for its ability to reduce air pollution Ultraviolet light will release free electrons from material thereby creating free radicals which break up VOCs and NOx gases One form is superhydrophilic br Pollution eating nanoparticles placed near a busy road were shown to absorb toxic emission from around cars each day br br br Energy transition br Since a large share of air pollution is caused by combustion of fossil fuels such as coal and oil the reduction of these fuels can reduce air pollution drastically Most effective is the switch to clean power sources such as wind power solar power hydro power which do not cause air pollution Efforts to reduce pollution from mobile sources includes expanding regulation to new sources such as cruise and transport ships farm equipment and small gas powered equipment such as string trimmers chainsaws and snowmobiles increased fuel efficiency such as through the use of hybrid vehicles conversion to cleaner fuels and conversion to electric vehicles br A very effective means to reduce air pollution is the transition to renewable energy According to a study published in Energy and Environmental Science in the switch to renewable energy in the United States would eliminate about premature mortalities per year and about in if no biomass were used This would save about billion in health costs a year due to reduced air pollution in or about of the U S gross domestic product Air quality improvement is a near term benefit among the many societal benefits from climate change mitigation br br br Alternatives to pollution br br There are now practical alternatives to the principal causes of air pollution br br Strategic substitution of air pollution sources in transport with lower emission or during the lifecycle emission free forms of public transport and bicycle use and infrastructure as well as with remote work reductions of work relocations and localizations br Phase out of fossil fuel vehicles is a critical component of a shift to sustainable transport however similar infrastructure and design decisions like electric vehicles may be associated with similar pollution for production as well as mining and resource exploitation for large numbers of needed batteries as well as the energy for their recharging br Areas downwind over miles of major airports have more than double total particulate emissions in air than other areas even when factoring in areas with frequent ship calls and heavy freeway and city traffic like Los Angeles Aviation biofuel mixed in with jetfuel at a ratio can reduce jet derived cruise altitude particulate emissions by according to a NASA led study however this should imply ground level benefits to urban air pollution as well br Ship propulsion and idling can be switched to much cleaner fuels like natural gas Ideally a renewable source but not practical yet br Combustion of fossil fuels for space heating can be replaced by using ground source heat pumps and seasonal thermal energy storage br Electricity generated from the combustion of fossil fuels can be replaced by nuclear and renewable energy Heating and home stoves which contribute significantly to regional air pollution can be replaced with a much cleaner fossil fuel such as natural gas or preferably renewables in poor countries br Motor vehicles driven by fossil fuels a key factor in urban air pollution can be replaced by electric vehicles Though lithium supply and cost is a limitation there are alternatives Herding more people into clean public transit such as electric trains can also help Nevertheless even in emission free electric vehicles rubber tires produce significant amounts of air pollution themselves ranking as th worst pollutant in Los Angeles br Reducing travel in vehicles can curb pollution After Stockholm reduced vehicle traffic in the central city with a congestion tax nitrogen dioxide and PM pollution declined as did acute pediatric asthma attacks br Biodigesters can be utilized in poor nations where slash and burn is prevalent turning a useless commodity into a source of income The plants can be gathered and sold to a central authority that will break them down in a large modern biodigester producing much needed energy to use br Induced humidity and ventilation both can greatly dampen air pollution in enclosed spaces which was found to be relatively high inside subway lines due to braking and friction and relatively less ironically inside transit buses than lower sitting passenger automobiles or subways br br br Control devices br br The following items are commonly used as pollution control devices in industry and transportation They can either destroy contaminants or remove them from an exhaust stream before it is emitted into the atmosphere br br br Monitoring br br Spatiotemporal monitoring of air quality may be necessary for improving air quality and thereby the health and safety of the public and assessing impacts of interventions Such monitoring is done to different extents with different regulatory requirements with discrepant regional coverage by a variety of organizations and governance entities such as using a variety of technologies for use of the data and sensing such mobile IoT sensors satellites and monitoring stations Some websites attempt to map air pollution levels using available data br br br Air quality modeling br br Numerical models either on a global scale using tools such as GCMs general circulation models coupled with a pollution module or CTMs Chemical transport model can be used to simulate the levels of different pollutants in the atmosphere These tools can have several types Atmospheric model and different uses These models can be used in forecast mode which can help policy makers to decide on appropriate actions when an air pollution episode is detected They can also be used for climate modeling including evolution of air quality in the future for example the IPCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change provides climate simulations including air quality assessments in their reports latest report accessible through their site br br br Regulations br br In general there are two types of air quality standards The first class of standards such as the U S National Ambient Air Quality Standards and E U Air Quality Directive set maximum atmospheric concentrations for specific pollutants Environmental agencies enact regulations which are intended to result in attainment of these target levels The second class such as the North American air quality index take the form of a scale with various thresholds which is used to communicate to the public the relative risk of outdoor activity The scale may or may not distinguish between different pollutants br br br Canada br In Canada air pollution and associated health risks are measured with the Air Quality Health Index AQHI It is a health protection tool used to make decisions to reduce short term exposure to air pollution by adjusting activity levels during increased levels of air pollution br The AQHI is a federal program jointly coordinated by Health Canada and Environment Canada However the AQHI program would not be possible without the commitment and support of the provinces municipalities and NGOs From air quality monitoring to health risk communication and community engagement local partners are responsible for the vast majority of work related to AQHI implementation The AQHI provides a number from to to indicate the level of health risk associated with local air quality Occasionally when the amount of air pollution is abnormally high the number may exceed The AQHI provides a local air quality current value as well as a local air quality maximums forecast for today tonight and tomorrow and provides associated health advice br br As it is now known that even low levels of air pollution can trigger discomfort for the sensitive population the index has been developed as a continuum The higher the number the greater the health risk and need to take precautions The index describes the level of health risk associated with this number as low moderate high or very high and suggests steps that can be taken to reduce exposure br br The measurement is based on the observed relationship of nitrogen dioxide NO ground level ozone O and particulates PM with mortality from an analysis of several Canadian cities Significantly all three of these pollutants can pose health risks even at low levels of exposure especially among those with pre existing health problems br When developing the AQHI Health Canada s original analysis of health effects included five major air pollutants particulates ozone and nitrogen dioxide NO as well as sulfur dioxide SO and carbon monoxide CO The latter two pollutants provided little information in predicting health effects and were removed from the AQHI formulation br The AQHI does not measure the effects of odour pollen dust heat or humidity br br br Germany br TA Luft is the German air quality regulation br br br Governing urban air pollution br br In Europe Council Directive EC on ambient air quality assessment and management provides a common strategy against which member states can set objectives for ambient air quality in order to avoid prevent or reduce harmful effects on human health and the environment and improve air quality where it is unsatisfactory br In July in the case Dieter Janecek v Freistaat Bayern the European Court of Justice ruled that under this directive citizens have the right to require national authorities to implement a short term action plan that aims to maintain or achieve compliance to air quality limit values br This important case law appears to confirm the role of the EC as centralised regulator to European nation states as regards air pollution control It places a supranational legal obligation on the UK to protect its citizens from dangerous levels of air pollution furthermore superseding national interests with those of the citizen br In the European Commission EC threatened the UK with legal action against the successive breaching of PM limit values The UK government has identified that if fines are imposed they could cost the nation upwards of million per year br In March the Greater London Built up Area remained the only UK region in breach of the EC s limit values and was given three months to implement an emergency action plan aimed at meeting the EU Air Quality Directive The City of London has dangerous levels of PM concentrations estimated to cause deaths per year within the city As well as the threat of EU fines in it was threatened with legal action for scrapping the western congestion charge zone which is claimed to have led to an increase in air pollution levels br In response to these charges mayor of London Boris Johnson has criticised the current need for European cities to communicate with Europe through their nation state s central government arguing that in future A great city like London should be permitted to bypass its government and deal directly with the European Commission regarding its air quality action plan br This can be interpreted as recognition that cities can transcend the traditional national government organisational hierarchy and develop solutions to air pollution using global governance networks for example through transnational relations Transnational relations include but are not exclusive to national governments and intergovernmental organisations allowing sub national actors including cities and regions to partake in air pollution control as independent actors br Global city partnerships can be built into networks for example the C Cities Climate Leadership Group of which London is a member The C is a public non state network of the world s leading cities that aims to curb their greenhouse emissions The C has been identified as governance from the middle and is an alternative to intergovernmental policy It has the potential to improve urban air quality as participating cities exchange information learn from best practices and consequently mitigate carbon dioxide emissions independently from national government decisions A criticism of the C network is that its exclusive nature limits influence to participating cities and risks drawing resources away from less powerful city and regional actors br br br Indigenous people br Because Indigenous people frequently experience a disproportionate share of the effects of environmental degradation and climate change even while they have made very little contribution to the processes causing these changes environmental justice is especially important to them Indigenous peoples have been marginalized and their lands and resources have been exploited as a result of historical and continuing colonization institutional injustices and inequality br Indigenous groups frequently lack the political and financial clout to influence policy decisions that impact their lands and means of subsistence or to lessen the effects of climate change This makes the already existing inequalities in these communities social economic and health conditions worse Furthermore traditional ecological knowledge and Indigenous knowledge systems provide insightful information about sustainable resource management and climate change adaptation techniques To promote persistence and environmental justice Indigenous viewpoints must be acknowledged and integrated into efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change and adapt to them br Combating climate change necessitates an all encompassing strategy that recognizes the interdependence of social economic and environmental elements This entails defending treaty rights advancing Indigenous sovereignty and self determination and aiding Indigenous led projects for sustainable development and environmental preservation br br br Hotspots br br Air pollution hotspots are areas where air pollution emissions expose individuals to increased negative health effects They are particularly common in highly populated urban areas where there may be a combination of stationary sources e g industrial facilities and mobile sources e g cars and trucks of pollution Emissions from these sources can cause respiratory disease childhood asthma cancer and other health problems Fine particulate matter such as diesel soot which contributes to more than million premature deaths around the world each year is a significant problem It is very small and can lodge itself within the lungs and enter the bloodstream Diesel soot is concentrated in densely populated areas and one in six people in the U S live near a diesel pollution hot spot br br While air pollution hotspots affect a variety of populations some groups are more likely to be located in hotspots Previous studies have shown disparities in exposure to pollution by race and or income Hazardous land uses toxic storage and disposal facilities manufacturing facilities major roadways tend to be located where property values and income levels are low Low socioeconomic status can be a proxy for other kinds of social vulnerability including race a lack of ability to influence regulation and a lack of ability to move to neighborhoods with less environmental pollution These communities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution and are more likely to face health risks such as cancer or asthma br Studies show that patterns in race and income disparities not only indicate a higher exposure to pollution but also higher risk of adverse health outcomes Communities characterized by low socioeconomic status and racial minorities can be more vulnerable to cumulative adverse health impacts resulting from elevated exposure to pollutants than more privileged communities Blacks and Latinos generally face more pollution than Whites and Asians and low income communities bear a higher burden of risk than affluent ones Racial discrepancies are particularly distinct in suburban areas of the Southern United States and metropolitan areas of the Midwestern and Western United States Residents in public housing who are generally low income and cannot move to healthier neighborhoods are highly affected by nearby refineries and chemical plants br br br Cities br br Air pollution is usually concentrated in densely populated metropolitan areas especially in developing countries where cities are experiencing rapid growth and environmental regulations are relatively lax or nonexistent Urbanization leads to a rapid rise in premature mortality due to anthropogenic air pollution in fast growing tropical cities However even populated areas in developed countries attain unhealthy levels of pollution with Los Angeles and Rome being two examples Between and the incidence of lung cancer in Beijing near doubled While smoking remains the leading cause of lung cancer in China the number of smokers is falling while lung cancer rates are rising br br Tehran was declared the most polluted city in the world on May br br br Projections br In a projection by half of the world s pollution emissions could be generated by Africa Potential contributors to such an outcome include increased burning activities such as the burning of open waste traffic agri food and chemical industries sand dust from the Sahara and overall population growth br In a study by outdoor air pollution particulate matter and ground level ozone is projected to become the top cause of environmentally related deaths worldwide br br br See also br
