Alpina Burkard Bovensiepen GmbH Co KG is an automobile manufacturing company based in Buchloe in the Ostallg u district of Bavaria Germany that develops and sells high performance versions of BMW cars Alpina works closely with BMW and their processes are integrated into BMW s production lines and is recognized by the German Ministry of Transport as an automobile manufacturer in contrast to other performance specialists which are aftermarket tuners The Alpina B is produced at the same assembly line in Dingolfing Germany BMW Plant Dingolfing as BMW s own Series The B s twin turbo litre V is assembled by hand at Alpina s facility in Buchloe Germany before being shipped to BMW for installation and the assembled vehicle is then sent back to Alpina for finishing touches br The firm was founded in by Burkard Bovensiepen a member of the Bovensiepen family of industrialists On March BMW announced its intention to acquire Alpina That same day BMW wrote on its website that it had officially acquired the brand br br br History br br Alpina s roots can be traced back to when Burkard Bovensiepen developed a Weber dual carburetor for the BMW This carburetor was well received by the automotive press as well as BMW s own sales boss Paul G Hahnemann In BMW certified the quality of this Alpina product by awarding BMW vehicles fitted with the Alpina system the full factory guarantee br Alpina Burkard Bovensiepen KG was established on January in Kaufbeuren Bavaria The company had eight employees Although Alpina started by producing typewriters the original Alpina ceased to exist at the end of the s in their attempt to move into the textile industry In Burkard established a BMW tuning business following his success with investments in the stock market He started the tuning business in an outbuilding of the original Alpina typewriter factory The company worked on carburetors and revised cylinder heads By with seventy employees the original facility changed locations from Kaufbeuren to Buchloe br In its first years Alpina established its core competency by tuning carburetors and crankshafts to extract more power from BMW engines elements that eventually defined the company s logo which came into being in Between and Alpina cars did very well in competition The highlight was in when the team s cars won the European Touring Car Championship the German Hillclimb Championship rally and track racing championships and the prestigious Spa Hours br Alpina officially withdrew from racing in because of capacity limitations and restrictions Tied to this was the decision to begin production of a new set of BMW Alpina automobiles br br br Brand distinctions br Since Alpina has been recognized by the German Federal Ministry of Transport as an automobile manufacturer thus Alpina built cars are branded and registered as Alpina instead of BMW although an Alpina can be serviced at all BMW dealerships and is fully covered if a warranty issue arises Alpina automobiles are also sold at some BMW dealerships br Distinctive features of Alpina vehicles are the fact that these models are literally manu factured meaning hand made The production process switches between fine tuning the engine delivering it to the BMW plant marrying engine and body there and bringing it back to Alpina for interior upgrade with Alpina s specific components again all in a hand made process that allows only limited production numbers Besides engine and interior Alpina also optimizes the transmission and installs steering wheel mounted button shifters called Switch Tronic on most cars with paddle shifters used on the B S Edition This has historic reasons since Alpina was the first to mount shifting buttons on the steering wheel br Distinguishing marks from the exterior are the spoke alloy wheels with hidden valves under the center cap and the Alpina Blue or Alpina Green metallic exterior colours Inside the finest materials are used to fabricate the exclusive feel A typical blue and green pattern is often used on interior parts such as stitching on leather A thin pinstriped style outside body decor set in gold or silver is also a hallmark of older Alpina cars which is an option on new Alpina models Another distinguishing mark is the Alpina wordmark at the bottom of the car s front a design heralded from its racing cars A metal plate inside also proves the heritage and the serial number of the car br Compared to cars from BMW s in house performance subsidiary BMW M Alpina s vehicles have more emphasis on Touring higher torque and have their own Alpina style shiftable ZF automatic transmissions instead of manual or semi automatic transmissions For instance regarding the high performance variants of the BMW E Series the B offers a different take on performance and how to accomplish it Unlike BMW M s own M which has a naturally aspirated high revving L V the Alpina B uses a supercharged L V which produces similar horsepower and greater torque at lower rpm br br br Current lineup br br Alpina D Bi Turbo Saloon Touring based on the BMW F F Series featuring a litre straight six bi turbocharged diesel engine delivering PS kW

equipped identically to a normal M li However an exclusive Alpina Green finish is available br BMW permitted Alpina to produce a high performance version of its flagship Series however they did not want it to be a high revving BMW M version which would have been known as a BMW M under the current nomenclature It has also been suggested that there was no market for an M that would have featured the BMW M s trademark high rev engine and twin clutch automated manual transmission and most customers who desired a performance option in the Series would have gone for the V engined BMW Li br Competitors include the Mercedes Benz S AMG and Audi S br br Alpina B xDrive br br The Alpina B xDrive was announced by BMW North America on February with sales starting in September With an electronically limited top speed of km h mph and a km h mph acceleration time of seconds along with a sportier setup it is the sportiest Series but is sold by BMW only in the United States and Canada

popular early models providing superior performance over the unmodified car The C made kW hp and N m lb ft of torque km h mph is achieved in seconds Top speed was km h mph The extra power is due to special Mahle pistons and a special exhaust and ignition system It also received dry sump lubrication and a short ratio five speed gearbox Only C cars were built making it one of the rarest Alpina models As BMW released the i Alpina responded with the C and later the models providing between hp kW The brakes and suspension were also upgraded br The C and early C models used the M B L engine but bore and stroke were increased to achieve a displacement of cm Alpina reworked the head which was ported and polished installed harder valve springs and a hotter cam The intake manifold was also reworked and Alpina used a larger throttle body It produced kW hp with N m lb ft of torque Alpina claimed km h mph acceleration in seconds Top speed was km h mph Production is unclear with estimates ranging from cars built to around depending on the source br br br Alpina C br br An interesting variant of the M engine was Alpina s C The first C combined the wider bore of the M B with the slightly larger mm in crankshaft of an M B to create a torquier engine of cc This version put out PS kW hp and N m lb ft units were built between and November After the C appeared in the spring of the was slightly upgraded and gained horsepower However to indicate its little brother position in the lineup the name was changed to C When the September facelift model of the E was introduced the litre C was discontinued although a few cars were finished into br br The larger yet litre unit was introduced in February in uncatalyzed C form This engine sharing the dimensions of the M B develops PS kW hp at rpm and shows what the engine was really capable of Originally installed in the E based Alpina C with available four wheel drive the catalyzed C appeared in the interim C Kat in March This was then renamed B five months later by which time the C labelled cars were discontinued The B continued to be available until June in all body variants and drivetrain configurations excepting automatics in which the E was offered Around B labelled C engined E s were built for export to Japan where the larger L B had a hard time passing emissions regulations Aside from the C drivetrain the B is cosmetically identical to the B br Later C models C were based on the i Alpina used the M B engine with very few modifications compared to earlier models Again the cylinder head was decked to increase compression ratio and it was ported and polished The ECU was also remapped Max power is kW hp with N m lb ft of torque km h mph was achieved in seconds Top speed is km h mph Only cars were built br The C used the e eta model engine block crank and rods but with custom flat head pistons provided by Mahle Originally Alpina modified the casting number cylinder head specific to the e with bigger intake valves larger air intake ports and redesigned the valve chamber for better flow A more aggressive camshaft was used with higher lift and duration and harder valve springs were installed Compression ratio was increased to The C made bhp kW with N m lb ft of torque and was the fastest E available at the time km h mph top speed cars were built br Later C and early B used the M B block with ETA e crank and rods The intake manifold was also redesigned for better flow The head was decked to improve compression ratio for models with the head for later head models with catalytic converter and matched with custom pistons flat Mahle pistons for engines equipped with the head and domed KS pistons for engines equipped with the head Larger throttle bodies were installed the C version uses the same throttle body as the M B i A total of cars were built between and The C makes bhp kW and N m lb ft of torque Top speed is km h mph and km h mph is achieved in seconds br The B is similar to late C cars It uses the M B block with M B crank and custom rods The head is exclusively used for the B model The head is decked mm to improve CR to and matched with custom domed KS or Mahle pistons Intake and cylinder head are ported and polished Custom ECU mapping is used Engine management is Bosch Motronic The B is equipped with a catalytic converter to conform to emission

engine from the Alpina C as the larger L engine was unable to pass emissions br The Alpina B S uses the M chassis The S like the uses the B M big six which makes bhp kW and N m lb ft of torque Displacement is cm km h mph is achieved in seconds Top speed is km h mph The gearbox used is the Getrag sport known as a dog leg gearbox Only cars were made from to br The E BMW i was developed by Alpina for BMW South Africa It was based on the i chassis and M B engine with numerous Alpina components common to the B Customers had to choose between power steering or air conditioning because of limited space in the engine bay br br br Alpina B GT br br To celebrate Alpina s victory in the ADAC GT Masters with an Alpina B GT Alpina decided to produce a limited run of the Alpina B S Bi Turbo called the Alpina B GT The B GT features a new exhaust system developed in collaboration with Akrapovi which is kg lb lighter than the standard exhaust and increases power to kW PS bhp and lb ft N m of torque It features upgraded brakes with mm discs a Drexler limited slip differential and fully adjustable coilovers by KW at all four corners br br The most noticeable changes were on the exterior The B GT sports a carbon fibre rear wing a special front splitter and lightweight Alpina GT Classic wheels painted in Himalaya Grey The B GT was available in Black Sapphire metallic Mineral White

as many as the B br br br E B br br The B was built as a sedan and touring based on the BMW E from January to May br In February Alpina introduced the Alpina D Biturbo the first six cylinder diesel model produced by Alpina The engine a litre twin turbocharged unit with kW PS and N m lb ft of torque was based on the engine of the BMW d It was at the time the most powerful diesel saloon in the world High pressure common rail injection technology the famous Bosch CP high pressure pump has revolutionized the diesel industry br br br Engines br The third generation of the B was built with both six cylinder and V engines br The six cylinder engines with and liters displacement were based on the i and the i For the liter engine the engine block was bored to increase displacement to cubic centimeters The cylinder head was machined and a modified crankshaft was added different pistons and camshafts were also used A modified intake system enabled a higher rate of air flow as well as a stainless steel exhaust system Alpina Bosal with metal catalytic converters The engine control unit was also completely revised which increased the power to kW PS hp br The two V engines with B V and liters B V S come from the BMW i Again a larger displacement was achieved by boring the engine block which together with other modifications increased the power to kW PS then to kW PS for the liter engine br and kW PS through an increased stroke with the liter engine br br br Suspension br The original suspension from the BMW E has been reworked for the B Changes include modified springs and tuned shock absorbers from Sachs that help lower the car br br br Technical data br br br E B br br The BMW E and the liter BMW N engine from the i serve as the basis for the Alpina B which uses the same H supercharged engine as the E B Compared to the E the B has larger brakes a new suspension with Electronic Damper Control a stainless steel silencing system with polished double tailpipes and the typical Alpina changes to the interior and exterior br The B was made from February to September and the B S was made from September to May br br br Drivetrain br The N B s output is increased by means of a centrifugal supercharger The supercharger is made by the company ASA and is also called Turbessor because it is able to combine the advantages of turbocharger and supercharger At low speeds it spontaneously responds as a conventional displacement compressor but it can also immediately provide the thrust of a turbo It also reaches speeds of more than revolutions per minute As compared to the i performance has increased from kW PS hp to kW PS hp torque was increased from N m ft lbf to N m ft lbf The power is transmitted to the rear wheels by means of a six speed automatic transmission HP As usual with Alpina this was refined and has Switch Tronic br br br Technical data br br br Note br In an Alpina B Touring was tested by Auto Motor und Sport on the Nard Ring The B reached a top speed of km h mph br br br Alpina B S br At the Frankfurt Motor Show IIA Alpina presented the revised B S br br br Engine br The motor s combustion process was optimized by changing the camshaft This resulted in a significantly lower exhaust gas temperature which is the basis for the performance increase The power of the liter V was thus increased by kW PS hp to kW PS hp The torque increased by N m ft lbf to N m ft lbf The B S takes the sprint to km h mph in seconds The top speed increases to km h mph br br br Transmission br One innovation is the ZF six speed Sport Switch Tronic transmission

has a litre V br br br E B br br For the E Series generation the Alpina B was widely credited with being able to hold its own against top performing offerings from Mercedes including AMG such as the S and S AMG Audi particularly quattro s Audi S the Bentley Flying Spur and Jaguar XJ Supercharged while BMW s own top of the line V Li was considered uncompetitive br The E B uses a supercharged version of the litre V found in the BMW i as the i and its litre engine were not around when development began The Li s naturally aspirated litre V was deemed too heavy to have a sporty offshoot The Alpina B with its twin turbo litre V engine and speed automatic transmission is less expensive and yet faster than its F stablemate the BMW Li powered by a twin turbo litre V mated to an speed automatic transmission The B s engine derived from the BMW N that is found in the standard BMW lineup matches the BMW i in fuel economy despite increased performance plus its lighter weight than the Li s V engine gives the B considerably better weight distribution and handling than the Li br BMW of North America LLC offered Alpina B s as limited edition models for and all of which quickly sold out br br br F F B br br The F B will be offered again for the model year in the US with approximately vehicles half of the annual production of the B with a choice of rear wheel drive or all wheel drive and or a standard or long wheelbase the B B L long wheelbase B xDrive all wheel drive and B L xDrive otherwise all configurations have the same equipment Roughly models will be sold in Canada all of the xDrive variety due to that country s winter weather br The B s twin turbo litre V is assembled by hand at Alpina s facility in Buchloe Germany before being shipped to BMW for installation and the assembled vehicle is then sent back to Alpina for finishing touches It is based upon BMW s twin turbo V but produces considerable more torque and horsepower albeit with some turbo lag due to the larger turbos yet more measured throttle mapping makes the B smoother than a stock BMW i br While BMW uses run flat tires for its Series the B comes with non reinforced tires with a tire repair kit for emergencies By using conventional softer sidewalled tires compared to the reinforced sidewalls of run flats Alpina engineers were able to stiffen the B s suspension for better handling and still improve the ride quality over that of a stock BMW i br For the model year the Alpina B received similar updates to the rest of the Series lineup including an speed automatic transmission while its engine adds Valvetronic and now produces hp kW PS and lb ft N m which is good for a km h mph time of seconds and a top speed of km h mph Compared to BMW M s version of the L twin turbo engine such as found in the F M Alpina s engine has hp kW PS less but more maximum torque which is also available at a lower rpm br In a comparison of the BMW series and the Alpina B Motor Trend stated the B handled better than the BMW iL but not as well as the iL br br br G B br br The all new B based on the G G BMW Series and features a L V producing hp kW PS and lb ft N m of torque The B can accelerate from

Alpina leather upholstery and or BMW Individual trims and upholstery br br br Technical data br br br Alpina Roadster V br br With production of the BMW Z completed by November for the Z production was replaced by the Alpina Roadster V The Alpina was a departure from the hard edged sporting focus of the original car and elements of the new grand touring intent were evident throughout this final edition br Instead of the original six speed manual and L S engine featured in Z s the Alpina came only as an automatic using a five speed BMW Steptronic transmission mated to a L Alpina tuned V motor from the Alpina E B V S Alpina F In order to complete the car s transition from sports car to Alpina relaxed suspension tuning was used The standard Z s run flat tires on in cm wheels were discarded in favor of conventional tires with softer sidewalls on in cm wheels br A new softer grade of Nappa leather replaced the Z s less supple specification and special Alpina gauges were featured on the dash cluster An Alpina steering wheel with three solid spokes replaced the original which could not be retrofitted with shift paddles for the automatic Gear selection was displayed in an Alpina specific display mounted in front of the wheel br Performance of the Alpina V differed from that of the standard car in that peak power was reduced to PS kW while peak torque was raised to N m lb ft this torque was available at significantly lower rpm than the original in order to enable more relaxed cruising Curiously the electronically limited top speed was officially raised to km h mph rather than the km h mph that most cars are limited to br Only of these Alpinas were built of which were exported to the U S market and only eight to the UK In the United States this special edition of the Z
