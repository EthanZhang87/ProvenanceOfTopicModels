Corning Incorporated is an American multinational technology company that specializes in specialty glass ceramics and related materials and technologies including advanced optics primarily for industrial and scientific applications The company was named Corning Glass Works until Corning divested its consumer product lines including CorningWare and Visions Pyroceram based cookware Corelle Vitrelle tableware and Pyrex glass bakeware in by selling the Corning Consumer Products Company subsidiary later Corelle Brands now known as Instant Brands to Borden br As of Corning had five major business sectors display technologies environmental technologies life sciences optical communications and specialty materials Corning is involved in two joint ventures Dow Corning and Pittsburgh Corning Quest Diagnostics and Covance were spun off from Corning in Corning is one of the main suppliers to Apple Inc Since working with Steve Jobs in to develop the iPhone Corning develops and manufactures Gorilla Glass which is used by many smartphone makers It is one of the world s biggest glassmakers Corning won the National Medal of Technology and Innovation four times for its product and process innovations br br br History br br Corning Glass Works was founded in by Amory Houghton in Somerville Massachusetts originally as the Bay State Glass Co It later moved to Williamsburg Brooklyn and operated as the Brooklyn Flint Glass Works The company moved again to its ultimate home and eponym the city of Corning New York in under leadership of the founder s son Amory Houghton Jr br Corning continues to maintain its world headquarters at Corning N Y The firm also established one of the first industrial research labs there in It continues to expand the nearby research and development facility as well as operations associated with catalytic converters and diesel engine filter product lines Corning has a long history of community development and has assured community leaders that it intends to remain headquartered in its small upstate New York hometown br The California Institute of Technology s inch m telescope mirror at Palomar Observatory was cast by Corning during out of low expansion borosilicate glass In George Ellery Hale approached Corning with the challenge of fabricating the required optic for his Palomar project A previous effort to fabricate the optic from fused quartz had failed Corning s first attempt was a failure the cast blank having voids Using lessons learned Corning was successful in the casting of the second blank After a year of cooling during which it was almost lost to a flood in the blank was completed The first blank now resides in Corning s Museum of Glass br In Corning formed a partnership with bottle maker Owens Illinois which formed the company known today as Owens Corning Owens Corning was spun off as a separate company in br br The company had a history of science based innovations following World War II and the strategy by management was research and disruptive and on demand product innovation br In Corning developed Chemcor a new toughened automobile windshield designed to be thinner and lighter than existing windshields which reduced danger of personal injury by shattering into small granules when smashed This toughened glass had a chemically hardened outer layer and its manufacture incorporated an ion exchange and a fusion process in special furnaces that Corning built in its Christiansburg Virginia facility Corning developed it as an alternative to laminated windshields with the intention of becoming an automotive industry supplier After being installed as side glass in a limited run of Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Darts Chemcor windshields debuted on the model year Javelins and AMXs built by American Motors Corporation AMC As there were no mandatory safety standards for motor vehicle windshields the larger automakers had no financial incentive to change from the cheaper existing products Corning terminated its windshield project in after it turned out to be one of the company s biggest and most expensive failures However like many Corning innovations the unique process to manufacture this automotive glass was resurrected and is today the basis of their very profitable LCD glass business br In the fall of the company announced that researchers Robert D Maurer Donald Keck Peter C Schultz and Frank Zimar had demonstrated an optical fiber with a low optical attenuation of dB per kilometer by doping silica glass with titanium A few years later they produced a fiber with only dB km using germanium oxide as the core dopant Such low attenuations made fiber optics practical for telecommunications and networking Corning became the world s leading manufacturer of optical fiber br In considerable attention was given to Corning s Z Glass project Z Glass was a product used in television picture tubes Due to a number of factors the exact nature of which are subject to dispute this project was considered a steep loss in profit and productivity The following year the project made a partial recovery This incident has been cited as a case study by the Harvard School of Business br Company profits soared in the late s during the dot com boom and Corning expanded its fiber operations significantly through the acquisition of telecommunications company Oak Industries and building several new plants The company also entered the photonics market investing heavily with the intent of becoming the leading provider of complete fiber optic systems Failure to succeed in photonics and the collapse in of the dot com market had a major impact on the company and Corning stock plummeted to per share However as of the company had posted five straight years of improving financial performance br br br Technologies br The turning point for Corning came when Apple approached it to develop a robust display screen for its upcoming iPhone Later other companies also adopted its Gorilla Glass screen In Corning announced the expansion of existing facilities and the construction of a Gen facility co located with the Sharp Corporation manufacturing complex in Sakai Osaka Japan The LCD glass substrate is produced without heavy metals Corning is a leading manufacturer of the glass used in liquid crystal displays br The company continues to produce optical fiber and cable for the communications industry at its Wilmington and Concord plants in North Carolina It is also a major manufacturer of ceramic emission control devices for catalytic converters in cars and light trucks that use gasoline engines The company is also investing in the production of ceramic emission control products for diesel engines as a result of tighter emission standards for those engines both in the U S and abroad br In Corning introduced an optic fiber ClearCurve which uses nanostructure technology to facilitate the small radius bending found in FTTX installations br br Gorilla Glass an outgrowth of the s Chemcor project is a high strength alkali aluminosilicate thin sheet glass used as a protective cover glass offering scratch resistance and durability in many touchscreens According to the book Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson Gorilla Glass was used in the first iPhone released in br On October Corning unveiled Lotus Glass an environmentally friendly and high performance glass developed for OLED and LCD displays br Corning invests about of revenue in research and development and has allocated US million towards further expansion of its Sullivan Park research facility near headquarters in Corning New York br Corning Incorporated manufactures a high purity fused silica employed in microlithography systems a low expansion glass utilized in the construction of reflective mirror blanks windows for U S Space Shuttles and Steuben art glass The number of Corning facilities employing the traditional tanks of molten glass has declined over the years but it maintains the capacity to supply bulk or finished glass of many types br Corning is engaged in research and development on green lasers mercury abatement microreactors photovoltaics and silicon on glass Through its Life Sciences division the company offers products to support life science research including stem cell culture products br In September Apple announced that it would invest million in Corning in an effort to develop and manufacture the glass needed for many of its products including the iPhone Apple Watch and iPad Though not confirmed by either company the investment could be used to develop new products in the future Apple had already invested million in Corning in br br br Other activities br Corning employs roughly people worldwide and had sales of billion in The company has been listed for many years among Fortune magazine s largest companies and was ranked in br Although the company has long been publicly owned James R Houghton great great grandson of the founder served as chairman of the board of directors from to Over the years Houghton family ownership has declined to about Wendell P Weeks has been with the company since and as of March was chairman chief executive officer and president br Over its year history Corning invented a process for rapid and inexpensive production of light bulbs including developing the glass for Thomas Edison s light bulb Corning was the glass supplier for lightbulbs for General Electric after Edison General Electric merged with Thomson Houston Electric Company in It was an early major manufacturer of glass panels and funnels for television tubes invented and produced Vycor high temperature glass with high thermal shock resistance Corning invented and produced Pyrex
