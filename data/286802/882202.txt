Dingolfing plant It differs from the conventional petrol engine essentially only in regards to the intake tract with additional injection valves for hydrogen The hydrogen is stored cryogenically at a temperature of minus degrees Celsius in a double walled steel tank behind the rear seat back The hydrogen tank holds litres and allows an additional range of km mi In addition the hL has a fuel cell rated at kW hp at volts This is not used as a drive unit but as an auxiliary power unit APU for power supply to the electrical system br During the Expo in Hanover the vehicles were used as shuttles
