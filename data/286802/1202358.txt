title: Diesel exhaust
id: 1202358
Diesel exhaust is the gaseous exhaust produced by a diesel type of internal combustion engine plus any contained particulates Its composition may vary with the fuel type or rate of consumption or speed of engine operation e g idling or at speed or under load and whether the engine is in an on road vehicle farm vehicle locomotive marine vessel or stationary generator or other application br Diesel exhaust is a Group carcinogen which causes lung cancer and has a positive association with bladder cancer It contains several substances that are also listed individually as human carcinogens by the IARC br Methods exist to reduce nitrogen oxides NOx and particulate matter PM in the exhaust So while diesel fuel contains slightly more carbon kg CO litre than petrol kg CO litre overall CO emissions of a diesel car tend to be lower due to higher efficiency In use on average this equates to around g CO km for petrol and g CO km for diesel br br br Composition br br The primary products of petroleum fuel combustion in air are carbon dioxide water and nitrogen The other components exist primarily from incomplete combustion and pyro synthesis While the distribution of the individual components of raw untreated diesel exhaust varies depending on factors like load engine type etc the adjacent table shows a typical composition br The physical and chemical conditions that exist inside any such diesel engines under any conditions differ considerably from spark ignition engines because by design diesel engine power is directly controlled by the fuel supply not by control of the air fuel mixture as in conventional gasoline engines As a result of these differences diesel engines generally produce a different array of pollutants than spark driven engines differences that are sometimes qualitative what pollutants are there and what are not but more often quantitative how much of particular pollutants or pollutant classes are present in each For instance diesel engines produce one twenty eighth the carbon monoxide that gasoline engines do as they burn their fuel in excess air even at full load br However the lean burning nature of diesel engines and the high temperatures and pressures of the combustion process result in significant production of NOx gaseous nitrogen oxides an air pollutant that constitutes a unique challenge with regard to their reduction While total nitrogen oxides from petrol cars have decreased by around through adoption of exhaust catalytic converters as of diesel cars still produce nitrogen oxides at a similar level to those bought years earlier under real world tests hence diesel cars emit around times more nitrogen oxides than petrol cars Modern on road diesel engines typically use selective catalytic reduction SCR systems to meet emissions laws as other methods such as exhaust gas recirculation EGR cannot adequately reduce NOx to meet the newer standards applicable in many jurisdictions Auxiliary diesel systems designed to remediate the nitrogen oxide pollutants are described in a separate section below br Moreover the fine particles fine particulate matter in diesel exhaust e g soot sometimes visible as opaque dark colored smoke has traditionally been of greater concern as it presents different health concerns and is rarely produced in significant quantities by spark ignition engines These especially harmful particulate contaminants are at their peak when such engines are run without sufficient oxygen to fully combust the fuel when a diesel engine runs at idle enough oxygen is usually present to burn the fuel completely The oxygen requirement in non idling engines is usually satisfied using turbocharging From the particle emission standpoint exhaust from diesel vehicles has been reported to be significantly more harmful than those from petrol vehicles br Diesel exhausts long known for their characteristic smells changed significantly with the reduction of sulfur content of diesel fuel and again when catalytic converters were introduced in exhaust systems Even so diesel exhausts continue to contain an array of inorganic and organic pollutants in various classes and in varying concentrations see below depending on fuel composition and engine running conditions br br br Chemical classes br br The following are classes of chemical compounds that have been found in diesel exhaust br br br Specific chemicals br The following are classes of specific chemicals that have been found in diesel exhaust br br Includes all regioisomers of this aromatic compound See ortho meta and para isomer descriptions at each compound s article br br br Regulation br br To rapidly reduce particulate matter from heavy duty diesel engines in California the California Air Resources Board created the Carl Moyer Memorial Air Quality Standards Attainment Program to provide funding for upgrading engines ahead of emissions regulations In the California Air Resources Board also implemented the California Statewide Truck and Bus Rule which requires all heavy duty diesel trucks and buses with a few exceptions that operate in California to either retrofit or replace engines in order to reduce diesel particulate matter The US Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA issued a health standard in January designed to reduce diesel exhaust exposure in underground metal and nonmetal mines on September MSHA published a notice in the Federal Register proposing to postpone the effective date from January until January br Sulfur content br Unlike international shipping that has a Sulfur limit at mass mass outside ECA until where it reduces to outside ECA diesel for on road use and off road heavy equipment has been limited in all of EU since br Diesel and gasoline have been limited to ppm sulfur since for on road vehicles and non road vehicles Mandatory specifications also apply to more than a dozen fuel parameters br br br Health concerns br br br General concerns br Emissions from diesel vehicles have been reported to be significantly more harmful than those from petrol vehicles Diesel combustion exhaust is a source of atmospheric soot and fine particles which is a component of the air pollution implicated in human cancer heart and lung damage and mental functioning Moreover diesel exhaust contains contaminants listed as carcinogenic for humans by the IARC part of the World Health Organization of the United Nations as present in their List of IARC Group carcinogens In diesel exhaust pollution accounted for around one quarter of the pollution in the air and a high share of sickness caused by automotive pollution br br br Occupational health effects br br Exposure to diesel exhaust and diesel particulate matter DPM is an occupational hazard to truckers railroad workers occupants of residential homes in vicinity of a rail yard and miners using diesel powered equipment in underground mines Adverse health effects have also been observed in the general population at ambient atmospheric particle concentrations well below the concentrations in occupational settings br In March U S government scientists showed that underground miners exposed to high levels of diesel fumes have a threefold increased risk for contracting lung cancer compared with those exposed to low levels The million Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study DEMS followed miners controlling for key carcinogens such as cigarette smoke radon and asbestos This allowed scientists to isolate the effects of diesel fumes br For over years concerns have been raised in the USA regarding children s exposure to DPM as they ride diesel powered school buses to and from school In the Environmental Protection Agency EPA established the Clean School Bus USA initiative in an effort to unite private and public organizations in curbing student exposures br br br Concerns regarding particulates br br Diesel particulate matter DPM sometimes also called diesel exhaust particles DEP is the particulate component of diesel exhaust which includes diesel soot and aerosols such as ash particulates metallic abrasion particles sulfates and silicates When released into the atmosphere DPM can take the form of individual particles or chain aggregates with most in the invisible sub micrometer range of nanometers also known as ultrafine particles UFP or PM br The main particulate fraction of diesel exhaust consists of fine particles Because of their small size inhaled particles may easily penetrate deep into the lungs The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs in the exhaust stimulate nerves in the lungs causing reflex coughing wheezing and shortness of breath The rough surfaces of these particles makes it easy for them to bind with other toxins in the environment thus increasing the hazards of particle inhalation br A study of particulate matter PM emissions from transit buses running on ULSD and a mixture of biodiesel and conventional diesel B was reported by Omidvarborna and coworkers where they conclude PM emissions appeared lower in cases of mixed diesel biodiesel use where they were dependent on the engine model cold and hot idle modes and fuel type and that heavy metals in PM emitted during hot idling were greater than those from cold idling reasons for PM reduction in biodiesel emissions were suggested to result from the oxygenated structure of biodiesel fuel as well as arising from changes in technology including the use of a catalytic converter in this test system Other studies concluded that while in certain specific cases i e low loads more saturated feedstocks NOx emissions can be lower than with diesel fuel in most cases NOx emissions are higher and the NOx emissions even go up as more biofuel is mixed in Pure biodiesel B even ends up having more NOx emissions compared to regular diesel fuel br br br Specific effects br Exposures have been linked with acute short term symptoms such as headache dizziness light headedness nausea coughing difficult or labored breathing tightness of chest and irritation of the eyes nose and throat Long term exposures can lead to chronic more serious health problems such as cardiovascular disease cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer br Elemental carbon attributable to traffic was significantly associated with wheezing at age and persistent wheezing at age in the Cincinnati Childhood Allergy and Air Pollution Study birth cohort study br The NERC HPA funded Traffic Pollution and Health in London project at King s College London is currently seeking to refine understanding of the health effects of traffic pollution Ambient traffic related air pollution was associated with decreased cognitive function in older men br Mortality from diesel soot exposure in was at least out of the German population of million according to the official report of the Umweltbundesamt Berlin Federal Environmental Agency of Germany br The study of nanoparticles and nanotoxicology is in its infancy and health effects from nanoparticles produced by all types of diesel engines are still being uncovered It is clear that diesel health detriments of fine particle emissions are severe and pervasive Although one study found no significant evidence that short term exposure to diesel exhaust results in adverse extrapulmonary effects effects that are correlated with an increase in cardiovascular disease a study in The Lancet concluded that traffic exposure is the single most serious preventable trigger of heart attack in the general public as the cause of of all attacks It is impossible to tell how much of this effect is due to the stress of being in traffic and how much is due to exposure to exhaust br Since the study of the detrimental health effects of nanoparticles nanotoxicology is still in its infancy and the nature and extent of negative health impacts from diesel exhaust continues to be discovered it remains controversial whether the public health impact of diesels is higher than that of petrol fueled vehicles br br br Variation with engine conditions br br The types and quantities of nanoparticles can vary according to operating temperatures and pressures presence of an open flame fundamental fuel type and fuel mixture and even atmospheric mixtures As such the resulting types of nanoparticles from different engine technologies and even different fuels are not necessarily comparable One study has shown that of the volatile component of diesel nanoparticles is unburned lubricating oil Long term effects still need to be further clarified as well as the effects on susceptible groups of people with cardiopulmonary diseases br Diesel engines can produce black soot or more specifically diesel particulate matter from their exhaust The black smoke consists of carbon compounds that have not burned because of local low temperatures where the fuel is not fully atomized These local low temperatures occur at the cylinder walls and at the surface of large droplets of fuel At these areas where it is relatively cold the mixture is rich contrary to the overall mixture which is lean The rich mixture has less air to burn and some of the fuel turns into a carbon deposit Modern car engines use a diesel particulate filter DPF to capture carbon particles and then intermittently burn them using extra fuel injected directly into the filter This prevents carbon buildup at the expense of wasting a small quantity of fuel br The full load limit of a diesel engine in normal service is defined by the black smoke limit beyond which point the fuel cannot be completely burned As the black smoke limit is still considerably lean of stoichiometric it is possible to obtain more power by exceeding it but the resultant inefficient combustion means that the extra power comes at the price of reduced combustion efficiency high fuel consumption and dense clouds of smoke This is only done in high performance applications where these disadvantages are of little concern br When starting from cold the engine s combustion efficiency is reduced because the cold engine block draws heat out of the cylinder in the compression stroke The result is that fuel is not burned fully resulting in blue and white smoke and lower power outputs until the engine has warmed This is especially the case with indirect injection engines which are less thermally efficient With electronic injection the timing and length of the injection sequence can be altered to compensate for this Older engines with mechanical injection can have mechanical and hydraulic governor control to alter the timing and multi phase electrically controlled glow plugs that stay on for a period after start up to ensure clean combustion the plugs are automatically switched to a lower power to prevent their burning out br W rtsil states that there are two ways of forming smoke on large diesel engines one being fuel hitting metal and not having time to burn off The other being when too much fuel is in the combustion chamber br W rtsil have tested an engine and compared smoke output when using conventional fuel system and common rail fuel system the result shows improvement on all operation conditions when using the common rail system br br br Ecological effects br br Experiments in showed that diesel exhaust impaired bees ability to detect the scent of oilseed rape flowers br Emissions from diesel engines contribute to the production of ground level ozone which can damage crops trees and other vegetation Diesel exhaust also contributes to the formation of acid rain which affects soil lakes and streams and can enter the human food chain via water produce meat and fish br Diesel exhaust plays a role in climate change Reducing greenhouse gas GHG emissions from diesel engines through improved fuel economy or idle reduction strategies can help address climate change improve our nation s energy security and strengthen our economy br br br Remedies br br br General br With emission standards tightening diesel engines are having to become more efficient and have fewer pollutants in their exhaust For instance light duty truck must now have NOx emissions less than g mile and in the U S by NOx emissions must be less than g mile Moreover in recent years the United States Europe and Japan have extended emissions control regulations from covering on road vehicles to include farm vehicles and locomotives marine vessels and stationary generator applications Changing to a different fuel i e dimethyl ether and other bioethers as diethyl ether tends to be a very effective means to reduce pollutants such as NOx and CO When running on dimethyl ether DME for instance particulate matter emissions are near nonexistent and the use of diesel particulate filters could even be omitted Also given that DME can be made from animal food and agricultural waste it can even be carbon neutral unlike regular diesel Mixing in bio ether or other fuels such as hydrogen into conventional diesel also tends to have a beneficial effect on the pollutants that are emitted In addition to changing the fuel US engineers have also come up with two other principles and distinct systems to all on market products that meet the U S emissions criteria selective non catalytic reduction SNCR and exhaust gas recirculation EGR Both are in the exhaust system of diesel engines and are further designed to promote efficiency br br br Selective catalytic reduction br Selective catalytic reduction SCR injects a reductant such as ammonia or urea the latter aqueous where it is known as diesel exhaust fluid DEF into the exhaust of a diesel engine to convert nitrogen oxides NOx into gaseous nitrogen and water SNCR systems have been prototyped that reduce of the NOx in the exhaust system with commercialized systems being somewhat lower SCR systems do not necessarily need particulate matter PM filters when SNCR and PM filters are combined some engines have been shown to be more fuel efficient A disadvantage of the SCR system in addition to added upfront development cost which can be offset by compliance and improved performance is the need to refill the reductant the periodicity of which varies with the miles driven load factors and the hours used The SNCR system is not as efficient at higher revolutions per minute rpm SCR is being optimized to have higher efficiency with broader temperatures to be more durable and to meet other commercial needs br br br Exhaust gas recirculation br br Exhaust gas recirculation EGR on diesel engines can be used to achieve a richer fuel to air mixture and a lower peak combustion temperature Both effects reduce NOx emissions but can negatively impact efficiency and the production of soot particles The richer mix is achieved by displacing some of the intake air but is still lean compared to petrol engines which approach the stoichiometric ideal The lower peak temperature is achieved by a heat exchanger that removes heat before re entering the engine and works due to the exhaust gases higher specific heat capacity than air With the greater soot production EGR is often combined with a particulate matter PM filter in the exhaust In turbocharged engines EGR needs a controlled pressure differential across the exhaust manifold and intake manifold which can be met by such engineering as use of a variable geometry turbocharger which has inlet guide vanes on the turbine to build exhaust backpressure in the exhaust manifold directing exhaust gas to the intake manifold It also requires additional external piping and valving and so requires additional maintenance br br br Combined systems br John Deere the farm equipment manufacturer is implementing such a combined SCR EGR design in a liter inline diesel engine that involves both system types a PM filter and additional oxidation catalyst technologies The combined system incorporates two turbochargers the first on the exhaust manifold with variable geometry and containing the EGR system and a second a fixed geometry turbocharger Recirculated exhaust gas and the compressed air from the turbochargers have separate coolers and air merges before entering the intake manifold and all subsystems are controlled by a central engine control unit that optimizes minimization of pollutants released in the exhaust gas br br br Other remedies br br A new technology being tested in has been created by Air Ink which collects carbon particles using a Kaalink cylindrical device that is retrofitted into a vehicle s exhaust system after processing to remove heavy metals and carcinogens the company plans to use the carbon to make ink br In India the Chakr Dual Fuel Kit retrofits a diesel generator set to operate on a mixture of both gas and diesel with natural gas and fossil fuel br br br Water recovery br There has been research into ways that troops in deserts can recover drinkable water from their vehicles exhaust gases br br br See
