title: 2020â€“2022 catalytic converter theft ring
id: 76074103
From to an organized criminal group stole and then resold catalytic converters through the United States The interstate ring is believed to have generated million with the majority earned through the DG Auto Parts corporation The money earned would then be divided between the owners of the company with the rest being paid out to several regional theft rings supplying the catalytic converters Its dismantlement in was described as the first known interdiction of such a criminal scheme br br br Background br A catalytic converter is a typically oblong shaped vehicle emissions control device that makes up part of an automobile s exhaust system The catalytic converter accelerates a chemical reaction using heat and precious metals contained within the device such as platinum rhodium and palladium PRP to transform toxic engine exhaust gases into less toxic pollutants and other non polluting gases Catalytic converters became mandatory in American automobiles following the Clean Air Act of but are easy to surreptitiously remove from vehicles br According to a report by the National Insurance Crime Bureau NCIB metal recyclers will often pay between to for a catalytic converter and up to for one that was removed from a hybrid vehicle The devices are typically much more valuable to the theft s victim it can cost between and or more to replace a catalytic converter that is stolen depending on the type of vehicle In catalytic converter thefts costs victims over br From to the price of PRP rose dramatically platinum rose from per ounce to about to adjusted for inflation This led to an epidemic of thefts targeting the device for sale to scrap dealers In a report the National Insurance Crime Bureau stated that in there were catalytic converter thefts reported In it was reported thefts In reported catalytic converter thefts jumped massively to with December leading the way with thefts or roughly percent of the yearly total in just one month According to records from Carfax which examined service records that listed stolen as the reason for the catalytic converter replacement it is estimated that catalytic converters were stolen in America in br Initially the operation of the theft scheme appeared a continuation of this baseline trend In the report the NCIB stated that based on insurance claims thefts of catalytic converters increased significantly from through In addition there were insurance claims for catalytic converter thefts in a number that had increased to by The report also stated that the highest rate for catalytic converter theft claims between and was California with thefts reported to insurers In alone an average of catalytic converters were reported stolen each month in California br br br Dowa Metals Mining America and Nippon PGM Co br br Dowa Metals Mining America is a precious metals refiner that began in as a mining operation in the town of Kosaka Akita Prefecture The company specialized in mining kuroko ore a rare black volcanic deposit found only in Japan and primarily in Akita Prefecture in the Hokuroku Basin The ores can contain as much as of combined copper lead and zinc but they can also contain quantities of gold and silver It was difficult to recover the precious and base metals from the ores efficiently due to the complex mineral composition until Dowa invented specialised floating and smelting methods for this purpose br Dowa expanded their domestic mining operations during the early th century and began exploring international opportunities for expansion in the s By Kosaka Mine had closed and by Dowa s domestic operations in Japan were suspended due to economic changes and the depletion of ore They currently operate three overseas mines Tizapa and Los Gatos Mines in Mexico and Gibraltar Mine in Canada In Dowa Holdings established Dowa Metals Mining America beginning operations at a refinery in Burlington New Jersey some time after br After Dowa evaluated the PRP dust that it received it would pay its suppliers and refine the dust into chunks These chunks would then be shipped to Tanaka Precious Metals in Akita where they would be prepared for sale Tanaka Precious Metals was a founding member of Nippon PGM Co a joint venture formed in between Dowa Tanaka Precious Metals and Kosaka Smelting and Refining Co br Tanaka Precious Metals was formed a year after Dowa in as Ejimaya Tanaka Shoten as a bullion trading business melting down foreign currency from Yokohama s foreign quarter refining and then selling the metals They have since become one of the world s largest precious metal suppliers supplying critical materials to several Japanese industries including vehicles and electronics br Kosaka Smelting and Refining Co was incorporated in May and today produces approximately different kinds of metals something they claim is rare in the industry Additionally they claim to be the only plant in Japan with the capability to produce both copper and lead at a single plant br Between and Tanaka Precious Metals annual revenue increased by approximately to million It is unclear whether Dowa performed any form of vetting on their suppliers br br br DG Auto Parts br br Navin and his brother Tinu Khanna were first generation immigrants from India Their older brothers owned and operated a wrecking yard and after working there for a few years Navin and Tinu began their own business ventures In they began a rubber disposal business in they began a recycling business and in they also started a company in the auto wrecking industry under the name DG Auto Wreckers br According to an interview performed by Navin with ACE Finance none of their prior endeavors succeeded until DG Auto Wreckers this success was due to finding Dowa Metals Mining America A subpoena into the brothers bank records corroborated the interview between March and April a total of was transferred by Dowa into a single account used by DG Auto Parts A further was discovered on another account br DG Auto Wreckers traded in used car parts including catalytic converters Initially the business remained small with sellers bringing in small loads from across New Jersey However when the COVID pandemic began the prices of PRP metals rose drastically In December rhodium cost per ounce and by March the price rose to per ounce with platinum and palladium seeing similar rises br The brothers incorporated the business as DG Auto Parts in February and moved to the Freehold New Jersey site They decided to focus on catalytic converter recycling and bought four decanning machines These machines break apart the catalytic converters and demolish the cores into dust which was then collected and sent to Dowa s refinery in Burlington New Jersey That year DG Auto Parts bought a site in Virginia and began partnering with converter businesses across the US including Curtis Cores A neighboring business manager said people would come with tractor trailers and drop them off Dumpsters full of cat alytic converter s They were working hours Investigations would later reveal that DG Auto Parts did not care whether their supplies were obtained legally br By the business had a website and an app for both Android and iOS for daily pricing on thousands of catalytic converter codes These codes identify the make model and place of origin of catalytic converters which in turn identify their value due to variation in state emission laws As an example GD EA denotes a Toyota Prius manufactured between and its high palladium content can sell for more than Sellers could send in photos of their catalytic converters for advance grading and pricing br As the profits grew DG Auto Parts began making advance payments in the millions to their largest suppliers including Curtis Cores so that they too could provide their suppliers with the highest prices to maximize the supply of catalytic converters br br br Initial investigation br br The investigation that led to the discovery of the theft ring began in late and early when a wave of catalytic converter thefts struck the Tulsa Oklahoma area Police began arresting cutters low level criminals responsible for stealing catalytic converters The police then attempted to flip the cutters for their fences According to the cutters one fence was Steven Low Sr an insurance agent and dealer in catalytic converters In May GPS tracked Low s vehicle to an automobile recycling warehouse on Oklahoma State Highway in Broken Arrow br The warehouse was owned by Tyler Curtis who was already of interest to investigators in a February Facebook Marketplace exchange Curtis had told an undercover investigator it does not matter where they the catalytic converters came from Two days after Low s visit the Tulsa Police Department stopped Curtis vehicle following a tip an off duty officer had spotted a suspicious white pickup truck with multiple catalytic converters in the bed driving through southeast Tulsa A search of the vehicle revealed contraband and other tools commonly associated with criminal activity a loaded handgun a small bag containing three grams of cocaine and eight grams of heroin a bundle of cash amounting to and catalytic converters with jagged ends suggesting that they had been stolen br The officers then called a lieutenant their liaison with the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI regarding the theft wave Questioned on where the catalytic converters came from Curtis claimed that his automobile recycling business which had opened in January Curtis Cores had obtained them legally br Curtis and his passenger were then arrested for possession of drugs and an unpermitted firearm To legally possess the catalytic converters Curtis needed a scrap metal license which Curtis did not possess however he said that his father had submitted an application for the permit It was later discovered that while he was in jail he made a recorded phone call in which he asked his parents to remove incriminating objects from the warehouse Curtis pleaded guilty or no contest in the Tulsa County District Court to the drug and firearm charges receiving a three year deferred sentence br After releasing Curtis on bail police obtained a search warrant regarding Curtis seized phone and iPad On these devices they discovered a Facebook messaging group including Curtis a man called Navin Khanna and another called Adam Sharkey br By September a team of investigators led by Brad Staggs and the improbably named Kansas Core had identified that the catalytic converters were transported from across the US to a Freehold New Jersey company called DG Auto Parts where the cores were extracted and then shipped overseas br In December Kansas Core had obtained a warrant to place a hour surveillance camera on a pole outside Curtis Cores Vehicles arrived daily sometimes hourly full of catalytic converters Curtis and his employees would then unload the converters inspect them and pay cash Then the converters would be packed into cardboard boxes wrapped in plastic and loaded onto pallets for transport The business handled between and catalytic converters per week These catalytic converters would then be transported either directly to DG Auto Parts or to Adam an intermediary in New York br Several weeks after Kansas Core gained the warrant to surveil Curtis Cores he gained a search warrant for Curtis s Facebook account Looking through his account they alongside a team associated with the Homeland Security Investigations HSI division in Tulsa traced the development of the trafficking ring Curtis had started working at Green Country Auto Core part time three years before his arrest Green Country s owner Dave Edwards trained Curtis extensively on the catalytic converter recycling industry and described Curtis as good at his job and a hustler br Between May and August Curtis found DG Auto Parts and put the owner Navin Khanna in contact with Edwards Edwards I didn t deal with that guy Navin Khanna much Tyler dealt with him I did talk to the guy just kind of rubbed me the wrong way Court documents would later reveal that Green Country Auto Core had sold approximately worth of catalytic converters to them In late Curtis told Edwards that he would be starting his own business and that he would be bringing DG Auto Parts with him Edwards later said of this I felt I wasted a lot of time on him showing him the business Would ve been nice to have a little warning couple of weeks at least In hindsight it s probably the best thing that happened to me br br br Dismantling the state theft rings br Kansas Core and other investigators started filing for more warrants intercepting calls made to and from Curtis s phone tracking the locations of his employees phones and monitoring their Facebook accounts Another warrant authorized a pole camera outside Curtis s home where he lived with his wife on a large plot of land owned by his in laws br Since Curtis Cores had received stolen catalytic converters it could be sued in federal court A regular delivery arrived from Houston Texas where the sellers specialized in torpedo type catalytic converters named for their distinctive shape extracted from Toyota Tacoma and Tundra pickup trucks br br br Texas br On March in Houston off duty sheriff s deputy Darren Almendarez was grabbing groceries with his wife and parked their Toyota Tundra outside of a Joe V s Smart Shop north of the city Leaving the store Almendarez noticed that a black Nissan Altima had backed up to his vehicle Almendarez had worked in an auto theft unit in the Harris County Sheriff s Office and recognized an apparent catalytic converter theft in progress As he approached two men clambered out from under his truck and into the Altima and he told his wife to run away and call the police The driver of the Altima raised a handgun Almendarez drew his own in the ensuing shootout Almendarez and two men inside the Altima were shot and then the men fled br Almendarez was rushed to Houston Northwest Hospital where he was pronounced dead Not long after Joshua Stewart and Fredarius Clark arrived at the same hospital seeking treatment for gunshot wounds Following treatment they were taken into custody A third suspect Fredrick Tardy was arrested the following day br Houston police suspected that the three men delivered their stolen goods into a supply chain running through Tulsa Staggs would later say describe the Houston police as highly motivated obviously to go out and take these people down So we took this detour in our investigation to provide them with anything we could br A week after Almendarez s death the pole camera monitoring Curtis Cores recorded a black GMC pickup truck with Texas license plates pulling a U Haul trailer of catalytic converters The truck was traced back to Isaac Castillo a Houston resident Houston police had already stopped Castillo in February when he was driving a pickup carrying catalytic converters discovering an unlicensed firearm and in cash Upon his return to Texas police stopped Castillo again Searching the truck police discovered a box containing in cash Castillo continued to deny any wrongdoing claiming that the money was a result of selling scrap in Oklahoma br However police continued to investigate and identified Castillo as a member of a Ley Road gang Houston police and the Houston HSI alleged that the three men accused of Almendarez s death had been using the Ley Road gang and another gang as fences for the catalytic converters they stole On July that year officers from Houston HSI Harris County Sherriff s Office Houston Police Department and the Texas Department of Public Safety raided the Ley Road gang seizing over firearms narcotics a stolen Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat and catalytic converters worth an estimated At the time Castillo was not among those detained The police obtained a warrant to locate his phone which placed him at Curtis Cores making another delivery br Shortly after leaving Castillo was stopped by police for a third time and this time arrested Castillo would later tell investigators that Curtis kept in his desk drawer and knew the catalytic converters he obtained and sold were stolen In an interview with one of the gang s leaders police were told that Curtis instructed them as to what vehicles to steal from br br br Colorado br Following a rise in catalytic converter thefts in Weld County Colorado Weld County Sherriff s Office WCSO began investigating in This later led police to Elevation Auto Core in Brighton Colorado In the WCSO was contacted by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation and HSI The investigation expanded to the state and federal level because Elevation Auto Core was a part of the larger theft ring including a business in Las Vegas Nevada br On May police tracked one of Curtis s employees to Elevation Auto Core Learning that he would be traveling back to Tulsa he was stopped at the airport A cash sniffing dog alerted officers to his bag which contained in cash The employee signed over the money to the police br According to arrest papers in the case undercover officers and confidential informants wearing cameras found they could walk in and easily sell obviously stolen catalytic converters Despite changes to Colorado law requiring identification and other personal information to be collected in the sale of catalytic converters little to no questions were asked in three different sting operations The catalytic converters were then similar to the Curtis Cores operation packaged and placed onto pallets to be transported out of state most destined for the east coast and overseas or decanned on site br On December six men were taken into custody in both Colorado and Nevada They were charged with violations of the Colorado Organized Crime Control Act Colorado tax laws theft and money laundering br br br Minnesota br From to four men from Minneapolis managed a theft ring where they acquired stolen catalytic converters and transported approximately of their stock to high volume buyers based in New Jersey Oklahoma Colorado and New York They used similar methods to the rest of the ring grading pricing sorting concealing and then transporting the catalytic converters using rented U Haul vehicles as well as their personal vehicles In total they received approximately in payments using wire transfers cash cheques or a combination of methods br In prosecutors say that the group took multiple trips to a buyer in New Jersey before flying back to Minnesota At least three of these trips netted them a profit of nearly br br br California br On May Vang Auto Core LLC was started by Tou Vang who was joined soon after by his brother Andrew Vang On May Tou was arrested for the theft of a catalytic converter from a Prius Between May and October that year Vang Auto Core was already in contact with DG Auto Parts with their first transaction occurring on October In the following three months the Vangs withdrew approximately in increments This is likely due to the Bank Secrecy Act a law requiring banks to report transactions larger than to the Internal Revenue Service br In September a Prius owner in Davis California discovered that their catalytic converter had been stolen Investigation into the theft uncovered footage recorded by a vehicle on the same street which showed a vehicle stopping nearby the Prius during the night much like how the thieves had stopped behind Almendarez s vehicle in Houston The vehicle and its owner were identified and surveillance began The following month police stopped the vehicle and upon searching it discovered a number of catalytic converters inside Two men were arrested in connection with this Dao Xiong and Shaneel Lal Prosecutors charged the two men with the theft of catalytic converters in eight northern California counties br During surveillance investigators observed the two men casing neighborhoods during the day only to return by night to steal catalytic converters Investigators also tracked Xiong to the Vangs home on Meadowgate Drive Sacramento br br In August police acquired a search warrant for a phone associated with a known cutter with which they discovered the cutter had been discussing catalytic converters with a man called Choy Saeteurn a mechanic based in Sacramento Police then acquired a search warrant for Saeteurn s Facebook account br br On September Tou and Saeteurn had a text conversation about Saeteurn returning to buying and selling catalytic converters saying that he was doing so discreetly Prosecutors later alleged that Tou was buying discreetly due to his prior arrest in By September however he was already under investigation for the interstate trafficking of catalytic converters br A week later on September Navin communicated with Saeteurn about a need for more Prius referring to Toyota Priuses and their catalytic converters In this conversation he referred to Tou directly br On September Navin communicated with Saeteurn about Tou shipping catalytic converters to DG Auto Parts bank records later showed DG Auto Parts paying Vang Auto Core for this In April shipping manifests showed that Vang Auto Core had shipped two crates which together weighed pounds kilograms to DG Auto Parts In the following two weeks DG Auto Parts paid Vang Auto Core a further br By May police were using a confidential informant to sell catalytic converters to the Vangs at their house From May to August the informant made five sales of between two or three catalytic converters at a time On one occasion the informant told the Vangs that he had stolen one from a Prius that he d previously targeted Andrew responded to this by saying for future reference don t say they were stolen br In August during a conversation with a confidential informant following the purchase of two catalytic converters Andrew asked them to see if you can cover it catalytic converter better on return trips to the house as another seller had brought hella heat over here not long prior by arriving in a stolen vehicle br According to police many of the cutters that sold to the Vangs were also related to the Tiny Rascal Gang TRG The TRG was founded in in Long Beach California by Cambodian refugees seeking protection from neighboring gangs Due to this and the fact the Vangs operated the business from home the Vangs were known to keep at least five firearms in their house and more than rounds of ammunition br In November one of the Vangs neighbors Joe McElroy came back from work to find the street cordoned off by police there was yellow crime tape surrounding the Vangs house and a tarp covering a corpse on the driveway Upon asking around he discovered that Andrew Vang had shot a burglar who had broken into their house Not long after he witnessed a stream of police entering the house with dogs and sledgehammers McElroy later said of this Cops come over and fucked up the whole house Just ransacked it Knocking the walls down They destroyed it The Vangs moved out within a few days with the damage said to have taken approximately eight months to repair br Due to the nature of the Vangs operation investigators speculated that the perpetrators knew about their business and targeted their home expecting to find money there Andrew was not charged for the shooting as the shooting was deemed to have been self defense When the Vangs left their home they looked to DG Auto Parts to help them In December the Khanna brothers paid approximately for a house in northern Sacramento on their behalf br By the second quarter of investigators already suspected that DG Auto Parts was the hub for the sale of stolen catalytic converters br br br Sting operations at DG Auto Parts br On May a Wyandotte Nation Tribal Police Department officer pulled over a rental truck and had a detection dog search the vehicle the dog indicated it had detected something Three pallets containing catalytic converters and approximately was found in the truck The driver Robert Sharkey provided various mixed narratives to the purpose of his trip or the source of the catalytic converters and money The name Sharkey was already known to police in Tulsa due to his son Adam Sharkey DG Auto Parts associate in New York According to police the money had originated from DG Auto Parts and approximately was destined for Curtis Cores br Robert was allegedly transferring money to another intermediary Martynas Macerauskas in Amarillo Texas Martynas was the owner of M M Auto a business in Clarendon Texas who partnered with DG Auto Parts He would later tell investigators about his dealings with DG Auto Parts saying Khanna does not care where the catalytic converters come from only that he wants the volume so he can keep up with sales to Dowa br On May Martynas wife was stopped in Texas with approximately in her vehicle she told police that she had driven it from DG Auto Parts In a search of M M Auto police found catalytic converters In total the Macerauskas received more than from DG Auto Parts for catalytic converters br That same day the pole camera surveilling Curtis Cores recorded Curtis s employees awaiting Robert s arrival At approximately a m Curtis was informed that Robert had been stopped and that the money had been seized Curtis then called Adam to inform him Two days after Robert Sharkey was stopped Curtis flew to Newark Liberty International Airport and drove to DG Auto Parts while being followed by investigators When he left he was carrying approximately in bags which he then drove back to Oklahoma br Curtis did become more careful upon returning after the Ley Road gang s then recent arrest and concern that police would link them back to him which was caught on a wiretap He altered how he would buy stolen goods refused to travel with large sums of money and would routinely check with his wife to ensure the money stashed around their property was safe Despite this extra care investigators used a confidential informant who went to Curtis Cores carrying catalytic converters who told Curtis that he had bought the catalytic converters from a sketchy motherfucker who had just got them from some cars and after escaping from police hid them in a field Curtis still bought them br In August Downpipe Depot Recycling LLC in East Hartford Connecticut a buyer for DG Auto Parts was raided by police after it was discovered that they transported and sold stolen catalytic converters to recycling businesses in New York and New Jersey When federal investigators later obtained a wiretap for an employee of DG Auto Parts they recorded Navin on August telling him that traveling with money was too risky and that the police were busting everybody br An August drop in PRP prices particularly palladium strained DG Auto Parts finances One buyer threatened to sue the company for stealing data from the pricing app There were accusations on their Facebook page that the brothers offered large sums of money for large quantities of catalytic converters and then refused to pay In September DG Auto Parts announced that it had secured funding out of its financial difficulties with private investment firm Barrett Edge who praised the Khanna brothers as consummate professionals br Meanwhile investigators sent confidential informants into DG Auto Parts for months to sell catalytic converters all the while emphasizing that they were stolen In a Facebook message Navin said every cat in Cali is stolen I can promise you that Federal indictments later alleged that on September a confidential informant claimed that their cousin worked in a Toyota warehouse and that they could steal catalytic converters and bricks cores that had not yet been put into catalytic converters from the Priuses stored there The brothers agreed to the plan paying for bricks and catalytic converters br br br Operation Heavy Metal and aftermath br By the third quarter of the investigation into the interstate catalytic converter theft ring was reaching its conclusion Now nicknamed Operation Heavy Metal the investigation had grown to include over local and federal agencies By chance investigators in Operation Heavy Metal discovered the investigation into the Vang family as such the investigation was merged into Operation Heavy Metal It was later discovered that Vang Auto Core had sold over of catalytic converters to DG Auto Parts The case had become so large that agents from multiple different agencies had to meet together in Philadelphia Pennsylvania to coordinate the final stages of the investigation On the morning of November the owner of a store adjacent to Curtis Cores Jeremy Jones of JT Auto was in his office grabbing a cup of coffee when he witnessed the police storming into Curtis Cores He later said of the day I look out the window and something caught my eye it was like a SWAT team There s a tank There s guys with assault rifles and military gear Curtis who had left shortly before the raid returned not long after and was arrested On that day the arrest of six of his partners and employees occurred alongside his wife br br Police used a helicopter and officers riding all terrain vehicles to search unsuccessfully for the money stashed on his wife s family s land where he and his wife lived Staggs said of this he probably has money hidden somewhere that we ll never find Curtis was accused of receiving approximately from DG Auto Parts for the shipment of catalytic converters br Simultaneously across the US police executed more than search warrants on locations used by the various organizations involved in the ring seizing homes bank accounts cash and luxury vehicles among other assets which were valued at tens of millions of dollars In total arrests were made in five states Seven people associated with DG Auto Parts were among those who were arrested six of whom had been involved in decanning and selling the metals to refineries br The Sharkeys gained approximately from the sale of stolen catalytic converters to DG Auto Parts and were arrested in New York Curtis received approximately from Capital Cores a company operated by Adam in Long Island New York br Dowa Metals Mining America had provided DG Auto Parts with the approximately in profits that police uncovered during the investigation Prosecutors said that of the approximately withdrawn from this sum by the Khannas only was recovered As such the Khannas were deemed to be a flight risk if released on bail Despite surveillance and bank records proving Dowa to be the source of DG Auto Parts money the company s name was withheld during the indictments against Curtis and the Khannas only being referred to as an unindicted co conspirator br br br Aftermath br Staggs stated that Operation Heavy Metal had drastically cut the rate of catalytic converter thefts saying in the four months prior to that national takedown day there were reports of catalytic converter theft In the four months after there were By reports of catalytic converter thefts had declined significantly In the first nine months of there were catalytic converter thefts reported per month down from over in br The government was seeking a forfeiture of approximately in connection with the case it is unclear whether they received this amount during the search and seizure efforts br On March Janice Ayala joined Dowa Metals Mining America as their Chief Compliance Officer In Ayala s year tenure at the Department of Homeland Security her most recent role prior to joining Dowa was as Director of Joint Task Force Investigations This agency oversaw the investigation into both DG Auto Parts and Dowa br On June a bill named the Deputy Darren Almendarez Act was signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott The law intended to increase penalties for the theft and unlawful possession of catalytic converters br The three men involved in the shooting of Darren Almendarez were later charged with capital murder The District Attorney s office are seeking the death penalty for Joshua Stewart and Fredarius Clark while Frederick Tardy who was at the time was deemed too young Tardy was released on a bond The three were awaiting court dates in April br On March a superseding indictment was unsealed charging Tinu and Navin s mother father and older brother Anita Nirmal and Michael Khanna with conspiracy to transport stolen catalytic converters from California to New Jersey The case alleged that after Tinu and Navin were arrested Anita Nirmal and Michael continued buying and selling stolen catalytic converters under DG Auto Parts The case also alleged that they sold the PRP metals to employees of a New Jersey metal refinery including Alfredo Mejia and Vishnu Chintaman via a broker Ricky Vega and that they knew the catalytic converters the metals came from were stolen br br br
