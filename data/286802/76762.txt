The Democratic Republic of the Congo also known as Congo Kinshasa Congo Zaire Congo DR DR Congo DRC or simply either Congo or the Congo is a country in Central Africa By land area the DRC is the second largest country in Africa and the th largest in the world With a population of around million the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the most populous Francophone country in the world The national capital and largest city is Kinshasa which is also the economic center The country is bordered by the Republic of the Congo Central African Republic South Sudan Uganda Rwanda Burundi Tanzania across Lake Tanganyika Zambia Angola the Cabinda exclave of Angola and the South Atlantic Ocean br Centered on the Congo Basin the territory of the DRC was first inhabited by Central African foragers around years ago and was reached by the Bantu expansion about years ago In the west the Kingdom of Kongo ruled around the mouth of the Congo River from the th to th centuries In the northeast center and east the kingdoms of Azande Luba and Lunda ruled from the th and th centuries to the th century King Leopold II of Belgium formally acquired rights to the Congo territory from the colonial nations of Europe in and declared the land his private property naming it the Congo Free State From to his colonial military forced the local population to produce rubber and committed widespread atrocities In Leopold ceded the territory which thus became a Belgian colony br Congo achieved independence from Belgium on June and was immediately confronted by a series of secessionist movements the assassination of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and the seizure of power by Mobutu Sese Seko in a coup d tat Mobutu renamed the country Zaire in and imposed a harsh personalist dictatorship until his overthrow in by the First Congo War The country then had its name changed back and was confronted by the Second Congo War from to which resulted in the deaths of million people The war ended under President Joseph Kabila who governed the country from to and under whom human rights in the country remained poor and included frequent abuses such as forced disappearances torture arbitrary imprisonment and restrictions on civil liberties Following the general election in the country s first peaceful transition of power since independence Kabila was succeeded as president by F lix Tshisekedi who has served as president since Since the Eastern DR Congo has been the site of an ongoing military conflict in Kivu br The Democratic Republic of the Congo is extremely rich in natural resources but has suffered from political instability a lack of infrastructure corruption and centuries of both commercial and colonial extraction and exploitation followed by more than years of independence with little widespread development Besides the capital Kinshasa the two next largest cities Lubumbashi and Mbuji Mayi are both mining communities The DRC s largest export is raw minerals with China accepting over of its exports in In DR Congo s level of human development was ranked th out of countries by the Human Development Index and is classed as a least developed country by the UN As of following two decades of various civil wars and continued internal conflicts around Congolese refugees were still living in neighbouring countries Two million children risk starvation and the fighting has displaced million people The country is a member of the United Nations Non Aligned Movement African Union COMESA Southern African Development Community Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie and Economic Community of Central African States br br br Etymology br br The Democratic Republic of the Congo is named after the Congo River which flows through the country The Congo River is the world s deepest river and the world s third largest river by discharge The Comit d tudes du haut Congo Committee for the Study of the Upper Congo established by King Leopold II of Belgium in and the International Association of the Congo established by him in were also named after the river br The Congo River was named by early European sailors after the Kingdom of Kongo and its Bantu inhabitants the Kongo people when they encountered them in the th century The word Kongo comes from the Kongo language also called Kikongo According to American writer Samuel Henry Nelson It is probable that the word Kongo itself implies a public gathering and that it is based on the root konga to gather trans itive The modern name of the Kongo people Bakongo was introduced in the early th century br The Democratic Republic of the Congo has been known in the past as in chronological order the Congo Free State Belgian Congo the Republic of the Congo L opoldville the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Zaire before returning to its current name the Democratic Republic of the Congo br At the time of independence the country was named the Republic of the Congo L opoldville to distinguish it from its neighbour the Republic of the Congo Brazzaville With the promulgation of the Luluabourg Constitution on August the country became the DRC but was renamed Zaire a past name for the Congo River on October by President Mobutu Sese Seko as part of his Authenticit initiative br The word Zaire is from a Portuguese adaptation of a Kikongo word nzadi river a truncation of nzadi o nzere river swallowing rivers The river was known as Zaire during the th and th centuries Congo seems to have replaced Zaire gradually in English usage during the th century and Congo is the preferred English name in th century literature although references to Zaire as the name used by the natives i e derived from Portuguese usage remained common br In the Sovereign National Conference voted to change the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo but the change was not made The country s name was later restored by President Laurent D sir Kabila when he overthrew Mobutu in To distinguish it from the neighboring Republic of the Congo it is sometimes referred to as Congo Kinshasa Congo Kinshasa or Big Congo Its name is sometimes also abbreviated as Congo DR DR Congo DRC the DROC and RDC in French br br br History br br Before Bantu expansion the territory comprising the Democratic Republic of the Congo was home to Central Africa s oldest settled groups the Mbuti peoples Most of the remnants of their hunter gatherer culture remain in the present time br br br Early history br br The geographical area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo was populated as early as years ago as shown by the discovery of the Semliki harpoon at Katanda one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish br Bantu peoples reached Central Africa at some point during the first millennium BC then gradually started to expand southward Their propagation was accelerated by the adoption of pastoralism and of Iron Age techniques The people living in the south and southwest were foraging groups whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies The development of metal tools during this time period revolutionized agriculture This led to the displacement of the hunter gatherer groups in the east and southeast The final wave of the Bantu expansion was complete by the th century followed by the establishment of the Bantu kingdoms whose rising populations soon made possible intricate local regional and foreign commercial networks that traded mostly in slaves salt iron and copper br br br Congo Free State br br Belgian exploration and administration took place from the s until the s It was first led by Henry Morton Stanley who undertook his explorations under the sponsorship of King Leopold II of Belgium The eastern regions of the precolonial Congo were heavily disrupted by constant slave raiding mainly from Arab Swahili slave traders such as the infamous Tippu Tip who was well known to Stanley br Leopold had designs on what was to become the Congo as a colony In a succession of negotiations Leopold professing humanitarian objectives in his capacity as chairman of the front organization Association Internationale Africaine actually played one European rival against another br King Leopold formally acquired rights to the Congo territory at the Conference of Berlin in and made the land his private property He named it the Congo Free State Leopold s regime began various infrastructure projects such as the construction of the railway that ran from the coast to the capital of Leopoldville now Kinshasa which took eight years to complete br br In the Free State colonists coerced the local population into producing rubber for which the spread of automobiles and development of rubber tires created a growing international market Rubber sales made a fortune for Leopold who built several buildings in Brussels and Ostend to honor himself and his country To enforce the rubber quotas the Force Publique was called in and made the practice of cutting off the limbs of the natives a matter of policy br During millions of Congolese died as a consequence of exploitation and disease In some areas the population declined dramatically it has been estimated that sleeping sickness and smallpox killed nearly half the population in the areas surrounding the lower Congo River br News of the abuses began to circulate In the British consul at Boma in the Congo Roger Casement was instructed by the British government to investigate His report called the Casement Report confirmed the accusations of humanitarian abuses The Belgian Parliament forced Leopold II to set up an independent commission of inquiry Its findings confirmed Casement s report of abuses concluding that the population of the Congo had been reduced by half during this period Determining precisely how many people died is impossible as no accurate records exist br br br Belgian Congo br br In the Belgian parliament in spite of initial reluctance bowed to international pressure especially from the United Kingdom and took over the Free State from King Leopold II On October the Belgian parliament voted in favour of annexing the Congo as a Belgian colony Executive power went to the Belgian minister of colonial affairs assisted by a Colonial Council Conseil Colonial both located in Brussels The Belgian parliament exercised legislative authority over the Belgian Congo In the colonial capital moved from Boma to L opoldville some kilometres mi further upstream into the interior The transition from the Congo Free State to the Belgian Congo was a break but it also featured a large degree of continuity The last governor general of the Congo Free State Baron Th ophile Wahis remained in office in the Belgian Congo and the majority of Leopold II s administration with him Opening up the Congo and its natural and mineral riches to the Belgian economy remained the main motive for colonial expansion however other priorities such as healthcare and basic education slowly gained in importance br Colonial administrators ruled the territory and a dual legal system existed a system of European courts and another one of indigenous courts tribunaux indig nes Indigenous courts had only limited powers and remained under the firm control of the colonial administration The Belgian authorities permitted no political activity in the Congo whatsoever and the Force Publique put down any attempts at rebellion br The Belgian Congo was directly involved in the two world wars During World War I an initial stand off between the Force Publique and the German colonial army in German East Africa turned into open warfare with a joint Anglo Belgian Portuguese invasion of German colonial territory in and during the East African campaign The Force Publique gained a notable victory when it marched into Tabora in September under the command of General Charles Tombeur after heavy fighting br After Belgium was rewarded for the participation of the Force Publique in the East African campaign with a League of Nations mandate over the previously German colony of Ruanda Urundi During World War II the Belgian Congo provided a crucial source of income for the Belgian government in exile in London and the Force Publique again participated in Allied campaigns in Africa Belgian Congolese forces under the command of Belgian officers notably fought against the Italian colonial army in Ethiopia in Asosa Borta and Sa o under Major General Auguste Eduard Gilliaert br br br Independence and political crisis br br In May a growing nationalist movement the Mouvement National Congolais led by Patrice Lumumba won the parliamentary elections Lumumba became the first Prime Minister of the Republic of the Congo on June The parliament elected Joseph Kasa Vubu as president of the Alliance des Bakongo ABAKO party Other parties that emerged included the Parti Solidaire Africain led by Antoine Gizenga and the Parti National du Peuple led by Albert Delvaux and Laurent Mbariko br The Belgian Congo achieved independence on June under the name R publique du Congo Republic of Congo or Republic of the Congo in English As the neighboring French colony of Middle Congo Moyen Congo also chose the name Republic of Congo upon achieving its independence the two countries were more commonly known as Congo L opoldville and Congo Brazzaville after their capital cities br Shortly after independence the Force Publique mutinied and on July the province of Katanga led by Mo se Tshombe and South Kasai engaged in secessionist struggles against the new leadership Most of the Europeans who had remained behind after independence fled the country opening the way for Congolese to replace the European military and administrative elite After the United Nations rejected Lumumba s call for help to put down the secessionist movements Lumumba asked for assistance from the Soviet Union who accepted and sent military supplies and advisers On August the Congolese armed forces invaded South Kasai Lumumba was dismissed from office on September by Kasa Vubu who publicly blamed him for massacres by the armed forces in South Kasai and for involving Soviets in the country Lumumba declared Kasa Vubu s action unconstitutional and a crisis between the two leaders developed br On September Colonel Joseph Mobutu with the backing of the US and Belgium removed Lumumba from office On January Lumumba was handed over to Katangan authorities and executed by Belgian led Katangan troops A investigation by Belgium s Parliament found Belgium morally responsible for the murder of Lumumba and the country has since officially apologised for its role in his death br On September in ongoing negotiations of a ceasefire a plane crash near Ndola resulted in the death of Dag Hammarskj ld the Secretary General of the United Nations along with all passengers setting off a succession crisis Amidst widespread confusion and chaos a temporary government was led by technicians the Coll ge des commissaires g n raux Katangan secession ended in January with the assistance of UN forces Several short lived governments of Joseph Ileo Cyrille Adoula and Moise Kapenda Tshombe took over in quick succession br Meanwhile in the east of the country Soviet and Cuban backed rebels called the Simbas rose up taking a significant amount of territory and proclaiming a communist People s Republic of the Congo in Stanleyville The Simbas were pushed out of Stanleyville in November during Operation Dragon Rouge a military operation conducted by Belgian and American forces to rescue hundreds of hostages Congolese government forces fully defeated the Simba rebels by November br Lumumba had previously appointed Mobutu chief of staff of the new Congo army Arm e Nationale Congolaise Taking advantage of the leadership crisis between Kasavubu and Tshombe Mobutu garnered enough support within the army to launch a coup A constitutional referendum the year before Mobutu s coup of resulted in the country s official name being changed to the Democratic Republic of the Congo In Mobutu changed the name again this time to Republic of Zaire br br br Mobutu autocracy and Zaire br br Mobutu had the staunch support of the United States because of his opposition to communism the U S believed that his administration would serve as an effective counter to communist movements in Africa A single party system was established and Mobutu declared himself head of state He periodically held elections in which he was the only candidate Although relative peace and stability were achieved Mobutu s government was guilty of severe human rights violations political repression a cult of personality and corruption br By late Mobutu had successfully neutralized his political opponents and rivals either through co opting them into his regime arresting them or rendering them otherwise politically impotent Throughout the late s Mobutu continued to shuffle his governments and cycle officials in and out of the office to maintain control Joseph Kasa Vubu s death in April ensured that no person with First Republic credentials could challenge his rule By the early s Mobutu was attempting to assert Zaire as a leading African nation He traveled frequently across the continent while the government became more vocal about African issues particularly those relating to the southern region Zaire established semi clientelist relationships with several smaller African states especially Burundi Chad and Togo br Corruption became so common the term le mal Zairois or Zairian sickness meaning gross corruption theft and mismanagement was coined reportedly by Mobutu International aid most often in the form of loans enriched Mobutu while he allowed national infrastructure such as roads to deteriorate to as little as one quarter of what had existed in Zaire became a kleptocracy as Mobutu and his associates embezzled government funds br br In a campaign to identify himself with African nationalism starting on June Mobutu renamed the nation s cities L opoldville became Kinshasa the country was known as Congo Kinshasa Stanleyville became Kisangani Elisabethville became Lubumbashi and Coquilhatville became Mbandaka In Mobutu renamed the country the Republic of Zaire its fourth name change in eleven years and its sixth overall The Congo River was renamed the Zaire River br During the s and s Mobutu was invited to visit the United States on several occasions meeting with U S Presidents Richard Nixon Ronald Reagan and George H W Bush Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union U S relations with Mobutu cooled as he was no longer deemed necessary as a Cold War ally Opponents within Zaire stepped up demands for reform This atmosphere contributed to Mobutu s declaring the Third Republic in whose constitution was supposed to pave the way for democratic reform The reforms turned out to be largely cosmetic Mobutu continued in power until armed forces forced him to flee in From to the United States facilitated Mobutu s attempts to hijack political change one academic wrote and also assisted the rebellion of Laurent Desire Kabila that overthrew the Mobutu regime br In September Mobutu died in exile in Morocco br br br Continental and civil wars br br By following the Rwandan Civil War and genocide and the ascension of a Tutsi led government in Rwanda Rwandan Hutu militia forces Interahamwe fled to eastern Zaire and used refugee camps as bases for incursions against Rwanda They allied with the Zairian Armed Forces to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaire br A coalition of Rwandan and Ugandan armies invaded Zaire to overthrow the government of Mobutu launching the First Congo War The coalition allied with some opposition figures led by Laurent D sir Kabila becoming the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo In Mobutu fled and Kabila marched into Kinshasa naming himself as president and reverting the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of the Congo br Kabila later requested that foreign military forces return to their own countries Rwandan troops retreated to Goma and launched a new Tutsi led rebel military movement called the Rassemblement Congolais pour la Democratie to fight Kabila while Uganda instigated the creation of a rebel movement called the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo led by Congolese warlord Jean Pierre Bemba The two rebel movements along with Rwandan and Ugandan troops started the Second Congo War by attacking the DRC army in Angolan Zimbabwean and Namibian militaries entered the hostilities on the side of the government br Kabila was assassinated in His son Joseph Kabila succeeded him and called for multilateral peace talks UN peacekeepers MONUC now known as MONUSCO arrived in April In Bemba intervened in the Central African Republic on behalf of its former president Ange F lix Patass Talks led to a peace accord under which Kabila would share power with former rebels By June all foreign armies except those of Rwanda had pulled out of Congo A transitional government was set up until after the election A constitution was approved by voters and on July DRC held its first multi party elections These were the first free national elections since which many believed would mark the end to violence in the region However an election result dispute between Kabila and Bemba turned into a skirmish between their supporters in Kinshasa MONUC took control of the city A new election took place in October which Kabila won and in December he was sworn in as president br br br Continued conflicts br Laurent Nkunda a member of Rally for Congolese Democracy Goma defected along with troops loyal to him and formed the National Congress for the Defence of the People CNDP which began an armed rebellion against the government In March after a deal between the DRC and Rwanda Rwandan troops entered the DRC and arrested Nkunda and were allowed to pursue FDLR militants The CNDP signed a peace treaty with the government in which it agreed to become a political party and to have its soldiers integrated into the national army in exchange for the release of its imprisoned members In Bosco Ntaganda the leader of the CNDP and troops loyal to him mutinied and formed the rebel military March Movement M claiming the government had violated the treaty br In the resulting M rebellion M briefly captured the provincial capital of Goma in November Neighboring countries particularly Rwanda have been accused of arming rebels groups and using them as proxies to gain control of the resource rich country an accusation they deny In March the United Nations Security Council authorized the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade to neutralize armed groups On November M declared an end to its insurgency Additionally in northern Katanga the Mai Mai created by Laurent Kabila slipped out of the control of Kinshasa with G d on Kyungu Mutanga s Mai Mai Kata Katanga briefly invading the provincial capital of Lubumbashi in and persons displaced in the province as of On and off fighting in the Ituri conflict occurred between the Nationalist and Integrationist Front and the Union of Congolese Patriots who claimed to represent the Lendu and Hema ethnic groups respectively In the northeast Joseph Kony s Lord s Resistance Army moved from their original bases in Uganda and South Sudan to DR Congo in and set up camps in the Garamba National Park br The war in the Congo has been described as the bloodiest war since World War II In The New York Times reported that people in the Congo continued to die at a rate of an estimated per month estimates of the number who have died from the long conflict range from to The death toll is caused by widespread disease and famine reports indicate that almost half of the individuals who have died are children under five years of age There have been frequent reports of weapon bearers killing civilians of the destruction of property of widespread sexual violence causing hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes and of other breaches of humanitarian and human rights law One study found that more than women are raped in the Democratic Republic of Congo every year In and Congo reported the highest levels of sexual violence in the world According to the Human Rights Watch and the New York University based Congo Research Group armed troops in DRC s eastern Kivu region have killed over civilians and kidnapped at least people since June to June On May Congolese gynecologist Denis Mukwege was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his effort to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war and armed conflict br In major protests broke out across the country and protesters demanded that Kabila step down as president The protests began after the passage of a law by the Congolese lower house that if also passed by the Congolese upper house would keep Kabila in power at least until a national census was conducted a process which would likely take several years and therefore keep him in power past the planned elections which he is constitutionally barred from participating in This bill passed however it was gutted of the provision that would keep Kabila in power until a census took place A census is supposed to take place but it is no longer tied to when the elections take place In elections were scheduled for late and a tenuous peace held in the Congo On November Congolese foreign minister Raymond Tshibanda told the press no elections would be held in it has been decided that the voter registration operation will end on July and that election will take place in April Protests broke out in the country on December when Kabila s term in office ended Across the country dozens of protesters were killed and hundreds were arrested br According to Jan Egeland presently Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council the situation in the DRC became much worse in and and is a major moral and humanitarian challenge comparable to the wars in Syria and Yemen which receive much more attention Women and children are abused sexually and abused in all possible manners Besides the conflict in North Kivu violence increased in the Kasai region The armed groups were after gold diamonds oil and cobalt to line the pockets of rich men both in the region and internationally There were also ethnic and cultural rivalries at play as well as religious motives and the political crisis with postponed elections Egeland says people believe the situation in the DRC is stably bad but in fact it has become much much worse The big wars of the Congo that were really on top of the agenda years ago are back and worsening Disruption in planting and harvesting caused by the conflict was estimated to escalate starvation in about two million children br Human Rights Watch said in that Kabila recruited former March Movement fighters to put down country wide protests over his refusal to step down from office at the end of his term M fighters patrolled the streets of Congo s main cities firing on or arresting protesters or anyone else deemed to be a threat to the president they said Fierce fighting has erupted in Masisi between government forces and a powerful local warlord General Delta The United Nations mission in the DRC is its largest and most expensive peacekeeping effort but it shut down five UN bases near Masisi in after the U S led a push to cut costs br A tribal conflict erupted on December at Yumbi in Mai Ndombe Province Nearly Banunu people from four villages were slaughtered by members of the Batende community in a deep rooted rivalry over monthly tribal duties land fields and water resources Some Banunus fled to Moniende island in the Congo River and another to Makotimpoko District in Republic of Congo Military style tactics were employed in the bloodbath and some assailants were clothed in army uniforms Local authorities and elements within the security forces were suspected of lending them support br br br election and new president present br br On December a general election was held On January the electoral commission announced opposition candidate F lix Tshisekedi as the winner of the presidential vote and he was officially sworn in as president on January However there were widespread suspicions that the results were rigged and that a deal had been made between Tshisekedi and Kabila The Catholic Church said that the official results did not correspond to the information its election monitors had collected The government had also delayed the vote until March in some areas citing the Ebola outbreak in Kivu as well as the ongoing military conflict This was criticized as these regions are known as opposition strongholds In August six months after the inauguration of F lix Tshisekedi a coalition government was announced br The political allies of Kabila maintained control of key ministries the legislature judiciary and security services However Tshisekedi succeeded in strengthening his hold on power In a series of moves he won over more legislators gaining the support of almost out of members of the National Assembly The pro Kabila speakers of both houses of parliament were forced out In April the new government was formed without the supporters of Kabila br A major measles outbreak in the country left nearly dead in The Ebola outbreak ended in June which had caused deaths over years Another smaller Ebola outbreak in the quateur Province began in June ultimately causing deaths The global COVID pandemic also reached the DRC in March with a vaccination campaign beginning on April br The Italian ambassador to the DRC Luca Attanasio and his bodyguard were killed in North Kivu on February On April meetings between Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and Tshisekedi resulted in new agreements increasing international trade and security counterterrorism immigration cyber security and customs between the two countries In February allegations of a coup d tat in the country led to uncertainty but the coup attempt failed br After the presidential election Tshisekedi had a clear lead in his run for a second term On December officials said that President Felix Tshisekedi had been re elected with of the vote Nine opposition candidates signed a declaration rejecting the election and called for a rerun br In May during a parliamentary crisis related to the election for the leadership of parliament Christian Malanga led an attempted coup which was repelled by security forces loyal to President F lix Tshisekedi Three belligerents reportedly carrying US passports were arrested by security forces and videos of their capture shared online br br br Geography br br The DRC is located in central sub Saharan Africa bordered to the northwest by the Republic of the Congo to the north by the Central African Republic to the northeast by South Sudan to the east by Uganda Rwanda and Burundi and by Tanzania across Lake Tanganyika to the south and southeast by Zambia to the southwest by Angola and to the west by the South Atlantic Ocean and the Cabinda Province exclave of Angola The country lies between latitudes N and S and longitudes E and E It straddles the Equator with one third to the north and two thirds to the south With an area of square kilometres sq mi it is the second largest country in Africa by area after Algeria br As a result of its equatorial location the DRC experiences high precipitation and has the highest frequency of thunderstorms in the world The annual rainfall can total upwards of millimetres in in some places and the area sustains the Congo rainforest the second largest rain forest in the world after the Amazon rainforest This massive expanse of lush jungle covers most of the vast low lying central basin of the river which slopes toward the Atlantic Ocean in the west This area is surrounded by plateaus merging into savannas in the south and southwest by mountainous terraces in the west and dense grasslands extending beyond the Congo River in the north The glaciated Rwenzori Mountains are found in the extreme eastern region br br The tropical climate produced the Congo River system which dominates the region topographically along with the rainforest it flows through The Congo Basin occupies nearly the entire country and an area of nearly km sq mi The river and its tributaries form the backbone of Congolese economics and transportation Major tributaries include the Kasai Sangha Ubangi Ruzizi Aruwimi and Lulonga br br The Congo River has the second largest flow and the second largest watershed of any river in the world trailing the Amazon in both respects The sources of the Congo River are in the Albertine Rift Mountains that flank the western branch of the East African Rift as well as Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru The river flows generally west from Kisangani just below Boyoma Falls then gradually bends southwest passing by Mbandaka joining with the Ubangi River and running into the Pool Malebo Stanley Pool Kinshasa and Brazzaville are on opposite sides of the river at the Pool Then the river narrows and falls through a number of cataracts in deep canyons collectively known as the Livingstone Falls and runs past Boma into the Atlantic Ocean The river and a kilometre wide mi strip of coastline on its north bank provide the country s only outlet to the Atlantic br The Albertine Rift plays a key role in shaping the Congo s geography Not only is the northeastern section of the country much more mountainous but tectonic movement results in volcanic activity occasionally with loss of life The geologic activity in this area also created the African Great Lakes four of which lie on the Congo s eastern frontier Lake Albert Lake Kivu Lake Edward and Lake Tanganyika br The rift valley has exposed an enormous amount of mineral wealth throughout the south and east of the Congo making it accessible to mining Cobalt copper cadmium industrial and gem quality diamonds gold silver zinc manganese tin germanium uranium radium bauxite iron ore and coal are all found in plentiful supply especially in the Congo s southeastern Katanga region br On January Mount Nyiragongo erupted with three streams of extremely fluid lava running out at km h mph and m yd wide One of the three streams flowed directly through Goma killing people and leaving homeless Over people were evacuated from the city during the eruption The lava flowed into and poisoned the water of Lake Kivu killing its plants animals and fish Only two planes left the local airport because of the possibility of the explosion of stored petrol The lava flowed through and past the airport destroying a runway and trapping several parked airplanes Six months after the event nearby Mount Nyamuragira also erupted The mountain subsequently erupted again in and once again in January br br br Biodiversity and conservation br br The rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo contain great biodiversity including many rare and endemic species such as the common chimpanzee and the bonobo or pygmy chimpanzee the African forest elephant mountain gorilla okapi forest buffalo leopard and further south in the country the southern white rhinoceros Five of the country s national parks are listed as World Heritage Sites the Garumba Kahuzi Biega Salonga and Virunga National Parks and the Okapi Wildlife Reserve The Democratic Republic of the Congo is one of Megadiverse countries and is the most biodiverse African country br Conservationists have particularly worried about primates The Congo is inhabited by several great ape species the common chimpanzee Pan troglodytes the bonobo Pan paniscus the eastern gorilla Gorilla beringei and possibly a population of the western gorilla Gorilla gorilla It is the only country in the world in which bonobos are found in the wild Much concern has been raised about great ape extinction Because of hunting and habitat destruction the numbers of chimpanzee bonobo and gorilla each of whose populations once numbered in the millions have now dwindled down to only about gorillas chimpanzees and possibly only about bonobos The gorillas chimpanzee bonobo and okapi are all classified as endangered by the World Conservation Union br Major environmental issues in DRC include deforestation poaching which threatens wildlife populations water pollution and mining From to the rate of deforestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo doubled In deforestation of the Congolian rainforests increased by br br br Government and politics br br After a four year interlude between two constitutions with new political institutions established at the various levels of government as well as new administrative divisions for the provinces throughout the country a new constitution came into effect in and politics in the Democratic Republic of the Congo finally settled into a stable presidential democratic republic br The transitional constitution had established a parliament with a bicameral legislature consisting of a Senate and a National Assembly br The Senate had among other things the charge of drafting the new constitution of the country The executive branch was vested in a member cabinet headed by a President and four vice presidents The President was also the Commander in Chief of the armed forces The transitional constitution also established a relatively independent judiciary headed by a Supreme Court with constitutional interpretation powers br The constitution also known as the Constitution of the Third Republic came into effect in February It had concurrent authority however with the transitional constitution until the inauguration of the elected officials who emerged from the July elections Under the new constitution the legislature remained bicameral the executive was concomitantly undertaken by a President and the government led by a Prime Minister appointed from the party able to secure a majority in the National Assembly br The government not the President is responsible to the Parliament The new constitution also granted new powers to the provincial governments creating provincial parliaments which have oversight of the Governor and the head of the provincial government whom they elect The new constitution also saw the disappearance of the Supreme Court which was divided into three new institutions The constitutional interpretation prerogative of the Supreme Court is now held by the Constitutional Court br Although located in the Central African UN subregion the nation is also economically and regionally affiliated with Southern Africa as a member of the Southern African Development Community SADC br br br Administrative divisions br br The country is currently divided into the city province of Kinshasa and other provinces The provinces are subdivided into territories and cities Before the country had provinces br br br Foreign relations br br The global growth in demand for scarce raw materials and the industrial surges in China India Russia Brazil and other developing countries has led to a resurgence in interference from developed countries Highlighting the DR Congo s importance to United States hegemony the effort to establish an elite Congolese unit is the latest push by the U S to professionalize armed forces in this strategically important region br There are economic and strategic incentives for external countries to bring more security to the Congo which is rich in natural resources such as cobalt a metal used in many industrial and military applications The largest use of cobalt is in superalloys used to make jet engine parts for high speed war planes Cobalt is also used in magnetic alloys and in cutting and wear resistant materials such as cemented carbides The chemical industry consumes significant quantities of cobalt in a variety of applications including catalysts for petroleum and chemical processing drying agents for paints and inks ground coats for porcelain enamels decolorant for ceramics and glass and pigments for ceramics paints and plastics The country possesses of the world s cobalt reserves br It is thought that due to the importance of cobalt for batteries for electric vehicles and stabilization of electric grids with large proportions of intermittent renewables in the electricity mix the DRC could become an object of increased geopolitical competition br In the st century Chinese investment in the DRC and Congolese exports to China have grown rapidly In July UN ambassadors of countries including DRC have signed a joint letter to the UNHRC defending China s treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities In President F lix Tshisekedi called for a review of mining contracts signed with China by his predecessor Joseph Kabila in particular the Sicomines multibillion minerals for infrastructure deal br br br Military br br The military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo known as the FARDC consists of the Land Forces the Air Force and the Navy br The FARDC was established in after the end of the Second Congo War and integrated many former rebel groups into its ranks Due to the presence of undisciplined and poorly trained ex rebels as well as a lack of funding and having spent years fighting against different militias the FARDC suffers from rampant corruption and inefficiency The agreements signed at the end of the Second Congo War called for a new national restructured and integrated army that would be made up of Kabila s government forces the FAC the RCD and the MLC Also stipulated was that rebels like the RCD N RCD ML and the Mai Mai would become part of the new armed forces It also provided for the creation of a Conseil Sup rieur de la D fense Superior Defence Council which would declare states of siege or war and give advice on security sector reform disarmament demobilisation and national defence policy The FARDC is organised on the basis of brigades which are dispersed throughout the provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Congolese troops have been fighting the Kivu conflict in the eastern North Kivu region the Ituri conflict in the Ituri region and other rebellions since the Second Congo War Besides the FARDC the largest peacekeeping mission of the United Nations known as MONUSCO is also present in the country with about peacekeepers br The Democratic Republic of Congo signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons br br br Law enforcement and crime br br The Congolese National Police are the primary police force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo br br br Corruption br br A relative of Mobutu explained how the government illicitly collected revenue

Mining br br The DRC is the world s largest producer of cobalt ore and a major producer of copper and diamonds As of the country is estimated to possess around of the world s cobalt production Diamonds come from Kasa Province in the west By far the largest mines in the DRC are located in southern Katanga Province and are highly mechanized with a capacity of several million tons per year of copper and cobalt ore and refining capability for metal ore The DRC is the second largest diamond producing nation in the world and artisanal and small scale miners account for most of its production br At independence in DRC was the second most industrialized country in Africa after South Africa it boasted a thriving mining sector and a relatively productive agriculture sector Foreign businesses have curtailed operations because of uncertainty about the outcome of long term conflicts lack of infrastructure and the difficult operating environment The wars intensified the impact of such basic problems as an uncertain legal framework corruption inflation and lack of openness in government economic policy and financial operations br Conditions improved in late when a large portion of the

mining However the smaller scale economic activity from artisanal mining occurs in the informal sector and is not reflected in GDP data A third of the DRC s diamonds are believed to be smuggled out of the country making it difficult to quantify diamond production levels In tin was discovered in the east of the country but to date has only been mined on a small scale Smuggling of conflict minerals

The terrain and climate of the Congo Basin present serious barriers to road and rail construction and the distances are enormous across this vast country The DRC has more navigable rivers and moves more passengers and goods by boat and ferry than any other country in Africa but air transport remains the only effective means of moving goods and people between many places within the country

unstable situation in the country and the condition of state structures it is extremely difficult to obtain reliable migration data However evidence suggests that DRC continues to be a destination country for immigrants in spite of recent declines in their numbers Immigration is very diverse in nature refugees and asylum seekers products of the numerous and violent conflicts in the Great Lakes Region constitute an important subset of the population Additionally the country s large mine operations attract migrant workers from Africa and beyond There is also considerable migration for commercial activities from other African countries and the rest of the world but these movements are not well studied Transit migration towards South Africa and Europe also plays a role br Immigration to the DRC has decreased steadily over the past two decades most likely as a result of the armed violence that the country has experienced According to the International Organization for Migration the number of immigrants in the DRC has fallen from just over one million in to in to in to an estimated in Official figures are unavailable partly due to the predominance of the informal economy in the DRC Data are also lacking on irregular immigrants however given neighbouring countries ethnic links to DRC nationals irregular migration is assumed to be a significant phenomenon br Figures for Congolese nationals abroad vary greatly depending on the source from three to six million This discrepancy is due to a lack of official reliable data Emigrants from the DRC are above all long term emigrants the majority of whom live in Africa and to a lesser extent in Europe and respectively according to estimated data New destination countries include South Africa and various points en route to Europe The DRC has produced a considerable number of refugees and asylum seekers located in the region and beyond These numbers peaked in when according to UNHCR there were more than refugees from

the native language of their own ethnic group Lingala was the official language of the Force Publique under Belgian colonial rule and remains to this day the predominant language of the armed forces Since the recent rebellions a good part of the army in the east also uses Swahili where it competes to be the regional lingua franca br Under Belgian rule the Belgians instituted teaching and use of the four national languages in primary schools making it one of the few African nations to have had literacy in local languages during the European colonial period This trend was reversed after independence when French became the sole language of education at all levels Since the four national languages have been reintroduced in the first two years of primary education with French becoming the sole language of education from the third year onward but in practice many primary schools in urban areas solely use French from the first year of school onward br Portuguese is taught in the Congolese schools as a foreign language The lexical similarity and phonology with French makes Portuguese a relatively easy language for the people to learn Most of the roughly Portuguese speakers in the DRC are Angolan and Mozambican expatriates br br br Religion br br Christianity is the predominant religion of the DRC A survey conducted by the Demographic and Health Surveys Program in indicated

secondary students The church owns and manages an extensive network of hospitals schools and clinics as well as many diocesan economic enterprises including farms ranches stores and artisans shops br Sixty two Protestant denominations are federated under the umbrella of the Church of Christ in the Congo It is often referred to as the Protestant Church since it covers most of the DRC Protestants With more than million members it constitutes one of the largest Protestant bodies in the world br Kimbanguism was seen as a threat to the colonial regime and was banned by the Belgians Kimbanguism officially the church of Christ on Earth by the prophet Simon Kimbangu has about three million members primarily among the Bakongo of Kongo Central and Kinshasa br Islam has been present in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since the th century when Arab traders from East Africa pushed into the interior for ivory and slave trading purposes Today Muslims constitute approximately of the

foreign governments the ban was lifted by the end of the s In plans were announced to build a national Bah House of Worship in the country br Traditional religions embody such concepts as monotheism animism vitalism spirit and ancestor worship witchcraft and sorcery and vary widely among ethnic groups The syncretic sects often merge elements of Christianity with traditional beliefs and rituals and are not recognized by mainstream churches as part of Christianity New variants of ancient beliefs have become widespread led by US inspired Pentecostal churches which have been in the forefront of witchcraft accusations particularly against children and the elderly Children accused of witchcraft are sent away from homes and family often to live on the street which can lead to physical violence against these children There are charities supporting street children such as the Congo Children Trust The Congo Children Trust s flagship project is Kimbilio which works to reunite street children in Lubumbashi The usual term for these children is enfants sorciers child witches or enfants dits sorciers children accused of witchcraft Non denominational church organizations have been formed to capitalize on this belief by charging exorbitant fees for exorcisms Though recently outlawed children have been subjected in these exorcisms to often violent abuse at the hands of self proclaimed

ethnic groups and their differing ways of life throughout the country from the mouth of the River Congo on the coast upriver through the rainforest and savanna in its centre to the more densely populated mountains in the far east Since the late th century traditional ways of life have undergone changes brought about by colonialism the struggle for independence the stagnation of the Mobutu era and most recently the First and Second Congo Wars Despite these pressures the customs and cultures of the Congo have retained much of their individuality The country s million inhabitants are mainly rural The who live in urban areas have been the most open to Western influences br br br Literature br Congolese authors use literature as a way to develop a sense of national consciousness amongst the people of the DRC Frederick Kambemba Yamusangie writes literature for the between generations of those who grew up in the Congo during the time when they were colonised fighting for
