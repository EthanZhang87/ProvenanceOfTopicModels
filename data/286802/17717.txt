A locomotive or engine is a rail transport vehicle that provides the motive power for a train If a locomotive is capable of carrying a payload it is usually rather referred to as a multiple unit motor coach railcar or power car the use of these self propelled vehicles is increasingly common for passenger trains but rare for freight trains br Traditionally locomotives pulled trains from the front However push pull operation has become common where the train may have a locomotive or locomotives at the front at the rear or at each end Most recently railroads have begun adopting DPU or distributed power The front may have one or two locomotives followed by a mid train locomotive that is controlled remotely from the lead unit br br br Etymology br The word locomotive originates from the Latin loco from a place ablative of locus place and the Medieval Latin motivus causing motion and is a shortened form of the term locomotive engine which was first used in to distinguish between self propelled and stationary steam engines br br br Classifications br br Prior to locomotives the motive force for railways had been generated by various lower technology methods such as human power horse power gravity or stationary engines that drove cable systems Few such systems are still in existence today Locomotives may generate their power from fuel wood coal petroleum or natural gas or they may take power from an outside source of electricity It is common to classify locomotives by their source of energy The common ones include br br br Steam br br A steam locomotive is a locomotive whose primary power source is a steam engine The most common form of steam locomotive also contains a boiler to generate the steam used by the engine The water in the boiler is heated by burning combustible material usually coal wood or oil to produce steam The steam moves reciprocating pistons which are connected to the locomotive s main wheels known as the driving wheels Both fuel and water supplies are carried with the locomotive either on the locomotive itself in bunkers and tanks this arrangement is known as a tank locomotive or pulled behind the locomotive in tenders this arrangement is known as a tender locomotive br The first full scale working railway steam locomotive was built by Richard Trevithick in It was constructed for the Coalbrookdale ironworks in Shropshire in England though no record of it working there has survived On February the first recorded steam hauled railway journey took place as another of Trevithick s locomotives hauled a train from the Penydarren ironworks in Merthyr Tydfil to Abercynon in South Wales Accompanied by Andrew Vivian it ran with mixed success The design incorporated a number of important innovations including the use of high pressure steam which reduced the weight of the engine and increased its efficiency br In Matthew Murray s twin cylinder rack locomotive Salamanca first ran on the edge railed rack and pinion Middleton Railway this is generally regarded as the first commercially successful locomotive Another well known early locomotive was Puffing Billy built by engineer William Hedley for the Wylam Colliery near Newcastle upon Tyne This locomotive is the oldest preserved and is on static display in the Science Museum London George Stephenson built Locomotion No for the Stockton Darlington Railway in the north east of England which was the first public steam railway in the world In his son Robert built The Rocket in Newcastle upon Tyne Rocket was entered into and won the Rainhill Trials This success led to the company emerging as the pre eminent early builder of steam locomotives used on railways in the UK US and much of Europe The Liverpool Manchester Railway built by Stephenson opened a year later making exclusive use of steam power for passenger and goods trains br The steam locomotive remained by far the most common type of locomotive until after World War II Steam locomotives are less efficient than modern diesel and electric locomotives and a significantly larger workforce is required to operate and service them British Rail figures showed that the cost of crewing and fuelling a steam locomotive was about two and a half times larger than the cost of supporting an equivalent diesel locomotive and the daily mileage they could run was lower Between about and the majority of steam locomotives were retired from commercial service and replaced with electric and diesel electric locomotives While North America transitioned from steam during the s and continental Europe by the s in other parts of the world the transition happened later Steam was a familiar technology that used widely available fuels and in low wage economies did not suffer as wide a cost disparity It continued to be used in many countries until the end of the th century By the end of the th century almost the only steam power remaining in regular use around the world was on heritage railways br br br Internal combustion br br Internal combustion locomotives use an internal combustion engine connected to the driving wheels by a transmission Typically they keep the engine running at a near constant speed whether the locomotive is stationary or moving Internal combustion locomotives are categorised by their fuel type and sub categorised by their transmission type br br br Benzene br Benzene locomotives have an internal combustion engines that use benzene as fuel Between the late s and s a number of commercial manufacturers for Benzene Locomotives had been operating This began with Deutz that produced an operating system based upon a design prototype for a manganese mine in Giessen Following in the early s they had been sold for multiple mining and Tunnelling operations Post the s no wide spread use was necessary or required their inadequacy had increased with the existence of petrol and diesel locomotives br br br Kerosene br br Kerosene locomotives use kerosene as the fuel They were the world s first internal combustion locomotives preceding diesel and other oil locomotives by some years The first known kerosene rail vehicle was a draisine built by Gottlieb Daimler in but this was not technically a locomotive as it carried a payload br A kerosene locomotive was built in by the Priestman Brothers of Kingston upon Hull for use on Hull docks This locomotive was built using a hp double acting marine type engine running at rpm mounted on a wheel wagon chassis It was only able to haul one loaded wagon at a time due to its low power output and was not a great success The first successful kerosene locomotive was Lachesis built by Richard Hornsby Sons and delivered to Woolwich Arsenal Railway in The company built four kerosene locomotives between and for use at the Arsenal br br br Petrol br br Petrol locomotives US gasoline locomotives use petrol gasoline as their fuel The first commercially successful petrol locomotive was a petrol mechanical locomotive built by the Maudslay Motor Company in for the Deptford Cattle Market in London It was an hp locomotive using a cylinder vertical petrol engine with a two speed mechanical gearbox br br br Petrol mechanical br br The most common type of petrol locomotive are petrol mechanical locomotives which use mechanical transmission in the form of gearboxes sometimes in conjunction with chain drives to deliver the power output of the engine to the driving wheels in the same way as a car The second petrol mechanical locomotive was built by F C Blake of Kew in January for the Richmond Main Sewerage Board br br br Petrol electric br br Petrol electric locomotives are petrol locomotives which use electric transmission to deliver the power output of the engine to the driving wheels This avoids the need for gearboxes by converting the rotary mechanical force of the engine into electrical energy by a dynamo and then powering the wheels by multi speed electric traction motors This allows for smoother acceleration It avoids the need for gear changes However it is more expensive heavier and sometimes bulkier than mechanical transmissions br A notable early petrol electric locomotive was built in for the Minneapolis St Paul Rochester and Dubuque Electric Traction Company It weighed tons generated hp and drove through a pair of bogies in a Bo Bo arrangement br br br Diesel br br Diesel locomotives are powered by diesel engines In the early days of diesel propulsion development various transmission systems were employed with varying degrees of success with electric transmission proving to be the most popular br br br Diesel mechanical br br A diesel mechanical locomotive uses mechanical transmission to transfer power to the wheels This type of transmission is generally limited to low powered low speed shunting switching locomotives lightweight multiple units and self propelled railcars The earliest diesel locomotives were diesel mechanical In Rudolf Diesel Adolf Klose and the steam and diesel engine manufacturer Gebr der Sulzer founded Diesel Sulzer Klose GmbH to manufacture diesel powered locomotives The Prussian State Railways ordered a diesel locomotive from the company in The world s first diesel powered locomotive a diesel mechanical locomotive was operated in the summer of on the Winterthur Romanshorn railway in Switzerland but was not a commercial success Small numbers of prototype diesel locomotives were produced in a number of countries through the mid s br br br Diesel electric br br Diesel electric locomotives are diesel locomotives using electric transmission The diesel engine drives either an electrical DC generator generally less than horsepower kW net for traction or an electrical AC alternator rectifier generally horsepower kW net or more for traction the output of which provides power to the traction motors that drive the locomotive There is no mechanical connection between the diesel engine and the wheels The vast majority of diesel locomotives today are diesel electric br In Hermann Lemp a General Electric electrical engineer developed and patented a reliable direct current electrical control system subsequent improvements were also patented by Lemp Lemp s design used a single lever to control both engine and generator in a coordinated fashion and was the prototype for all diesel electric locomotive control In GE produced three experimental diesel electric locomotives using Lemp s control design In a diesel electric locomotive Eel original number Yu e started operations It had been designed by a team led by Yury Lomonosov and built by Maschinenfabrik Esslingen in Germany It had driving axles E After several test rides it hauled trains for almost three decades from to br br br Diesel hydraulic br br Diesel hydraulic locomotives are diesel locomotives using hydraulic transmission In this arrangement they use one or more torque converters in combination with gears with a mechanical final drive to convey the power from the diesel engine to the wheels br The main worldwide user of main line hydraulic transmission locomotives was Deutsche Bundesbahn with designs including the DB Class V and the DB V family British Rail introduced a number of diesel hydraulic designs during its Modernisation Plan initially licence built versions of German designs In Spain Renfe used high power to weight ratio twin engined German designs to haul high speed trains from the s to s see Renfe Classes br Hydrostatic drive systems have also been applied to rail use for example to hp to kW shunting locomotives by CMI Group Belgium Hydrostatic drives are also used in railway maintenance machines such as tampers and rail grinders br br br Gas turbine br br A gas turbine locomotive is an internal combustion engine locomotive consisting of a gas turbine ICE engines require a transmission to power the wheels The engine must be allowed to continue to run when the locomotive is stopped br Gas turbine mechanical locomotives use a mechanical transmission to deliver the power output of gas turbines to the wheels A gas turbine locomotive was patented in by Marc Antoine Francois Mennons British patent no There is no evidence that the locomotive was actually built but the design includes the essential features of gas turbine locomotives including compressor combustion chamber turbine and air pre heater In Renault delivered a prototype four axle hp gas turbine mechanical locomotive fitted with the Pescara free turbine gas and compressed air producing system rather than a co axial multi stage compressor integral to the turbine This model was succeeded by a pair of six axle hp locomotives with two turbines and Pescara feeds in Several similar locomotives were built in USSR by Kharkov Locomotive Works br Gas turbine electric locomotives use a gas turbine to drive an electrical generator or alternator which produced electric current powers the traction motor which drive the wheels In the Swiss Federal Railways ordered Am a GTEL with a kW hp of maximum engine power from Brown Boveri It was completed in and then underwent testing before entering regular service The Am was the first gas turbine electric locomotive British Rail was built by Brown Boveri and delivered in British Rail was built by Metropolitan Vickers and delivered in A third locomotive the British Rail GT was constructed in Union Pacific ran a large fleet of turbine powered freight locomotives starting in the s These were widely used on long haul routes and were cost effective despite their poor fuel economy due to their use of leftover fuels from the petroleum industry At their height the railroad estimated that they powered about of Union Pacific s freight trains a much wider use than any other example of this class br A gas turbine offers some advantages over a piston engine There are few moving parts decreasing the need for lubrication and potentially reducing maintenance costs and the power to weight ratio is much higher A turbine of a given power output is also physically smaller than an equally powerful piston engine allowing a locomotive to be very powerful without being inordinately large However a turbine s power output and efficiency both drop dramatically with rotational speed unlike a piston engine which has a comparatively flat power curve This makes GTEL systems useful primarily for long distance high speed runs Additional problems with gas turbine electric locomotives included that they were very noisy br br br Wood Gas Generation br Some locomotives usually in France and Italy ran on a Wood gas generator br br br Electric br br An electric locomotive is a locomotive powered only by electricity Electricity is supplied to moving trains with a nearly continuous conductor running along the track that usually takes one of three forms an overhead line suspended from poles or towers along the track or from structure or tunnel ceilings a third rail mounted at track level or an onboard battery Both overhead wire and third rail systems usually use the running rails as the return conductor but some systems use a separate fourth rail for this purpose The type of electrical power used is either direct current DC or alternating current AC br br Various collection methods exist a trolley pole which is a long flexible pole that engages the line with a wheel or shoe a bow collector which is a frame that holds a long collecting rod against the wire a pantograph which is a hinged frame that holds the collecting shoes against the wire in a fixed geometry or a contact shoe which is a shoe in contact with the third rail Of the three the pantograph method is best suited for high speed operation br Electric locomotives almost universally use axle hung traction motors with one motor for each powered axle In this arrangement one side of the motor housing is supported by plain bearings riding on a ground and polished journal that is integral to the axle The other side of the housing has a tongue shaped protuberance that engages a matching slot in the truck bogie bolster its purpose being to act as a torque reaction device as well as a support Power transfer from motor to axle is effected by spur gearing in which a pinion on the motor shaft engages a bull gear on the axle Both gears are enclosed in a liquid tight housing containing lubricating oil The type of service in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed Numerically high ratios are commonly found on freight units whereas numerically low ratios are typical of passenger engines br Electricity is typically generated in large and relatively efficient generating stations transmitted to the railway network and distributed to the trains Some electric railways have their own dedicated generating stations and transmission lines but most purchase power from an electric utility The railway usually provides its own distribution lines switches and transformers br Electric locomotives usually cost less than diesel locomotives their maintenance costs are lower and cost up to less to run br br br Direct current br br The earliest systems were DC systems The first electric passenger train was presented by Werner von Siemens at Berlin in The locomotive was driven by a kW series wound motor and the train consisting of the locomotive and three cars reached a speed of km h During four months the train carried passengers on a metre long feet circular track The electricity V DC was supplied through a third insulated rail between the tracks A contact roller was used to collect the electricity The world s first electric tram line opened in Lichterfelde near Berlin Germany in It was built by Werner von Siemens see Gross Lichterfelde Tramway and Berlin Stra enbahn The Volk s Electric Railway opened in in Brighton and is the oldest surviving electric railway Also in M dling and Hinterbr hl Tram opened near Vienna in Austria It was the first in the world in regular service powered from an overhead line Five years later in the U S electric trolleys were pioneered in on the Richmond Union Passenger Railway using equipment designed by Frank J Sprague br The first electrically worked underground line was the City South London Railway prompted by a clause in its enabling act prohibiting use of steam power It opened in using electric locomotives built by Mather Platt Electricity quickly became the power supply of choice for subways abetted by the Sprague s invention of multiple unit train control in br The first use of electrification on a main line was on a four mile stretch of the Baltimore Belt Line of the Baltimore Ohio B O in connecting the main portion of the B O to the new line to New York through a series of tunnels around the edges of Baltimore s downtown Three Bo Bo units were initially used at the south end of the electrified section they coupled onto the locomotive and train and pulled it through the tunnels br DC was used on earlier systems These systems were gradually replaced by AC Today almost all main line railways use AC systems DC systems are confined mostly to urban transit such as metro systems light rail and trams where power requirement is less br br br Alternating current br br The first practical AC electric locomotive was designed by Charles Brown then working for Oerlikon Z rich In Brown had demonstrated long distance power transmission using three phase AC between a hydro electric plant at Lauffen am Neckar and Frankfurt am Main West a distance of km Using experience he had gained while working for Jean Heilmann on steam electric locomotive designs Brown observed that three phase motors had a higher power to weight ratio than DC motors and because of the absence of a commutator were simpler to manufacture and maintain However they were much larger than the DC motors of the time and could not be mounted in underfloor bogies they could only be carried within locomotive bodies br In Hungarian engineer K lm n Kand developed a new type phase asynchronous electric drive motors and generators for electric locomotives br Kand s early designs were first applied in a short three phase AC tramway in Evian les Bains France which was constructed between and In Kand invented and developed the rotary phase converter enabling electric locomotives to use three phase motors whilst supplied via a single overhead wire carrying the simple industrial frequency Hz single phase AC of the high voltage national networks br In Oerlikon installed the first commercial example of the system on the Lugano Tramway Each tonne locomotive had two kW hp motors run by three phase V Hz fed from double overhead lines Three phase motors run at constant speed and provide regenerative braking and are well suited to steeply graded routes and the first main line three phase locomotives were supplied by Brown by then in partnership with Walter Boveri in on the km Burgdorf Thun line Switzerland The first implementation of industrial frequency single phase AC supply for locomotives came from Oerlikon in using the designs of Hans Behn Eschenburg and Emil Huber Stockar installation on the Seebach Wettingen line of the Swiss Federal Railways was completed in The kV Hz kW hp tonne locomotives used transformers and rotary converters to power DC traction motors br Italian railways were the first in the world to introduce electric traction for the entire length of a main line rather than just a short stretch The km Valtellina line was opened on September designed by Kand and a team from the Ganz works The electrical system was three phase at kV Hz The voltage was significantly higher than used earlier and it required new designs for electric motors and switching devices The three phase two wire system was used on several railways in Northern Italy and became known as the Italian system Kand was invited in to undertake the management of Societ Italiana Westinghouse and led the development of several Italian electric locomotives br br br Battery electric br br A battery electric locomotive or battery locomotive is an electric locomotive powered by onboard batteries a kind of battery electric vehicle br Such locomotives are used where a conventional diesel or electric locomotive would be unsuitable An example is maintenance trains on electrified lines when the electricity supply is turned off Another use is in industrial facilities where a combustion powered locomotive i e steam or diesel powered could cause a safety issue due to the risks of fire explosion or fumes in a confined space Battery locomotives are preferred for mines where gas could be ignited by trolley powered units arcing at the collection shoes or where electrical resistance could develop in the supply or return circuits especially at rail joints and allow dangerous current leakage into the ground Battery locomotives in over the road service can recharge while absorbing dynamic braking energy br The first known electric locomotive was built in by chemist Robert Davidson of Aberdeen and it was powered by galvanic cells batteries Davidson later built a larger locomotive named Galvani exhibited at the Royal Scottish Society of Arts Exhibition in The seven ton vehicle had two direct drive reluctance motors with fixed electromagnets acting on iron bars attached to a wooden cylinder on each axle and simple commutators It hauled a load of six tons at four miles per hour kilometers per hour for a distance of one and a half miles kilometres It was tested on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in September of the following year but the limited power from batteries prevented its general use br Another example was at the Kennecott Copper Mine Latouche Alaska where in the underground haulage ways were widened to enable working by two battery locomotives of tons In Kennecott Copper ordered four series electric locomotives with on board batteries These locomotives weighed tons and operated on volt overhead trolley wire with considerable further range whilst running on batteries The locomotives provided several decades of service using Nickel iron battery Edison technology The batteries were replaced with lead acid batteries and the locomotives were retired shortly afterward All four locomotives were donated to museums but one was scrapped The others can be seen at the Boone and Scenic Valley Railroad Iowa and at the Western Railway Museum in Rio Vista California The Toronto Transit Commission previously operated a battery electric locomotive built by Nippon Sharyo in and retired in br London Underground regularly operates battery electric locomotives for general maintenance work br br br Other types br br br Fireless br br br Atomic electric br In the early s Lyle Borst of the University of Utah was given funding by various US railroad line and manufacturers to study the feasibility of an electric drive locomotive in which an onboard atomic reactor produced the steam to generate the electricity At that time atomic power was not fully understood Borst believed the major stumbling block was the price of uranium With the Borst atomic locomotive the center section would have a ton reactor chamber and steel walls feet thick to prevent releases of radioactivity in case of accidents He estimated a cost to manufacture atomic locomotives with h p engines at approximately each Consequently trains with onboard nuclear generators were generally deemed unfeasible due to prohibitive costs br br br Fuel cell electric br br In the first tonne kW hydrogen fuel cell powered mining locomotive was demonstrated in Val d Or Quebec In the educational mini hydrail in Kaohsiung Taiwan went into service The Railpower GG B finally is another example of a fuel cell electric locomotive br br br Hybrid locomotives br br There are many different types of hybrid or dual mode locomotives using two or more types of motive power The most common hybrids are electro diesel locomotives powered either from an electricity supply or else by an onboard diesel engine These are used to provide continuous journeys along routes that are only partly electrified Examples include the EMD FL and Bombardier ALP DP br br br Use br There are three main uses of locomotives in rail transport operations for hauling passenger trains freight trains and for switching UK English shunting br Freight locomotives are normally designed to deliver high starting tractive effort and high sustained power This allows them to start and move long heavy trains but usually comes at the cost of relatively low maximum speeds Passenger locomotives usually develop lower starting tractive effort but are able to operate at the high speeds required to maintain passenger schedules Mixed traffic locomotives US English general purpose or road switcher locomotives meant for both passenger and freight trains do not develop as much starting tractive effort as a freight locomotive but are able to haul heavier trains than a passenger locomotive br Most steam locomotives have reciprocating engines with pistons coupled to the driving wheels by means of connecting rods with no intervening gearbox This means the combination of starting tractive effort and maximum speed is greatly influenced by the diameter of the driving wheels Steam locomotives intended for freight service generally have smaller diameter driving wheels than passenger locomotives br In diesel electric and electric locomotives the control system between the traction motors and axles adapts the power output to the rails for freight or passenger service Passenger locomotives may include other features such as head end power also referred to as hotel power or electric train supply or a steam generator br Some locomotives are designed specifically to work steep grade railways and feature extensive additional braking mechanisms and sometimes rack and pinion Steam locomotives built for steep rack and pinion railways frequently have the boiler tilted relative to the locomotive frame so that the boiler remains roughly level on steep grades br Locomotives are also used on some high speed trains Some of them are operated in push pull formation with trailer control cars at another end of a train which often have a cabin with the same design as a cabin of locomotive examples of such trains with conventional locomotives are Railjet and Intercity br Also many high speed trains including all TGV many Talgo Avril XXI some Korea Train Express ICE ICE and Intercity use dedicated power cars which do not have places for passengers and technically are special single ended locomotives The difference from conventional locomotives is that these power cars are integral part of a train and are not adapted for operation with any other types of passenger coaches On the other hand many high speed trains such as the Shinkansen network never use locomotives Instead of locomotive like power cars they use electric multiple units EMUs or diesel multiple units DMUs passenger cars that also have traction motors and power equipment Using dedicated locomotive like power cars allows for a high ride quality and less electrical equipment br but EMUs have less axle weight which reduces maintenance costs and EMUs also have higher acceleration and higher seating capacity br Also some trains including TGV PSE TGV TMST and TGV V use both non passenger power cars and additional passenger motor cars br br br Operational role br Locomotives occasionally work in a specific role such as br br Train engine is the technical name for a locomotive attached to the front of a railway train to haul that train Alternatively where facilities exist for push pull operation the train engine might be attached to the rear of the train br Pilot engine a locomotive attached in front of the train engine to enable double heading br Banking engine a locomotive temporarily assisting a train from the rear due to a difficult start or a sharp incline gradient br Light engine a locomotive operating without a train behind it for relocation or operational reasons Occasionally a light engine is referred to as a train in and of itself br Station pilot a locomotive used to shunt passenger trains at a railway station br br br Wheel arrangement br br The wheel arrangement of a locomotive describes how many wheels it has common methods include the AAR wheel arrangement UIC classification and Whyte notation systems br br br Remote control locomotives br br In the second half of the twentieth century remote control locomotives started to enter service in switching operations being remotely controlled by an operator outside of the locomotive cab br The main benefit is one operator can control the loading of grain coal gravel etc into the cars In addition the same operator can move the train as needed Thus the locomotive is loaded or unloaded in about a third of the time br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br Bibliography br br br External links br Media related to Locomotives at
