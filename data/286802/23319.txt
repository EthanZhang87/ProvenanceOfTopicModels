Palladium is a chemical element it has symbol Pd and atomic number It is a rare and lustrous silvery white metal discovered in by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston He named it after the asteroid Pallas which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena acquired by her when she slew Pallas Palladium platinum rhodium ruthenium iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals PGMs They have similar chemical properties but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them br More than half the supply of palladium and its congener platinum is used in catalytic converters which convert as much as of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust hydrocarbons carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide into nontoxic substances nitrogen carbon dioxide and water vapor Palladium is also used in electronics dentistry medicine hydrogen purification chemical applications groundwater treatment and jewelry Palladium is a key component of fuel cells in which hydrogen and oxygen react to produce electricity heat and water br Ore deposits of palladium and other PGMs are rare The most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the Bushveld Igneous Complex covering the Transvaal Basin in South Africa the Stillwater Complex in Montana United States the Sudbury Basin and Thunder Bay District of Ontario Canada and the Norilsk Complex in Russia Recycling is also a source mostly from scrapped catalytic converters The numerous applications and limited supply sources result in considerable investment interest br br br Characteristics br Palladium belongs to group in the periodic table but the configuration in the outermost electrons is in accordance with Hund s rule Electrons that by the Madelung rule would be expected to occupy the s instead fill the d orbitals as it is more energetically favorable to have a completely filled d shell instead of the s d configuration br br This s configuration unique in period makes palladium the heaviest element having only one incomplete electron shell with all shells above it empty br Palladium has the appearance of a soft silver white metal that resembles platinum It is the least dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals It is soft and ductile when annealed and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold worked Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid in hot concentrated sulfuric acid and when finely ground in hydrochloric acid It dissolves readily at room temperature in aqua regia br Palladium does not react with oxygen at standard temperature and thus does not tarnish in air Palladium heated to C will produce a layer of palladium II oxide PdO It may slowly develop a slight brownish coloration over time likely due to the formation of a surface layer of its monoxide br Palladium films with defects produced by alpha particle bombardment at low temperature exhibit superconductivity having Tc K br br br Isotopes br br Naturally occurring palladium is composed of seven isotopes six of which are stable The most stable radioisotopes are Pd with a half life of million years found in nature Pd with days and Pd with days Eighteen other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from u Pd to u Pd These have half lives of less than thirty minutes except Pd half life hours Pd half life hours and Pd half life hours br For isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the most abundant stable isotope Pd the primary decay mode is electron capture with the primary decay product being rhodium The primary mode of decay for those isotopes of Pd with atomic mass greater than is beta decay with the primary product of this decay being silver br Radiogenic Ag is a decay product of Pd and was first discovered in in the Santa Clara meteorite of The discoverers suggest that the coalescence and differentiation of iron cored small planets may have occurred million years after a nucleosynthetic event Pd versus Ag correlations observed in bodies which have been melted since accretion of the Solar System must reflect the presence of short lived nuclides in the early Solar System Pd is also produced as a fission product in spontaneous or induced fission of U As it is not very mobile in the environment and has a relatively low decay energy Pd is usually considered to be among the less concerning of the long lived fission products br br br Compounds br br Palladium compounds exist primarily in the and oxidation state Other less common states are also recognized Generally the compounds of palladium are more similar to those of platinum than those of any other element br br br br br br br br br br br br Palladium II br Palladium II chloride is the principal starting material for other palladium compounds It arises by the reaction of palladium with chlorine It is used to prepare heterogeneous palladium catalysts such as palladium on barium sulfate palladium on carbon and palladium chloride on carbon Solutions of PdCl in nitric acid react with acetic acid to give palladium II acetate also a versatile reagent PdCl reacts with ligands L to give square planar complexes of the type PdCl L One example of such complexes is the benzonitrile derivative PdCl PhCN br br PdCl L PdCl L L PhCN PPh NH etc br The complex bis triphenylphosphine palladium II dichloride is a useful catalyst br br br Palladium br Palladium forms a range of zerovalent complexes with the formula PdL PdL and PdL For example reduction of a mixture of PdCl PPh and PPh gives tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium br br PdCl PPh PPh N H Pd PPh N N H Cl br Another major palladium complex tris dibenzylideneacetone dipalladium Pd dba is prepared by reducing sodium tetrachloropalladate in the presence of dibenzylideneacetone br Palladium as well as palladium II are catalysts in coupling reactions as has been recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Richard F Heck Ei ichi Negishi and Akira Suzuki Such reactions are widely practiced for the synthesis of fine chemicals Prominent coupling reactions include the Heck Suzuki Sonogashira coupling Stille reactions and the Kumada coupling Palladium II acetate tetrakis triphenylphosphine palladium Pd PPh and tris dibenzylideneacetone dipalladium Pd dba serve either as catalysts or precatalysts br br br Other oxidation states br Although Pd IV compounds are comparatively rare one example is sodium hexachloropalladate IV Na PdCl A few compounds of palladium III are also known Palladium VI was claimed in but subsequently disproven br Mixed valence palladium complexes exist e g Pd CO OAc Pd acac forms an infinite Pd chain structure with alternatively interconnected Pd CO OAc and Pd acac units br When alloyed with a more electropositive element palladium can acquire a negative charge Such compounds are known as palladides such as gallium palladide Palladides with the stoichiometry RPd exist where R is scandium yttrium or any of the lanthanides br br br Occurrence br br As overall mine production of palladium reached kilograms in Russia was the top producer with kilograms followed by South Africa Canada the U S and Zimbabwe Russia s company Norilsk Nickel ranks first among the largest palladium producers globally accounting for of the world s production br Palladium can be found as a free metal alloyed with gold and other platinum group metals in placer deposits of the Ural Mountains Australia Ethiopia North and South America For the production of palladium these deposits play only a minor role The most important commercial sources are nickel copper deposits found in the Sudbury Basin Ontario and the Norilsk Talnakh deposits in Siberia The other large deposit is the Merensky Reef platinum group metals deposit within the Bushveld Igneous Complex South Africa The Stillwater igneous complex of Montana and the Roby zone ore body of the Lac des les igneous complex of Ontario are the two other sources of palladium in Canada and the United States Palladium is found in the rare minerals cooperite and polarite Many more Pd minerals are known but all of them are very rare br Palladium is also produced in nuclear fission reactors and can be extracted from spent nuclear fuel see synthesis of precious metals though this source for palladium is not used None of the existing nuclear reprocessing facilities are equipped to extract palladium from the high level radioactive waste A complication for the recovery of palladium in spent fuel is the presence of Pd a slightly radioactive long lived fission product Depending on end use the radioactivity contributed by the Pd might make the recovered palladium unusable without a costly step of isotope separation br br br Applications br br The largest use of palladium today is in catalytic converters Palladium is also used in jewelry dentistry watch making blood sugar test strips aircraft spark plugs surgical instruments and electrical contacts Palladium is also used to make some professional transverse concert or classical flutes As a commodity palladium bullion has ISO currency codes of XPD and Palladium is one of only four metals to have such codes the others being gold silver and platinum Because it adsorbs hydrogen palladium was a key component of the controversial cold fusion experiments of the late s br br br Catalysis br br When it is finely divided as with palladium on carbon palladium forms a versatile catalyst it speeds heterogeneous catalytic processes like hydrogenation dehydrogenation and petroleum cracking Palladium is also essential to the Lindlar catalyst also called Lindlar s Palladium A large number of carbon carbon bonding reactions in organic chemistry are facilitated by palladium compound catalysts For example br br Heck reaction br Suzuki coupling br Tsuji Trost reactions br Wacker process br Negishi reaction br Stille coupling br Sonogashira coupling br When dispersed on conductive materials palladium is an excellent electrocatalyst for oxidation of primary alcohols in alkaline media Palladium is also a versatile metal for homogeneous catalysis used in combination with a broad variety of ligands for highly selective chemical transformations br In the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for palladium catalyzed cross couplings in organic synthesis to Richard F Heck Ei ichi Negishi and Akira Suzuki A study showed that palladium is an effective catalyst for carbon fluorine bonds br br Palladium catalysis is primarily employed in organic chemistry and industrial applications although its use is growing as a tool for synthetic biology in effective in vivo catalytic activity of palladium nanoparticles was demonstrated in mammals to treat disease br br br Electronics br The primary application of palladium in electronics is in multi layer ceramic capacitors in which palladium and palladium silver alloy is used for electrodes Palladium sometimes alloyed with nickel is or can be used for component and connector plating in consumer electronics and in soldering materials The electronic sector consumed tonnes million troy ounces of palladium in according to a Johnson Matthey report br br br Technology br Hydrogen easily diffuses through heated palladium and membrane reactors with Pd membranes are used in the production of high purity hydrogen Palladium is used in palladium hydrogen electrodes in electrochemical studies Palladium II chloride readily catalyzes carbon monoxide gas to carbon dioxide and is useful in carbon monoxide detectors br br br Hydrogen storage br br Palladium readily adsorbs hydrogen at room temperatures forming palladium hydride PdHx with x less than While this property is common to many transition metals palladium has a uniquely high absorption capacity and does not lose its ductility until x approaches This property has been investigated in designing an efficient and safe hydrogen fuel storage medium though palladium itself is currently prohibitively expensive for this purpose The content of hydrogen in palladium can be linked to magnetic susceptibility which decreases with the increase of hydrogen and becomes zero for PdH At any higher ratio the solid solution becomes diamagnetic br Palladium is used for purification of hydrogen on a laboratory but not industrial scale br br br Dentistry br Palladium is used in small amounts about in some alloys of dental amalgam to decrease corrosion and increase the metallic lustre of the final restoration br br br Jewelry br Palladium has been used as a precious metal in jewelry since as an alternative to platinum in the alloys called white gold where the naturally white color of palladium does not require rhodium plating Palladium being much less dense than platinum is similar to gold in that it can be beaten into leaf as thin as nm in Unlike platinum palladium may discolor at temperatures above C F due to oxidation making it more brittle and thus less suitable for use in jewelry to prevent this palladium intended for jewelry is heated under controlled conditions br Prior to the principal use of palladium in jewelry was the manufacture of white gold Palladium is one of the three most popular alloying metals in white gold nickel and silver can also be used Palladium gold is more expensive than nickel gold but seldom causes allergic reactions though certain cross allergies with nickel may occur br When platinum became a strategic resource during World War II many jewelry bands were made out of palladium Palladium was little used in jewelry because of the technical difficulty of casting With the casting problem resolved the use of palladium in jewelry increased originally because platinum increased in price while the price of palladium decreased In early when gold and platinum prices rose steeply China began fabricating volumes of palladium jewelry consuming tonnes in Subsequent changes in the relative price of platinum lowered demand for palladium to tonnes in Demand for palladium as a catalyst has increased the price of palladium to about higher than that of platinum in January br In January hallmarks for palladium were introduced by assay offices in the United Kingdom and hallmarking became mandatory for all jewelry advertising pure or alloyed palladium Articles can be marked as or parts of palladium per thousand of the alloy br Fountain pen nibs made from gold are sometimes plated with palladium when a silver rather than gold appearance is desired Sheaffer has used palladium plating for decades either as an accent on otherwise gold nibs or covering the gold completely br Palladium is also used by the luxury brand Herm s as one of the metals plating the hardware on their handbags most famous of which being Birkin br br br Photography br In the platinotype printing process photographers make fine art black and white prints using platinum or palladium salts Often used with platinum palladium provides an alternative to silver br br br Effects on health br br br Toxicity br br Palladium is a metal with low toxicity as conventionally measured e g LD Recent research on the mechanism of palladium toxicity suggests high toxicity if measured on a longer timeframe and at the cellular level in the liver and kidney Mitochondria appear to have a key role in palladium toxicity via mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and depletion of the cellular glutathione GSH level Until that recent work it had been thought that palladium was poorly absorbed by the human body when ingested Plants such as the water hyacinth are killed by low levels of palladium salts but most other plants tolerate it although tests show that at levels above growth is affected High doses of palladium could be poisonous tests on rodents suggest it may be carcinogenic though until the recent research cited above no clear evidence indicated that the element harms humans br br br Precautions br Like other platinum group metals bulk Pd is quite inert Although contact dermatitis has been reported data on the effects are limited It has been shown that people with an allergic reaction to palladium also react to nickel making it advisable to avoid the use of dental alloys containing palladium on those so allergic br Some palladium is emitted with the exhaust gases of cars with catalytic converters Between and ng km of palladium particulate is released by such cars while the total uptake from food is estimated to be less than g per person a day The second possible source of palladium is dental restoration from which the uptake of palladium is estimated to be less than g per person per day People working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably greater uptake For soluble compounds such as palladium chloride is eliminated from the body within three days br The median lethal dose LD of soluble palladium compounds in mice is mg kg for oral and mg kg for intravenous administration br br br History br br William Hyde Wollaston noted the discovery of a new noble metal in July in his lab book and named it palladium in August of the same year Wollaston purified a quantity of the material and offered it without naming the discoverer in a small shop in Soho in April After harsh criticism from Richard Chenevix who claimed that palladium was an alloy of platinum and mercury Wollaston anonymously offered a reward of for grains of synthetic palladium alloy Chenevix received the Copley Medal in after he published his experiments on palladium Wollaston published the discovery of rhodium in and mentions some of his work on palladium He disclosed that he was the discoverer of palladium in a publication in br It was named by Wollaston in after the asteroid Pallas which had been discovered two months earlier Wollaston found palladium in crude platinum ore from South America by dissolving the ore in aqua regia neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide and precipitating platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate with ammonium chloride He added mercuric cyanide to form the compound palladium II cyanide which was heated to extract palladium metal br Palladium chloride was at one time prescribed as a tuberculosis treatment at the rate of g per day approximately one milligram per kilogram of body weight This treatment had many negative side effects and was later replaced by more effective drugs br Most palladium is used for catalytic converters in the automobile industry Catalytic converters are targets for thieves because they contain palladium and other rare metals In the run up to year the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted for political reasons the export quota was not granted on time The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all time high of per troy ounce g in January Around that time the Ford Motor Company fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage stockpiled the metal When prices fell in early Ford lost nearly US billion br World demand for palladium increased from tons in to nearly tons in The global production of palladium from mines was tonnes in according to the United States Geological Survey Many were concerned about a steady supply of palladium in the wake of Russia s annexation of Crimea partly as sanctions could hamper Russian palladium exports any restrictions on Russian palladium exports could have exacerbated what was already expected to be a large palladium deficit in Those concerns pushed palladium prices to their highest level since In September they soared above the per ounce mark In however palladium cost around per ounce as Russia managed to maintain stable supplies In January palladium futures climbed past per ounce for the first time on record mainly due to the strong demand from the automotive industry Palladium reached per troy ounce g on January passing per troy ounce the first time The price rose above per troy ounce in May and March br br br Palladium as investment br br Global palladium sales were million troy ounces t in of which was used in the manufacturing of automotive catalytic converters followed by industrial jewelry and investment usages More than of global platinum and of palladium are mined in South Africa Russia s mining company Norilsk Nickel produces another of palladium with US and Canada based mines producing most of the rest br The price for palladium reached an all time high of per ounce on May driven mainly on speculation of the catalytic converter demand from the automobile industry Palladium is traded in the spot market with the code XPD When settled in USD the code is XPDUSD A later surplus of the metal was caused by the Russian government selling stockpiles from the Soviet era at a rate of about to million troy ounces to t a year The amount and status of this stockpile are a state secret br During the Russo Ukrainian War in March prices for palladium increased since the first of March Russia is the primary supplier to Europe and the country supplies of the global production br br br Palladium producers br Norilsk Nickel br Sibanye Stillwater br Anglo American Platinum br Impala Platinum br Northam Platinum br br br
