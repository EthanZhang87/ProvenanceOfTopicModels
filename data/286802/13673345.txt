A car or an automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on roads seat one to eight people have four wheels and mainly transport people over cargo br The French inventor Nicolas Joseph Cugnot built the first steam powered road vehicle in while the Swiss inventor Fran ois Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion powered automobile in The modern car a practical marketable automobile for everyday use was invented in when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent Motorwagen Commercial cars became widely available during the th century One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the Ford Model T begun in an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company Cars were rapidly adopted in the US where they replaced horse drawn carriages In Europe and other parts of the world demand for automobiles did not increase until after World War II The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy br Cars have controls for driving parking passenger comfort and a variety of lamps Over the decades additional features and controls have been added to vehicles making them progressively more complex These include rear reversing cameras air conditioning navigation systems and in car entertainment Most cars in use in the early s are propelled by an internal combustion engine fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels Electric cars which were invented early in the history of the car became commercially available in the s and are predicted to cost less to buy than petrol driven cars before The transition from fossil fuel powered cars to electric cars features prominently in most climate change mitigation scenarios such as Project Drawdown s actionable solutions for climate change br There are costs and benefits to car use The costs to the individual include acquiring the vehicle interest payments if the car is financed repairs and maintenance fuel depreciation driving time parking fees taxes and insurance The costs to society include maintaining roads land use road congestion air pollution noise pollution public health and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury related deaths worldwide Personal benefits include on demand transportation mobility independence and convenience Societal benefits include economic benefits such as job and wealth creation from the automotive industry transportation provision societal well being from leisure and travel opportunities and the generation of revenue from taxation People s ability to move flexibly from place to place has far reaching implications for the nature of societies There are around one billion cars in use worldwide Car usage is increasing rapidly especially in China India and other newly industrialised countries br br br Etymology br The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus carrum wheeled vehicle or via Old North French Middle English carre two wheeled cart both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros chariot It originally referred to any wheeled horse drawn vehicle such as a cart carriage or wagon br Motor car attested from is the usual formal term in British English Autocar a variant likewise attested from and literally meaning self propelled car is now considered archaic Horseless carriage is attested from br Automobile a classical compound derived from Ancient Greek aut s self and Latin mobilis movable entered English from French and was first adopted by the Automobile Club of Great Britain in It fell out of favour in Britain and is now used chiefly in North America where the abbreviated form auto commonly appears as an adjective in compound formations like auto industry and auto mechanic br br br History br br The first steam powered vehicle was designed by Ferdinand Verbiest a Flemish member of a Jesuit mission in China around It was a centimetre long in scale model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger It is not known with certainty if Verbiest s model was successfully built or run br Nicolas Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full scale self propelled mechanical vehicle in about he created a steam powered tricycle He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts His inventions were limited by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure In Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam powered road vehicle It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use br The development of external combustion steam engines is detailed as part of the history of the car but often treated separately from the development of true cars A variety of steam powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the th century including steam cars steam buses phaetons and steam rollers In the United Kingdom sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of br In Nic phore Ni pce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world s first internal combustion engine which they called a Pyr olophore but installed it in a boat on the river Saone in France Coincidentally in the Swiss inventor Fran ois Isaac de Rivaz designed his own de Rivaz internal combustion engine and used it to develop the world s first vehicle to be powered by such an engine The Ni pces Pyr olophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder dried spores of the Lycopodium plant finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen Neither design was successful as was the case with others such as Samuel Brown Samuel Morey and Etienne Lenoir who each built vehicles usually adapted carriages or carts powered by internal combustion engines br In November French inventor Gustave Trouv demonstrated a three wheeled car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity Although several other German engineers including Gottlieb Daimler Wilhelm Maybach and Siegfried Marcus were working on cars at about the same time the year is regarded as the birth year of the modern car a practical marketable automobile for everyday use when the German Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent Motorwagen he is generally acknowledged as the inventor of the car br In Benz was granted a patent for his first engine which had been designed in Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle His first Motorwagen was built in in Mannheim Germany He was awarded the patent for its invention as of his application on January under the auspices of his major company Benz Cie which was founded in Benz began promotion of the vehicle on July and about Benz vehicles were sold between and when his first four wheeler was introduced along with a cheaper model They also were powered with four stroke engines of his own design Emile Roger of France already producing Benz engines under license now added the Benz car to his line of products Because France was more open to the early cars initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany In August Bertha Benz the wife and business partner of Carl Benz undertook the first road trip by car to prove the road worthiness of her husband s invention br In Benz designed and patented the first internal combustion flat engine called boxermotor During the last years of the th century Benz was the largest car company in the world with units produced in and because of its size Benz Cie became a joint stock company The first motor car in central Europe and one of the first factory made cars in the world was produced by Czech company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau later renamed to Tatra in the Pr sident automobil br Daimler and Maybach founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft DMG in Cannstatt in and sold their first car in under the brand name Daimler It was a horse drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer which they retrofitted with an engine of their design By about vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann where they set up shop after disputes with their backers Benz Maybach and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other s early work They never worked together by the time of the merger of the two companies Daimler and Maybach were no longer part of DMG Daimler died in and later that year Maybach designed an engine named Daimler Mercedes that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country Two years later in a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine which generated hp Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own Rights to the Daimler brand name were sold to other manufacturers br In mile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began producing vehicles with Daimler engines and so laid the foundation of the automotive industry in France In Auguste Doriot and his Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a petrol driven vehicle when their self designed and built Daimler powered Peugeot Type completed kilometres mi from Valentigney to Paris and Brest and back again They were attached to the first Paris Brest Paris bicycle race but finished six days after the winning cyclist Charles Terront br The first design for an American car with a petrol internal combustion engine was made in by George Selden of Rochester New York Selden applied for a patent for a car in but the patent application expired because the vehicle was never built After a delay of years and a series of attachments to his application on November Selden was granted a US patent U S patent for a two stroke car engine which hindered more than encouraged development of cars in the United States His patent was challenged by Henry Ford and others and overturned in br In the first running petrol driven American car was built and road tested by the Duryea brothers of Springfield Massachusetts The first public run of the Duryea Motor Wagon took place on September on Taylor Street in Metro Center Springfield Studebaker subsidiary of a long established wagon and coach manufacturer started to build cars in and commenced sales of electric vehicles in and petrol vehicles in br In Britain there had been several attempts to build steam cars with varying degrees of success with Thomas Rickett even attempting a production run in Santler from Malvern is recognised by the Veteran Car Club of Great Britain as having made the first petrol driven car in the country in followed by Frederick William Lanchester in but these were both one offs The first production vehicles in Great Britain came from the Daimler Company a company founded by Harry J Lawson in after purchasing the right to use the name of the engines Lawson s company made its first car in and they bore the name Daimler br In German engineer Rudolf Diesel was granted a patent for a New Rational Combustion Engine In he built the first diesel engine Steam electric and petrol driven vehicles competed for a few decades with petrol internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the s Although various pistonless rotary engine designs have attempted to compete with the conventional piston and crankshaft design only Mazda s version of the Wankel engine has had more than very limited success br All in all it is estimated that over patents created the modern automobile and motorcycle br br br Mass production br br Large scale production line manufacturing of affordable cars was started by Ransom Olds in at his Oldsmobile factory in Lansing Michigan and based upon stationary assembly line techniques pioneered by Marc Isambard Brunel at the Portsmouth Block Mills England in The assembly line style of mass production and interchangeable parts had been pioneered in the US by Thomas Blanchard in at the Springfield Armory in Springfield Massachusetts This concept was greatly expanded by Henry Ford beginning in with the world s first moving assembly line for cars at the Highland Park Ford Plant br As a result Ford s cars came off the line in minute intervals much faster than previous methods increasing productivity eightfold while using less manpower from manhours to hour minutes It was so successful paint became a bottleneck Only Japan black would dry fast enough forcing the company to drop the variety of colours available before until fast drying Duco lacquer was developed in This is the source of Ford s apocryphal remark any color as long as it s black In an assembly line worker could buy a Model T with four months pay br Ford s complex safety procedures especially assigning each worker to a specific location instead of allowing them to roam about dramatically reduced the rate of injury The combination of high wages and high efficiency is called Fordism and was copied by most major industries The efficiency gains from the assembly line also coincided with the economic rise of the US The assembly line forced workers to work at a certain pace with very repetitive motions which led to more output per worker while other countries were using less productive methods br In the automotive industry its success was dominating and quickly spread worldwide seeing the founding of Ford France and Ford Britain in Ford Denmark Ford Germany in Citro n was the first native European manufacturer to adopt the production method Soon companies had to have assembly lines or risk going broke by companies which did not had disappeared br Development of automotive technology was rapid due in part to the hundreds of small manufacturers competing to gain the world s attention Key developments included electric ignition and the electric self starter both by Charles Kettering for the Cadillac Motor Company in independent suspension and four wheel brakes br Since the s nearly all cars have been mass produced to meet market needs so marketing plans often have heavily influenced car design It was Alfred P Sloan who established the idea of different makes of cars produced by one company called the General Motors Companion Make Program so that buyers could move up as their fortunes improved br Reflecting the rapid pace of change makes shared parts with one another so larger production volume resulted in lower costs for each price range For example in the s LaSalles sold by Cadillac used cheaper mechanical parts made by Oldsmobile in the s Chevrolet shared bonnet doors roof and windows with Pontiac by the s corporate powertrains and shared platforms with interchangeable brakes suspension and other parts were common Even so only major makers could afford high costs and even companies with decades of production such as Apperson Cole Dorris Haynes or Premier could not manage of some two hundred American car makers in existence in only survived in and with the Great Depression by only of those were left br In Europe much the same would happen Morris set up its production line at Cowley in and soon outsold Ford while beginning in to follow Ford s practice of vertical integration buying Hotchkiss British subsidiary engines Wrigley gearboxes and Osberton radiators for instance as well as competitors such as Wolseley in Morris had per cent of total British car production Most British small car assemblers from Abbey to Xtra had gone under Citro n did the same in France coming to cars in between them and other cheap cars in reply such as Renault s CV and Peugeot s CV they produced cars in and Mors Hurtu and others could not compete Germany s first mass manufactured car the Opel PS Laubfrosch Tree Frog came off the line at R sselsheim in soon making Opel the top car builder in Germany with per cent of the market br In Japan car production was very limited before World War II Only a handful of companies were producing vehicles in limited numbers and these were small three wheeled for commercial uses like Daihatsu or were the result of partnering with European companies like Isuzu building the Wolseley A in Mitsubishi was also partnered with Fiat and built the Mitsubishi Model A based on a Fiat vehicle Toyota Nissan Suzuki Mazda and Honda began as companies producing non automotive products before the war switching to car production during the s Kiichiro Toyoda s decision to take Toyoda Loom Works into automobile manufacturing would create what would eventually become Toyota Motor Corporation the largest automobile manufacturer in the world Subaru meanwhile was formed from a conglomerate of six companies who banded together as Fuji Heavy Industries as a result of having been broken up under keiretsu legislation br br br Components and design br br br Propulsion and fuels br br br Fossil fuels br The transport sector is a major contributor to air pollution noise pollution and climate change br Most cars in use in the early s run on petrol burnt in an internal combustion engine ICE The International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers says that in countries that mandate low sulphur motor spirit petrol fuelled cars built to late s standards such as Euro emit very little local air pollution Some cities ban older petrol driven cars and some countries plan to ban sales in future However some environmental groups say this phase out of fossil fuel vehicles must be brought forwards to limit climate change Production of petrol fuelled cars peaked in br Other hydrocarbon fossil fuels also burnt by deflagration rather than detonation in ICE cars include diesel autogas and CNG Removal of fossil fuel subsidies concerns about oil dependence tightening environmental laws and restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions are propelling work on alternative power systems for cars This includes hybrid vehicles plug in electric vehicles and hydrogen vehicles Out of all cars sold in nine per cent were electric and by the end of that year there were more than million electric cars on the world s roads Despite rapid growth less than two per cent of cars on the world s roads were fully electric and plug in hybrid cars by the end of Cars for racing or speed records have sometimes employed jet or rocket engines but these are impractical for common use br Oil consumption has increased rapidly in the th and st centuries because there are more cars the s oil glut even fuelled the sales of low economy vehicles in OECD countries The BRIC countries are adding to this consumption br As of few production cars use wheel hub motors br br br Batteries br br In almost all hybrid even mild hybrid and pure electric cars regenerative braking recovers and returns to a battery some energy which would otherwise be wasted by friction brakes getting hot Although all cars must have friction brakes front disc brakes and either disc or drum rear brakes for emergency stops regenerative braking improves efficiency particularly in city driving br br br User interface br br Cars are equipped with controls used for driving passenger comfort and safety normally operated by a combination of the use of feet and hands and occasionally by voice on st century cars These controls include a steering wheel pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car s speed and in a manual transmission car a clutch pedal a shift lever or stick for changing gears and a number of buttons and dials for turning on lights ventilation and other functions Modern cars controls are now standardised such as the location for the accelerator and brake but this was not always the case Controls are evolving in response to new technologies for example the electric car and the integration of mobile communications br Some of the original controls are no longer required For example all cars once had controls for the choke valve clutch ignition timing and a crank instead of an electric starter However new controls have also been added to vehicles making them more complex These include air conditioning navigation systems and in car entertainment Another trend is the replacement of physical knobs and switches by secondary controls with touchscreen controls such as BMW s iDrive and Ford s MyFord Touch Another change is that while early cars pedals were physically linked to the brake mechanism and throttle in the early s cars have increasingly replaced these physical linkages with electronic controls br br br Electronics and interior br br Cars are typically equipped with interior lighting which can be toggled manually or be set to light up automatically with doors open an entertainment system which originated from car radios sideways windows which can be lowered or raised electrically manually on earlier cars and one or multiple auxiliary power outlets for supplying portable appliances such as mobile phones portable fridges power inverters and electrical air pumps from the on board electrical system More costly upper class and luxury cars are equipped with features earlier such as massage seats and collision avoidance systems br Dedicated automotive fuses and circuit breakers prevent damage from electrical overload br br br Lighting br br Cars are typically fitted with multiple types of lights These include headlights which are used to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users so that the vehicle can be used at night in some jurisdictions daytime running lights red brake lights to indicate when the brakes are applied amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver white coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing and on some vehicles additional lights e g side marker lights to increase the visibility of the car Interior lights on the ceiling of the car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers Some vehicles also have a boot light and more rarely an engine compartment light br br br Weight and size br br During the late th and early st century cars increased in weight due to batteries modern steel safety cages anti lock brakes airbags and more powerful if more efficient engines and as of typically weigh between and tonnes and short tons and long tons Heavier cars are safer for the driver from a crash perspective but more dangerous for other vehicles and road users The weight of a car influences fuel consumption and performance with more weight resulting in increased fuel consumption and decreased performance The Wuling Hongguang Mini EV a typical city car weighs about kilograms lb Heavier cars include SUVs and extended length SUVs like the Suburban Cars have also become wider br Some places tax heavier cars more as well as improving pedestrian safety this can encourage manufacturers to use materials such as recycled aluminium instead of steel It has been suggested that one benefit of subsidising charging infrastructure is that cars can use lighter batteries br br br Seating and body style br br Most cars are designed to carry multiple occupants often with four or five seats Cars with five seats typically seat two passengers in the front and three in the rear Full size cars and large sport utility vehicles can often carry six seven or more occupants depending on the arrangement of the seats On the other hand sports cars are most often designed with only two seats Utility vehicles like pickup trucks combine seating with extra cargo or utility functionality The differing needs for passenger capacity and their luggage or cargo space has resulted in the availability of a large variety of body styles to meet individual consumer requirements that include among others the sedan saloon hatchback station wagon estate coupe and minivan br br br Safety br br Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury related deaths worldwide Mary Ward became one of the first documented car fatalities in in Parsonstown Ireland and Henry Bliss one of the US s first pedestrian car casualties in in New York City There are now standard tests for safety in new cars such as the Euro and US NCAP tests and insurance industry backed tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety IIHS br br br Costs and benefits br br The costs of car usage which may include the cost of acquiring the vehicle repairs and auto maintenance fuel depreciation driving time parking fees taxes and insurance are weighed against the cost of the alternatives and the value of the benefits perceived and real of vehicle usage The benefits may include on demand transportation mobility independence and convenience and emergency power During the s cars had another benefit c ouples finally had a way to head off on unchaperoned dates plus they had a private space to snuggle up close at the end of the night br Similarly the costs to society of car use may include maintaining roads land use air pollution noise pollution road congestion public health health care and of disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life and can be balanced against the value of the benefits to society that car use generates Societal benefits may include economy benefits such as job and wealth creation of car production and maintenance transportation provision society wellbeing derived from leisure and travel opportunities and revenue generation from the tax opportunities The ability of humans to move flexibly from place to place has far reaching implications for the nature of societies br br br Environmental effects br br Cars are a major cause of urban air pollution with all types of cars producing dust from brakes tyres and road wear although these may be limited by vehicle emission standards While there are different ways to power cars most rely on petrol or diesel and they consume almost a quarter of world oil production as of Both petrol and diesel cars pollute more than electric cars Cars and vans caused of direct carbon dioxide emissions in As of due to greenhouse gases emitted during battery production electric cars must be driven tens of thousands of kilometres before their lifecycle carbon emissions are less than fossil fuel cars however this varies considerably and is expected to improve in future due to lower carbon electricity and longer lasting batteries produced in larger factories Many governments use fiscal policies such as road tax to discourage the purchase and use of more polluting cars and many cities are doing the same with low emission zones Fuel taxes may act as an incentive for the production of more efficient hence less polluting car designs e g hybrid vehicles and the development of alternative fuels High fuel taxes or cultural change may provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter smaller more fuel efficient cars or to not drive br The lifetime of a car built in the s is expected to be about years or about millionkm millionmiles if driven a lot According to the International Energy Agency the average rated fuel consumption of new light duty vehicles fell by only between and far smaller than the annual average reduction between and Given slow progress to date the IEA estimates fuel consumption will have to decrease by per year on average from to The increase in sales of SUVs is bad for fuel economy Many cities in Europe have banned older fossil fuel cars and all fossil fuel vehicles will be banned in Amsterdam from Many Chinese cities limit licensing of fossil fuel cars and many countries plan to stop selling them between and br The manufacture of vehicles is resource intensive and many manufacturers now report on the environmental performance of their factories including energy usage waste and water consumption Manufacturing each kWh of battery emits a similar amount of carbon as burning through one full tank of petrol The growth in popularity of the car allowed cities to sprawl therefore encouraging more travel by car resulting in inactivity and obesity which in turn can lead to increased risk of a variety of diseases br Animals and plants are often negatively affected by cars via habitat destruction and pollution Over the lifetime of the average car the loss of habitat potential may be over square metres sq ft based on primary production correlations Animals are also killed every year on roads by cars referred to as roadkill More recent road developments are including significant environmental mitigation in their designs such as green bridges designed to allow wildlife crossings and creating wildlife corridors br Growth in the popularity of cars and commuting has led to traffic congestion Moscow Istanbul Bogot Mexico City and S o Paulo were the world s most congested cities in according to INRIX a data analytics company br br br Social issues br Mass production of personal motor vehicles in the United States and other developed countries with extensive territories such as Australia Argentina and France vastly increased individual and group mobility and greatly increased and expanded economic development in urban suburban exurban and rural areas br In the United States the transport divide and car dependency resulting from domination of car based transport systems presents barriers to employment in low income neighbourhoods with many low income individuals and families forced to run cars they cannot afford in order to maintain their income Dependency on automobiles by African Americans may result in exposure to the hazards of driving while black and other types of racial discrimination related to buying financing and insuring them br br br Emerging car technologies br Although intensive development of conventional battery electric vehicles is continuing into the s other car propulsion technologies that are under development include wireless charging hydrogen cars and hydrogen electric hybrids Research into alternative forms of power includes using ammonia instead of hydrogen in fuel cells br New materials which may replace steel car bodies include aluminium fiberglass carbon fiber biocomposites and carbon nanotubes Telematics technology is allowing more and more people to share cars on a pay as you go basis through car share and carpool schemes Communication is also evolving due to connected car systems br br br Autonomous car br br Fully autonomous vehicles also known as driverless cars already exist as robotaxis but have a long way to go before they are in general use br br br Open source development br br There have been several projects aiming to develop a car on the principles of open design an approach to designing in which the plans for the machinery and systems are publicly shared often without monetary compensation None of the projects have succeeded in developing a car as a whole including both hardware and software and no mass production ready open source based designs have been introduced Some car hacking through on board diagnostics OBD has been done so far br br br Car sharing br Car share arrangements and carpooling are also increasingly popular in the US and Europe For example in the US some car sharing services have experienced double digit growth in revenue and membership growth between and Services like car sharing offer residents to share a vehicle rather than own a car in already congested neighbourhoods br br br Industry br br The automotive industry designs develops manufactures markets and sells the world s motor vehicles more than three quarters of which are cars In there were million cars manufactured worldwide down from million the previous year br The automotive industry in China produces by far the most million in followed by Japan seven million then Germany South Korea and India The largest market is China followed by the US br Around the world there are about a billion cars on the road they burn over a trillion litres US gal imp gal of petrol and diesel fuel yearly consuming about exajoules TWh of energy The numbers of cars are increasing rapidly in China and India In the opinion of some urban transport systems based around the car have proved unsustainable consuming excessive energy affecting the health of populations and delivering a declining level of service despite increasing investment Many of these negative effects fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars The sustainable transport movement focuses on solutions to these problems The car industry is also facing increasing competition from the public transport sector as some people re evaluate their private vehicle usage br br br Alternatives br br Established alternatives for some aspects of car use include public transport such as busses trolleybusses trains subways tramways light rail cycling and walking Bicycle sharing systems have been established in China and many European cities including Copenhagen and Amsterdam Similar programmes have been developed in large US cities Additional individual modes of transport such as personal rapid transit could serve as an alternative to cars if they prove to be socially accepted A study which checked the costs and the benefits of introducing Low Traffic Neighbourhood in London found the benefits overpass the costs approximately by times in the first years and the difference is growing over time br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br Further reading br Halberstam David The
