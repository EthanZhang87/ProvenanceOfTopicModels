Eug ne Jules Houdry Domont France April Upper Darby Township Pennsylvania July was a mechanical engineer who graduated from cole Nationale Sup rieure d Arts et M tiers in br Houdry served as a lieutenant in a tank company in the French Army during World War One receiving the French Legion of Honour br He helped innovate catalytic cracking of petroleum feed stocks for which he br received the Perkin Medal among others br br br Life br Eugene Jules Houdry was born on April at Domont France near Paris His parents were Jules Houdry and milie Thias Jule Lemaire His father owned a successful business that manufactured structural steel br br Houdry studied mechanical engineering at the cole des arts et m tiers in the Paris suburb of Chalons sur Marne br He graduated first in his class in earning a gold medal from the French government as the highest ranking scholar in his class br He also captained his school s soccer team winning the national championship of France in br After graduation Houdry joined his father s steel making business as an engineer br br br World War I br During World War I Houdry served in the French army first as a lieutenant in the field artillery He later transferred to the army s new tank corps and took part in the first French battle to use tanks part of the Nivelle Offensive which began on April br Houdry was seriously wounded in the Juvincourt sector during the Second Battle of the Aisne Most of the French tanks used in this offensive were rendered inoperable and very few reached their objective br Houdry was injured while trying to organize repairs to the damaged tanks under heavy fire He was later awarded the Croix de Guerre and was made a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor br br br Between the wars br After the war Houdry returned to his father s company Houdry et Fils His hobby was road racing and he drove a Bugatti racing car br Through the family steel company he met automobile and parts manufacturers and engineers who were trying to improve engine performance This sparked Houdry s interest in high performance fuels br Recognizing that the key to better performance of automobiles and airplanes was the improvement of fuels he became interested in the catalytic processes used to convert coal and lignite to gasoline In Houdry visited the United States where he saw the Indianapolis and toured a Ford Motor plant in Detroit Michigan br On July Eugene Houdry married Genevi ve Marie Quilleret br The couple were to have two sons br Jacques br and Pierre br Following the war there was an increasing demand for motor fuel It was feared that petroleum stocks which were being processed using thermal cracking would not meet the demand Scientists sought new ways to produce liquid fuels from bitumen coal and lignite In Italy a French pharmacist named E A Prudhomme was the principal scientist of a group experimenting with promising techniques for water gas synthesis br In Houdry had established a manufacturing company for steel springs and chains the Manufacture G n rale des Ressorts M G R in Beauchamp Seine et Oise In Houdry convinced Prudhomme to join him at Beauchamp and set up a fuel research laboratory under Houdry s management In Houdry incorporated the Soci t Anonyme Fran aise pour la Fabrication d Essences et P troles br By they had developed a step process for a lignite based fuel using desulfurizing and catalysts for cracking br br During the lignite to gasoline process the solid lignite was initially broken down by heat to produce viscous hydrocarbon oil and tars then the oil was further converted by an added catalyst to produce lower boiling hydrocarbons similar to the gasoline fraction derived from petroleum br A major problem with Prudhomme s process was that the catalysts could not be reclaimed The surface of the catalyst quickly became coated with a layer of carbon or coke and became less effective There was already some work in this problem e g in a patent alumina was suggested as a catalyst for oil cracking By having tested hundreds of catalysts Houdry had focused on naturally occurring Fuller s earth He determined that it could be processed to obtain a purer aluminosilicate catalyst which could be successfully regenerated under certain conditions br By Houdry was able to get initial support from the French government to build a pilot gas plant in Saint Julien de Peyrolas It began production in June and ceased production in Although the process was successfully demonstrated it was expensive and yields were lower than predicted Houdry was unable to get ongoing support from the French government or from French companies to produce the new fuel br Approaches to the French Saint Gobain Company and the Anglo Iranian Oil Company were unsuccessful br br br Moving to America br Unable to get backing for new fuels in France Houdry turned to the United States where his efforts were more successful br Houdry moved from France to America in He settled in Paulsboro New Jersey where he formed the Houdry Process Corporation in br As discussed in more detail below See Inventions Houdry worked with the American oil companies Socony Vacuum and Sun Oil to develop pilot plants for improved fuels The first full scale Houdry unit was opened in Marcus Hook in By Houdry fixed bed catalytic units were producing high octane aviation fuel for the armed forces br br br World War II activities br During World War II Houdry strongly opposed the government of Vichy France under Marshall Philippe P tain and its collaboration with Germany As president of the U S chapter of France Forever where his brother in law Pierre Quilleret was also one of the founders Houdry vocally and publicly criticized Petain stating that he did not speak for the French people br Houdry supported General Charles de Gaulle leader of the provisional French government in exile br On May the Vichy government revoked Houdry s French citizenship br In January Houdry was granted citizenship in the United States br Both of Houdry s sons Jacques and Pierre served in World War II as part of the United States Army Pierre served in field artillery and chemical warfare units Eugene Houdry supported the war effort through the development of industrial processes and fuels br br br Inventions br br br Coal to gasoline br Houdry originally focused on using lignite brown coal as a feedstock but switched to using heavy liquid tars Although others had experimented with catalysts for this purpose they were stymied by the fact that the catalyst ceased to work after a time Houdry diagnosed the nature of the problem and developed a method to regenerate the catalyst br The first Houdry unit was built at Sun Oil s Marcus Hook PA oil refinery in Many more units were built by the s and were instrumental for US wartime aviation gasoline production br Among others at the company who helped Houdry in the development of the catalytic cracking process was Alex Golden Oblad br The process was further developed by two MIT engineers Warren K Lewis and Edwin R Gilliland under contract to Standard Oil of New Jersey now ExxonMobil They developed the process into fluid catalytic cracking which solved the problem of having to shut down the process to burn the coke off the catalyst by using a continuously circulating fluidized catalyst made of a fine zeolite powder This process is still in widespread use especially in the US where gasoline is in high demand compared to other refined products br Houdry later became interested in automotive catalysts and the catalytic converter was one of approximately patents that he received but nothing came of it until the s because the tetraethyl lead that was still in use in the s and s poisoned the catalyst br br br Butadiene br Houdry also invented a catalytic process to produce butadiene from butane gas which was formed during crude oil production During World War II butadiene was important to the production of synthetic rubber br br br Oxy Catalyst br br Following World War II Houdry started the Oxy Catalyst Company Houdry was concerned with possible health risks relating to automobile and industrial air pollution He built a generic catalytic converter capable of reducing carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons from automobile exhausts For his design he received U S Patent in Catalytic converters eventually became standard equipment in American cars following passage of the Clean Air Act introduced by Edmund S Muskie in br br br Scientific recognition br Houdry s contributions to catalytic technology were recognized by numerous awards including the Potts Medal of the Franklin Institute in br the Perkin Medal of the Society of Chemical Industry American Section in br the E V Murphree Award in Industrial and Engineering Chemistry of the American Chemical Society in and posthumous election to the National Inventors Hall of Fame in br He was awarded honorary degrees from Pennsylvania Military College Doctor of Science in and Grove City College in In the North American Catalysis Society created the Eugene J Houdry Award in Applied Catalysis awarded in odd numbered years since to recognize and encourage individual contributions in the field of catalysis with emphasis on the development of new and improved catalysts and processes representing outstanding advances in their useful application br On April Houdry s work was recognized by the designation of a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society at the site of the Sun Company now Sunoco Logistics Partners L P in Marcus Hook Pennsylvania br br br Death br Houdry died on July at Upper Darby Township Pennsylvania at the age of He was survived by his sons and his wife
