title: NOx
id: 2630676
In atmospheric chemistry NOx is shorthand for nitric oxide NO and nitrogen dioxide NO the nitrogen oxides that are most relevant for air pollution These gases contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain as well as affecting tropospheric ozone br NOx gases are usually produced from the reaction between nitrogen and oxygen during combustion of fuels such as hydrocarbons in air especially at high temperatures such as in car engines In areas of high motor vehicle traffic such as in large cities the nitrogen oxides emitted can be a significant source of air pollution NOx gases are also produced naturally by lightning br NOx does not include nitrous oxide N O a fairly inert oxide of nitrogen that contributes less severely to air pollution notwithstanding its involvement in ozone depletion and high global warming potential br NOy is defined as the sum of NOx plus the NOz compounds produced from the oxidation of NOx which include nitric acid nitrous acid HONO dinitrogen pentoxide N O peroxyacetyl nitrate PAN alkyl nitrates RONO peroxyalkyl nitrates ROONO the nitrate radical NO and peroxynitric acid HNO br br br Formation and reactions br Because of energy limitations oxygen and nitrogen do not react at ambient temperatures But at high temperatures they undergo an endothermic reaction producing various oxides of nitrogen Such temperatures arise inside an internal combustion engine or a power station boiler during the combustion of a mixture of air and fuel and naturally in a lightning flash br In atmospheric chemistry the term NOx refers to the total concentration of NO and NO since the conversion between these two species is rapid in the stratosphere and troposphere During daylight hours these concentrations together with that of ozone are in steady state also known as photostationary state PSS the ratio of NO to NO is determined by the intensity of sunshine which converts NO to NO and the concentration of ozone which reacts with NO to again form NO br In other words the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere is determined by the ratio of these two species br br The symbol br br br br br M br br br br displaystyle ce M br br represents a third body a molecular species that is required to carry away energy from the exothermic reaction Equation relates the concentrations of NOx and ozone and is known as the Leighton relationship br The time br br br br br br br displaystyle tau br br that is needed to reach a steady state among NOx and ozone is dominated by reaction which reverses reactions br br for mixing ratio of NO NO part per billion ppb the time constant is minutes for NO ppb minutes br br br Formation of smog br When NOx and volatile organic compounds VOCs react in the presence of sunlight they form photochemical smog a significant form of air pollution The presence of photochemical smog increases during the summer when the incident solar radiation is higher The emitted hydrocarbons from industrial activities and transportation react with NOx quickly and increase the concentration of ozone and peroxide compounds especially peroxyacetyl nitrate PAN br Children people with lung diseases such as asthma and people who work or exercise outside are particularly susceptible to adverse effects of smog such as damage to lung tissue and reduction in lung function br br br Formation of nitric acid and acid rain br NO is further oxidized in the gas phase during daytime by reaction with OH br br NO OH M HNO M br where M denotes a third molecule required to stabilize the addition product Nitric acid HNO is highly soluble in liquid water in aerosol particles or cloud drops br NO also reacts with ozone to form nitrate radical br br NO O NO O br During the daytime NO is quickly photolyzed back to NO but at night it can react with a second NO to form dinitrogen pentoxide br br NO NO M N O M br N O reacts rapidly with liquid water in aerosol particles or cloud drops but not in the gas phase to form HNO br br N O H O liq HNO aq br These are thought to be the principal pathways for formation of nitric acid in the atmosphere This nitric acid contributes to acid rain or may deposit to soil where it makes nitrate which is of use to growing plants The aqueous phase reaction br br NO H O HNO HNO br is too slow to be of any significance in the atmosphere br br br Sources br br br Natural sources br Nitric oxide is produced during thunderstorms due to the extreme heating and cooling within a lightning strike This causes stable molecules such as N and O to convert into significant amounts of NO similar to the process that occurs during high temperature fuel combustion NOx from lightning can become oxidized to produce nitric acid HNO this can be precipitated out as acid rain or deposited onto particles in the air Elevated production of NOx from lightning depends on the season and geographic location The occurrence of lightning is more common over land near the equator in the inter tropical convergence zone ITCZ during summer months This area migrates slightly as seasons change NOx production from lightning can be observed through satellite observations br Scientists Ott et al estimated that each flash of lightning on average in the several mid latitude and subtropical thunderstorms studied turned kg lb of nitrogen into chemically reactive NOx With billion lightning flashes per year multiplied by kilograms per lightning strike they estimated the total amount of NOx produced by lightning per year is million tonnes However NOx emissions resulting from fossil fuel combustion are estimated at million tonnes br A recent discovery indicated that cosmic ray and solar flares can significantly influence the number of lightning strikes occurring on Earth Therefore space weather can be a major driving force of lightning produced atmospheric NOx Atmospheric constituents such as nitrogen oxides can be stratified vertically in the atmosphere Ott noted that the lightning produced NOx is typically found at altitudes greater than km while combustion and biogenic soil NOx are typically found near the sources at near surface elevation where it can cause the most significant health effects br br br Biogenic sources br Agricultural fertilization and the use of nitrogen fixing plants also contribute to atmospheric NOx by promoting nitrogen fixation by microorganisms The nitrification process transforms ammonia into nitrate Denitrification is basically the reverse process of nitrification During denitrification nitrate is reduced to nitrite then NO then N O and finally nitrogen Through these processes NOx is emitted to the atmosphere br A recent study conducted by the University of California Davis found that adding nitrogen fertilizer to soil in California is contributing percent or more to state wide NOx pollution levels When nitrogen fertilizer is added to the soil excess ammonium and nitrate not used by plants can be converted to NO by microorganisms in the soil which escapes into the air NOx is a precursor for smog formation which is already a known issue for the state of California In addition to contributing to smog when nitrogen fertilizer is added to the soil and the excess is released in the form of NO or leached as nitrate this can be a costly process for the farming industry br A study by the Indiana University determined that forests in the eastern United States can expect to see increases in NOx and in turn changes in the types of trees which predominate Due to human activity and climate change the maples sassafras and tulip poplar have been pushing out the beneficial oak beech and hickory The team determined that the first three tree species maples sassafras and tulip poplar are associated with ammonia oxidizing bacteria known to emit reactive nitrogen from soil By contrast the second three tree species oak beech and hickory are associated with microbes that absorb reactive nitrogen oxides and thus can have a positive impact on the nitrogen oxide component of air quality Nitrogen oxide release from forest soils is expected to be highest in Indiana Illinois Michigan Kentucky and Ohio br br br Industrial sources anthropogenic sources br The three primary sources of NOx in combustion processes br br thermal NOx br fuel NOx br prompt NOx br Thermal NOx formation which is highly temperature dependent is recognized as the most relevant source when combusting natural gas Fuel NOx tends to dominate during the combustion of fuels such as coal which have a significant nitrogen content particularly when burned in combustors designed to minimise thermal NOx The contribution of prompt NOx is normally considered negligible A fourth source called feed NOx is associated with the combustion of nitrogen present in the feed material of cement rotary kilns at between C and C where it is considered a minor contributor br br br Thermal br Thermal NOx refers to NOx formed through high temperature oxidation of the diatomic nitrogen found in combustion air The formation rate is primarily a function of temperature and the residence time of nitrogen at that temperature At high temperatures usually above C F molecular nitrogen N and oxygen O in the combustion air dissociate into their atomic states and participate in a series of reactions br The three principal reactions the extended Zel dovich mechanism producing thermal NOx are br br N O NO N br N O NO O br N OH NO H br All three reactions are reversible Zeldovich was the first to suggest the importance of the first two reactions The last reaction of atomic nitrogen with the hydroxyl radical HO was added by Lavoie Heywood and Keck to the mechanism and makes a significant contribution to the formation of thermal NOx br br br Fuel br It is estimated that transportation fuels cause of the anthropogenic i e human caused NOx The major source of NOx production from nitrogen bearing fuels such as certain coals and oil is the conversion of fuel bound nitrogen to NOx during combustion During combustion the nitrogen bound in the fuel is released as a free radical and ultimately forms free N or NO Fuel can contribute as much as of total NOx emissions through the combusting oil and as much as through the combusting of coal br Although the complete mechanism is not fully understood there are two primary pathways of formation The first involves the oxidation of volatile nitrogen species during the initial stages of combustion During the release and before the oxidation of the volatiles nitrogen reacts to form several intermediaries which are then oxidized into NO If the volatiles evolve into a reducing atmosphere the nitrogen evolved can readily be made to form nitrogen gas rather than NOx The second pathway involves the combustion of nitrogen contained in the char matrix during the combustion of the char portion of the fuels This reaction occurs much more slowly than the volatile phase Only around of the char nitrogen is ultimately emitted as NOx since much of the NOx that forms during this process is reduced to nitrogen by the char which is nearly pure carbon br br br Prompt br Nitrogen oxides are released during manufacturing of nitrogen fertilizers Though nitrous oxide is emitted during its application it is then reacted in atmosphere to form nitrogen oxides This third source is attributed to the reaction of atmospheric nitrogen N with radicals such as C CH and CH fragments derived from fuel rather than thermal or fuel processes Occurring in the earliest stage of combustion this results in the formation of fixed species of nitrogen such as NH nitrogen monohydride NCN diradical cyanonitrene HCN hydrogen cyanide H CN dihydrogen cyanide and CN cyano radical which can oxidize to NO In fuels that contain nitrogen the incidence of prompt NOx is comparatively small and it is generally only of interest for the most exacting emission targets br br br Health and environment effects br There is strong evidence that NOx respiratory exposure can trigger and exacerbate existing asthma symptoms and may even lead to the development of asthma over longer periods of time It has also been associated with heart disease diabetes birth outcomes and all cause mortality but these nonrespiratory effects are less well established br NOx reacts with ammonia moisture and other compounds to form nitric acid vapor and related particles br NOx reacts with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight to form ozone Ozone can cause adverse effects such as damage to lung tissue and reduction in lung function mostly in susceptible populations children elderly asthmatics Ozone can be transported by wind currents and cause health impacts far from the original sources The American Lung Association estimates that nearly percent of United States inhabitants live in counties that are not in ozone compliance In South East England ground level ozone pollution tends to be highest in the countryside and in suburbs while in central London and on major roads NO emissions are able to mop up ozone to form NO and oxygen br NOx also readily reacts with common organic chemicals and even ozone to form a wide variety of toxic products nitroarenes nitrosamines and also the nitrate radical some of which may cause DNA mutations Recently another pathway via NOx to ozone has been found that predominantly occurs in coastal areas via formation of nitryl chloride when NOx comes into contact with salt mist br The direct effect of the emission of NOx has positive contribution to the greenhouse effect Instead of reacting with ozone in Reaction NO can also react with HO and organic peroxyradicals RO and thus increase the concentration of ozone Once the concentration of NOx exceeds a certain level atmospheric reactions result in net ozone formation Since tropospheric ozone can absorb infrared radiation this indirect effect of NOx is intensifying global warming br There are also other indirect effects of NOx that can either increase or decrease the greenhouse effect First of all through the reaction of NO with HO radicals OH radicals are recycled which oxidize methane molecules meaning NOx emissions can counter the effect of greenhouse gases For instance ship traffic emits a great amount of NOx which provides a source of NOx over the ocean Then photolysis of NO leads to the formation of ozone and the further formation of hydroxyl radicals OH through ozone photolysis Since the major sink of methane in the atmosphere is by reaction with OH radicals the NOx emissions from ship travel may lead to a net global cooling However NOx in the atmosphere may undergo dry or wet deposition and return to land in the form of HNO NO Through this way the deposition leads to nitrogen fertilization and the subsequent formation of nitrous oxide N O in soil which is another greenhouse gas In conclusion considering several direct and indirect effects NOx emissions have a negative contribution to global warming br NOx in the atmosphere is removed through several pathways During daytime NO reacts with hydroxyl radicals OH and forms nitric acid HNO which can easily be removed by dry and wet deposition Organic peroxyradicals RO can also react with NO and NO and result in the formation of organic nitrates These are ultimately broken down to inorganic nitrate which is a useful nutrient for plants During nighttime NO and NO can form nitrous acid HONO through surface catalyzed reaction Although the reaction is relatively slow it is an important reaction in urban areas In addition the nitrate radical NO is formed by the reaction between NO and ozone At night NO further reacts with NO and establishes an equilibrium reaction with dinitrogen pentoxide N O Via heterogeneous reaction N O reacts with water vapor or liquid water and forms nitric acid HNO As mentioned above nitric acid can be removed through wet and dry deposition and this results in the removal of NOx from the atmosphere br br br Biodiesel and NOx br Biodiesel and its blends in general are known to reduce harmful tailpipe emissions such as carbon monoxide particulate matter PM otherwise known as soot and unburned hydrocarbon emissions While earlier studies suggested biodiesel could sometimes decrease NOx and sometimes increase NOx emissions subsequent investigation has shown that blends of up to biodiesel in USEPA approved diesel fuel have no significant impact on NOx emissions compared with regular diesel The state of California uses a special formulation of diesel fuel to produce less NOx relative to diesel fuel used in the other states This has been deemed necessary by the California Air Resources Board CARB to offset the combination of vehicle congestion warm temperatures extensive sunlight PM and topography that all contribute to the formation of ozone and smog CARB has established a special regulation for Alternative Diesel Fuels to ensure that any new fuels including biodiesel coming into the market do not substantially increase NOx emissions The reduction of NOx emissions is one of the most important challenges for advances in vehicle technology While diesel vehicles sold in the US since are dramatically cleaner than previous diesel vehicles urban areas continue to seek more ways to reduce the formation of smog and ozone NOx formation during combustion is associated with a number of factors such as combustion temperature As such it can be observed that the vehicle drive cycle or the load on the engine have more significant impact on NOx emissions than the type of fuel used This may be especially true for modern clean diesel vehicles that continuously monitor engine operation electronically and actively control engine parameters and exhaust system operations to limit NOx emission to less than g km Low temperature combustion or LTC technology may help reduce thermal formation of NOx during combustion however a tradeoff exists as high temperature combustion produces less PM or soot and results in greater power and fuel efficiency br br br Regulation and emission control technologies br Selective catalytic reduction SCR and selective non catalytic reduction SNCR reduce post combustion NOx by reacting the exhaust with urea or ammonia to produce nitrogen and water SCR is now being used in ships diesel trucks and in some diesel cars The use of exhaust gas recirculation and catalytic converters in motor vehicle engines have significantly reduced vehicular emissions NOx was the main focus of the Volkswagen emissions violations br Other technologies such as flameless oxidation FLOX and staged combustion significantly reduce thermal NOx in industrial processes Bowin low NOx technology is a hybrid of staged premixed radiant combustion technology with major surface combustion preceded by minor radiant combustion In the Bowin burner air and fuel gas are premixed at a ratio greater than or equal to the stoichiometric combustion requirement Water Injection technology whereby water is introduced into the combustion chamber is also becoming an important means of NOx reduction through increased efficiency in the overall combustion process Alternatively the water e g to is emulsified into the fuel oil before the injection and combustion This emulsification can either be made in line unstabilized just before the injection or as a drop in fuel with chemical additives for long term emulsion stability stabilized Excessive water addition facilitates hot corrosion which is the primary reason why dry low NOx technologies are favored today besides the requirement of a more complex system br br br
