title: Catalyst poisoning
id: 6473308
Catalyst poisoning is the partial or total deactivation of a catalyst by a chemical compound Poisoning refers specifically to chemical deactivation rather than other mechanisms of catalyst degradation such as thermal decomposition or physical damage Although usually undesirable poisoning may be helpful when it results in improved catalyst selectivity e g Lindlar s catalyst An important historic example was the poisoning of catalytic converters by leaded fuel br br br Poisoning of Pd catalysts br Organic functional groups and inorganic anions often have the ability to strongly adsorb to metal surfaces Common catalyst poisons include carbon monoxide halides cyanides sulfides sulfites phosphates phosphites and organic molecules such as nitriles nitro compounds oximes and nitrogen containing heterocycles Agents vary their catalytic properties because of the nature of the transition metal Lindlar catalysts are prepared by the reduction of palladium chloride in a slurry of calcium carbonate CaCO followed by poisoning with lead acetate In a related case the Rosenmund reduction of acyl halides to aldehydes the palladium catalyst over barium sulfate or calcium carbonate is intentionally poisoned by the addition of sulfur or quinoline in order to lower the catalyst activity and thereby prevent over reduction of the aldehyde product to the primary alcohol br br br Poisoning process br Poisoning often involves compounds that chemically bond to a catalyst s active sites Poisoning decreases the number of active sites and the average distance that a reactant molecule must diffuse through the pore structure before undergoing reaction increases as a result As a result poisoned sites can no longer accelerate the reaction with which the catalyst was supposed to catalyze Large scale production of substances such as ammonia in the Haber Bosch process include steps to remove potential poisons from the product stream When the poisoning reaction rate is slow relative to the rate of diffusion the poison will be evenly distributed throughout the catalyst and will result in homogeneous poisoning of the catalyst Conversely if the reaction rate is fast compared to the rate of diffusion a poisoned shell will form on the exterior layers of the catalyst a situation known as pore mouth poisoning and the rate of catalytic reaction may become limited by the rate of diffusion through the inactive shell Homogenous and pore mouth poisoning occurrences are most frequently observed when using a porous medium catalyst br br br Selective poisoning br If the catalyst and reaction conditions are indicative of low effectiveness selective poisoning may be observed where poisoning of only a small fraction of the catalyst s surface gives a disproportionately large drop in activity

poisoning of catalysts can be used to improve selectivity of reactions Poisoning can allow for selective intermediates to be isolated and desirable final products to be produced br br br Hydrodesulfurization catalysts br In the purification of petroleum products the process of hydrodesulfurization is utilized Thiols such as thiophene are reduced using H to produce H S and hydrocarbons of varying chain length Common catalysts used are tungsten and molybdenum sulfide Adding cobalt and nickel to either edges or partially incorporating them into the crystal lattice structure can improve the catalyst s efficiency The synthesis of the catalyst creates a supported hybrid that prevents poisoning of the cobalt nuclei br br br Other examples br In catalytic converters used on automobiles the combustion of leaded gasoline produces elemental lead lead II oxide lead II chloride and lead II bromide Lead alloys with the metals present in the catalyst while lead oxides and halides coat the catalyst s surfaces reducing the converter s ability to reduce NOx emissions br In fuel cells using platinum catalysts the fuels must be free of sulfur and carbon monoxide unless a desulfurization system is used br Ziegler Natta catalysts for the production of polyolefins e g polyethylene polypropylene etc are poisoned by water and oxygen This poisoning applies to both homogeneous catalysts and heterogeneous catalysts for olefin polymerization This requires the monomers ethylene propylene etc to be purified br br br See also br Hydrogen purity br Reaction inhibitor
