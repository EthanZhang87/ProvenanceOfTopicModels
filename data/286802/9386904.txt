In a piston engine the bore or cylinder bore is the diameter of each cylinder br Engine displacement is calculated based on bore stroke length and the number of cylinders br br displacement bore stroke ncylinders br br The stroke ratio determined by dividing the bore by the stroke traditionally indicated whether an engine was designed for power at high engine speeds rpm or torque at lower engine speeds The term bore can also be applied to the bore of a locomotive cylinder or steam engine pistons br br br In steam locomotives br The term bore also applies to the cylinder of a steam locomotive or steam engine br br br Bore pitch br br Bore pitch is the distance between the centerline of a cylinder bore to the centerline of the next cylinder bore adjacent to it in an internal combustion engine It s also referred to as the mean cylinder width bore spacing bore center distance and cylinder spacing br The bore pitch is always larger than the inside diameter of the cylinder the bore and piston diameter since it includes the thickness of both cylinder walls and any water passage separating them This is one of the first dimensions required when developing a new engine since it limits maximum cylinder size and therefore indirectly maximum displacement and determines the length of the engine L or of that bank of cylinders V V etc br In addition the positions of the main bearings must be between individual cylinders L with main bearings or L with main bearings only one rod journal between main bearings or between adjacent pairs of cylinders L with main bearings L or V with main bearings or V with main bearings two rod journals between main bearings br In some older engines such as the Chevrolet Gen Stovebolt inline six the GMC straight engine the Buick Straight eight and the Chrysler Slant the bore pitch is additionally extended to allow more material between the main bearing webs in the block For example in an L the first pair center pair and rear pair of cylinders that share a pair of main bearings have a smaller pitch than between and that bridge a main bearing br Since the start up expense of casting an engine block is very high this is a strong incentive to retain this dimension for as long as possible to amortize the tooling cost over a large number of engines If and when the engine is further refined modified or enlarged the bore pitch may be the only dimension retained from its predecessor The bore diameter is frequently increased to the limit of minimal wall thickness the water passage is eliminated between each pair of adjacent cylinders the deck height is increased to accommodate a longer stroke etc but in general if the bore pitch is the same the engines are related br As an example of development the Chrysler polyspheric V first introduced in was gradually increased in size by bore and stroke to by then received a drastic make over in to conventional wedge combustion chambers then modified again for stud mounted rocker arms and finally underwent an even greater re design to become the modern liter hemi All of these engines retain the original bore pitch distance set down in br br br Hybrid heads br Hybrid is the term commonly used to identify an engine modified for high performance by adapting a cylinder head from another sometimes completely different brand size model or type engine Note using a later head of the same engine family isn t a true hybrid but mere modernization br In some cases two heads from the donor source engine are joined end to end to match the number of cylinders on the subject engine such as using three cylinders each of two V heads on a Chevrolet inline six br Identical or extremely similar bore pitch is what makes this possible or almost impossible br br br See also br br br
