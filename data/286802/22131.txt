Natural gas also called fossil gas methane gas or simply gas is a naturally occurring mixture of gaseous hydrocarbons consisting primarily of methane in addition to various smaller amounts of other higher alkanes Traces of carbon dioxide nitrogen hydrogen sulfide and helium are also usually present Methane is colorless and odorless and the second largest greenhouse gas contributor to global climate change after carbon dioxide Because natural gas is odorless odorizers such as mercaptan which smells like sulfur or rotten eggs are commonly added to it for safety so that leaks can be readily detected br Natural gas is a fossil fuel that is formed when layers of organic matter primarily marine microorganisms decompose under anaerobic conditions and are subjected to intense heat and pressure underground over millions of years The energy that the decayed organisms originally obtained from the sun via photosynthesis is stored as chemical energy within the molecules of methane and other hydrocarbons br Natural gas can be burned for heating cooking and electricity generation It is also used as a chemical feedstock in the manufacture of plastics and other commercially important organic chemicals and less commonly used as a fuel for vehicles br The extraction and consumption of natural gas is a major and growing contributor to climate change Both the gas itself specifically methane and carbon dioxide which is released when natural gas is burned are greenhouse gases When burned for heat or electricity natural gas emits fewer toxic air pollutants less carbon dioxide and almost no particulate matter compared to other fossil and biomass fuels However gas venting and unintended fugitive emissions throughout the supply chain can result in natural gas having a similar carbon footprint to other fossil fuels overall br Natural gas can be found in underground geological formations often alongside other fossil fuels like coal and oil petroleum Most natural gas has been created through either biogenic or thermogenic processes Thermogenic gas takes a much longer period of time to form and is created when organic matter is heated and compressed deep underground Methanogenic organisms produce methane from a variety of sources principally carbon dioxide br br During petroleum production natural gas is sometimes flared rather than being collected and used Before natural gas can be burned as a fuel or used in manufacturing processes it almost always has to be processed to remove impurities such as water The byproducts of this processing include ethane propane butanes pentanes and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons Hydrogen sulfide which may be converted into pure sulfur carbon dioxide water vapor and sometimes helium and nitrogen must also be removed br Natural gas is sometimes informally referred to simply as gas especially when it is being compared to other energy sources such as oil coal or renewables However it is not to be confused with gasoline which is also shortened in colloquial usage to gas especially in North America br Natural gas is measured in standard cubic meters or standard cubic feet The density compared to air ranges from g mole kg per standard cubic meter to as high as g mole kg per scm but generally less than g mole kg per scm For comparison pure methane g mole has a density times that of air kg per standard cubic meter br br br Name br In the early s natural gas became known as natural to distinguish it from the dominant gas fuel at the time coal gas Unlike coal gas which is manufactured by heating coal natural gas can be extracted from the ground in its native gaseous form When the use of natural gas overtook the use of coal gas in English speaking countries in the th century it was increasingly referred to as simply gas In order to highlight its role in exacerbating the climate crisis however many organizations have criticized the continued use of the word natural in referring to the gas These advocates prefer the term fossil gas or methane gas as better conveying to the public its climate threat A study of Americans perceptions of the fuel found that across political identifications the term methane gas led to better estimates of its harms and risks br br br History br Natural gas can come out of the ground and cause a long burning fire In ancient Greece the gas flames at Mount Chimaera contributed to the legend of the fire breathing creature Chimera In ancient China gas resulting from the drilling for brines was first used by about BC The Chinese transported gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo to where it was used to boil salt water to extract the salt in the Ziliujing District of Sichuan br Natural gas was not widely used before the development of long distance pipelines in the early twentieth century Before that most use was near to the source of the well and the predominant gas for fuel and lighting during the industrial revolution was manufactured coal gas br The history of natural gas in the United States begins with localized use In the seventeenth century French missionaries witnessed the American Indians setting fire to natural gas seeps around lake Erie and scattered observations of these seeps were made by European descended settlers throughout the eastern seaboard through the s In William Hart dug the first commercial natural gas well in the United States at Fredonia New York United States which led in to the formation of the Fredonia Gas Light Company Further such ventures followed near wells in other states until technological innovations allowed the growth of major long distance pipelines from the s onward br By km cu mi or had been used out of the total km cu mi of estimated remaining recoverable reserves of natural gas br br br Sources br br br Natural gas br br In the th century natural gas was primarily obtained as a by product of producing oil The small light gas carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the reservoir to the surface similar to uncapping a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide effervesces The gas was often viewed as a by product a hazard and a disposal problem in active oil fields The large volumes produced could not be used until relatively expensive pipeline and storage facilities were constructed to deliver the gas to consumer markets br Until the early part of the th century most natural gas associated with oil was either simply released or burned off at oil fields Gas venting and production flaring are still practised in modern times but efforts are ongoing around the world to retire them and to replace them with other commercially viable and useful alternatives Unwanted gas or stranded gas without a market is often returned to the reservoir with injection wells while awaiting a possible future market or to re pressurize the formation which can enhance oil extraction rates from other wells In regions with a high natural gas demand such as the US pipelines are constructed when it is economically feasible to transport gas from a wellsite to an end consumer br In addition to transporting gas via pipelines for use in power generation other end uses for natural gas include export as liquefied natural gas LNG or conversion of natural gas into other liquid products via gas to liquids GTL technologies GTL technologies can convert natural gas into liquids products such as gasoline diesel or jet fuel A variety of GTL technologies have been developed including Fischer Tropsch F T methanol to gasoline MTG and syngas to gasoline plus STG F T produces a synthetic crude that can be further refined into finished products while MTG can produce synthetic gasoline from natural gas STG can produce drop in gasoline diesel jet fuel and aromatic chemicals directly from natural gas via a single loop process In Royal Dutch Shell s barrels m per day F T plant went into operation in Qatar br Natural gas can be associated found in oil fields or non associated isolated in natural gas fields and is also found in coal beds as coalbed methane It sometimes contains a significant amount of ethane propane butane and pentane heavier hydrocarbons removed for commercial use prior to the methane being sold as a consumer fuel or chemical plant feedstock Non hydrocarbons such as carbon dioxide nitrogen helium rarely and hydrogen sulfide must also be removed before the natural gas can be transported br Natural gas extracted from oil wells is called casinghead gas whether or not truly produced up the annulus and through a casinghead outlet or associated gas The natural gas industry is extracting an increasing quantity of gas from challenging unconventional resource types sour gas tight gas shale gas and coalbed methane br There is some disagreement on which country has the largest proven gas reserves Sources that consider that Russia has by far the largest proven reserves include the US Central Intelligence Agency km and Energy Information Administration km as well as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries km Contrarily BP credits Russia with only km which would place it in second slightly behind Iran to km depending on the source br br It is estimated that there are about km of unconventional gas such as shale gas of which km may be recoverable In turn many studies from MIT Black Veatch and the US Department of Energy predict that natural gas will account for a larger portion of electricity generation and heat in the future br The world s largest gas field is the offshore South Pars North Dome Gas Condensate field shared between Iran and Qatar It is estimated to have cubic kilometers cu mi of natural gas and billion barrels billion cubic meters of natural gas condensates br Because natural gas is not a pure product as the reservoir pressure drops when non associated gas is extracted from a field under supercritical pressure temperature conditions the higher molecular weight components may partially condense upon isothermic depressurizing an effect called retrograde condensation The liquid thus formed may get trapped as the pores of the gas reservoir get depleted One method to deal with this problem is to re inject dried gas free of condensate to maintain the underground pressure and to allow re evaporation and extraction of condensates More frequently the liquid condenses at the surface and one of the tasks of the gas plant is to collect this condensate The resulting liquid is called natural gas liquid NGL and has commercial value br br br Shale gas br br Shale gas is natural gas produced from shale Because shale s matrix permeability is too low to allow gas to flow in economical quantities shale gas wells depend on fractures to allow the gas to flow Early shale gas wells depended on natural fractures through which gas flowed almost all shale gas wells today require fractures artificially created by hydraulic fracturing Since shale gas has become a major source of natural gas in the United States and Canada Because of increased shale gas production the United States was in the number one natural gas producer in the world The production of shale gas in the United States has been described as a shale gas revolution and as one of the landmark events in the st century br Following the increased production in the United States shale gas exploration is beginning in countries such as Poland China and South Africa Chinese geologists have identified the Sichuan Basin as a promising target for shale gas drilling because of the similarity of shales to those that have proven productive in the United States Production from the Wei well is between and m per day In late China National Petroleum Corporation claimed daily production of million cubic meters of gas from its Changning Weiyuan demonstration zone br br br Town gas br br Town gas is a flammable gaseous fuel made by the destructive distillation of coal It contains a variety of calorific gases including hydrogen carbon monoxide methane and other volatile hydrocarbons together with small quantities of non calorific gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen and was used in a similar way to natural gas This is a historical technology and is not usually economically competitive with other sources of fuel gas today br Most town gashouses located in the eastern US in the late th and early th centuries were simple by product coke ovens that heated bituminous coal in air tight chambers The gas driven off from the coal was collected and distributed through networks of pipes to residences and other buildings where it was used for cooking and lighting Gas heating did not come into widespread use until the last half of the th century The coal tar or asphalt that collected in the bottoms of the gashouse ovens was often used for roofing and other waterproofing purposes and when mixed with sand and gravel was used for paving streets br br br Crystallized natural gas clathrates br Huge quantities of natural gas primarily methane exist in the form of clathrates under sediment on offshore continental shelves and on land in arctic regions that experience permafrost such as those in Siberia Hydrates require a combination of high pressure and low temperature to form br In Japan Oil Gas and Metals National Corporation JOGMEC announced that they had recovered commercially relevant quantities of natural gas from methane hydrate br br br Processing br br The image below is a schematic block flow diagram of a typical natural gas processing plant It shows the various unit processes used to convert raw natural gas into sales gas pipelined to the end user markets br The block flow diagram also shows how processing of the raw natural gas yields byproduct sulfur byproduct ethane and natural gas liquids NGL propane butanes and natural gasoline denoted as pentanes br br br Demand br br As of mid natural gas production in the US had peaked three times with current levels exceeding both previous peaks It reached trillion cubic feet per year in followed by a decline and reached trillion cubic feet in After a brief drop withdrawals increased nearly every year since owing to the shale gas boom with production at trillion cubic feet and production at trillion cubic feet After the third peak in December extraction continued to fall from March onward due to decreased demand caused by the COVID pandemic in the US br The global energy crisis was driven by a global surge in demand as the world quit the economic recession caused by COVID particularly due to strong energy demand in Asia br br br Storage and transport br br Because of its low density it is not easy to store natural gas or to transport it by vehicle Natural gas pipelines are impractical across oceans since the gas needs to be cooled down and compressed as the friction in the pipeline causes the gas to heat up Many existing pipelines in the US are close to reaching their capacity prompting some politicians representing northern states to speak of potential shortages The large trade cost implies that natural gas markets are globally much less integrated causing significant price differences across countries In Western Europe the gas pipeline network is already dense New pipelines are planned or under construction between Western Europe and the Near East or Northern Africa br Whenever gas is bought or sold at custody transfer points rules and agreements are made regarding the gas quality These may include the maximum allowable concentration of CO H S and H O Usually sales quality gas that has been treated to remove contamination is traded on a dry gas basis and is required to be commercially free from objectionable odours materials and dust or other solid or liquid matter waxes gums and gum forming constituents which might damage or adversely affect operation of equipment downstream of the custody transfer point br LNG carrier ships transport liquefied natural gas LNG across oceans while tank trucks can carry LNG or compressed natural gas CNG over shorter distances Sea transport using CNG carrier ships that are now under development may be competitive with LNG transport in specific conditions br Gas is turned into liquid at a liquefaction plant and is returned to gas form at regasification plant at the terminal Shipborne regasification equipment is also used LNG is the preferred form for long distance high volume transportation of natural gas whereas pipeline is preferred for transport for distances up to km mi over land and approximately half that distance offshore br CNG is transported at high pressure typically above bars kPa psi Compressors and decompression equipment are less capital intensive and may be economical in smaller unit sizes than liquefaction regasification plants Natural gas trucks and carriers may transport natural gas directly to end users or to distribution points such as pipelines br br In the past the natural gas which was recovered in the course of recovering petroleum could not be profitably sold and was simply burned at the oil field in a process known as flaring Flaring is now illegal in many countries Additionally higher demand in the last years has made production of gas associated with oil economically viable As a further option the gas is now sometimes re injected into the formation for enhanced oil recovery by pressure maintenance as well as miscible or immiscible flooding Conservation re injection or flaring of natural gas associated with oil is primarily dependent on proximity to markets pipelines and regulatory restrictions br Natural gas can be indirectly exported through the absorption in other physical output The expansion of shale gas production in the US has caused prices to drop relative to other countries This has caused a boom in energy intensive manufacturing sector exports whereby the average dollar unit of US manufacturing exports has almost tripled its energy content between and br A master gas system was invented in Saudi Arabia in the late s ending any necessity for flaring Satellite and nearby infra red camera observations however shows that flaring and venting are still happening in some countries br Natural gas is used to generate electricity and heat for desalination Similarly some landfills that also discharge methane gases have been set up to capture the methane and generate electricity br Natural gas is often stored underground references about geological storage needed inside depleted gas reservoirs from previous gas wells salt domes or in tanks as liquefied natural gas The gas is injected in a time of low demand and extracted when demand picks up Storage nearby end users helps to meet volatile demands but such storage may not always be practicable br With countries accounting for of the worldwide extraction access to natural gas has become an important issue in international politics and countries vie for control of pipelines In the first decade of the st century Gazprom the state owned energy company in Russia engaged in disputes with Ukraine and Belarus over the price of natural gas which have created concerns that gas deliveries to parts of Europe could be cut off for political reasons The United States is preparing to export natural gas br br br Floating liquefied natural gas br Floating liquefied natural gas FLNG is an innovative technology designed to enable the development of offshore gas resources that would otherwise remain untapped due to environmental or economic factors which currently make them impractical to develop via a land based LNG operation FLNG technology also provides a number of environmental and economic advantages br br Environmental Because all processing is done at the gas field there is no requirement for long pipelines to shore compression units to pump the gas to shore dredging and jetty construction and onshore construction of an LNG processing plant which significantly reduces the environmental footprint Avoiding construction also helps preserve marine and coastal environments In addition environmental disturbance will be minimised during decommissioning because the facility can easily be disconnected and removed before being refurbished and re deployed elsewhere br Economic Where pumping gas to shore can be prohibitively expensive FLNG makes development economically viable As a result it will open up new business opportunities for countries to develop offshore gas fields that would otherwise remain stranded such as those offshore East Africa br Many gas and oil companies are considering the economic and environmental benefits of floating liquefied natural gas FLNG There are currently projects underway to construct five FLNG facilities Petronas is close to completion on their FLNG at Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering and are underway on their FLNG project at Samsung Heavy Industries Shell Prelude is due to start production The Browse LNG project will commence FEED in br br br Uses br Natural gas is primarily used in the northern hemisphere North America and Europe are major consumers br Often well head gases require removal of various hydrocarbon molecules contained within the gas Some of these gases include heptane pentane propane and other hydrocarbons with molecular weights above methane CH The natural gas transmission lines extend to the natural gas processing plant or unit which removes the higher molecular weight hydrocarbons to produce natural gas with energy content between megajoules per cubic metre British thermal units per cubic foot The processed natural gas may then be used for residential commercial and industrial uses br br br Mid stream natural gas br Natural gas flowing in the distribution lines is called mid stream natural gas and is often used to power engines which rotate compressors These compressors are required in the transmission line to pressurize and repressurize the mid stream natural gas as the gas travels Typically natural gas powered engines require MJ m BTU cu ft natural gas to operate at the rotational name plate specifications Several methods are used to remove these higher molecular weighted gases for use by the natural gas engine A few technologies are as follows br br Joule Thomson skid br Cryogenic or chiller system br Chemical enzymology system br br br Power generation br br br Domestic use br br In the US over one third of households million homes cook with gas Natural gas dispensed in a residential setting can generate temperatures in excess of C F making it a powerful domestic cooking and heating fuel Stanford scientists estimated that gas stoves emit of the gas they use as unburned methane and that total U S stove emissions are gigagrams of methane In much of the developed world it is supplied through pipes to homes where it is used for many purposes including ranges and ovens heating cooling outdoor and portable grills and central heating Heaters in homes and other buildings may include boilers furnaces and water heaters Both North America and Europe are major consumers of natural gas br Domestic appliances furnaces and boilers use low pressure usually with a standard preassure around kilopascals psi over atmospheric preassure The pressures in the supply lines vary either the standard utilization pressure UP mentioned above or elevated pressure EP which may be anywhere from to kilopascals to psi over atmospheric pressure Systems using EP have a regulator at the service entrance to step down to UP br Natural gas piping systems inside buildings are often designed with pressures of to kilopascals to psi and have downstream pressure regulators to reduce pressure as needed In the United States the maximum allowable operating pressure for natural gas piping systems within a building is based on NFPA National Fuel Gas Code except when approved by the Public Safety Authority or when insurance companies have more stringent requirements br Generally natural gas system pressures are not allowed to exceed psi kPa unless all of the following conditions are met br br The AHJ will allow a higher pressure br The distribution pipe is welded Note Some jurisdictions may also require that welded joints be radiographed to verify continuity br The pipes are closed for protection and placed in a ventilated area that does not allow gas accumulation br The pipe is installed in the areas used for industrial processes research storage or mechanical equipment rooms br Generally a maximum liquefied petroleum gas pressure of psi kPa is allowed provided the building is constructed in accordance with NFPA Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code Chapter br A seismic earthquake valve operating at a pressure of psig bar can stop the flow of natural gas into the site wide natural gas distribution piping network that runs outdoors underground above building roofs and or within the upper supports of a canopy roof Seismic earthquake valves are designed for use at a maximum of psig br In Australia natural gas is transported from gas processing facilities to regulator stations via transmission pipelines Gas is then regulated down to distributed pressures and the gas is distributed around a gas network via gas mains Small branches from the network called services connect individual domestic dwellings or multi dwelling buildings to the network The networks typically range in pressures from kPa low pressure to kPa high pressure Gas is then regulated down to kPa or kPa before being metered and passed to the consumer for domestic use Natural gas mains are made from a variety of materials historically cast iron though more modern mains are made from steel or polyethylene br In some states in the USA natural gas can be supplied by independent natural gas wholesalers suppliers using existing pipeline owners infrastructure through Natural Gas Choice programs br LPG liquefied petroleum gas typically fuels outdoor and portable grills Although compressed natural gas CNG is sparsely available for similar applications in the US in rural areas underserved by the existing pipeline system and distribution network of the less expensive and more abundant LPG liquefied petroleum gas br br br Transportation br CNG is a cleaner and also cheaper alternative to other automobile fuels such as gasoline petrol By the end of there were over million natural gas vehicles worldwide led by Iran million China million Pakistan million Argentina million India million and Brazil million The energy efficiency is generally equal to that of gasoline engines but lower compared with modern diesel engines Gasoline petrol vehicles converted to run on natural gas suffer because of the low compression ratio of their engines resulting in a cropping of delivered power while running on natural gas CNG specific engines however use a higher compression ratio due to this fuel s higher octane number of br Besides use in road vehicles CNG can also be used in aircraft Compressed natural gas has been used in some aircraft like the Aviat Aircraft Husky CNG and the Chromarat VX KittyHawk br LNG is also being used in aircraft Russian aircraft manufacturer Tupolev for instance is running a development program to produce LNG and hydrogen powered aircraft The program has been running since the mid s and seeks to develop LNG and hydrogen variants of the Tu and Tu passenger aircraft and also the Tu cargo aircraft Depending on the current market price for jet fuel and LNG fuel for an LNG powered aircraft could cost rubles US less per tonne roughly with considerable reductions to carbon monoxide hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions br The advantages of liquid methane as a jet engine fuel are that it has more specific energy than the standard kerosene mixes do and that its low temperature can help cool the air which the engine compresses for greater volumetric efficiency in effect replacing an intercooler Alternatively it can be used to lower the temperature of the exhaust br br br Fertilizers br br Natural gas is a major feedstock for the production of ammonia via the Haber process for use in fertilizer production The development of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer has significantly supported global population growth it has been estimated that almost half the people on the Earth are currently fed as a result of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use br br br Hydrogen br br Natural gas can be used to produce hydrogen with one common method being the hydrogen reformer Hydrogen has many applications it is a primary feedstock for the chemical industry a hydrogenating agent an important commodity for oil refineries and the fuel source in hydrogen vehicles br br br Animal and fish feed br Protein rich animal and fish feed is produced by feeding natural gas to Methylococcus capsulatus bacteria on commercial scale br br br Olefins alkenes br Natural gas components alkanes can be converted into olefins alkenes or other chemical synthesis Ethane by oxidative dehydrogenation converts to ethylene which can be further converted to ethylene oxide ethylene glycol acetaldehyde or other olefins Propane by oxidative hydrogenation converts to propylene or can be oxidized to acrylic acid and acrylonitrile br br br Other br Natural gas is also used in the manufacture of fabrics glass steel plastics paint synthetic oil and other products br Fuel for industrial heating and desiccation processes br Raw material for large scale fuel production using gas to liquid GTL process e g to produce sulphur and aromatic free diesel with low emission combustion br br br Health effects br Cooking with natural gas contributes to poor indoor air quality and can lead to severe respiratory diseases such as asthma br br br Environmental effects br br br Greenhouse effect and natural gas release br br Human activity is responsible for about of all methane emissions and for most of the resulting increase in atmospheric methane Natural gas is intentionally released or is otherwise known to leak during the extraction storage transportation and distribution of fossil fuels Globally methane accounts for an estimated of anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming The decomposition of municipal solid waste a source of landfill gas and wastewater account for an additional of such emissions These estimates include substantial uncertainties which should be reduced in the near future with improved satellite measurements such as those planned for MethaneSAT br After release to the atmosphere methane is removed by gradual oxidation to carbon dioxide and water by hydroxyl radicals OH formed in the troposphere or stratosphere giving the overall chemical reaction CH O CO H O While the lifetime of atmospheric methane is relatively short when compared to carbon dioxide with a half life of about years it is more efficient at trapping heat in the atmosphere so that a given quantity of methane has times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide over a year period and times over a year period Natural gas is thus a potent greenhouse gas due to the strong radiative forcing of methane in the short term and the continuing effects of carbon dioxide in the longer term br Targeted efforts to reduce warming quickly by reducing anthropogenic methane emissions is a climate change mitigation strategy supported by the Global Methane Initiative br br br Greenhouse gas emissions br When refined and burned natural gas can produce less carbon dioxide per joule delivered than oil and less than coal It can also produce potentially fewer toxic pollutants than other hydrocarbon fuels However compared to other major fossil fuels natural gas causes more emissions in relative terms during the production and transportation of the fuel meaning that the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions are about higher than the direct emissions from the site of consumption br In terms of the warming effect over years natural gas production and use comprises about one fifth of human greenhouse gas emissions and this contribution is growing rapidly Globally natural gas use emitted about billion tons of CO in including flaring while coal and oil use emitted and billion tons respectively The IEA estimates the energy sector oil natural gas coal and bioenergy to be responsible for about of human methane emissions According to the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report natural gas consumption grew by between and compared to a increase in oil and oil product consumption br The continued financing and construction of new gas pipelines indicates that huge emissions of fossil greenhouse gases could be locked in for to years into the future In the U S state of Texas alone five new long distance gas pipelines have been under construction with the first entering service in and the others scheduled to come online during br br br Installation bans br To reduce its greenhouse emissions the Netherlands is subsidizing a transition away from natural gas for all homes in the country by In Amsterdam no new residential gas accounts have been allowed since and all homes in the city are expected to be converted by to use the excess heat from adjacent industrial buildings and operations br Some cities in the United States have started prohibiting gas hookups for new houses with state laws passed and under consideration to either require electrification or prohibit local requirements New gas appliance hookups are banned in New York State and the Australian Capital Territory Additionally the state of Victoria in Australia has implemented a ban on new natural gas hookups starting from January as part of its gas substitution roadmap br The UK government is also experimenting with alternative home heating technologies to meet its climate goals To preserve their businesses natural gas utilities in the United States have been lobbying for laws preventing local electrification ordinances and are promoting renewable natural gas and hydrogen fuel br br br Other pollutants br Although natural gas produces far lower amounts of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides NOx than other fossil fuels NOx from burning natural gas in homes can be a health hazard br br br Radionuclides br Natural gas extraction also produces radioactive isotopes of polonium Po lead Pb and radon Rn Radon is a gas with initial activity from to becquerels per cubic meter of gas It decays rapidly to Pb which can build up as a thin film in gas extraction equipment br br br Safety concerns br The natural gas extraction workforce face unique health and safety challenges br br br Production br Some gas fields yield sour gas containing hydrogen sulfide H S a toxic compound when inhaled Amine gas treating an industrial scale process which removes acidic gaseous components is often used to remove hydrogen sulfide from natural gas br Extraction of natural gas or oil leads to decrease in pressure in the reservoir Such decrease in pressure in turn may result in subsidence sinking of the ground above Subsidence may affect ecosystems waterways sewer and water supply systems foundations and so on br br br Fracking br br Releasing natural gas from subsurface porous rock formations may be accomplished by a process called hydraulic fracturing or fracking Since the first commercial hydraulic fracturing operation in approximately one million wells have been hydraulically fractured in the United States The production of natural gas from hydraulically fractured wells has used the technological developments of directional and horizontal drilling which improved access to natural gas in tight rock formations Strong growth in the production of unconventional gas from hydraulically fractured wells occurred between and br In hydraulic fracturing well operators force water mixed with a variety of chemicals through the wellbore casing into the rock The high pressure water breaks up or fracks the rock which releases gas from the rock formation Sand and other particles are added to the water as a proppant to keep the fractures in the rock open thus enabling the gas to flow into the casing and then to the surface Chemicals are added to the fluid to perform such functions as reducing friction and inhibiting corrosion After the frack oil or gas is extracted and of the frack fluid i e the mixture of water chemicals sand etc flows back to the surface Many gas bearing formations also contain water which will flow up the wellbore to the surface along with the gas in both hydraulically fractured and non hydraulically fractured wells This produced water often has a high content of salt and other dissolved minerals that occur in the formation br The volume of water used to hydraulically fracture wells varies according to the hydraulic fracturing technique In the United States the average volume of water used per hydraulic fracture has been reported as nearly gallons for vertical oil and gas wells prior to nearly gallons for vertical oil and gas wells between and and nearly million gallons for horizontal gas wells between and br Determining which fracking technique is appropriate for well productivity depends largely on the properties of the reservoir rock from which to extract oil or gas If the rock is characterized by low permeability which refers to its ability to let substances i e gas pass through it then the rock may be considered a source of tight gas Fracking for shale gas which is currently also known as a source of unconventional gas involves drilling a borehole vertically until it reaches a lateral shale rock formation at which point the drill turns to follow the rock for hundreds or thousands of feet horizontally In contrast conventional oil and gas sources are characterized by higher rock permeability which naturally enables the flow of oil or gas into the wellbore with less intensive hydraulic fracturing techniques than the production of tight gas has required The decades in development of drilling technology for conventional and unconventional oil and gas production have not only improved access to natural gas in low permeability reservoir rocks but also posed significant adverse impacts on environmental and public health br The US EPA has acknowledged that toxic carcinogenic chemicals i e benzene and ethylbenzene have been used as gelling agents in water and chemical mixtures for high volume horizontal fracturing HVHF Following the hydraulic fracture in HVHF the water chemicals and frack fluid that return to the well s surface called flowback or produced water may contain radioactive materials heavy metals natural salts and hydrocarbons which exist naturally in shale rock formations Fracking chemicals radioactive materials heavy metals and salts that are removed from the HVHF well by well operators are so difficult to remove from the water they are mixed with and would so heavily pollute the water cycle that most of the flowback is either recycled into other fracking operations or injected into deep underground wells eliminating the water that HVHF required from the hydrologic cycle br Historically low gas prices have delayed the nuclear renaissance as well as the development of solar thermal energy br br br Added odor br In its native state natural gas is colorless and almost odorless In the USA the New London School explosion that occurred in in Texas caused a push for legislation requiring the addition of an odorant to assist consumers in detecting leaks An odorizer with an unpleasant smell such as thiophane or tert Butylthiol t butyl mercaptan may be added Situations have occurred in which an odorant cannot be properly detected by an observer with a normal sense of smell despite being detectable by analytical instruments This is caused by odor masking when one odor overpowers the sensation of another As of the industry is conducting research on the causes of odor masking br br br Risk of explosion br br Explosions caused by natural gas leaks occur a few times each year Individual homes small businesses and other structures are most frequently affected when an internal leak builds up gas inside the structure Leaks often result from excavation work such as when contractors dig and strike pipelines sometimes without knowing any damage resulted Frequently the blast is powerful enough to significantly damage a building but leave it standing In these cases the people inside tend to have minor to moderate injuries Occasionally the gas can collect in high enough quantities to cause a deadly explosion destroying one or more buildings in the process Many building codes now forbid the installation of gas pipes inside cavity walls or below floor boards to mitigate against this risk Gas usually dissipates readily outdoors but can sometimes collect in dangerous quantities if flow rates are high enough However considering the tens of millions of structures that use the fuel the individual risk of using natural gas is low br br br Risk of carbon monoxide inhalation br Natural gas heating systems may cause carbon monoxide poisoning if unvented or poorly vented Improvements in natural gas furnace designs have greatly reduced CO poisoning concerns Detectors are also available that warn of carbon monoxide or explosive gases such as methane and propane br br br Energy content statistics and pricing br br Quantities of natural gas are measured in standard cubic meters cubic meter of gas at temperature C F and pressure kPa psi or standard cubic feet cubic foot of gas at temperature F and pressure psi kPa standard cubic meter standard cubic feet The gross heat of combustion of commercial quality natural gas is around MJ m kWh cu ft but this can vary by several percent This is about to MJ kg depending on the density For comparison the heat of combustion of pure methane is MJ per standard cubic metre or MJ kg br Except in the European Union the U S and Canada natural gas is sold in gigajoule retail units LNG liquefied natural gas and LPG liquefied petroleum gas are traded in metric tonnes kg or million BTU as spot deliveries Long term natural gas distribution contracts are signed in cubic meters and LNG contracts are in metric tonnes The LNG and LPG is transported by specialized transport ships as the gas is liquified at cryogenic temperatures The specification of each LNG LPG cargo will usually contain the energy content but this information is in general not available to the public The European Union aimed to cut its gas dependency on Russia by two thirds in br In August possibly the largest natural gas discovery in history was made and notified by an Italian gas company ENI The energy company indicated that it has unearthed a supergiant gas field in the Mediterranean Sea covering about square miles km This was named the Zohr gas field and could hold a potential trillion cubic feet billion cubic meters of natural gas ENI said that the energy is about billion barrels of oil equivalent BOE GJ The Zohr field was found in the deep waters off the northern coast of Egypt and ENI claims that it will be the largest ever in the Mediterranean and even the world br br br European Union br Gas prices for end users vary greatly across the EU A single European energy market one of the key objectives of the EU should level the prices of gas in all EU member states Moreover it would help to resolve supply and global warming issues as well as strengthen relations with other Mediterranean countries and foster investments in the region Qatar has been asked by the US to supply emergency gas to the EU in case of supply disruptions in the Russo Ukrainian crisis br br br United States br br In US units one standard cubic foot L of natural gas produces around British thermal units kJ The actual heating value when the water formed does not condense is the net heat of combustion and can be as much as less br In the United States retail sales are often in units of therms th therm BTU Gas sales to domestic consumers are often in units of standard cubic feet scf Gas meters measure the volume of gas used and this is converted to therms by multiplying the volume by the energy content of the gas used during that period which varies slightly over time The typical annual consumption of a single family residence is therms or one Residential Customer Equivalent RCE Wholesale transactions are generally done in decatherms Dth thousand decatherms MDth or million decatherms MMDth A million decatherms is a trillion BTU roughly a billion cubic feet of natural gas br The price of natural gas varies greatly depending on location and type of consumer The typical caloric value of natural gas is roughly BTU per cubic foot depending on gas composition Natural gas in the United States is traded as a futures contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange Each contract is for million BTU or billion BTU GJ Thus if the price of gas is million BTU on the NYMEX the contract is worth br br br Canada br br Canada uses metric measure for internal trade of petrochemical products Consequently natural gas is sold by the gigajoule GJ cubic meter m or thousand cubic meters E m Distribution infrastructure and meters almost always meter volume cubic foot or cubic meter Some jurisdictions such as Saskatchewan sell gas by volume only Other jurisdictions such as Alberta gas is sold by the energy content GJ In these areas almost all meters for residential and small commercial customers measure volume m or ft and billing statements include a multiplier to convert the volume to energy content of the local gas supply br A gigajoule GJ is a measure approximately equal to litres barrels of oil or m or cu ft or million BTUs of gas The energy content of gas supply in Canada can vary from to MJ m to BTU cu ft depending on gas supply and processing between the wellhead and the customer br br br Adsorbed natural gas ANG br Natural gas may be stored by adsorbing it to the porous solids called sorbents The optimal condition for methane storage is at room temperature and atmospheric pressure Pressures up to MPa about times atmospheric pressure will yield greater storage capacity The most common sorbent used for ANG is activated carbon AC
