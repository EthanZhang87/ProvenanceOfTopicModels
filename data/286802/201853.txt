Engine displacement is the measure of the cylinder volume swept by all of the pistons of a piston engine excluding the combustion chambers It is commonly used as an expression of an engine s size and by extension as an indicator of the power through mean effective pressure and rotational speed an engine might be capable of producing and the amount of fuel it should be expected to consume For this reason displacement is one of the measures often used in advertising as well as regulating motor vehicles br It is usually expressed using the metric units of cubic centimetres cc or cm equivalent to millilitres or litres l or L or particularly in the United States cubic inches CID cu in or in br br br Definition br The overall displacement for a typical reciprocating piston engine is calculated by multiplying together three values the distance travelled by the piston the stroke length the circular area of the cylinder and the number of cylinders in the whole engine br The formula is br br br br br br Displacement br br br br stroke length br br br br br br br br br bore br br br br br br br br br br br br number of cylinders br br br br displaystyle text Displacement text stroke length times pi left frac text bore right times text number of cylinders br br br Using this formula for non typical types of engine such as the Wankel design and the oval piston type used in Honda NR motorcycles can sometimes yield misleading results when attempting to compare engines Manufacturers and regulators may develop and use specialised formulae to determine a comparative nominal displacement for variant engine types br br br Governmental regulations br br In several countries fees and taxes levied on road vehicles by transport authorities are scaled in proportion to engine displacement In countries where this is practised vehicle manufacturers often seek to increase power output through higher revving engines or turbocharging instead of increasing the displacement br Examples of countries where the road taxes are based upon engine displacement br br In some European countries and which predates the EU there is one charge for engines over litre and another at the level of about litres br In the United Kingdom cars registered after March are taxed based on the exhaust emissions However cars registered before this date are taxed based on engine displacement Cars under cm qualify for a lower tax rate br In Japan the engine displacement is one of the factors along with overall vehicle size and power output used to determine the vehicle size class and therefore the cost of road tax for the vehicle br In France and some other EU countries mopeds with a displacement of less than cc cu in can be driven with minimum qualifications This led to all light motorbikes having a displacement of about cm br In many areas of the United States Canada except Quebec Australia and New Zealand the road taxes are not based on engine displacement However the engine displacement is often used in low powered scooters or mopeds to determine whether a licence is required to operate the vehicle A common threshold is cc cu in br Wankel engines are able to produce higher power levels for a given displacement Therefore they are generally taxed as times their stated physical displacement litres becomes effectively becomes effectively although actual power outputs can be higher than suggested by this conversion factor The nominal displacement of a Wankel engine is times smaller than the physical displacement but this is compensated by the fact that the shaft has times the rotational speed of the rotor The nominal displacement is the swept volume of a single chamber br br br Automotive model names br Historically many car model names have included their engine displacement Examples include the Cadillac Series powered by a Cubic inch litre engine and the BMW a litre engine and Lexus LS with a cc engine This was especially common in US muscle cars like the Ford Mustang Boss and and later GT L The Plymouth Roadrunner and the Chevrolet Chevelle SS and br However trends towards downsizing and hybrid electric drivetrains since have resulted in far fewer model names being based on the engine displacement br br br See also br Active Fuel Management br Bore engine br Compression ratio br Stroke engine br Variable displacement br br br
