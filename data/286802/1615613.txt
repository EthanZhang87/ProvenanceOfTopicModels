id: 1615613
A reciprocating saw is a type handheld small machine powered saw in which the cutting action is achieved through a push and pull reciprocating or back and forth motion of the blade The original trade name Sawzall is often used in the United States where Milwaukee Electric Tool first produced a tool of this type in br The adjective Sawzall is commonly applied to a smaller type of chargeable or battery powered handheld saw used in construction and demolition work as well as in gardening and the pruning of larger trees or plants This type of saw also known as a hognose recip saw or sawsaw has a large blade resembling that of a jigsaw and a handle oriented to allow the saw to be used comfortably on vertical surfaces The typical design of this tool has a foot at the base of the blade also similar to that of a jigsaw The user holds or rests the foot on the surface being cut thus countering the tendency of the blade to push away from or pull towards the cut as it travels through its movement br br br Design br Designs range widely in power speed and features from less powerful portable handheld models that are usually shaped like a cordless drill to high powered high speed corded models designed for heavy construction and demolition work Modern reciprocating saws almost all have adjustable speed setting either via trigger sensitivity or with a dial Another feature that has become important to the way these saws are used is the inclusion of an orbital action consisting of oscillating the traversed reciprocation in an up and down fashion perpendicular to the motion of cut causing the tip of the blade to move in an oval pattern up and down as well as back and forth This feature is primarily for wood or the pruning of tree branches allowing quick cuts br A reciprocating saw is a popular tool used by many window fitters gardeners landscape architects and construction workers as well as emergency rescue workers Variants and accessories are available for specialized uses such as clamps and long blades for cutting large pipes br Blades are available for a variety of materials and uses common blades include those designed for cutting metal wood composites or drywall among other materials Furthermore most of these blade types come with a variety of tooth designs intended for special purposes such as plant and shrub pruning demolition work clean cutting or use on contaminated materials Abrasive coated blades are also available for hard materials like tile rock or stone br The term reciprocating saw or oscillating saw is also applied generically to any saw which cuts with a back and forth motion These include br br Jigsaw br Scroll saw br Sabre saw br Rotary reciprocating saw br Powered reciprocating tools are also found in surgery and dental surgery where they are used in operations that require cutting or grinding of bone br br br Mechanism br br The reciprocating action may be produced in several ways A crank or Scotch yoke type drive may be used a swashplate type drive a captive cam or eccentric barrel cam or other rotary to linear drive Modern tools are built with variants of all of these mechanisms Eccentric cam crank and scotch yoke drives need balance weights to reduce vibration in the plane of the rotating element and may still exhibit vibration that is objectionable to a user of a handheld saw and can lead to difficulty in controlling a cut The swash plate drive has the advantage that there is little rotational out of balance so the principal vibration is in line with the blade This is generally controllable by keeping the foot of a handheld tool against the work br br br See also br Power hacksaw br br br br br br External links br NIOSH Sound Power and Vibrations Database Archived at the Wayback Machine br New York City Construction Quiet Vendor Guidelines Archived at the Wayback Machine
