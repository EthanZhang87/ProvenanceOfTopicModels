title: Autogas
id: 2622651
Autogas or LPG is liquefied petroleum gas LPG used as a fuel in internal combustion engines in vehicles as well as in stationary applications such as generators It is a mixture of propane and butane br Autogas is widely used as a green fuel as its use reduces CO exhaust emissions by around compared to petrol One litre of petrol produces kg of CO when burnt whereas the equivalent amount of autogas litres due to the lower density of autogas produces only kg of CO when burnt CO emissions are lower compared to petrol and NOx by It has an octane rating MON RON that is between and and an energy content higher heating value HHV that is between megajoules per litre for pure propane and megajoules per litre for pure butane depending upon the actual fuel composition br Autogas is the third most popular automotive fuel in the world with approximately million of million passenger cars powered using the fuel representing less than of the total market share Approximately half of all autogas fueled passenger vehicles are in the five largest markets in descending order Turkey South Korea Poland Italy and Australia br br br Terminology variations and confusion br In countries where petroleum spirits is called petrol rather than gasoline it is common for autogas to be simply referred to as gas This can be confusing for people from countries where petrol is called gasoline as they often use gas as an abbreviation of gasoline br In the United States autogas is more commonly known under the name of its primary constituent propane In the Propane Education and Research Council adopted the term Propane Autogas to refer to LPG used in on road motor vehicles br In the UK the terms LPG and autogas are used interchangeably In Australia and the Netherlands the common term is LPG In Italy and France GPL an acronym for Italian gas di petrolio liquefatto or French gaz de p trole liqu fi is used In Spain the term GLP gas licuado del petr leo is used br In Asian countries particularly those with historical American influences such as the Philippines the term autogas is not commonly recognised as a generic term and the use of the terms LPG or autoLPG is more widely used by consumers especially by taxi drivers many of whom use converted vehicles The converted vehicles are commonly called LPG vehicles or LPG cars br br br Difficulties with LPG as automotive fuel br Despite LPG being widely used as a fuel for cars motorists in need of autogas can sometimes face difficulties especially in remote areas and in places where supply and demand are low Therefore they may need to plan their journeys around access to stations where LPG can reliably be obtained Some autogas fuel systems handle this with parallel autogas and petrol mechanisms in vehicles allowing either autogas or petrol to be used at any given time br br br History br br Internal combustion engines fuelled by gases date from at least with the work of Samuel Brown in London By Hanover had an autogas station br and a trial run took place with trucks travelling between Moscow and Leningrad in the same year Initial use depended largely on the types of different alternative fuels available and on their cost More widespread application of autogas in transport systems came in the s especially for taxis notably in the Netherlands Italy Bangkok and Istanbul br and buses br br br Vehicle manufacturers br Toyota made a number of LPG only engines in their s M R and Y engine families br A number of automobile manufacturers Citro n Fiat Ford Hyundai General Motors including Daewoo Holden Opel Vauxhall Saab Maruti Suzuki Peugeot Renault including Dacia Skoda Tata Motors Toyota Volvo and more recently Volkswagen have OEM bi fuel models that will run equally well on both LPG and petrol Holden Special Vehicles HSV also offer bi fuel models however the vehicles use a different system from that of their donor vehicles from Holden with HSV using technology from Orbital Autogas Systems which injects the autogas into the engine as a liquid instead of a gas for increased efficiency Since Holden s Commodore range sedan wagon and ute has been offered as a dedicated LPG vehicle with an aluminium fuel tank in place of the petrol tank br Petrol engined cars trucks and buses which have not been fitted with LPG autogas systems by the manufacturers can usually accept third party systems to enable them to use either LPG or petrol ROUSH CleanTech manufactures designs engineers manufactures and installs propane autogas fuel systems for medium duty Ford commercial vehicles and Type A and Type C Blue Bird school buses br Vialle manufacture OEM LPG powered scooters and LPG powered mopeds that run equally well on LPG Ford Australia have offered an LPG only variant of their Falcon model since br br br br br br br br br br br br Countries br br Autogas enjoys great popularity in numerous countries and territories including Australia the European Union Hong Kong India the Philippines Northern Macedonia South Korea Serbia Sri Lanka and Turkey It is also available at larger petrol stations in several countries In Armenia for example the transport ministry estimates as many as to of vehicles use autogas because it offers a very cheap alternative to both diesel and petrol being less than half the price of petrol and some cheaper than diesel The recent rises in oil derived fuel prices has significantly increased the difference br br br Algeria br Since the s the Algerian government has pursued a policy to promote the use of autogas in Algeria The two main incentives for the government to put this policy into action were to take advantage of the large LPG production and to reduce urban pollution At the end of there were approximately autogas powered vehicles on the roads supported by over refuelling stations br The Algerian government fixes the prices of all automotive fuels Autogas is priced in Algeria at of the price of diesel making it an affordable option br br br Australia br LPG was popular in Australia because it was less than half the price of petrol in urban areas approx A per litre as opposed to A per litre for unleaded fuel and A per litre for diesel in February and it is locally produced br The popularity of automotive LPG is declining as more motorists purchase hybrid electric cars local car manufacturing that offered LPG as a factory option ceased and a federal government excise on LPG commenced in making the fuel more expensive br The two major local manufacturers Ford and Holden when they used to manufacture cars in Australia production ceasing in and respectively used to offer factory fitted autogas in some models of their locally made large cars and commercial vehicles Mitsubishi Australia formerly manufactured factory fitted autogas vehicles locally but ceased manufacturing in All factory autogas vehicles with the exception of the E Gas Ford Falcon model were bi fuel vehicles meaning they have the capability to run on either petrol autogas or a combination br Holden Special Vehicles offered a different autogas system from its parent Holden that injects the autogas into the engine as a liquid allowing for higher efficiency br All Ford LPG vehicles that were locally made used liquid injected LPG and developed kW more than the petrol equivalent br There are approximately autogas powered cars on Australia s roads The number of LPG Dual fuel vehicles continues to decrease falling by between and Over the same period the number of registered electric vehicles increased by to br There has been a corresponding reduction in the number of LPG refuelling locations less than in down from several years prior br Whilst historically autogas was excise free it began being imposed on all vehicle fuels that were not previously subject to excise in and was added incrementally up to The excise on autogas started at cents per litre in and reached cents per litre in By comparison the excise on petrol remained at its existing cents per litre The additional excise on autogas is offset somewhat by a subsidy that was implemented in for private motorists paying either A to convert their existing vehicle to autogas or A for purchasing a new vehicle that was manufactured to operate on autogas The subsidy does not apply to business vehicles or vehicles with a gross vehicle mass of over kilograms In addition to the subsidy provided by the Australian federal government the Western Australian government also provides a A subsidy under the long running LPG subsidy scheme br br br Belgium br The use of autogas called LPG in both French and Dutch speaking Belgium was once very popular in Belgium thanks to the subsidies given by the government to install conversion kits Since when the subsidies disappeared the number of cars running on LPG has decreased and the number of cars running on diesel has increased This was partly due to the tax incentives to purchase diesel cars In recent years the use of autogas as a vehicle fuel has accounted for less than of vehicle fuel use in Belgium At the end of there was an estimate of autogas powered vehicles on Belgium supported by refuelling stations In there were cars equipped with LPG and in it went down to Since there has been a slight increase in the number of autogas powered vehicles of around This increase is mainly due to the phasing out of the tax incentives to buy diesel cars The number of refuelling stations equipped with LPG has increased and in there were stations br In Belgium autogas is totally free of excises but not of VAT As of June the price of a litre of autogas is around a third of the price of a litre of diesel making it the cheapest car fuel available in Belgium This is a strong incentive for cross border LPG refuelling traffic with neighbouring countries especially with France where LPG is much more expensive br To compensate for the loss of tax revenue Belgian cars equipped with LPG pay a higher road tax than petrol or compressed natural gas CNG cars In a Government s effort to incentivate the use of LPG cars the registration tax paid by LPG cars is lower than the registration tax of CNG petrol and diesel cars because Thus since brand new LPG cars and LPG cars with less than one year of age benefit from an important reduction in registration duty br Despite the fact that autogas is excise free in Belgium it is the cheapest car fuel in Belgium and that it enjoys an important reduction in registration duty autogas has never reached again the levels of use that it once had in the s Belgium does not provide with subsidies for LPG or CNG car installations The current subsidies provided to CNG car installations since are provided by the natural gas private industry br Since OPEL is the only distributor that still sells brand new factory installed LPG cars in Belgium br br br Bulgaria br Autogas consumption in Bulgaria accounted for the total fuel consumption in an amount which has tripled since By the end of there were an estimated autogas powered vehicles on the road with around refuelling stations Autogas is also very popular with commercial users in Bulgaria as of minibuses and taxicabs were able to run on the fuel Vehicles originally manufactured to operate on autogas are virtually non existent in Bulgaria so the vast majority of the vehicles are third party conversions br br br Canada br br Autogas or auto propane as it is more commonly referred to in Canada is the most popular alternative fuel in the country It is primarily used by high consumption public and private fleets taxis couriers school buses and transit vehicles br Canadian auto propane demand began to increase dramatically in the s after the Government of Canada introduced a CA grant in for consumers to convert their vehicles to run on propane in response to national energy security concerns Some provinces also offered various grants and incentives for propane conversions Vehicle conversions reached approximately in the early s and auto propane was estimated to be available at over locations The Federal Government grant was discontinued in Auto propane demand began to decline in the early s due to changes in technology and relatively low cost of gasoline and diesel fuel br An increase in demand has occurred since as a result of lower prices relative to gasoline and diesel fuel and improved technology In it is estimated that the number of auto propane vehicles on the road in Canada is between and the number of fuelling stations is In auto propane amounted to of the total domestic propane consumption in Canada br Auto propane is desirable for fleets due to the fact that in many cities in Canada it costs about less than gasoline and diesel Auto propane also enjoys favourable fuel tax status and is exempt from the federal excise tax and is taxed at a lower rate than gasoline and diesel in every province and territory Average auto propane prices are reported by Natural Resources Canada br The only OEM vehicle available for purchase in Canada is the Blue Bird Corporation Propane Powered Vision Others are pending Aftermarket conversions represent the balance of the market These conversions are typically performed on gasoline vehicles and may be either mono fuel propane only or dual fuel operate on propane or gasoline These conversions are performed in accordance to provincial and territorial regulations and the Canadian Standards Association CSA B Installation code for propane fuel systems and tanks on highway vehicles br Another propane option gaining some popularity is diesel blend where propane is blended into the diesel fuel as it is injected into the combustion chamber This reduces diesel consumption and improves emissions br The cost to convert a vehicle to propane in Canada is approximately CA to CA for the current vapour or liquid fuel injected technology and fleet users can expect a payback on the conversion cost within a year Converting a vehicle to propane is approximately half the cost of converting a vehicle to natural gas in Canada In just about every case a propane dispensing facility will cost significantly less money than any other fuel including gasoline or diesel Installing a propane fuelling station will typically cost up to less than a natural gas fuelling station A typical USWG dispenser will cost approximately CA and a larger high volume dispenser with a USWG tank will cost CA to CA not including site costs br br br China br br Autogas consumption in China has grown rapidly since the s has slowed down in the early s but has started to grow again in recent years In autogas refuelling stations have spread to cities and has become a major alternative fuel in China Motorcycles account for a large portion of the autogas with over autogas motorcycles in Shanghai alone In Shenyang the local government is encouraging public transport to convert to autogas and as of over taxicabs run on the fuel as well as over buses The city of Guangzhou accounted for of national autogas consumption in Only of China s Liquefied Petroleum Gas is produced domestically br br br Croatia br As of approximately Croatians drove using autogas which at the time was available from stations throughout the nation In it was estimated that there were autogas powered cars on Croatia s roads and in it is estimated that drivers in Croatia were using autogas This recent increase in popularity has largely been attributed to the lower price of autogas compared to petrol or diesel br In Croatia exported of domestically produced liquefied petroleum gas LPG leaving only for consumption Out of that of domestically sold LPG is used as autogas Damir Stambuk from the Croatian Ministry of Economy which is also responsible for energy said that Croatia is not yet ready for a regular autogas market due to a small network of stations but in the future it will be br br br Czech Republic br At the end of the roads of the Czech Republic had an estimated autogas vehicles with refuelling stations br br br Denmark br Autogas has become uncommon in Denmark since taxes have risen making LPG more expensive than unleaded petrol As a result there is no customer demand leaving only around refuelling stations The stations are run by Shell YX OK Uno X Q and Statoil br br br France br It was estimated that France would have over autogas vehicles on the road by the end of By the end of there were an estimated autogas vehicles in use with almost refuelling stations In autogas accounted for around of the total automotive fuel use br br br Germany br br In Germany the fuel is called Autogas as well CNG is known as Erdgas There were fuel stations selling autogas in supplying about registered gas fuelled cars per cent of all cars in Germany mylpg eu lists stations in In addition to filling stations numerous suppliers of industrial gas run dedicated autogas stations on their premises Most filling pumps use the ACME adapter but DISH can also be found Special fuel tax rates make autogas rather cheap in Germany about per litre while octane unleaded is per litre br br br Greece br LPG or autogas despite having existed for about three decades in Greece initially used only in taxis in it was legalized for all vehicles has become popular in the last three to five years mostly due to the increase in petrol prices The number of refuelling points as well as conversion workshops is rapidly increasing Currently there are about filling stations Some companies e g Fiat Toyota Subaru Opel Chevrolet offer some models with bi fuel capability The price at the end of was about of the price of petrol The most common term used for it is ygraerio meaning liquid gas br br br Hong Kong br In Hong Kong all taxicabs bar electric taxis rely on autogas Many public light buses also rely on autogas br br br Ireland br Autogas was very popular in Ireland during the early s and the country had a large and extensive network of refuelling points It proved popular at the time particularly as Ireland was in a deep recession for much of the s However autogas fell out of favor in the late s and s due to unreliable early autogas systems and as the country experienced massive economic growth and unprecedented wealth demand for conversions and autogas subsequently dwindled br However as Ireland once again entered economic recession austerity measures and increased fuel taxation saw the price of traditional Diesel and petrol fuels skyrocket to record highs This has seen a small revival of autogas in Ireland in with new conversion outlets and refueling points opening again It has been re introduced to Ireland by the new Polish diaspora living in the country drawing upon their knowledge and expertise from Europe s biggest autogas market br There is a much larger market for Autogas in Northern Ireland due to UK Government supports There are currently LPG outlets on the island of Ireland with in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland br br br Italy br Autogas is very popular in Italy With over autogas vehicles on the road it is the second largest autogas market in the European Union after Poland Italy was one of the first countries in the world to introduce autogas which happened in the s In the first half of alone more than new autogas cars were registered General Motors has been especially successful in Italy with two thirds of the vehicles sold in being autogas capable br Self fill is not permitted in Italy br br br Japan br br As of Japan has about autogas vehicles on the road which is less than in recent years However the number of autogas vehicles on Japan s roads has been very unstable The first autogas taxicabs were introduced in Japan in the s and s With a sharp decline in the s the number started to rise again in Between and the number dropped The vast majority of autogas vehicles on Japanese roads are taxicabs or commercial vehicles This is why in the Japan LP Gas Association started an initiative to encourage corporations and motorists alike to switch to autogas vehicles The initiative involves Japanese retailers to introduce an autogas vehicle into their fleet every three years Many of these corporations already have autogas vehicles but Makoto Arahata from the Japanese LP Gas Association says that there is still much room for improvement br br br Lithuania br Lithuania is one of the countries with the highest rates of autogas use in Europe Autogas is very popular in Lithuania and it is widely available The distribution of most car brands are in the hands of the Polish distributors therefore factory installed LPG in brand new cars are as common and widely available as they are in Poland br br br Malta br Autogas was introduced to Malta on May by Liquigas The first filling station is located at the Malta International Airport br br br Netherlands br br Use of autogas has varied in the Netherlands It went up in the s and has decreased ever since except for an increase in In there are around autogas vehicles on the road total cars being a little less than million br Autogas is sold at most fuel stations stations in urban areas may not supply it due to safety regulations with regard to LPG storage tanks The Dutch Bayonet is the standard filling device used br The road tax on autogas vehicles can be up to times that of petrol powered vehicles On the modern third generation G autogas systems the difference on tax is zero for cars up to kg but increases for heavier cars The diesel tax is twice the petrol tax Because the price of autogas is less than half that of petrol fitting a car with an LPG system is only economically feasible at more than around km year br br br New Zealand br br LPG has modest popularity in New Zealand among road users and reached its peak during the period immediately following the oil crises of the s As part of his Think Big policies to encourage energy self sufficiency Rob Muldoon heavily subsidised the construction of LPG infrastructure during the late s and early s br br br Pakistan br LPG was allowed to be used as an automotive fuel in and first Autogas station became operative in located at Sialkot br Up until there were only four Autogas stations operating in Pakistan serving around vehicles LPG failed to attract attention of the investors and customers due to extremely cheap prices of CNG as Pakistan had huge Natural Gas reserves Pakistan in a decade became the largest consumer of CNG This impacted Pakistan s reserves in a negative way and they receded in a quick span In November Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority issued about NoC s for setting up LPG Autogas stations mainly to PSO a State owned Petroleum giant However in December Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority OGRA contrary to the rest of the world where LPG is promoted declared LPG a risk to public safety thus banned LPG to be used in Public transport vehicles thus closing the era of LPG in Pakistan even before it started br br br Poland br br Poland has one of the oldest and most successful autogas markets in Europe It is the country with the highest rate of LPG use per capita higher even than Italy In there were autogas refuelling stations and autogas vehicles on the road The number of autogas vehicles in Poland increased by in however autogas sales decreased by This is mostly due to older vehicles being replaced with newer more fuel efficient ones Almost half of Poland s LPG comes from Russia Most of the Polish distributors offer brand new factory installed LPG cars of mostly all brands br br br Russian Federation br br br Autogas is widely used in Russia In its modern form it has been used since the s when high oil prices and difficulties in economically producing lightweight diesel engines motivated the CPSU to try autogas in light trucks and buses with carburettor engines There are two types of autogas equipment and autogas stations as well LPG propane butane mix and compressed natural gas CNG methane Natural gas is stored at a higher pressure than LPG bar vs bar for LPG br The main consumer of LPG is commercial light weight cargo transport so as GAZelles in Russia are mostly LPG powered There are some community supported sources where people post gas station locations on the map These sources may be used by some travelers going to Russia by car First limited series of vehicles driven by multi fuel including methane has appeared in the middle of the th century br As of the number of autogas vehicles in Russia is actively growing Some are built in the factory to use autogas and some are retrofitted existing vehicles The average cost of a litre of petrol and diesel fuel in Russia is about per litre The cost of a litre of LPG is from to while fuel consumption is almost the same In LPG prices fell down since January to per litre or even till in some regions br There are a number of incentives also provided for owners to convert their cars to use autogas There is also a huge disparity in the rate of development of methane and propane gas stations The owners of gas vehicles themselves are very fond of their cars for the low cost of operation but often complain about the inconvenience of placing cylinders in the cabin as well as the fact that if for example the old Volga costs about then its gasification can cost twice as much But gasification of new cars as already mentioned in the article is possible directly from the factory or by official dealers of car brands br CNG is more commonly used for commercial passenger transport taxis city buses Although the Russian government subsidizes conversion of petrol powered vehicles to CNG by reimbursement of the majority of its price CNG equipment costs twice more as LPG it is not popular among private car owners because CNG tanks are much larger than LPG tanks and CNG stations are not common LPG stations are as common as petrol and diesel stations br br br Serbia br Serbia has a well developed autogas market Many petrol powered vehicles from the s s and early s both locally made cars such as Yugos and imports from Western Europe have been converted to LPG Autogas systems used in Serbia are mostly from Italian companies like Lovato and Tartarini As of August LPG is approximately cheaper per litre than petrol It is available at petrol stations in the cities and along major routes as well as some dedicated stations br br br South Korea br South Korea had the world s largest Autogas market which peaked in As of the country has a fleet of million registered autogas powered cars with refueling stations A large portion of the autogas fleet is light duty vehicles used for commercial ends such as taxis and rental cars br br br Spain br Autogas called GLP in Spain was restricted by law to taxis and public transport buses for many decades In recent years the market has been liberalised and autogas has been made available to all kinds of vehicles The Spanish government subsidises the installations of autogas in cars and the purchase of brand new factory installed autogas cars There are many factory installed autogas brand new cars available for purchase While the number of autogas powered cars is increasing every year it is still low The main barrier for a major expansion of the number of autogas powered cars is that the number of refuelling stations for autogas is also still low but it is increasing quickly too By the end of there were stations selling autogas in Spain Spain is currently the only country using the new EU wide common standard connector for autogas the Euroconnector or Euronozzle adapter The Euronozzle adapter was supposed to replace the current three different LPG filling systems ACME Bajonet and Dish in Europe but that would be expensive so investments in such a change over have not started yet Before Euronozzle Spain used a form of Bajonet Spain s neighbouring countries France and Portugal continue to use Dish adapters for filling vehicles up with LPG br br br Thailand br Thailand has for over years run LPG taxi cabs in Bangkok though autos and buses had erroneously labelled NGV stickers when in fact they were LPG A low cost local modification industry had sprung up in Thailand with costs of conversion as low as US as well as strong local knowhow to avoid its major safety issues By half of all taxicabs had switched from gasoline to LPG by low cost local modification Despite a government push the number of LPG vehicles continues to grow and outpace NGVs The number of autogas vehicles has continues to see high growth despite a push for operators to switch to NGV CNG there has been considerable resistance due to inherent costs As of January Thailand has LPG fueled vehicles and consumed tonnes in of LPG while stations serve some CNG vehicles br br br Turkey br Turkey has the highest percentage of autogas vehicles in the world Some of passenger cars run on autogas and autogas consumption now exceeds petrol consumption The Turkish government regulated the autogas price to provide consumers with a net economic advantage of As of the end of there are autogas fueling stations around the country and market growth has been supported by a network of licensed conversion shops br According to the Turkish Statistics Institute s report the nation had over vehicles in January are passenger vehicles light weight trucks motorcycles tractors heavy weight trucks mini buses for transportation buses and special purpose vehicles br Currently average new generation cars are sold per month br LPG is dominantly used in Turkey as an autogas while there are only around CNG fuelled cars and there are only two CNG filling stations br In Turkey Diesel vehicles are usually not converted to LPG because of unsuccessful applications in the past For that reason installations are often not made to light and heavy weight trucks tractors bus and mini buses and motorcycles because the owners of conversion workshops are fearful of the risks br million LPG cars are passenger vehicles of the passenger cars are diesel powered and are petrol powered As there is no conversion to diesel cars among petrol powered passenger cars According to the reports of the MMO Chamber of Mechanical Engineers authorized to check emissions and licenses there were million LPG fuelled vehicles by the end of the year br This means more than of petrol powered passenger vehicles are already converted to LPG br The converted vehicles were mostly carburetted engines Nearly of the old carburetted engines have already been converted and day by day new generation vehicle owners are also choosing LPG as an alternative fuel br The reason of this high LPG application is because of the Turkish government s application of high taxes upon petrol and diesel prices and because of these taxes Turkey finds itself using the second most expensive petrol in the world after Norway even though Turkey has borders with OPEC countries exporting crude oil and petroleum to the world and has the lowest transportation costs Turkish people found the only solution to save money from their road expenses by converting their cars to autogas which gives them an advantage of to savings br This big conversion is the success of Turkish autogas kits and autogas tanks manufacturers starting from even though autogas use became legal in At the same time Italian companies also supplied systems through several companies br br br Ukraine br Ukraine has a well developed autogas market Many petrol powered vehicles from the s s and s both locally made cars such as ZAZ and imports from Western Europe have been converted to LPG One may also buy a factory prepared LPG car As of August LPG is approximately times cheaper per litre than petrol It is widely available at petrol stations in the cities and along major routes as well as some dedicated stations br br br United Kingdom br According to the LPG trade association in the UK there are about refuelling stations that cater for the LPG powered vehicles on UK roads This represents less than of vehicles br The only Government incentive to use LPG is the lower road fuel tax applied to LPG compared to petrol As of January the saving of about pence per litre is the highest it has ever been and that combined with conversion prices being an historic low should result in an increase in LPG conversions br Technology has reached the point where almost all conversions are Sequential Vapour Injection and in the UK there is a large number of kits with various price and quality ranges to choose from resulting in a very competitive market br br br United States br br Autogas is on the rise in the United States As of February the United States has more than autogas vehicles on the road accounting for just of the world s total and as of June the United States has autogas fueling stations making it easier for drivers to refuel across the country The U S Department of Energy has a website that autogas drivers can easily locate autogas fueling stations near them as well as other alternative fuels The cost of converting a car to use petrol or autogas at a turn of a knob starts from US Autogas use by car drivers can help the United States to reduce dependence on foreign oil as of all U S Autogas is produced in the U S br In a provision was enacted that placed a cent per gallon tax credit on propane autogas as part of H R making it per gallon cheaper than petrol on average The alternative fuel credit was extended in and remained in effect until the end of br Autogas for America claims to be the unified voice of the autogas industry in the United States Composed of autogas experts transportation industry specialists and environmental advocates Autogas for America says it leverages industry cooperation to widen recognition of autogas among the US public media and government br The Alternative Fuel Association of America based in New York is the largest association of its kind it give incentives of up to to the owners of fleets who retrofit their vehicle to autogas the Association works closely with CNG and LPG Max of America one of the pioneer companies in the LPG and CNG conversions in America br Piston powered small aircraft that use autogas require a Supplemental Type Certificate issued by the United States Federal Aviation Administration br br br System types br br The different autogas systems generally use the same type of filler tanks lines and fittings but use different components in the engine bay Liquid injection systems use special tanks with circulation pumps and return lines similar to petrol fuel injection systems br There are three basic types of autogas system The oldest of these is the conventional converter and mixer system which has existed since the s and is still widely used today The other two types are known as injection systems but there are significant differences between the two br A converter mixer system uses a converter to change liquid fuel from the tank into vapour then feeds that vapour to the mixer where it is mixed with the intake air This is also known as a venturi system or single point system br Vapour phase injection systems also use a converter but unlike the mixer system the gas exits the converter at a regulated pressure The gas is then injected into the air intake manifold via a series of electrically controlled injectors The injector opening times are controlled by the autogas control unit This unit works in much the same way as a petrol fuel injection control unit This allows much more accurate metering of fuel to the engine than is possible with mixers improving economy and or power while reducing emissions br Liquid phase injection systems do not use a converter but instead deliver the liquid fuel into a fuel rail in much the same manner as a petrol injection system These systems are still very much in their infancy Because the fuel vaporises in the intake the air around it is cooled significantly This increases the density of the intake air and can potentially lead to substantial increases in engine power output to the extent that such systems are usually de tuned to avoid damaging other parts of the engine Liquid phase injection has the potential to achieve much better economy and power plus lower emission levels than are possible using mixers or vapour phase injectors br br br System components br br br Filler br br The fuel is transferred into a vehicle tank as liquid by connecting the bowser at the filling station to the filler fitting on the vehicle br The type of filler used varies from country to country and in some cases different types are used within the same country br The four types are br br ACME thread This type has a threaded fitting onto which the bowser nozzle is screwed before the trigger is pulled to establish a seal before fuel transfer This type is used in Australia US Germany Belgium Republic of Ireland Some LPG filling stations in the United Kingdom also use ACME br Dutch bayonet This type establishes a gas proof seal by a push and twist action This type is used in the United Kingdom Netherlands and Switzerland Some LPG filling stations in Norway also use bayonet Spain was using a longer version of bayonet when LPG was still for taxis only but has switched to Euronozzle when LPG sales were made available to the general public br Italian dish This type is used in Italy France Portugal Poland Czech Republic Slovakia Austria Hungary Slovenia Croatia Serbia Albania Greece Bulgaria Romania Ukraine Russia Lithuania Latvia Estonia and Sweden br Euronozzle This new type of adaptor was developed to minimize or eliminate the small amount of gas that escapes when disconnecting the filler hose from the vehicle The Euronozzle is or was supposed to become a unified new filling system for the entire European continent but investments in such a change over have failed to start As of Spain remains the only country in Europe that has adopted the Euronozzle adaptor a decision that was made when Spain had to redevelop a filling station network for LPG from practically zero br Adaptors that allow a vehicle fitted with a particular system to refuel at a station equipped with another system are available br The fill valve contains a check valve so that the liquid in the line between the filler and the tank s does not escape when the bowser nozzle is disconnected br In installations where more than one tank is fitted T fittings may be used to connect the tanks to one filler so that the tanks are filled simultaneously In some applications more than one filler may be fitted such as on opposite sides of the vehicle These may be connected to separate tanks or may be connected to the same tanks using T fittings in the same manner as for connecting multiple tanks to one filler br Fillers are typically made of brass to avoid the possibility of sparks when attaching or removing the bowser that might occur if steel fittings were used br br br Hoses pipes and fittings br br The hose between the filler and tank s is called the fill hose or fill line The hose or pipe between the tank s and the converter is called the service line These both carry liquid under pressure br The flexible hose between the converter and mixer is called the vapour hose or vapour line This line carries vapour at low pressure and has a much larger diameter to suit br Where the tank valves are located inside an enclosed space such as the boot of a sedan a plastic containment hose is used to provide a gas tight seal between the gas components and the inside of the vehicle br Liquid hoses for LPG are specifically designed and rated for the pressures that exist in LPG systems and are made from materials designed to be compatible with the fuel Some hoses are made with crimped fittings while others are made using re usable fittings that are pressed or screwed onto the end of the hose br Rigid sections of liquid line are usually made using copper tubing although in some applications steel pipes are used instead The ends of the pipes are always double flared and fitted with flare nuts to secure them to the fittings br Liquid line fittings are mostly made from brass The fittings typically adapt from a thread in a component such as a BSP or NPT threaded hole on a tank to an SAE flare fitting to suit the ends of pipes or hoses br br br Tank br br Vehicles are often fitted with only one tank but multiple tanks are used in a some applications In passenger car applications the tank is typically either a cylindrical tank made from steel mounted in the boot of the vehicle or a toroidal tank also steel or set of permanently interconnected cylinders placed in the spare wheel well In commercial vehicle applications the tanks are generally cylindrical tanks mounted either in the cargo space or on the chassis underneath the body Increasingly the tank is an aluminium Conformable Tank which is lighter has more capacity and cannot rust br The tanks have fittings for filling liquid outlet emergency relief of excess pressure fuel level gauge and sometimes a vapour outlet These may be separate valves mounted into a series of to holes in a plate welded into the tank shell or may be assembled onto a multi valve unit which is bolted into one large hole on a boss welded or in the case of an aluminium tank extruded as part of the tank shell br br Modern fill valves are usually fitted with an automatic fill limiter AFL to prevent overfilling The AFL has a float arm which restricts the flow significantly but does not shut it off entirely This is intended to cause the pressure in the line to rise enough to tell the bowser to stop pumping but not cause dangerously high pressures Before AFLs were introduced it was common for the filler with integral check valve to be screwed directly into the tank as the operator had to open an ullage valve at the tank while filling allowing vapour out of the top of the tank and stopping filling when liquid started coming out of the ullage valve to indicate that the tank was full Modern tanks are not fitted with ullage valves br The liquid outlet is usually used to supply fuel to the engine and is usually referred to as the service valve Modern service valves incorporate an electric shut off solenoid In applications using very small engines such as small generators vapour may be withdrawn from the top of the tank instead of liquid from the bottom of the tank br The emergency pressure relief valve in the tank is called a hydrostatic pressure relief valve It is designed to open if the pressure in the tank is dangerously high thus releasing some vapour to the atmosphere to reduce the pressure in the tank The release of a small quantity of vapour reduces the pressure in the tank which causes some of the liquid in the tank to vaporise to re establish equilibrium between liquid and vapour The latent heat of vaporisation causes the tank to cool which reduces pressure even further br The gauge sender is usually a magnetically coupled arrangement with a float arm inside the tank rotating a magnet which rotates an external gauge The external gauge is usually readable directly and most also incorporate an electronic sender to operate a fuel gauge on the dashboard br br br Valves br There are a number of types of valve used in autogas systems The most common ones are shut off or filter lock valves which are used to stop flow in the service line These may be operated by vacuum or electricity On bi fuel systems with a petrol carburettor a similar shut off valve is usually fitted in the petrol line between the pump and carburettor br Check valves are fitted in the filler and on the fill input to the fuel tank to prevent fuel flowing back the wrong way br Service valves are fitted to the outlet from the tank to the service line These have a tap to turn the fuel on and off The tap is usually only closed when the tank is being worked on In some countries an electrical shut off valve is built into the service valve br br Where multiple tanks are fitted a combination of check valves and a hydrostatic relief valve are usually installed to prevent fuel from flowing from one tank to another In Australia there is a common assembly designed for this purpose It is a combined twin check valve and hydrostatic relief valve assembly built in the form of a T fitting such that the lines from the tanks come into the sides of the valve and the outlet to the converter comes out the end Because there is only one common brand of these valves they are known colloquially as a Sherwood valve br br br Converter br The converter also known as vaporiser or reducer is a device designed to change the fuel from a pressurised liquid to a vapour at around atmospheric pressure for delivery to the mixer or vapour phase injectors Because of the refrigerant characteristic of the fuel heat must be put into the fuel by the converter This is usually achieved by having engine coolant circulated through a heat exchanger that transfers heat from that coolant to the LPG br There are two distinctly different basic types of converter for use with mixer type systems The European style of converter is a more complex device that incorporates an idle circuit and is designed to be used with a simple fixed venturi mixer The American style of converter is a simpler design which is intended to be used with a variable venturi mixer that incorporates an idle circuit br Engines with a low power output such as scooters quad bikes and generators can use a simpler type of converter also known as governor or regulator These converters are fed with fuel in vapour form br Evaporation takes place in the tank where refrigeration occurs as the liquid fuel boils The tanks large surface area exposed to the ambient air temperature combined with the low power output fuel requirement of the engine make this type of system viable The refrigeration of the fuel tank is proportional to fuel demand hence this arrangement is only used on smaller engines br This type of converter can either be fed with vapour at tank pressure called a stage regulator or be fed via a tank mounted regulator at a fixed reduced pressure called a single stage regulator br br br Mixer br The mixer is the device that mixes the fuel into the air flowing to the engine The mixer incorporates a venturi designed to draw the fuel into the airflow due to the movement of the air br Mixer type systems have existed since the s and some designs have changed little over that time Mixers are now being increasingly superseded by injectors br br br Vapour phase injectors br Most vapour phase injection systems mount the solenoids in a manifold block or injector rail then run hoses to the nozzles which are screwed into holes drilled and tapped into the runners of the intake manifold There is usually one nozzle for each cylinder Some vapour injection systems resemble petrol injection having separate injectors that fit into the manifold or head in the same manner as petrol injectors and are fed fuel through a fuel rail br br br Liquid phase injectors br Liquid phase injectors are mounted onto the engine in a manner similar to petrol injectors being mounted directly at the inlet manifold and fed liquid fuel from a fuel rail br br br Electrical and electronic controls br There are four distinct electrical systems that may be used in autogas systems fuel gauge sender fuel shut off closed loop feedback mixture control and injection control br In some installations the fuel gauge sender fitted to the autogas tank is matched to the original fuel gauge in the vehicle In others an additional gauge is added to display the level of fuel in the autogas tank separately from the existing petrol gauge br In most modern installations an electronic device called a tachometric relay or safety switch is used to operate electrical shut off solenoids These work by sensing that the engine is running by detecting ignition pulses Some systems use an engine oil pressure sensor instead In all installations there is a filterlock consisting of a filter assembly and a vacuum or electric solenoid operated shut off valve located at the input to the converter In European converters there is also a solenoid in the converter to shut off the idle circuit These valves are usually both connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch Where solenoids are fitted to the outputs of fuel tanks these are also connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch In installations with multiple tanks a switch or changeover relay may be fitted to allow the driver to select which tank to use fuel from On bi fuel the switch used to change between fuels is used to turn off the tachometric relay br Closed loop feedback systems use an electronic controller that operates in much the same way as in a petrol fuel injection systems using an oxygen sensor to effectively measure the air fuel mixture by measuring the oxygen content of the exhaust and control valve on the converter or in the vapour line to adjust the mixture Mixer type systems that do not have a closed loop feedback fitted are sometimes referred to as open loop systems br Injection systems use a computerised control system which is very similar to that used in petrol injection systems In virtually all systems the injection control system integrates the tachometric relay and closed loop feedback functions br br br Optional valve protection br br Many LPG equipment installers recommend the installation of so called valve protection systems These can consist in the most simple case of a bottle containing valve protection liquid The liquid is drawn into the air intake system and distributed into the engines cylinders along with the fuel and air br More sophisticated systems can consist of a piggyback ECU that is synchronised with the LPG injector ECU This results in a more precise injection of valve protection fluid br br br Converter and mixer system operation br The designs of converters and mixers are matched to each other by matching sizes and shapes of components within the two br In most areas of the world the word converter is not commonly used Regulator or reducer or vaporizer are more popular br Because it has main functions br br Reducer reduces the high pressure of incoming liquid phase LPG down to atmospheric pressure br Regulator regulates the gas flow according to the requirement of the engine br Vaporizer vaporizes the liquid form LPG into gas form by using the hot coolant circulation of the engine br In European style systems the size and shape of the venturi of the carburettor is designed to match the converter In USA style systems the air valve and metering pins in the mixer are sized to match the diaphragm size and spring stiffness in the converter In both cases the components are matched by the manufacturers and only basic adjustments are needed during installation and tuning br br An autogas carburettor may simply consist of a throttlebody and a mixer sometimes fitted together using an adapter the venturi is not needed br Cold start enrichment is achieved by the fact that the engine coolant is cold when the engine is cold This causes denser vapour to be delivered to the mixer As the engine warms up the coolant temperature rises until the engine is at operating temperature and the mixture has leaned off to the normal running mixture Depending on the system the throttle may need to be held open further when the engine is cold in the same manner as with a petrol carburettor On others the normal mixture is intended to be somewhat lean and no cold start throttle increase is needed Because of the way enrichment is achieved no additional choke butterfly is required for cold starting with LPG Some evaporators have an electric choke valve energising this valve before starting the engine will spray some LPG vapour into the carburetor to help cold start br The temperature of the engine is critical to the tuning of an autogas system The engine thermostat effectively controls the temperature of the converter thus directly affecting the mixture A faulty thermostat or a thermostat of the wrong temperature range for the design of the system may not operate correctly br The power output capacity of a system is limited by the ability of the converter to deliver a stable flow of vapour A coolant temperature lower than intended will reduce the maximum power output possible as will an air bubble trapped in the cooling circuit or complete loss of coolant All converters have a limit beyond which mixtures become unstable Unstable mixtures typically contain tiny droplets of liquid fuel that were not heated enough in the converter and will vaporise in the mixer or intake to form an excessively rich mixture When this occurs the mixture will become so rich that the engine will flood and stall Because the outside of the converter will be at or below C when this happens water vapour from the air will freeze onto the outside of the converter forming an icy white layer Some converters are very susceptible to cracking when this happens br br br LPG injection for diesel vehicles br LPG may be used for a supplemental fuel for diesels of all sizes Diesel contains BTU per US gallon where propane contains BTU per US gallon If LPG is less expensive there may very well be a saving Any actual savings are dependent on the relative cost of diesel versus LPG In Australia where diesel costs substantially more than LPG savings of to are claimed br The above systems add small quantities of LPG with the primary aim of improving economy but much larger quantities of LPG can be injected in order to increase power Even at full output a diesel engine runs about lean of stoichiometric to avoid black smoke production so there is a substantial amount of oxygen in the intake charge which is not consumed in the combustion process This oxygen is therefore available for the combustion of a substantial addition of LPG resulting in a large increase in power output br br br See also br Gas
