A motorcycle motorbike bike or if three wheeled a trike is a two or three wheeled motor vehicle steered by a handlebar from a saddle style seat br Motorcycle designs variy greatly to suit a range of different purposes long distance travel commuting cruising sport including racing and off road riding Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social activities such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies br The Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal combustion petroleum fueled motorcycle In Hildebrand Wolfm ller became the first series production motorcycle br Globally motorcycles are comparably numerically to cars as a method of transport in approximately million new motorcycles were sold around the world while million cars were sold over the same period br In the top four motorcycle producers by volume and type were Honda Yamaha Kawasaki and Suzuki In developing countries motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel economy Of all the motorcycles in the world are in the Asia Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions excluding car centric Japan br According to the US Department of Transportation the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was times higher for motorcycles than for cars br br br Types br br The term motorcycle has different legal definitions depending on jurisdiction see Legal definitions and restrictions br There are three major types of motorcycle street off road and dual purpose Within these types there are many sub types of motorcycles for different purposes There is often a racing counterpart to each type such as road racing and street bikes or motocross including dirt bikes br Street bikes include cruisers sportbikes scooters and mopeds and many other types Off road motorcycles include many types designed for dirt oriented racing classes such as motocross and are not street legal in most areas Dual purpose machines like the dual sport style are made to go off road but include features to make them legal and comfortable on the street as well br Each configuration offers either specialised advantage or broad capability and each design creates a different riding posture br In some countries the use of pillions rear seats is restricted br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br History br br br Experimentation and invention br br The first internal combustion petroleum fueled motorcycle was the Daimler Reitwagen It was designed and built by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt Germany in This vehicle was unlike either the safety bicycles or the boneshaker bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees of steering axis angle and no fork offset and thus did not use the principles of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics developed nearly years earlier Instead it relied on two outrigger wheels to remain upright while turning br The inventors called their invention the Reitwagen riding car It was designed as an expedient testbed for their new engine rather than a true prototype vehicle br br The first commercial design for a self propelled cycle was a three wheel design called the Butler Petrol Cycle conceived of Edward Butler in England in He exhibited his plans for the vehicle at the Stanley Cycle Show in London in The vehicle was built by the Merryweather Fire Engine company in Greenwich in br The Butler Petrol Cycle was a three wheeled vehicle with the rear wheel directly driven by a hp kW cc cu in displacement in in mm mm bore stroke flat twin four stroke engine with magneto ignition replaced by coil and battery equipped with rotary valves and a float fed carburettor five years before Maybach and Ackermann steering all of which were state of the art at the time Starting was by compressed air The engine was liquid cooled with a radiator over the rear driving wheel Speed was controlled by means of a throttle valve lever No braking system was fitted the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot operated lever the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels The driver was seated between the front wheels It was not however a success as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing br Many authorities have excluded steam powered electric motorcycles or diesel powered two wheelers from the definition of a motorcycle and credit the Daimler Reitwagen as the world s first motorcycle Given the rapid rise in use of electric motorcycles worldwide defining only internal combustion powered two wheelers as motorcycles is increasingly problematic The first petroleum fueled internal combustion motorcycles like the German Reitwagen were however also the first practical motorcycles br If a two wheeled vehicle with steam propulsion is considered a motorcycle then the first motorcycles built seem to be the French Michaux Perreaux steam velocipede which patent application was filed in December constructed around the same time as the American Roper steam velocipede built by Sylvester H Roper of Roxbury Massachusetts br who had been demonstrating his machine at fairs and circuses in the eastern U S since Roper built about steam cars and cycles from the s until his death in br br br Summary of early inventions br br br First motorcycle companies br br In Hildebrand Wolfm ller became the first series production motorcycle and the first to be called a motorcycle German Motorrad Excelsior Motor Company originally a bicycle manufacturing company based in Coventry England began production of their first motorcycle model in br The first production motorcycle in the US was the Orient Aster built by Charles Metz in at his factory in Waltham Massachusetts br In the early period of motorcycle history many producers of bicycles adapted their designs to accommodate the new internal combustion engine As the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins the number of motorcycle producers increased Many of the nineteenth century inventors who worked on early motorcycles often moved on to other inventions Daimler and Roper for example both went on to develop automobiles br br At the end of the th century the first major mass production firms were set up In Triumph Motorcycles in England began producing motorbikes and by it was producing over bikes Other British firms were Royal Enfield Norton Douglas Motorcycles and Birmingham Small Arms Company who began motorbike production in and respectively Indian began production in and Harley Davidson was established two years later By the outbreak of World War I the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world was Indian br producing over bikes per year br br br First World War br br During the First World War motorbike production was greatly ramped up for the war effort to supply effective communications with front line troops Messengers on horses were replaced with despatch riders on motorcycles carrying messages performing reconnaissance and acting as a military police American company Harley Davidson was devoting over of its factory output toward military contract by the end of the war The British company Triumph Motorcycles sold more than of its Triumph Type H model to allied forces during the war With the rear wheel driven by a belt the Model H was fitted with a cc cu in air cooled four stroke single cylinder engine It was also the first Triumph without pedals br The Model H in particular is regarded by many as having been the first modern motorcycle Introduced in it had a cc side valve four stroke engine with a three speed gearbox and belt transmission It was so popular with its users that it was nicknamed the Trusty Triumph br br br Postwar br br By Harley Davidson was the largest manufacturer with their motorcycles being sold by dealers in countries br Amongst many British motorcycle manufacturers Chater Lea with its twin cylinder models followed by its large singles in the s stood out Initially using converted a Woodmann designed ohv Blackburne engine it became the first cc to exceed mph km h recording mph km h over the flying kilometre during April Later Chater Lea set a world record for the flying kilometre for cc and cc motorcycles at mph km h for the firm Chater Lea produced variants of these world beating sports models and became popular among racers at the Isle of Man TT Today the firm is probably best remembered for its long term contract to manufacture and supply AA Patrol motorcycles and sidecars br By the late s or early s DKW in Germany took over as the largest manufacturer br br In the s streamlining began to play an increasing part in the development of racing motorcycles and the dustbin fairing held out the possibility of radical changes to motorcycle design NSU and Moto Guzzi were in the vanguard of this development both producing very radical designs well ahead of their time br NSU produced the most advanced design but after the deaths of four NSU riders in the seasons they abandoned further development and quit Grand Prix motorcycle racing br Moto Guzzi produced competitive race machines and until the end of had a succession of victories The following year full enclosure fairings were banned from racing by the FIM in the light of the safety concerns br From the s through the s small two stroke motorcycles were popular worldwide partly as a result of East German MZs Walter Kaaden s engine work in the s br br br Today br br In the st century the motorcycle industry is mainly dominated by Indian and Japanese motorcycle companies In addition to the large capacity motorcycles there is a large market in smaller capacity less than cc motorcycles mostly concentrated in Asian and African countries and produced in China and India A Japanese example is the Honda Super Cub which went on to become the biggest selling vehicle of all time with its millionth unit produced in April br Today this area is dominated by mostly Indian companies with Hero MotoCorp emerging as the world s largest manufacturer of two wheelers Its Splendor model has sold more than million to date Other major producers are Bajaj and TVS Motors br br br Technical aspects br br br Construction br br Motorcycle construction is the engineering manufacturing and assembly of components and systems for a motorcycle which results in the performance cost and aesthetics desired by the designer With some exceptions construction of modern mass produced motorcycles has standardised on a steel or aluminium frame telescopic forks holding the front wheel and disc brakes Some other body parts designed for either aesthetic or performance reasons may be added A petrol powered engine typically consisting of between one and four cylinders and less commonly up to eight cylinders coupled to a manual five or six speed sequential transmission drives the swingarm mounted rear wheel by a chain driveshaft or belt The repair can be done using a Motorcycle lift br br br Fuel economy br Motorcycle fuel economy varies greatly with engine displacement and riding style A streamlined fully faired Matzu Matsuzawa Honda XL achieved mpg US L km mpg imp in the Craig Vetter Fuel Economy Challenge on real highways in real conditions br Due to low engine displacements cc cu in and high power to mass ratios motorcycles offer good fuel economy Under conditions of fuel scarcity like s Britain and modern developing nations motorcycles claim large shares of the vehicle market In the United States the average motorcycle fuel economy is miles per US gallon km per liter br br br Electric motorcycles br br Very high fuel economy equivalents are often derived by electric motorcycles Electric motorcycles are nearly silent zero emission electric motor driven vehicles Operating range and top speed are limited by battery technology Fuel cells and petroleum electric hybrids are also under development to extend the range and improve performance of the electric drive system br br br Reliability br A survey of readers of the US Consumer Reports magazine collected reliability data on motorcycles purchased new from to The most common problem areas were accessories brakes electrical including starters charging ignition and fuel systems and the types of motorcycles with the greatest problems were touring off road dual sport sport touring and cruisers There were not enough sport bikes in the survey for a statistically significant conclusion though the data hinted at reliability as good as cruisers These results may be partially explained by accessories including such equipment as fairings luggage and auxiliary lighting which are frequently added to touring adventure touring dual sport and sport touring bikes Trouble with fuel systems is often the result of improper winter storage and brake problems may also be due to poor maintenance Of the five brands with enough data to draw conclusions Honda Kawasaki and Yamaha were statistically tied with to of those bikes in the survey experiencing major repairs Harley Davidsons had a rate of while BMWs did worse with of those needing major repairs There were not enough Triumph and Suzuki motorcycles surveyed for a statistically sound conclusion though it appeared Suzukis were as reliable as the other three Japanese brands while Triumphs were comparable to Harley Davidson and BMW Three fourths of the repairs in the survey cost less than US and two thirds of the motorcycles were repaired in less than two days In spite of their relatively worse reliability in this survey Harley Davidson and BMW owners showed the greatest owner satisfaction and three fourths of them said they would buy the same bike again followed by of Honda owners and to of Kawasaki and Yamaha owners br br br Dynamics br br Two wheeled motorcycles stay upright while rolling due to a physical property known as conservation of angular momentum in the wheels Angular momentum points along the axle and it wants to stay pointing in that direction br Different types of motorcycles have different dynamics and these play a role in how a motorcycle performs in given conditions For example one with a longer wheelbase provides the feeling of more stability by responding less to disturbances Motorcycle tyres have a large influence over handling br Motorcycles must be leaned in order to make turns This lean is induced by the method known as countersteering in which the rider momentarily steers the handlebars in the direction opposite of the desired turn This practice is counterintuitive and therefore often confusing to novices and even many experienced motorcyclists br With such short wheelbase motorcycles can generate enough torque at the rear wheel and enough stopping force at the front wheel to lift the opposite wheel off the road These actions if performed on purpose are known as wheelies and stoppies or endos respectively br br br Accessories br br Various features and accessories may be attached to a motorcycle either as OEM factory fitted or aftermarket Such accessories are selected by the owner to enhance the motorcycle s appearance safety performance or comfort and may include anything from mobile electronics to sidecars and trailers br br br Records br The world record for the longest motorcycle jump was set in by Robbie Maddison with metres ft br Since late the Ack Attack team has held the motorcycle land speed record at mph km h br br br Safety br br Motorcycles have a higher rate of fatal accidents than automobiles or trucks and buses United States Department of Transportation data for from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System show that for passenger cars fatal crashes occur per registered vehicles For motorcycles this figure is higher at per registered vehicles four times higher than for cars br The same data shows that fatalities occur per million vehicle miles travelled for passenger cars whereas for motorcycles the figure is which is times higher than for cars times more deaths per mile travelled in br Furthermore for motorcycles the accident rates have increased significantly since the end of the s while the rates have dropped for passenger cars br The most common configuration of motorcycle accidents in the United States is when a motorist pulls out or turns in front of a motorcyclist violating their right of way This is sometimes called a SMIDSY an acronym formed from the motorists common response of Sorry mate I didn t see you br Motorcyclists can anticipate and avoid some of these crashes with proper training increasing their visibility to other traffic keeping to the speed limits and not consuming alcohol or other drugs before riding br The United Kingdom has several organisations dedicated to improving motorcycle safety by providing advanced rider training beyond what is necessary to pass the basic motorcycle licence test These include the Institute of Advanced Motorists IAM and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents RoSPA Along with increased personal safety riders with these advanced qualifications may benefit from reduced insurance costs br br In South Africa the Think Bike campaign is dedicated to increasing both motorcycle safety and the awareness of motorcycles on the country s roads The campaign while strongest in the Gauteng province has representation in Western Cape KwaZulu Natal and the Free State It has dozens of trained marshals available for various events such as cycle races and is deeply involved in numerous other projects such as the annual Motorcycle Toy Run br Motorcycle safety education is offered throughout the United States by organisations ranging from state agencies to non profit organisations to corporations Most states use the courses designed by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation MSF while Oregon and Idaho developed their own All of the training programs include a Basic Rider Course an Intermediate Rider Course and an Advanced Rider Course br br In Ireland since in the UK and some Australian jurisdictions such as Victoria New South Wales br the Australian Capital Territory Tasmania br and the Northern Territory it is compulsory to complete a basic rider training course before being issued a Learners Licence after which they can ride on public roads br In Canada motorcycle rider training is compulsory in Quebec and Manitoba only but all provinces and territories have graduated licence programs which place restrictions on new drivers until they have gained experience Eligibility for a full motorcycle licence or endorsement for completing a Motorcycle Safety course varies by province Without the Motorcycle Safety Course the chance of getting insurance for the motorcycle is very low The Canada Safety Council a non profit safety organisation offers the Gearing Up program across Canada and is endorsed by the Motorcycle and Moped Industry Council Training course graduates may qualify for reduced insurance premiums br Motorcyclists and motor scooter riders are also exposed to an increased risk of suffering hearing damage such as hearing loss and tinnitus ringing ears The noise is caused by wind noise while riding rolling noise from the tyres and the engine itself The helmet only provides insufficient protection against high sound pressure levels Medicine as of is not able to cure hearing damage Wearing hearing protection such as special earplugs for motorcyclists can help prevent hearing damage br br br Motorcycle rider postures br br The motorcyclist s riding position depends on rider body geometry anthropometry combined with the geometry of the motorcycle itself These factors create a set of three basic postures br br Sport the rider leans forward into the wind and the weight of the upper torso is supported by the rider s core at low speed and air pressure at high speed The footpegs are below the rider or to the rear The reduced frontal area cuts wind resistance and allows higher speeds At low speed in this position the rider s arms may bear some of the weight of the rider s torso which can be problematic br Standard the rider sits upright or leans forward slightly The feet are below the rider These are motorcycles that are not specialised to one task so they do not excel in any particular area The standard posture is used with touring and commuting as well as dirt and dual sport bikes and may offer advantages for beginners br Cruiser the rider sits at a lower seat height with the upper torso upright or leaning slightly rearward Legs are extended forwards sometimes out of reach of the regular controls on cruiser pegs The low seat height can be a consideration for new or short riders Handlebars tend to be high and wide The emphasis is on comfort while compromising cornering ability because of low ground clearance and the greater likelihood of scraping foot pegs floor boards or other parts if turns are taken at the speeds other motorcycles can more readily accomplish br Factors of a motorcycle s ergonomic geometry that determine the seating posture include the height angle and location of footpegs seat and handlebars Factors in a rider s physical geometry that contribute to seating posture include torso arm thigh and leg length and overall rider height br br br Legal definitions and restrictions br br A motorcycle is broadly defined by law in most countries for the purposes of registration taxation and rider licensing as a powered two wheel motor vehicle Most countries distinguish between mopeds of cc and the more powerful larger vehicles including scooter type motorcycles Many jurisdictions include some forms of three wheeled cars as motorcycles br In Nigeria motorcycles popularly referred to as Okada have been subject of many controversies with regards to safety and security followed by restriction of movement in many states In it was banned in Lagos Nigeria s most populous city br br br Environmental impact br Motorcycles and scooters low fuel consumption has attracted interest in the United States from environmentalists and those affected by increased fuel prices br Piaggio Group Americas supported this interest with the launch of a Vespanomics website and platform claiming lower per mile carbon emissions of lb mile g km less than the average car a reduction and better fuel economy br However a motorcycle s exhaust emissions may contain times more oxides of nitrogen NOx carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons than exhaust from a similar year passenger car or SUV br This is because many motorcycles lack a catalytic converter and the emission standard is much more permissive for motorcycles than for other vehicles While catalytic converters have been installed in most gasoline powered cars and trucks since in the United States they can present fitment and heat difficulties in motorcycle applications br United States Environmental Protection Agency certification result reports for all vehicles versus on highway motorcycles which also includes scooters the average certified emissions level for vehicles tested was The average Nox Co End Of Useful Life Emissions for motorcycles tested was of the tested model motorcycles were equipped with a catalytic converter br br br United States emissions limits br The following table shows maximum acceptable legal emissions of the combination of hydrocarbons oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide for new motorcycles sold in the United States with cc or greater piston displacement br br The maximum acceptable legal emissions of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide for new Class I and II motorcycles cc cc and cc cc respectively sold in the United States are as follows br br br Europe br European emission standards for motorcycles are similar to those for cars New motorcycles must meet Euro standards while cars must meet Euro D temp standards Motorcycle emission controls are being updated and it has been proposed to update to Euro in br br br Vietnam br According to the National Environmental Status Report and recent air quality reports emissions from motor vehicles have been identified as the main cause of environmental pollution Among them with over million vehicles in operation nationwide statistics from the Ministry of Transport motorcycles are the largest source of pollutant emissions br In Hanoi there are over million motorcycles of which nearly million were manufactured before In Ho Chi Minh City there are about million motorcycles of which are over years old Air quality index AQI in urban centers often spikes during peak traffic times such as rush hour in the morning and evening br A study by the Institute of Environment and Resources Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City found that motorcycles account for about of NO emissions of CO emissions of NMVOC emissions of particulate matter emissions and of fine particulate matter emissions br Traffic emissions account for of total emissions in Ho Chi Minh City While the world is moving towards Euro emission standards most cars in Vietnam meet Euro or Euro standards However motorcycles still meet Euro or Euro standards which were implemented
