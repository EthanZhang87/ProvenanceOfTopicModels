title: Acid rain
id: 3263
Acid rain is rain or any other form of precipitation that is unusually acidic meaning that it has elevated levels of hydrogen ions low pH Most water including drinking water has a neutral pH that exists between and but acid rain has a pH level lower than this and ranges from on average The more acidic the acid rain is the lower its pH is Acid rain can have harmful effects on plants aquatic animals and infrastructure Acid rain is caused by emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide which react with the water molecules in the atmosphere to produce acids br Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests freshwaters soils microbes insects and aquatic life forms In ecosystems persistent acid rain reduces tree bark durability leaving flora more susceptible to environmental stressors such as drought heat cold and pest infestation Acid rain is also capable of detrimenting soil composition by stripping it of nutrients such as calcium and magnesium which play a role in plant growth and maintaining healthy soil In terms of human infrastructure acid rain also causes paint to peel corrosion of steel structures such as bridges and weathering of stone buildings and statues as well as having impacts on human health br Some governments including those in Europe and North America have made efforts since the s to reduce the release of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide into the atmosphere through air pollution regulations These efforts have had positive results due to the widespread research on acid rain starting in the s and the publicized information on its harmful effects The main source of sulfur and nitrogen compounds that result in acid rain are anthropogenic but nitrogen oxides can also be produced naturally by lightning strikes and sulfur dioxide is produced by volcanic eruptions br br br Definition br Acid rain is a popular term referring to the deposition of a mixture from wet rain snow sleet fog cloudwater and dew and dry acidifying particles and gases acidic components Distilled water once carbon dioxide is removed has a neutral pH of Liquids with a pH less than are acidic and those with a pH greater than are alkaline Clean or unpolluted rain has an acidic pH but usually no lower than because carbon dioxide and water in the air react together to form carbonic acid a weak acid according to the following reaction br br H O l CO g H CO aq br Carbonic acid then can ionize in water forming low concentrations of carbonate and hydronium ions br br H O l H CO aq HCO aq H O aq br Unpolluted rain can also contain other chemicals which affect its pH acidity level A common example is nitric acid produced by electric discharge in the atmosphere such as lightning Acid deposition as an environmental issue discussed later in the article would include additional acids other than H CO br Occasional pH readings in rain and fog water of well below have been reported in industrialized areas br The main sources of the SO and NOx pollution that causes acid rain are burning fossil fuels to generate electricity and power internal combustion vehicles to refine oil and in industrial manufacturing and other processes br br br History br br Acid rain was first systematically studied in Europe in the s and in the United States and Canada the following decade br br br In Europe br The corrosive effect of polluted acidic city air on limestone and marble was noted in the th century by John Evelyn who remarked upon the poor condition of the Arundel marbles br Since the Industrial Revolution emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere have increased In Robert Angus Smith was the first to show the relationship between acid rain and atmospheric pollution in Manchester England Smith coined the term acid rain in br In the late s scientists began widely observing and studying the phenomenon At first the main focus in this research lay on local effects of acid rain Waldemar Christofer Br gger was the first to acknowledge long distance transportation of pollutants crossing borders from the United Kingdom to Norway a problem systematically studied by Brynjulf Ottar in the s Ottar s work was strongly influenced by Swedish soil scientist Svante Od n who had drawn widespread attention to Europe s acid rain problem in popular newspapers and wrote a landmark paper on the subject in br br br In the United States br br The earliest report about acid rain in the United States came from chemical evidence gathered from Hubbard Brook Valley public awareness of acid rain in the US increased in the s after The New York Times reported on these findings br In a group of scientists including Gene Likens discovered the rain that was deposited at White Mountains of New Hampshire was acidic The pH of the sample was measured to be at Hubbard Brook The Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study followed up with a series of research studies that analyzed the environmental effects of acid rain The alumina from soils neutralized acid rain that mixed with stream water at Hubbard Brook The result of this research indicated that the chemical reaction between acid rain and aluminium leads to an increasing rate of soil weathering Experimental research examined the effects of increased acidity in streams on ecological species In scientists modified the acidity of Norris Brook New Hampshire and observed the change in species behaviors There was a decrease in species diversity an increase in community dominants and a reduction in the food web complexity br In the US Congress passed an Acid Deposition Act This Act established an year assessment and research program under the direction of the National Acidic Precipitation Assessment Program NAPAP NAPAP enlarged a network of monitoring sites to determine how acidic precipitation was seeking to determine long term trends and established a network for dry deposition Using a statistically based sampling design NAPAP quantified the effects of acid rain on a regional basis by targeting research and surveys to identify and quantify the impact of acid precipitation on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems NAPAP also assessed the effects of acid rain on historical buildings monuments and building materials It also funded extensive studies on atmospheric processes and potential control programs br From the start policy advocates from all sides attempted to influence NAPAP activities to support their particular policy advocacy efforts or to disparage those of their opponents For the US Government s scientific enterprise a significant impact of NAPAP were lessons learned in the assessment process and in environmental research management to a relatively large group of scientists program managers and the public br In the National Academy of Sciences was looking into research about the controversial issues regarding acid rain President Ronald Reagan dismissed the issues of acid rain until his personal visit to Canada and confirmed that the Canadian border suffered from the drifting pollution from smokestacks originating in the US Midwest Reagan honored the agreement to Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau s enforcement of anti pollution regulation In Reagan commissioned William Nierenberg to serve on the National Science Board Nierenberg selected scientists including Gene Likens to serve on a panel to draft a report on acid rain In the panel of scientists came up with a draft report which concluded that acid rain is a real problem and solutions should be sought White House Office of Science and Technology Policy reviewed the draft report and sent Fred Singer s suggestions of the report which cast doubt on the cause of acid rain The panelists revealed rejections against Singer s positions and submitted the report to Nierenberg in April In May the House of Representatives voted against legislation that aimed to control sulfur emissions There was a debate about whether Nierenberg delayed to release the report Nierenberg himself denied the saying about his suppression of the report and stated that the report was withheld after the House s vote because it was not ready to be published br In the US National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program NAPAP provided its first assessment of acid rain in the United States It reported that of New England Lakes were acidic with sulfates being the most common problem They noted that of the lakes could no longer support Brook Trout and of the lakes were unsuitable for the survival of many species of minnow Subsequent Reports to Congress have documented chemical changes in soil and freshwater ecosystems nitrogen saturation decreases in amounts of nutrients in soil episodic acidification regional haze and damage to historical monuments br Meanwhile in the US Congress passed a series of amendments to the Clean Air Act Title IV of these amendments established a cap and trade system designed to control emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides Both these emissions proved to cause a significant problem on U S citizens and their access to healthy clean air Title IV called for a total reduction of about million tons of SO emissions from power plants close to a reduction It was implemented in two phases Phase I began in and limited sulfur dioxide emissions from of the largest power plants to a combined total of million tons of sulfur dioxide One power plant in New England Merrimack was in Phase I Four other plants Newington Mount Tom Brayton Point and Salem Harbor were added under other provisions of the program Phase II began in and affects most of the power plants in the country br During the s research continued On March the EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule CAIR This rule provides states with a solution to the problem of power plant pollution that drifts from one state to another CAIR will permanently cap emissions of SO and NOx in the eastern United States When fully implemented CAIR will reduce SO emissions in eastern states and the District of Columbia by over and NOx emissions by over from levels br Overall the program s cap and trade program has been successful in achieving its goals Since the s SO emissions have dropped and according to the Pacific Research Institute acid rain levels have dropped since Conventional regulation was used in the European Union which saw a decrease of over in SO emissions during the same time period br In total SO emissions were million tons achieving the program s long term goal ahead of the statutory deadline br In the EPA estimated that by the overall costs of complying with the program for businesses and consumers would be billion to billion a year only one fourth of what was originally predicted Forbes says In by which time the cap and trade system had been augmented by the George W Bush administration s Clean Air Interstate Rule SO emissions had fallen to million tons br The term citizen science can be traced back as far as January to a campaign by the Audubon Society to measure acid rain Scientist Muki Haklay cites in a policy report for the Wilson Center entitled Citizen Science and Policy A European Perspective a first use of the term citizen science by R Kerson in the magazine MIT Technology Review from January Quoting from the Wilson Center report The new form of engagement in science received the name citizen science The first recorded example of the use of the term is from describing how volunteers across the US collected rain samples to assist the Audubon Society in an acid rain awareness raising campaign The volunteers collected samples checked for acidity and reported back to the organization The information was then used to demonstrate the full extent of the phenomenon br br br In Canada br Canadian Harold Harvey was among the first to research a dead lake In he and R J Beamish published a report Acidification of the La Cloche Mountain Lakes documenting the gradual deterioration of fish stocks in lakes in Killarney Park in Ontario which they had been studying systematically since br In the s and s acid rain was a major topic of research at the Experimental Lakes Area ELA in Northwestern Ontario Canada Researchers added sulfuric acid to whole lakes in controlled ecosystem experiments to simulate the effects of acid rain Because its remote conditions allowed for whole ecosystem experiments research at the ELA showed that the effect of acid rain on fish populations started at concentrations much lower than those observed in laboratory experiments In the context of a food web fish populations crashed earlier than when acid rain had direct toxic effects to the fish because the acidity led to crashes in prey populations e g mysids As experimental acid inputs were reduced fish populations and lake ecosystems recovered at least partially although invertebrate populations have still not completely returned to the baseline conditions This research showed both that acidification was linked to declining fish populations and that the effects could be reversed if sulfuric acid emissions decreased and influenced policy in Canada and the United States br In seven Canadian provinces all except British Columbia Alberta and Saskatchewan and the federal government signed the Eastern Canada Acid Rain Program The provinces agreed to limit their combined sulfur dioxide emissions to million tonnes by The Canada US Air Quality Agreement was signed in In all federal provincial and territorial Ministers of Energy and Environment signed The Canada Wide Acid Rain Strategy for Post which was designed to protect lakes that are more sensitive than those protected by earlier policies br br br In India br Increased risk might be posed by the expected rise in total sulphur emissions from kilotonnes kt in to kt in kt in and in br br br Emissions of chemicals leading to acidification br The most important gas which leads to acidification is sulfur dioxide Emissions of nitrogen oxides which are oxidized to form nitric acid are of increasing importance due to stricter controls on emissions of sulfur compounds Tg S per year in the form of SO comes from fossil fuel combustion and industry Tg S from wildfires and Tg S per year from volcanoes br br br Natural phenomena br br The principal natural phenomena that contribute acid producing gases to the atmosphere are emissions from volcanoes Thus for example fumaroles from the Laguna Caliente crater of Po s Volcano create extremely high amounts of acid rain and fog with acidity as high as a pH of clearing an area of any vegetation and frequently causing irritation to the eyes and lungs of inhabitants in nearby settlements Acid producing gasses are also created by biological processes that occur on the land in wetlands and in the oceans The major biological source of sulfur compounds is dimethyl sulfide br Nitric acid in rainwater is an important source of fixed nitrogen for plant life and is also produced by electrical activity in the atmosphere such as lightning br Acidic deposits have been detected in glacial ice thousands of years old in remote parts of the globe br br br Human activity br br The principal cause of acid rain is sulfur and nitrogen compounds from human sources such as electricity generation animal agriculture factories and motor vehicles These also include power plants which use electric power generators that account for a quarter of nitrogen oxides and two thirds of sulfur dioxide within the atmosphere Industrial acid rain is a substantial problem in China and Russia and areas downwind from them These areas all burn sulfur containing coal to generate heat and electricity br The problem of acid rain has not only increased with population and industrial growth but has become more widespread The use of tall smokestacks to reduce local pollution has contributed to the spread of acid rain by releasing gases into regional atmospheric circulation dispersal from these taller stacks causes pollutants to be carried farther causing widespread ecological damage Often deposition occurs a considerable distance downwind of the emissions with mountainous regions tending to receive the greatest deposition because of their higher rainfall An example of this effect is the low pH of rain which falls in Scandinavia Regarding low pH and pH imbalances in correlation to acid rain low levels or those under the pH value of are considered acidic Acid rain falls at a pH value of roughly making it harmful to consume for humans When these low pH levels fall in specific regions they not only affect the environment but also human health With acidic pH levels in humans comes hair loss low urinary pH severe mineral imbalances constipation and many cases of chronic disorders like Fibromyalgia and Basal Carcinoma br br br Chemical process br Combustion of fuels produces sulfur dioxide and nitric oxides They are converted into sulfuric acid and nitric acid br br br Gas phase chemistry br In the gas phase sulfur dioxide is oxidized by reaction with the hydroxyl radical via an intermolecular reaction br br SO OH HOSO br which is followed by br br HOSO O HO SO br In the presence of water sulfur trioxide SO is converted rapidly to sulfuric acid br br SO g H O l H SO aq br Nitrogen dioxide reacts with OH to form nitric acid br br NO OH HNO br br br Chemistry in cloud droplets br When clouds are present the loss rate of SO is faster than can be explained by gas phase chemistry alone This is due to reactions in the liquid water droplets br br Hydrolysis br Sulfur dioxide dissolves in water and then like carbon dioxide hydrolyses in a series of equilibrium reactions br br SO g H O SO H O br SO H O H HSO br HSO H SO br Oxidation br There are a large number of aqueous reactions that oxidize sulfur from S IV to S VI leading to the formation of sulfuric acid The most important oxidation reactions are with ozone hydrogen peroxide and oxygen reactions with oxygen are catalyzed by iron and manganese in the cloud droplets br br br Acid deposition br br br Wet deposition br Wet deposition of acids occurs when any form of precipitation rain snow and so on removes acids from the atmosphere and delivers it to the Earth s surface This can result from the deposition of acids produced in the raindrops see aqueous phase chemistry above or by the precipitation removing the acids either in clouds or below clouds Wet removal of both gases and aerosols are both of importance for wet deposition br CAM plants are predominantly found in arid environments where water availability is limited br br br Dry deposition br Acid deposition also occurs via dry deposition in the absence of precipitation This can be responsible for as much as to of total acid deposition This occurs when particles and gases stick to the ground plants or other surfaces br br br Adverse effects br Acid rain has been shown to have adverse impacts on forests freshwaters and soils killing insect and aquatic life forms as well as causing damage to buildings and having impacts on human health br br br Surface waters and aquatic animals br br Both the lower pH and higher aluminium concentrations in surface water that occur as a result of acid rain can cause damage to fish and other aquatic animals At pH lower than most fish eggs will not hatch and lower pH can kill adult fish As lakes and rivers become more acidic biodiversity is reduced Acid rain has eliminated insect life and some fish species including the brook trout in some lakes streams and creeks in geographically sensitive areas such as the Adirondack Mountains of the United States br However the extent to which acid rain contributes directly or indirectly via runoff from the catchment to lake and river acidity i e depending on characteristics of the surrounding watershed is variable The United States Environmental Protection Agency s EPA website states Of the lakes and streams surveyed acid rain caused acidity in of the acidic lakes and about of the acidic streams Lakes hosted by silicate basement rocks are more acidic than lakes within limestone or other basement rocks with a carbonate composition i e marble due to buffering effects by carbonate minerals even with the same amount of acid rain br Sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide concentration has many implication on aquatic ecosystems including acidity change increased nitrogen and aluminum content and altering biogeochemical processes Typically sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide do not have direct physiological effects upon exposure most effects are developed by accumulation and prolonged exposure of these gases in the environment modifying soil and water chemistry br br br Soils br Soil biology and chemistry can be seriously damaged by acid rain Some microbes are unable to tolerate changes to low pH and are killed The enzymes of these microbes are denatured changed in shape so they no longer function by the acid The hydronium ions of acid rain also mobilize toxins such as aluminium and leach away essential nutrients and minerals such as magnesium br br H aq Mg clay H clay Mg aq br Soil chemistry can be dramatically changed when base cations such as calcium and magnesium are leached by acid rain thereby affecting sensitive species such as sugar maple Acer saccharum br Soil acidification br br Impacts of acidic water and soil acidification on plants could be minor or in most cases major Most minor cases which do not result in fatality of plant life can be attributed to the plants being less susceptible to acidic conditions and or the acid rain being less potent However even in minor cases the plant will eventually die due to the acidic water lowering the plant s natural pH Acidic water enters the plant and causes important plant minerals to dissolve and get carried away which ultimately causes the plant to die of lack of minerals for nutrition In major cases which are more extreme the same process of damage occurs as in minor cases which is removal of essential minerals but at a much quicker rate Likewise acid rain that falls on soil and on plant leaves causes drying of the waxy leaf cuticle which ultimately causes rapid water loss from the plant to the outside atmosphere and eventually results in death of the plant Soil acidification can lead to a decline in soil microbes as a result of a change in pH which would have an adverse effect on plants due to their dependence on soil microbes to access nutrients To see if a plant is being affected by soil acidification one can closely observe the plant leaves If the leaves are green and look healthy the soil pH is normal and acceptable for plant life But if the plant leaves have yellowing between the veins on their leaves that means the plant is suffering from acidification and is unhealthy Moreover a plant suffering from soil acidification cannot photosynthesize the acid water induced process of drying out of the plant can destroy chloroplast organelles Without being able to photosynthesize a plant cannot create nutrients for its own survival or oxygen for the survival of aerobic organisms which affects most species on Earth and ultimately ends the purpose of the plant s existence br br br Forests and other vegetation br br Adverse effects may be indirectly related to acid rain like the acid s effects on soil see above or high concentration of gaseous precursors to acid rain High altitude forests are especially vulnerable as they are often surrounded by clouds and fog which are more acidic than rain br Plants are capable of adapting to acid rain On Jinyun Mountain Chongqing plant species were seen adapting to new environmental conditions The affects on the species ranged from being beneficial to detrimental With natural rainfall or mild acid rainfall the biochemical and physiological characteristics of plant seedlings were enhanced Once the pH increases reaches the threshold of the acid rain can no longer be beneficial and begins to have negative affects br Acid rain can negatively impact photosynthesis in plant leaves when leaves are exposed to a lower pH photosynthesis is impacted due to the decline in chlorophyll Acid rain also has the ability to cause deformation to leaves at a cellular level examples include tissue scaring and changes to the stomatal epidermis and mesophyll cells Additional impacts of acid rain includes a decline in cuticle thickness present on the leaf surface Because acid rain damages leaves this directly impacts a plants ability to have a strong canopy cover a decline in canopy cover can lead plants to be more vulnerable to diseases br Dead or dying trees often appear in areas impacted by acid rain Acid rain causes aluminum to leach from the soil posing risks to both plant and animal life Furthermore it strips the soil of critical minerals and nutrients necessary for tree growth br At higher altitudes acidic fog and clouds can deplete nutrients from tree foliage leading to discolored or dead leaves and needles This depletion compromises the trees ability to absorb sunlight weakening them and diminishing their capacity to endure cold conditions br Other plants can also be damaged by acid rain but the effect on food crops is minimized by the application of lime and fertilizers to replace lost nutrients In cultivated areas limestone may also be added to increase the ability of the soil to keep the pH stable but this tactic is largely unusable in the case of wilderness lands When calcium is leached from the needles of red spruce these trees become less cold tolerant and exhibit winter injury and even death Acid rain may also affect crop productivity by necrosis or changes to soil nutrients which ultimately prevent plants from reaching maturity br br br Ocean acidification br br Acid rain has a much less harmful effect on oceans on a global scale but it creates an amplified impact in the shallower waters of coastal waters Acid rain can cause the ocean s pH to fall known as ocean acidification making it more difficult for different coastal species to create their exoskeletons that they need to survive These coastal species link together as part of the ocean s food chain and without them being a source for other marine life to feed off of more marine life will die Coral s limestone skeleton is particularly sensitive to pH decreases because the calcium carbonate a core component of the limestone skeleton dissolves in acidic low pH solutions br In addition to acidification excess nitrogen inputs from the atmosphere promote increased growth of phytoplankton and other marine plants which in turn may cause more frequent harmful algal blooms and eutrophication the creation of oxygen depleted dead zones in some parts of the ocean br br br Human health effects br Acid rain can negatively impact human health especially when people breathe in particles released from acid rain The effects of acid rain on human health are complex and may be seen in several ways such as respiratory issues for long term exposure and indirect exposure through contaminated food and water sources br br br Nitrogen Dioxide Effects br Exposure to air pollutants associated with acid rain such as nitrogen dioxide NO may have a negative impact on respiratory health Water soluble nitrogen dioxide accumulates in the tiny airways where it is transformed into nitric and nitrous acids Pneumonia caused by nitric acids directly damages the epithelial cells lining the airways resulting in pulmonary edema Exposure to nitrogen dioxide also reduces the immune response by inhibiting the generation of inflammatory cytokines by alveolar macrophages in response to bacterial infection In animal studies the pollutant further reduces respiratory immunity by decreasing mucociliary clearance in the lower respiratory tract which results in a reduced ability to remove respiratory infections br br br Sulfur Trioxide Effects br The effects of sulfur trioxide and sulfuric acid are similar because they both produce sulfuric acid when they come into touch with the wet surfaces of your skin or respiratory system The amount of SO breath through the mouth is larger than the amount of SO breath through the nose When humans breathe in sulfur trioxide small droplets of sulfuric acid will form inside the body and enter the respiratory tract to the lungs depending on the particle size The effects of SO on the respiratory system lead to breathing difficulty in people who have asthma symptoms Sulfur trioxide also causes very corrosive and irritation on the skin eye and gastrointestinal tracts when there is direct exposure to a specific concentration or long term exposure Consuming concentrated sulfuric acid has been known to cause mortality burn the mouth and throat erode a hole in the stomach burns skin when it comes into contact with skin and make your eyes weep if it gets into them br br br Federal Government s recommendation br br br Nitrogen Dioxides br A parts per million ppm maximum for nitric oxide in working air has been set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA for an hour workday and a hour workweek Additionally OSHA has established a ppm nitrogen dioxide exposure limit for minutes in the workplace br br br Sulfur Trioxide br The not to exceed limits in the air water soil or food that are recommended by regulations are often based on levels that affect animals before being modified to assist in safeguarding people Depending on whether they employ different animal studies have different exposure lengths e g an hour workday versus a hour day or for other reasons these not to exceed values can vary between federal bodies br The amount of sulfur dioxide that can be emitted into the atmosphere is capped by the EPA This reduces the quantity of sulfur dioxide in the air that turns into sulfur trioxide and sulfuric acid Sulfuric acid concentrations in workroom air are restricted by OSHA to mg m Moreover NIOSH advises a time weighted average limit of mg m br When you are aware of NO and SO exposure you should talk to your doctor and ask people who are around you especially children br br br Other adverse effects br br Acid rain can damage buildings historic monuments and statues especially those made of rocks such as limestone and marble that contain large amounts of calcium carbonate Acids in the rain react with the calcium compounds in the stones to create gypsum which then flakes off br br CaCO s H SO aq CaSO s CO g H O l br The effects of this are commonly seen on old gravestones where acid rain can cause the inscriptions to become completely illegible Acid rain also increases the corrosion rate of metals in particular iron steel copper and bronze br br br Affected areas br Places significantly impacted by acid rain around the globe include most of eastern Europe from Poland northward into Scandinavia the eastern third of the United States and southeastern Canada Other affected areas include the southeastern coast of China and Taiwan br br br Prevention methods br br br Technical solutions br Many coal firing power stations use flue gas desulfurization FGD to remove sulfur containing gases from their stack gases For a typical coal fired power station FGD will remove or more of the SO in the flue gases An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used A wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot smoke stack gases from a power plant into the tower Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH neutral calcium sulfate that is physically removed from the scrubber That is the scrubber turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates br In some areas the sulfates are sold to chemical companies as gypsum when the purity of calcium sulfate is high In others they are placed in landfill The effects of acid rain can last for generations as the effects of pH level change can stimulate the continued leaching of undesirable chemicals into otherwise pristine water sources killing off vulnerable insect and fish species and blocking efforts to restore native life br Fluidized bed combustion also reduces the amount of sulfur emitted by power production br Vehicle emissions control reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides from motor vehicles br br br International treaties br br International treaties on the long range transport of atmospheric pollutants have been agreed upon by western countries for some time now Beginning in European countries convened in order to ratify general principles discussed during the UNECE Convention The purpose was to combat Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution The Helsinki Protocol on the Reduction of Sulfur Emissions under the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution furthered the results of the convention Results of the treaty have already come to fruition as evidenced by an approximate percent drop in particulate matter in North America The effectiveness of the Convention in combatting acid rain has inspired further acts of international commitment to prevent the proliferation of particulate matter Canada and the US signed the Air Quality Agreement in Most European countries and Canada signed the treaties Activity of the Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution Convention remained dormant after when countries convened to further reduce the effects of acid rain In foreign cooperation to prevent acid rain was sparked in Asia for the first time Ten diplomats from countries ranging throughout the continent convened to discuss ways to prevent acid rain Following these discussions the Acid Deposition Monitoring Network in East Asia EANET was established in as an intergovernmental initiative to provide science based inputs for decision makers and promote international cooperation on acid deposition in East Asia In the EANET member countries include Cambodia China Indonesia Japan Lao PDR Malaysia Mongolia Myanmar the Philippines Republic of Korea Russia Thailand and Vietnam br br br Emissions trading br br In this regulatory scheme every current polluting facility is given or may purchase on an open market an emissions allowance for each unit of a designated pollutant it emits Operators can then install pollution control equipment and sell portions of their emissions allowances they no longer need for their own operations thereby recovering some of the capital cost of their investment in such equipment The intention is to give operators economic incentives to install pollution controls br The first emissions trading market was established in the United States by enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of The overall goal of the Acid Rain Program established by the Act is to achieve significant environmental and public health benefits through reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide SO and nitrogen oxides NOx the primary causes of acid rain To achieve this goal at the lowest cost to society the program employs both regulatory and market based approaches for controlling air pollution br br br See also br Alkaline precipitation
