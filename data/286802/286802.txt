id: 286802
A catalytic converter is an exhaust emission control device which converts toxic gases and pollutants in exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine into less toxic pollutants by catalyzing a redox reaction Catalytic converters are usually used with internal combustion engines fueled by gasoline or diesel including lean burn engines and sometimes on kerosene heaters and stoves br The first widespread introduction of catalytic converters was in the United States automobile market To comply with the U S Environmental Protection Agency s stricter regulation of exhaust emissions most gasoline powered vehicles starting with the model year are equipped with catalytic converters These two way converters combine oxygen with carbon monoxide CO and unburned hydrocarbons HC to produce carbon dioxide CO and water H O Although two way converters on gasoline engines were rendered obsolete in by three way converters that also reduce oxides of nitrogen NOx they are still used on lean burn engines to oxidize particulate matter and hydrocarbon emissions including diesel engines which typically use lean combustion as three way converters require fuel rich or stoichiometric combustion to successfully reduce NOx br Although catalytic converters are most commonly applied to exhaust systems in automobiles they are also used on electrical generators forklifts mining equipment trucks buses locomotives motorcycles and on ships They are even used on some wood stoves to control emissions This is usually in response to government regulation either through environmental regulation or through health and safety regulations br br br History br Catalytic converter prototypes were first designed in France at the end of the th century when only a few thousand oil cars were on the roads these prototypes had inert clay based materials coated with platinum rhodium and palladium and sealed into a double metallic cylinder A few decades later a catalytic converter was patented by Eugene Houdry a French mechanical engineer Houdry was an expert in catalytic oil refining having invented the catalytic cracking process that all modern refining is based on today Houdry moved to the United States in to live near the refineries in the Philadelphia area and develop his catalytic refining process When the results of early studies of smog in Los Angeles were published Houdry became concerned about the role of smokestack exhaust and automobile exhaust in air pollution and founded a company called Oxy Catalyst Houdry first developed catalytic converters for smokestacks called cats for short and later developed catalytic converters for warehouse forklifts that used low grade unleaded gasoline In the mid s he began research to develop catalytic converters for gasoline engines used on cars and was awarded United States Patent for his work br Catalytic converters were further developed by a series of engineers including Carl D Keith John J Mooney Antonio Eleazar and Phillip Messina at Engelhard Corporation creating the first production catalytic converter in br The first widespread introduction of catalytic converters was in the United States automobile market To comply with the U S Environmental Protection Agency s new exhaust emissions regulations most gasoline powered vehicles manufactured from onwards are equipped with catalytic converters Early catalytic converters were two way combining oxygen with carbon monoxide CO and unburned hydrocarbons HC chemical compounds in fuel of the form CmHn to produce carbon dioxide CO and water H O These stringent emission control regulations also resulted in the removal of the antiknock agent tetraethyl lead from automotive gasoline to reduce lead in the air Lead and its compounds are catalyst poisons and foul catalytic converters by coating the catalyst s surface Requiring the removal of lead allowed the use of catalytic converters to meet the other emission standards in the regulations To lower harmful NOx emissions a twin catalyst system was developed in the s this added a separate rhodium platinum catalyst which reduced NOx ahead of the air pump after which a two way catalytic converter palladium platinum removed HC and CO This cumbersome and expensive system was soon made redundant after it was noted that under some conditions the initial catalyst also removed HC and CO This led to the development of the three way catalyst made possible by electronics and engine management developments br William C Pfefferle developed a catalytic combustor for gas turbines in the early s allowing combustion without significant formation of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide Four way catalytic converters have also been developed which also remove particulates from engine exhaust since most of these particulates are unburned hydrocarbons they can be burned to convert them into carbon dioxide br br br Construction br br The catalytic converter s construction is as follows br br The catalyst support or substrate For automotive catalytic converters the core is usually a ceramic monolith that has a honeycomb structure commonly square not hexagonal Prior to the mid s the catalyst material was deposited on a packed bed of alumina pellets in early GM applications Metallic foil monoliths made of Kanthal FeCrAl are used in applications where particularly high heat resistance is required The substrate is structured to produce a large surface area The cordierite ceramic substrate used in most catalytic converters was invented by Rodney Bagley Irwin Lachman and Ronald Lewis at Corning Glass for which they were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in br The washcoat A washcoat is a carrier for the catalytic materials and is used to disperse the materials over a large surface area Aluminum oxide titanium dioxide silicon dioxide e g colloidal silica or a mixture of silica and alumina can be used The catalytic materials are suspended in the washcoat prior to applying to the core Washcoat materials are selected to form a rough irregular surface which increases the surface area compared to the smooth surface of the bare substrate br Ceria or ceria zirconia These oxides are mainly added as oxygen storage promoters br The catalyst itself is most often a mix of precious metals mostly from the platinum group Platinum is the most active catalyst and is widely used but is not suitable for all applications because of unwanted additional reactions and historically high cost Palladium and rhodium are two other precious metals used though as of February platinum has become the least expensive of the platinum group metals Rhodium is used as a reduction catalyst palladium is used as an oxidation catalyst and platinum is used both for reduction and oxidation Cerium iron manganese and nickel are also used although each has limitations Nickel is not legal for use in the European Union because of its reaction with carbon monoxide into toxic nickel tetracarbonyl Copper can be used in most countries with a notable exception in Japan br Upon failure a catalytic converter can be recycled into scrap The precious metals inside the converter including platinum palladium and rhodium are extracted br br br Placement of catalytic converters br Catalytic converters require a temperature of C F to operate effectively Therefore they are placed as close to the engine as possible or one or more smaller catalytic converters known as pre cats are placed immediately after the exhaust manifold br br br Types br br br Two way br A way or oxidation sometimes called an oxi cat catalytic converter has two simultaneous tasks br br Oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide CO O CO br Oxidation of hydrocarbons unburnt and partially burned fuel to carbon dioxide and water CxH x x O xCO x H O a combustion reaction br This type of catalytic converter is widely used on diesel engines to reduce hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions They were also used on gasoline engines in American and Canadian market automobiles until Because of their inability to control oxides of nitrogen manufacturers briefly installed twin catalyst systems with an NOx reducing rhodium platinum catalyst ahead of the air pump which led to the development of the three way converter The oxi cat also continued to be used on certain lower cost cars in some markets such as Europe where NOx emissions were not universally regulated until the introduction of the Euro emissions standard br br br Three way br Three way catalytic converters have the additional advantage of controlling the emission of nitric oxide NO and nitrogen dioxide NO both together abbreviated with NOx and not to be confused with nitrous oxide N O NOx species are precursors to acid rain and smog br Since three way oxidation reduction catalytic converters have been used in vehicle emission control systems in the United States and Canada many other countries have also adopted stringent vehicle emission regulations that in effect require three way converters on gasoline powered vehicles The reduction and oxidation catalysts are typically contained in a common housing however in some instances they may be housed separately A three way catalytic converter has three simultaneous tasks br Reduction of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen N br br br br br br C br br br br br br NO br br br br

efficiently when the catalytic converter receives exhaust from an engine running slightly above the stoichiometric point For gasoline combustion this ratio is between and parts air to one part fuel by weight The ratio for autogas or liquefied petroleum gas LPG natural gas and ethanol fuels can vary significantly for each notably so with oxygenated or alcohol based fuels with e requiring approximately more fuel requiring modified fuel system tuning and components when using those fuels Engines fitted with regulated way catalytic converters are equipped with a computerized closed loop feedback fuel injection system using one or more oxygen sensors also known as Lambda Sonds or sensors Other variants combined three way converters with carburetors equipped with feedback mixture control were used An unregulated three way converter features the same chemical processes but without the oxygen sensor which meant higher NOx emissions particularly under partial loads These were low cost solutions typically used for retrofitting to older cars or for smaller cheaper cars br Three way converters are effective when the engine is operated within a narrow band of air fuel ratios near the stoichiometric point Total conversion efficiency falls very rapidly when the engine is operated outside of this band Slightly lean of stoichiometric the exhaust gases from the engine contain excess oxygen the production of NOx by the engine increases and the efficiency of the catalyst at reducing NOx falls off rapidly However the conversion of HC and CO is very efficient due to the available oxygen oxidizing to H O and CO Slightly rich of stoichiometric the production of CO and unburnt HC by the engine starts to increase dramatically available oxygen decreases and the efficiency of the catalyst for oxidizing CO and HC decreases significantly especially as stored oxygen becomes depleted However the efficiency of the catalyst at reducing NOx is good and the production of NOx by the engine decreases To maintain catalyst efficiency the air fuel ratio must stay close to stoichiometric and not remain rich or lean for too long br Closed loop engine control systems are used for effective operation of three way catalytic converters because of this continuous rich lean balance required for effective NOx reduction and HC CO oxidation The control system allows the catalyst to release oxygen during slightly rich operating conditions which oxidizes CO and HC under conditions that also favor the reduction of NOx Before the stored oxygen is depleted the control system shifts the air fuel ratio to become slightly lean improving HC and CO oxidation while storing additional oxygen in the catalyst material at a small penalty in NOx reduction efficiency Then the air fuel mixture is brought back to slightly rich at a small penalty in CO and HC oxidation efficiency and the cycle repeats Efficiency is improved when this oscillation around the stoichiometric point is small and carefully controlled br Closed loop control under light to moderate load is accomplished by using one or more oxygen sensors in the exhaust system When oxygen is detected by the sensor the air fuel ratio is lean of stoichiometric and when oxygen is not detected it is rich The control system adjusts the rate of fuel being injected into the engine based on this signal to keep the air fuel ratio near the stoichiometric point in order to maximize the catalyst conversion efficiency The control algorithm is also affected by the time delay between the adjustment of the fuel flow rate and the sensing of the changed air fuel ratio by the sensor as well as the sigmoidal response of the oxygen sensors Typical control systems are designed to rapidly sweep the air fuel ratio such that it oscillates slightly around the stoichiometric point staying near the optimal efficiency point while managing the levels of stored oxygen and unburnt HC br Closed loop control is often not used during high load maximum power operation when an increase in emissions is permitted and a rich mixture is commanded to increase power and prevent exhaust gas temperature from exceeding design limits This presents a challenge for control system and catalyst design During such operations large amounts of unburnt HC are produced by the engine well beyond the capacity of the catalyst to release oxygen The surface of the catalyst quickly becomes saturated with HC When returning to lower power output and leaner air fuel ratios the control system must prevent excessive oxygen from reaching the catalyst too quickly as this will rapidly burn the HC in the already hot catalyst potentially exceeding the design temperature limit of the catalyst Excessive catalyst temperature can prematurely age the catalyst reducing its efficiency before reaching its design lifetime Excessive catalyst temperature can also be caused by cylinder misfire which continuously flows unburnt HC combined with oxygen to the hot catalyst burning in the catalyst and increasing its temperature br br br Unwanted reactions br Unwanted reactions result in the formation of hydrogen sulfide and ammonia which poison catalysts Nickel or manganese is sometimes added to the washcoat to limit hydrogen sulfide emissions Sulfur free or low sulfur fuels eliminate or minimize problems with hydrogen sulfide br br br Diesel engines br For compression ignition i e diesel engines the most commonly used catalytic converter is the diesel oxidation catalyst DOC DOCs contain palladium and or platinum supported on alumina This catalyst converts particulate matter PM hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and water These converters often operate at percent efficiency virtually eliminating diesel odor and helping reduce visible particulates These catalysts are ineffective for NOx so NOx emissions from diesel engines are controlled by exhaust gas recirculation EGR br In most light duty diesel manufacturers in the U S added catalytic systems to their vehicles to meet federal emissions requirements Two techniques have been developed for the catalytic reduction of NOx emissions under lean exhaust conditions selective catalytic reduction SCR and the NOx adsorber br Instead of precious metal containing NOx absorbers most manufacturers selected base metal SCR systems that use a reagent such as ammonia to reduce the NOx into nitrogen and water Ammonia is supplied to the catalyst system by the injection of urea into the exhaust which then undergoes thermal decomposition and hydrolysis into ammonia The urea solution is also referred to as diesel exhaust fluid DEF br Diesel exhaust contains relatively high levels of particulate matter Catalytic converters remove only of PM so particulates are cleaned up by a soot trap or diesel particulate filter DPF In the U S all on road light medium and heavy duty diesel powered vehicles built after January are subject to diesel particulate emission limits and so are equipped with a way catalytic converter and a diesel particulate filter As long as the engine was manufactured before January the vehicle is not required to have the DPF system This led to an inventory runup by engine manufacturers in late so they could continue selling pre DPF vehicles well into br br br Lean burn spark ignition engines br For lean burn spark ignition engines an oxidation catalyst is used in the same manner as in a diesel engine Emissions from lean burn spark ignition engines are very similar to emissions from a diesel compression ignition engine br br br Installation br Many vehicles have a close coupled catalytic converter located near the engine s exhaust manifold The converter heats up quickly due to its exposure to the very hot exhaust gases enabling it to reduce undesirable emissions during the engine warm up period This is achieved by burning off the excess hydrocarbons which result from the extra rich mixture required for a cold start br When catalytic converters were first introduced most vehicles used carburetors that provided a relatively rich air fuel ratio Oxygen O levels in the exhaust stream were therefore generally insufficient for the catalytic reaction to occur efficiently Most designs of the time therefore included secondary air injection which injected air into the exhaust stream This increased the available oxygen allowing the catalyst to function as intended br Some three way catalytic converter systems have air injection systems with the air injected between the first NOx reduction and second HC and CO oxidation stages of the converter As in two way converters this injected air provides oxygen for the oxidation reactions An upstream air injection point ahead of the catalytic converter is also sometimes present to provide additional oxygen only during the engine warm up period This causes unburned fuel to ignite in the exhaust tract thereby preventing it reaching the catalytic converter at all This technique reduces the engine runtime needed for the catalytic converter to reach its light off or operating temperature br Most newer vehicles have electronic fuel injection systems and do not require air injection systems in their exhausts Instead they provide a precisely controlled air fuel mixture that quickly and continually cycles between lean and rich combustion Oxygen sensors monitor the exhaust oxygen content before and after the catalytic converter and the engine control unit uses this information to adjust the fuel injection so as to prevent the first NOx reduction catalyst from becoming oxygen loaded while simultaneously ensuring the second HC and CO oxidation catalyst is sufficiently oxygen saturated br br br Damage br Catalyst poisoning occurs when the catalytic converter is exposed to exhaust containing substances that coat the working surfaces so that they cannot contact and react with the exhaust The most notable contaminant is lead so vehicles equipped with catalytic converters can run only on unleaded fuel Other common catalyst poisons include sulfur manganese originating primarily from the gasoline additive MMT and silicon which can enter the exhaust stream if the engine has a leak that allows coolant into the combustion chamber Phosphorus is another catalyst contaminant Although phosphorus is no longer used in gasoline it and zinc another low level catalyst contaminant was widely used in engine oil antiwear additives such as zinc dithiophosphate ZDDP Beginning in a limit of phosphorus concentration in engine oils was adopted in the API SM and ILSAC GF specifications br Depending on the contaminant catalyst poisoning can sometimes be reversed by running the engine under a very heavy load for an extended period of time The increased exhaust temperature can sometimes vaporize or sublimate the contaminant removing it from the catalytic surface However removal of lead deposits in this manner is usually not possible because of lead s high boiling point br Any condition that causes abnormally high levels of unburned hydrocarbons raw or partially burnt fuel or oils to reach the converter will tend to significantly elevate its temperature bringing the risk of a meltdown of the substrate and resultant catalytic deactivation and severe exhaust restriction These conditions include failure of the upstream components of the exhaust system manifold header assembly and associated clamps susceptible to rust corrosion and or fatigue e g the exhaust manifold splintering after repeated heat cycling ignition system e g coil packs and or primary ignition components e g distributor cap wires ignition coil and spark plugs and or damaged fuel system components fuel injectors fuel pressure regulator and associated sensors Oil and or coolant leaks perhaps caused by a head gasket leak can also cause high unburned hydrocarbons br br br Regulations br br Emissions regulations vary considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction Most automobile spark ignition engines in North America have been fitted with catalytic converters since and the technology used in non automotive applications is generally based on automotive technology In many jurisdictions it is illegal to remove or disable a catalytic converter for any reason other than its direct and immediate replacement Nevertheless some vehicle owners remove or gut the catalytic converter on their vehicle In such cases the converter may be replaced by a welded in section of ordinary pipe or a flanged test pipe ostensibly meant to check if the converter is clogged by comparing how the engine runs with and without the converter This facilitates temporary reinstallation of the converter in order to pass an emission test br In the United States it is a violation of Section a A of the amended Clean Air Act for a vehicle repair shop to remove a converter from a vehicle or cause a converter to be removed from a vehicle except in order to replace it with another converter and Section a B makes it illegal for any person to sell or to install any part that would bypass defeat or render inoperative any emission control system device or design element Vehicles without functioning catalytic converters generally fail emission inspections The automotive aftermarket supplies high flow converters for vehicles with upgraded engines or whose owners prefer an exhaust system with larger than stock capacity br Catalytic converters have been mandatory on all new gasoline cars sold in the European Union and the United Kingdom since January in order to comply with the Euro emission standards br br br Effect on exhaust flow br Faulty catalytic converters as well as undamaged early types of converters can restrict the flow of exhaust which negatively affects vehicle performance and fuel economy Modern catalytic converters do not significantly restrict exhaust flow A test on a Honda Civic for example showed that removing the stock catalytic converter netted only a increase in maximum horsepower a new metallic core converter only cost the car horsepower compared to no converter br br br Dangers br Carburetors on pre vehicles without feedback fuel air mixture control could easily provide too much fuel to the engine which could cause the catalytic converter to overheat and potentially ignite flammable materials under the car br br br Warm up period br Vehicles fitted with catalytic converters emit most of their total pollution during the first five minutes of engine operation for example before the catalytic converter has warmed up sufficiently to be fully effective br In the early s it became common to place the catalyst converter right next to the exhaust manifold close to the engine for much quicker warm up br In Alpina introduced an electrically heated catalyst Called E KAT it was used in Alpina s B E KAT based on the BMW i Heating coils inside the catalytic converter assemblies are electrified just after the engine is started bringing the catalyst up to operating temperature very quickly to qualify the vehicle for low emission vehicle LEV designation BMW later introduced the same heated catalyst developed jointly by Emitec Alpina and BMW in its i in br Some vehicles contain a pre cat a small catalytic converter upstream of the main catalytic converter which heats up faster on vehicle start up reducing the emissions associated with cold starts A pre cat is most commonly used by an auto manufacturer when trying to attain the Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle ULEV rating such as on the Toyota MR Roadster br br br Environmental effect br Catalytic converters have proven to be reliable and effective in reducing noxious tailpipe emissions However they also have some shortcomings in use and also adverse environmental effects in production br br An engine equipped with a three way catalyst must run at the stoichiometric point which means more fuel is consumed than in a lean burn engine This means approximately more CO emissions from the vehicle br Catalytic converter production requires palladium or platinum part of the world supply of these precious metals is produced near Norilsk Russia where the industry among others has caused Norilsk to be added to Time magazine s list of most polluted places br The extreme heat of the converters themselves can cause wildfires especially in dry areas br br br Theft br br Because of the external location and the use of valuable precious metals including platinum palladium and rhodium catalytic converters are a target for thieves The problem is especially common among late model pickup trucks and truck based SUVs because of their high ground clearance and easily removed bolt on catalytic converters Welded on converters are also at risk of theft as they can be easily cut off The Toyota Prius catalytic converters are also targets for thieves The catalytic converters of hybrids need more of the precious metals to work properly compared to conventional internal combustion vehicles because they do not get as hot as those installed on conventional vehicles since the combustion engines of hybrids only run part of the time br Pipecutters are often used to quietly remove the converter but other tools such as a portable reciprocating saw can damage other components of the car such as the alternator wiring or fuel lines with potentially dangerous consequences br In bipartisan legislation to combat catalytic converter theft was introduced in the U S Senate The Preventing Auto Recycling Thefts Act PART Act would mandate catalytic converters in new vehicles to come with traceable identification numbers Additionally the legislation would make catalytic converter theft a federal criminal offense br br br Statistics br Rising metal prices in the U S during the s commodities boom led to a significant increase in converter theft A catalytic converter can cost more than to replace more if the vehicle is damaged during the theft Apart from damaging other systems of the vehicle theft can also cause death and injury to thieves br Thefts of catalytic converters rose over tenfold in the United States from the late s to early s driven presumably by the rise in the price of precious metals contained within the converters It is important to note that study findings reveal an average price elasticity of which means that a percent increase in the price of metal leads to an approximate percent increase in thefts According to the National Insurance Crime Bureau there were reported cases of catalytic converter theft in which increased to in In it was reported that the number of catalytic converter thefts in the United States sharply rose to total thefts for the year br From to thieves in the United Kingdom were targeting older model hybrid cars such as Toyota s hybrids which have more precious metals than newer vehicles sometimes worth more than the value of the car leading to scarcity and long delays in replacing them br In a trend emerged in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where catalytic converters were alleged to be stolen for use in illicit street drug production The drug a powder known as bomb was said to be a mixture of powdered pills vitamins and pulverized honeycomb structures of catalytic converters In however a study of various samples of the drug concluded that its alleged origin from catalytic exhausts was found to be unsubstantiated br br br Diagnostics br Various jurisdictions now require on board diagnostics to monitor the function and condition of the emissions control system including the catalytic converter Vehicles equipped with OBD II diagnostic systems are designed to alert the driver to a misfire condition by means of illuminating the check engine light on the dashboard or flashing it if the current misfire conditions are severe enough to potentially damage the catalytic converter br On board diagnostic systems take several forms br Temperature sensors are used for two purposes The first is as a warning system typically on two way catalytic converters such as are still sometimes used on LPG forklifts The function of the sensor is to warn of catalytic converter temperature above the safe limit of C F Modern catalytic converter designs are not as susceptible to temperature damage and can withstand sustained temperatures of C F Temperature sensors are also used to monitor catalyst functioning usually two sensors will be fitted with one before the catalyst and one after to monitor the temperature rise over the catalytic converter core br The oxygen sensor is the basis of the closed loop control system on a spark ignited rich burn engine however it is also used for diagnostics In vehicles with OBD II a second oxygen sensor is fitted after the catalytic converter to monitor the O levels The O levels are monitored to see the efficiency of the burn process The on board computer makes comparisons between the readings of the two sensors The readings are taken by voltage measurements If both sensors show the same output or the rear O is switching the computer recognizes that the catalytic converter either is not functioning or has been removed and will operate a malfunction indicator lamp and affect engine performance Simple oxygen sensor simulators have been developed to circumvent this problem by simulating the change across the catalytic converter with plans and pre assembled devices available on the Internet Although these are not legal for on road use they have been used with mixed results Similar devices apply an offset to the sensor signals allowing the engine to run a more fuel economical lean burn that may however damage the engine or the catalytic converter br NOx sensors are extremely expensive and are in general used only when a compression ignition engine is fitted with a selective catalytic reduction SCR converter or a NOx absorber in a feedback system When fitted to an SCR system there may be one or two sensors When one sensor is fitted it will be pre catalyst when two are fitted the second one will be post catalyst They are used for the same reasons and in the same manner as an oxygen sensor
