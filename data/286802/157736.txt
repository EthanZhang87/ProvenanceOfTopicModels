id: 157736
A hybrid vehicle is one that uses two or more distinct types of power such as submarines that use diesel when surfaced and batteries when submerged Other means to store energy include pressurized fluid in hydraulic hybrids br Hybrid powertrains are designed to switch from one power source to another to maximize both fuel efficiency and energy efficiency In hybrid electric vehicles for instance the electric motor is more efficient at producing torque or turning power while the combustion engine is better for maintaining high speed Improved efficiency lower emissions and reduced running costs relative to non hybrid vehicles are three primary benefits of hybridization br br br Vehicle types br br br Two wheeled and cycle type vehicles br Mopeds electric bicycles and even electric kick scooters are a simple form of a hybrid powered by an internal combustion engine or electric motor and the rider s muscles Early prototype motorcycles in the late th century used the same principle br br In a parallel hybrid bicycle human and motor torques are mechanically coupled at the pedal or one of the wheels e g using a hub motor a roller pressing onto a tire or a connection to a wheel using a transmission element Most motorized bicycles mopeds are of this type br In a series hybrid bicycle SHB a kind of chainless bicycle the user pedals a generator charging a battery or feeding the motor which delivers all of the torque required They are commercially available being simple in theory and manufacturing br The first published prototype of an SHB is by Augustus Kinzel US Patent in In Bernie Macdonalds conceived the Electrilite SHB with power electronics allowing regenerative braking and pedaling while stationary In Thomas Muller designed and built a Fahrrad mit elektromagnetischem Antrieb for his diploma thesis In J rg Blatter and Andreas Fuchs of Berne University of Applied Sciences built an SHB and in modified a Leitra tricycle European patent EP Until they built several prototype SH tricycles and quadricycles In Harald Kutzke described an active bicycle the aim is to approach the ideal bicycle weighing nothing and having no drag by electronic compensation br br A series hybrid electric petroleum bicycle SHEPB is powered by pedals batteries a petrol generator or plug in charger providing flexibility and range enhancements over electric only bicycles br A SHEPB prototype made by David Kitson in Australia in used a lightweight brushless DC electric motor from an aerial drone and small hand tool sized internal combustion engine and a D printed drive system and lightweight housing altogether weighing less than kg Active cooling keeps plastic parts from softening The prototype uses a regular electric bicycle charge port br br br Heavy vehicle br br Hybrid power trains use diesel electric or turbo electric to power railway locomotives buses heavy goods vehicles mobile hydraulic machinery and ships A diesel turbine engine drives an electric generator or hydraulic pump which powers electric hydraulic motors strictly an electric hydraulic transmission not a hybrid unless it can accept power from outside With large vehicles conversion losses decrease and the advantages in distributing power through wires or pipes rather than mechanical elements become more prominent especially when powering multiple drives e g driven wheels or propellers Until recently most heavy vehicles had little secondary energy storage e g batteries hydraulic accumulators excepting non nuclear submarines one of the oldest production hybrids running on diesel while surfaced and batteries when submerged Both series and parallel setups were used in World War II era submarines br br br Rail transport br br Europe br The new Autorail grande capacit AGC or high capacity railcar built by the Canadian company Bombardier for service in France is diesel electric motors using or V on different rail systems It was tested in Rotterdam the Netherlands with Railfeeding a Genesee Wyoming company br China br The First Hybrid Evaluating locomotive was designed by rail research center Matrai in and built in It was an EMD G locomotive upgraded with batteries a kW diesel generator and four AC motors br Japan br Japan s first hybrid train with significant energy storage is the KiHa E with roof mounted lithium ion batteries br India br Indian railway launched one of its kind CNG Diesel hybrid trains in January The train has a hp engine which uses fumigation technology The first of these trains is set to run on the km long Rewari Rohtak route CNG is less polluting alternative for diesel and petrol and is popular as an alternative fuel in India Already many transport vehicles such as auto rickshaws and buses run on CNG fuel br North America br In the US General Electric made a locomotive with sodium nickel chloride Na NiCl battery storage They expect fuel economy br Variant diesel electric locomotive include the Green Goat GG and Green Kid GK switching yard engines built by Canada s Railpower Technologies with lead acid Pba batteries and to hp electric motors and a new clean burning hp diesel generator No fuel is wasted for idling of the time for these types of locomotives It is unclear if regenerative braking is used but in principle it is easily utilized br Since these engines typically need extra weight for traction purposes anyway the battery pack s weight is a negligible penalty The diesel generator and batteries are normally built on an existing retired yard locomotive s frame The existing motors and running gear are all rebuilt and reused Fuel savings of and up to pollution reductions are claimed over a typical older switching yard engine The advantages hybrid cars have for frequent starts and stops and idle periods apply to typical switching yard use Green Goat locomotives have been purchased by Canadian Pacific BNSF Kansas City Southern Railway and Union Pacific among others br br br Cranes br Railpower Technologies engineers working with TSI Terminal Systems are testing a hybrid diesel electric power unit with battery storage for use in Rubber Tyred Gantry RTG cranes RTG cranes are typically used for loading and unloading shipping containers onto trains or trucks in ports and container storage yards The energy used to lift the containers can be partially regained when they are lowered Diesel fuel and emission reductions of are predicted by Railpower engineers First systems are expected to be operational in br br br Road transport commercial vehicles br br Hybrid systems are regularly in use for trucks buses and other heavy highway vehicles Small fleet sizes and installation costs are compensated by fuel savings with advances such as higher capacity lowered battery cost etc Toyota Ford GM and others are introducing hybrid pickups and SUVs Kenworth Truck Company recently introduced the Kenworth T Class that for city usage seems to be competitive FedEx and others are investing in hybrid delivery vehicles particularly for city use where hybrid technology may pay off first As of December FedEx is trialling two delivery trucks with Wrightspeed electric motors and diesel generators the retrofit kits are claimed to pay for themselves in a few years The diesel engines run at a constant RPM for peak efficiency br In students at Minneapolis Minnesota s Hennepin Vocational Technical Center converted a Volkswagen Beetle to a petro hydraulic hybrid with off the shelf components A car rated at mpg was returning mpg with the hp engine replaced by a hp engine and reached mph br In the s engineers at EPA s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory developed a petro hydraulic powertrain for a typical American sedan car The test car achieved over mpg on combined EPA city highway driving cycles Acceleration was mph in seconds using a liter diesel engine No lightweight materials were used The EPA estimated that produced in high volumes the hydraulic components would add only to the cost Under EPA testing a hydraulic hybrid Ford Expedition returned mpg L km City and mpg L km highway UPS currently has two trucks in service using this technology br br br Military off road vehicles br Since the US military has been testing serial hybrid Humvees and have found them to deliver faster acceleration a stealth mode with low thermal signature near silent operation and greater fuel economy br br br Ships br Ships with both mast mounted sails and steam engines were an early form of a hybrid vehicle Another example is the diesel electric submarine This runs on batteries when submerged and the batteries can be recharged by the diesel engine when the craft is on the surface br As of there are ships with an average of MWh of batteries The average was kWh in br Newer hybrid ship propulsion schemes include large towing kites manufactured by companies such as SkySails Towing kites can fly at heights several times higher than the tallest ship masts capturing stronger and steadier winds br br br Aircraft br The Boeing Fuel Cell Demonstrator Airplane has a Proton Exchange Membrane PEM fuel cell lithium ion battery hybrid system to power an electric motor which is coupled to a conventional propeller The fuel cell provides all power for the cruise phase of flight During takeoff and climb the flight segment that requires the most power the system draws on lightweight lithium ion batteries br The demonstrator aircraft is a Dimona motor glider built by Diamond Aircraft Industries of Austria which also carried out structural modifications to the aircraft With a wingspan of meters feet the airplane will be able to cruise at about km h mph on power from the fuel cell br Hybrid FanWings have been designed A FanWing is created by two engines with the capability to autorotate and landing like a helicopter br br br Engine type br br br Hybrid electric petroleum vehicles br br When the term hybrid vehicle is used it most often refers to a Hybrid electric vehicle These encompass such vehicles as the Saturn Vue Toyota Prius Toyota Yaris Toyota Camry Hybrid Ford Escape Hybrid Ford Fusion Hybrid Toyota Highlander Hybrid Honda Insight Honda Civic Hybrid Lexus RX h and h Hyundai Ioniq and others A petroleum electric hybrid most commonly uses internal combustion engines using a variety of fuels generally gasoline or Diesel engines and electric motors to power the vehicle The energy is stored in the fuel of the internal combustion engine and an electric battery set There are many types of petroleum electric hybrid drivetrains from Full hybrid to Mild hybrid which offer varying advantages and disadvantages br William H Patton filed a patent application for a gasoline electric hybrid rail car propulsion system in early and for a similar hybrid boat propulsion system in mid There is no evidence that his hybrid boat met with any success but he built a prototype hybrid tram and sold a small hybrid locomotive br In Henri Pieper developed the world s first petro electric hybrid automobile In Ferdinand Porsche developed a series hybrid using two motor in wheel hub arrangements with an internal combustion generator set providing the electric power Porsche s hybrid set two speed records br While liquid fuel electric hybrids date back to the late th century the braking regenerative hybrid was invented by David Arthurs an electrical engineer from Springdale Arkansas in His home converted Opel GT was reported to return as much as mpg with plans still sold to this original design and the Mother Earth News modified version on their website br The plug in electric vehicle PEV is becoming more and more common It has the range needed in locations where there are wide gaps with no services The batteries can be plugged into house mains electricity for charging as well being charged while the engine is running br br br Continuously outboard recharged electric vehicle br Some battery electric vehicles can be recharged while the user drives Such a vehicle establishes contact with an electrified rail plate or overhead wires on the highway via an attached conducting wheel or other similar mechanisms see conduit current collection The vehicle s batteries are recharged by this process on the highway and can then be used normally on other roads until the battery is discharged For example some of the battery electric locomotives used for maintenance trains on the London Underground are capable of this mode of operation br Developing an infrastructure for battery electric vehicles would provide the advantage of virtually unrestricted highway range Since many destinations are within km of a major highway this technology could reduce the need for expensive battery systems However private use of the existing electrical system is almost universally prohibited Besides the technology for such electrical infrastructure is largely outdated and outside some cities not widely distributed see Conduit current collection trams electric rail trolleys third rail Updating the required electrical and infrastructure costs could perhaps be funded by toll revenue or by dedicated transportation taxes br br br Hybrid fuel dual mode br br In addition to vehicles that use two or more different devices for propulsion some also consider vehicles that use distinct energy sources or input types fuels using the same engine to be hybrids although to avoid confusion with hybrids as described above and to use correctly the terms these are perhaps more correctly described as dual mode vehicles br br Some trolleybuses can switch between an onboard diesel engine and overhead electrical power depending on conditions see dual mode bus In principle this could be combined with a battery subsystem to create a true plug in hybrid trolleybus although as of no such design seems to have been announced br Flexible fuel vehicles can use a mixture of input fuels mixed in one tank typically gasoline and ethanol methanol or biobutanol br Bi fuel vehicle Liquified petroleum gas and natural gas are very different from petroleum or diesel and cannot be used in the same tanks so it would be challenging to build an LPG or NG flexible fuel system Instead vehicles are built with two parallel fuel systems feeding one engine For example some Chevrolet Silverado HDs can effortlessly switch between petroleum and natural gas offering a range of over km miles While the duplicated tanks cost space in some applications the increased range decreased cost of fuel and flexibility where LPG or CNG infrastructure is incomplete may be a significant incentive to purchase While the US Natural gas infrastructure is partially incomplete it is increasing and in had CNG stations in place Rising gas prices may push consumers to purchase these vehicles In when gas prices traded around US per litre US gal the price of gasoline was US per megawatt hour per million British thermal units compared to natural gas s MWh per million British thermal units On a per unit of energy comparative basis this makes natural gas much cheaper than gasoline br Some vehicles have been modified to use another fuel source if it is available such as cars modified to run on autogas LPG and diesels modified to run on waste vegetable oil that has not been processed into biodiesel br Power assist mechanisms for bicycles and other human powered vehicles are also included see Motorized bicycle br br br Fluid power hybrid br br Hydraulic hybrid and pneumatic hybrid vehicles use an engine or regenerative braking or both to charge a pressure accumulator to drive the wheels via hydraulic liquid or pneumatic compressed gas drive units In most cases the engine is detached from the drivetrain serving solely to charge the energy accumulator The transmission is seamless Regenerative braking can be used to recover some of the supplied drive energy back into the accumulator br br br Petro air hybrid br A French company MDI has designed and has running models of a petro air hybrid engine car The system does not use air motors to drive the vehicle being directly driven by a hybrid engine The engine uses a mixture of compressed air and gasoline injected into the cylinders A key aspect of the hybrid engine is the active chamber which is a compartment heating air via fuel doubling the energy output Tata Motors of India assessed the design phase towards full production for the Indian market and moved into completing detailed development of the compressed air engine into specific vehicle and stationary applications br br br Petro hydraulic hybrid br br Petro hydraulic configurations have been common in trains and heavy vehicles for decades The auto industry recently focused on this hybrid configuration as it now shows promise for introduction into smaller vehicles br In petro hydraulic hybrids the energy recovery rate is high and therefore the system is more efficient than electric battery charged hybrids using the current electric battery technology demonstrating a to increase in energy economy in US Environmental Protection Agency EPA testing The charging engine needs only to be sized for average usage with acceleration bursts using the stored energy in the hydraulic accumulator which is charged when in low energy demanding vehicle operation The charging engine runs at optimum speed and load for efficiency and longevity Under tests undertaken by the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA a hydraulic hybrid Ford Expedition returned miles per US gallon L km mpg imp City and miles per US gallon L km mpg imp highway UPS currently has two trucks in service using this technology br Although petro hydraulic hybrid technology has been known for decades and used in trains as well as very large construction vehicles the high costs of the equipment precluded the systems from lighter trucks and cars In the modern sense an experiment proved the viability of small petro hydraulic hybrid road vehicles in A group of students at Minneapolis Minnesota s Hennepin Vocational Technical Center converted a Volkswagen Beetle car to run as a petro hydraulic hybrid using off the shelf components A car rated at mpg US L km mpg imp was returning mpg US L km mpg imp with the hp engine replaced by a hp engine The experimental car reached mph km h br In the s a team of engineers working at EPA s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory succeeded in developing a revolutionary type of petro hydraulic hybrid powertrain that would propel a typical American sedan car The test car achieved over mpg on combined EPA city highway driving cycles Acceleration was mph in seconds using a L diesel engine No lightweight materials were used The EPA estimated that produced in high volumes the hydraulic components would add only to the base cost of the vehicle br The petro hydraulic hybrid system has a faster and more efficient charge discharge cycling than petro electric hybrids and is also cheaper to build The accumulator vessel size dictates total energy storage capacity and may require more space than an electric battery set Any vehicle space consumed by a larger size of accumulator vessel may be offset by the need for a smaller sized charging engine in HP and physical size br Research is underway in large corporations and small companies The focus has now switched to smaller vehicles The system components were expensive which precluded installation in smaller trucks and cars A drawback was that the power driving motors were not efficient enough at part load A British company Artemis Intelligent Power made a breakthrough introducing an electronically controlled hydraulic motor pump the Digital Displacement motor pump The pump is highly efficient at all speed ranges and loads giving feasibility to small applications of petro hydraulic hybrids The company converted a BMW car as a test bed to prove viability The BMW i gave double the mpg in city driving compared to the standard car This test was using the standard cc engine with a smaller engine the figures would have been more impressive The design of petro hydraulic hybrids using well sized accumulators allows downsizing an engine to average power usage not peak power usage Peak power is provided by the energy stored in the accumulator A smaller more efficient constant speed engine reduces weight and liberates space for a larger accumulator br Current vehicle bodies are designed around the mechanicals of existing engine transmission setups It is restrictive and far from ideal to install petro hydraulic mechanicals into existing bodies not designed for hydraulic setups One research project s goal is to create a blank paper design new car to maximize the packaging of petro hydraulic hybrid components in the vehicle All bulky hydraulic components are integrated into the chassis of the car One design has claimed to return mpg in tests by using a large hydraulic accumulator which is also the structural chassis of the car The small hydraulic driving motors are incorporated within the wheel hubs driving the wheels and reversing to claw back kinetic braking energy The hub motors eliminate the need for friction brakes mechanical transmissions driveshafts and U joints reducing costs and weight Hydrostatic drive with no friction brakes is used in industrial vehicles The aim is mpg in average driving conditions The energy created by shock absorbers and kinetic braking energy that normally would be wasted assists in charging the accumulator A small fossil fuelled piston engine sized for average power use charges the accumulator The accumulator is sized at running the car for minutes when fully charged The aim is a fully charged accumulator that will produce a mph acceleration speed of under seconds using four wheel drive br In January industry giant Chrysler announced a partnership with the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA to design and develop an experimental petro hydraulic hybrid powertrain suitable for use in large passenger cars In an existing production minivan was adapted to the new hydraulic powertrain for assessment br PSA Peugeot Citro n exhibited an experimental Hybrid Air engine at the Geneva Motor Show The vehicle uses nitrogen gas compressed by energy harvested from braking or deceleration to power a hydraulic drive which supplements power from its conventional gasoline engine The hydraulic and electronic components were supplied by Robert Bosch GmbH Mileage was estimated to be about mpg US L km mpg imp on the Euro test cycle if installed in a Citro n C type of body PSA Although the car was ready for production and was proven and feasible delivering the claimed results Peugeot Citro n were unable to attract a major manufacturer to share the high development costs and are shelving the project until a partnership can be arranged br br br Electric human power hybrid vehicle br Another form of a hybrid vehicle are the human powered electric vehicles These include such vehicles as the Sinclair C Twike electric bicycles electric skateboards and Electric motorcycles and scooters br br br Hybrid vehicle power train configurations br br br Parallel hybrid br br In a parallel hybrid vehicle an electric motor and an internal combustion engine are coupled such that they can power the vehicle either individually or together Most commonly the internal combustion engine the electric motor and gearbox are coupled by automatically controlled clutches For electric driving the clutch between the internal combustion engine is open while the clutch to the gearbox is engaged While in combustion mode the engine and motor run at the same speed br The first mass production parallel hybrid sold outside Japan was the st generation Honda Insight br The Mercedes Benz E BlueTEC HYBRID released in only in European markets is a very rare mass produced diesel hybrid vehicle powered by a Mercedes Benz OM engine developing kW hp paired with a kW hp electric motor positioned between the engine and the gearbox for a combined output of kW hp The vehicle has a fuel consumption rate of km L mpg US mpg imp br br br Mild parallel hybrid br These types use a generally compact electric motor usually kW to provide auto stop start features and to provide extra power assist during the acceleration and to generate on the deceleration phase also known as regenerative braking br On road examples include Honda Civic Hybrid Honda Insight nd generation Honda CR Z Honda Accord Hybrid Mercedes Benz S BlueHYBRID BMW Series hybrids General Motors BAS Hybrids Suzuki S Cross Suzuki Wagon R and Smart fortwo with micro hybrid drive br br br Power split or series parallel hybrid br In a power split hybrid electric drive train there are two motors a traction electric motor and an internal combustion engine The power from these two motors can be shared to drive the wheels via a power split device which is a simple planetary gear set The ratio can be from for the combustion engine to for the traction electric motor or anything in between The combustion engine can act as a generator charging the batteries br Modern versions such as the Toyota Hybrid Synergy Drive have a second electric motor generator connected to the planetary gear In cooperation with the traction motor generator and the power split device this provides a continuously variable transmission br On the open road the primary power source is the internal combustion engine When maximum power is required for example to overtake the traction electric motor is used to assist This increases the available power for a short period giving the effect of having a larger engine than actually installed In most applications the combustion engine is switched off when the car is slow or stationary thereby reducing curbside emissions br Passenger car installations include Toyota Prius Ford Escape and Fusion as well as Lexus RX h RX h GS h LS h and CT h br br br Series hybrid br br A series or serial hybrid vehicle is driven by an electric motor functioning as an electric vehicle while the battery pack energy supply is sufficient with an engine tuned for running as a generator when the battery pack is insufficient There is typically no mechanical connection between the engine and the wheels and the primary purpose of the range extender is to charge the battery Series hybrids have also been referred to as extended range electric vehicle range extended electric vehicle or electric vehicle extended range EREV REEV EVER br The BMW i with Range Extender is a production series hybrid It operates as an electric vehicle until the battery charge is low and then activates an engine powered generator to maintain power and is also available without the range extender The Fisker Karma was the first series hybrid production vehicle br When describing cars the battery of a series hybrid is usually charged by being plugged in but a series hybrid may also allow for a battery to only act as a buffer and for regeneration purposes and for the electric motor s power to be supplied constantly by a supporting engine Series arrangements have been common in diesel electric locomotives and ships Ferdinand Porsche effectively invented this arrangement in speed record setting racing cars in the early th century such as the Lohner Porsche Mixte Hybrid Porsche named his arrangement System Mixt and it was a wheel hub motor design where each of the two front wheels was powered by a separate motor This arrangement was sometimes referred to as an electric transmission as the electric generator and driving motor replaced a mechanical transmission The vehicle could not move unless the internal combustion engine was running br In Toyota released the first series hybrid bus sold in Japan GM introduced the Chevy Volt series plug in hybrid in aiming for an all electric range of mi km though this car also has a mechanical connection between the engine and drivetrain Supercapacitors combined with a lithium ion battery bank have been used by AFS Trinity in a converted Saturn Vue SUV vehicle Using supercapacitors they claim up to mpg in a series hybrid arrangement br Nissan Note e power is an example of a series hybrid technology since in Japan br br br Plug in hybrid electric vehicle br br Another subtype of hybrid vehicles is the plug in hybrid electric vehicle The plug in hybrid is usually a general fuel electric parallel or serial hybrid with increased energy storage capacity usually through a lithium ion battery which allows the vehicle to drive on all electric mode a distance that depends on the battery size and its mechanical layout series or parallel It may be connected to mains electricity supply at the end of the journey to avoid charging using the on board internal combustion engine br This concept is attractive to those seeking to minimize on road emissions by avoiding or at least minimizing the use of ICE during daily driving As with pure electric vehicles the total emissions saving for example in CO terms is dependent upon the energy source of the electricity generating company br For some users this type of vehicle may also be financially attractive so long as the electrical energy being used is cheaper than the petrol diesel that they would have otherwise used Current tax systems in many European countries use mineral oil taxation as a major income source This is generally not the case for electricity which is taxed uniformly for the domestic customer however that person uses it Some electricity suppliers also offer price benefits for off peak night users which may further increase the attractiveness of the plug in option for commuters and urban motorists br br br Road safety for cyclists pedestrians br br A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report examined hybrid electric vehicle accidents that involved pedestrians and cyclists and compared them to accidents involving internal combustion engine vehicles ICEV The findings showed that in certain road situations HEVs are more dangerous for those on foot or bicycle For accidents where a vehicle was slowing or stopping backing up entering or leaving a parking space when the sound difference between HEVs and ICEVs is most pronounced HEVs were twice as likely to be involved in a pedestrian crash than ICEVs For crashes involving cyclists or pedestrians there was a higher incident rate for HEVs than ICEVs when a vehicle was turning a corner However there was no statistically significant difference between the types of vehicles when they were driving straight br Several automakers developed electric vehicle warning sounds designed to alert pedestrians to the presence of electric drive vehicles such as hybrid electric vehicle plug in hybrid electric vehicles and all electric vehicles EVs travelling at low speeds Their purpose is to make pedestrians cyclists the blind and others aware of the vehicle s presence while operating in all electric mode br Vehicles in the market with such safety devices include the Nissan Leaf Chevrolet Volt Fisker Karma Honda FCX Clarity Nissan Fuga Hybrid Infiniti M Hyundai ix FCEV Hyundai Sonata Hybrid Honda Fit EV the Toyota Camry Hybrid Lexus CT h and all the Prius family of cars br br br Environmental issues br br br Fuel consumption and emissions reductions br The hybrid vehicle typically achieves greater fuel economy and lower emissions than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles ICEVs resulting in fewer emissions being generated These savings are primarily achieved by three elements of a typical hybrid design br br Relying on both the engine and the electric motors for peak power needs resulting in a smaller engine size more for average usage rather than peak power usage A smaller engine can have fewer internal losses and lower weight br Having significant battery storage capacity to store and reuse recaptured energy especially in stop and go traffic typical of the city driving cycle br Recapturing significant amounts of energy during braking that are normally wasted as heat This regenerative braking reduces vehicle speed by converting some of its kinetic energy into electricity depending upon the power rating of the motor generator br Other techniques that are not necessarily hybrid features but that are frequently found on hybrid vehicles include br br Using Atkinson cycle engines instead of Otto cycle engines for improved fuel economy br Shutting down the engine during traffic stops or while coasting or during other idle periods br Improving aerodynamics part of the reason that SUVs get such bad fuel economy is the drag on the car A box shaped car or truck has to exert more force to move through the air causing more stress on the engine making it work harder Improving the shape and aerodynamics of a car is a good way to help better the fuel economy and also improve vehicle handling at the same time br Using low rolling resistance tires tires were often made to give a quiet smooth ride high grip etc but efficiency was a lower priority Tires cause mechanical drag once again making the engine work harder consuming more fuel Hybrid cars may use special tires that are more inflated than regular tires and stiffer or by choice of carcass structure and rubber compound have lower rolling resistance while retaining acceptable grip and so improving fuel economy whatever the power source br Powering the a c power steering and other auxiliary pumps electrically as and when needed this reduces mechanical losses when compared with driving them continuously with traditional engine belts br These features make a hybrid vehicle particularly efficient for city traffic where there are frequent stops coasting and idling periods In addition noise emissions are reduced particularly at idling and low operating speeds in comparison to conventional engine vehicles For continuous high speed highway use these features are much less useful in reducing emissions br br br Hybrid vehicle emissions br Hybrid vehicle emissions today are getting close to or even lower than the recommended level set by the EPA Environmental Protection Agency The recommended levels they suggest for a typical passenger vehicle should be equated to metric tons of CO The three most popular hybrid vehicles Honda Civic Honda Insight and Toyota Prius set the standards even higher by producing and tons showing a major improvement in carbon dioxide emissions Hybrid vehicles can reduce air emissions of smog forming pollutants by up to and cut carbon dioxide emissions in half br An increase in fossil fuels is needed to build hybrid vehicles versus conventional cars This increase is more than offset by reduced emissions when running the vehicle br Hybrid CO emissions have been understated when comparing certification cycles to real world driving In one study using real world driving data it was shown they use on average g of CO per km instead of the g per km in official tests br Toyota states that three Hybrid vehicles equal one battery electric vehicle in CO reduction effect from carbon neutrality viewpoint which means reducing CO emissions to zero throughout the entire life cycle of a product starting from procurement of raw materials manufacturing and transportation to use recycling and disposal br br br Environmental impact of hybrid car battery br br Though hybrid cars consume less fuel than conventional cars there is still an issue regarding the environmental damage of the hybrid car battery Today most hybrid car batteries are Lithium ion which has higher energy density than nickel metal hydride batteries and is more environmentally friendly than lead based batteries which constitute the bulk of petrol car starter batteries today br There are many types of batteries Some are far more toxic than others Lithium ion is the least toxic of the batteries mentioned above br The toxicity levels and environmental impact of nickel metal hydride batteries the type previously used in hybrids are much lower than batteries like lead acid or nickel cadmium according to one source Another source claims nickel metal hydride batteries are much more toxic than lead batteries also that recycling them and disposing of them safely is difficult In general various soluble and insoluble nickel compounds such as nickel chloride and nickel oxide have known carcinogenic effects in chick embryos and rats The main nickel compound in NiMH batteries is nickel oxyhydroxide NiOOH which is used as the positive electrode However Nickel Metal Hydride Batteries have fallen out of favour in hybrid vehicles as various Lithium Ion Chemistries have become more mature to market br The lithium ion battery has become a market leader in this segment due to its high energy density stability and cost when compared to other technologies A market leader in this area is Panasonic with their partnership with Tesla br The lithium ion batteries are appealing because they have the highest energy density of any rechargeable batteries and can produce a voltage more than three times that of nickel metal hydride battery cell while simultaneously storing large quantities of electricity as well The batteries also produce higher output boosting vehicle power higher efficiency avoiding wasteful use of electricity and provides excellent durability compared with the life of the battery being roughly equivalent to the life of the vehicle Additionally the use of lithium ion batteries reduces the overall weight of the vehicle and also achieves improved fuel economy of better than petro powered vehicles with a consequent reduction in CO emissions helping to prevent global warming br br Lithium ion batteries are also safer to recycle with Volkswagen Group pioneering processes to recycle lithium ion batteries this is also being chased by various other large companies such as BMW Audi Mercedes Benz and Tesla The main goal within many of these companies is to combat disinformation about the nature of lithium batteries primarily that they are not recyclable which primarily stem from articles discussing the difficulties of recycling br br br Charging br There are two different levels of charging in plug in hybrids Level one charging is the slower method as it uses a V A single phase grounded outlet Level two is a faster method existing Level equipment offers charging from V or V at up to A kW It may require dedicated equipment and a connection installation for home or public units The optimum charging window for Lithium ion batteries is V Recharging with a volt household outlet takes several hours a volt charger takes hours and a quick charge takes approximately minutes to achieve charge Three important factors distance on charge cost of charging and time to charge br In order for hybrids to run on electrical power the car must perform the action of braking in order to generate some electricity The electricity then gets discharged most effectively when the car accelerates or climbs up an incline br In hybrid electric car batteries can run on solely electricity for miles km on a single charge Hybrid battery capacity currently ranges from kWh to kWh on a fully electric car On a hybrid car the battery packs currently range from kWh to kWh representing a large difference in use of electricity in hybrid cars br br br Raw materials increasing costs br br There is an impending increase in the costs of many rare materials used in the manufacture of hybrid cars For example the rare earth element dysprosium is required to fabricate many of the advanced electric motors and battery systems in hybrid propulsion systems Neodymium is another rare earth metal which is a crucial ingredient in high strength magnets that are found in permanent magnet electric motors br Nearly all the rare earth elements in the world come from China and many analysts believe that an overall increase in Chinese electronics manufacturing will consume this entire supply by In addition export quotas on Chinese rare earth elements have resulted in an unknown amount of supply br A few non Chinese sources such as the advanced Hoidas Lake project in northern Canada as well as Mount Weld in Australia are currently under development however the barriers to entry are high and require years to go online br br br How hybrid electric vehicles work br Hybrids Electric vehicles HEVs combine the advantage of gasoline engines and electric motors The key areas for efficiency or performance gains are regenerative braking dual power sources and less idling br br Regenerative braking The electric motor normally converts electricity into physical motion Used in reverse as a generator it can also convert physical motion into electricity This both slows the car braking and recharges regenerates the batteries br Dual power Power can come from either the engine motor or both depending on driving circumstances Additional power to assist the engine in accelerating or climbing might be provided by the electric motor Or more commonly a smaller electric motor provides all of the power for low speed driving conditions and is augmented by the engine at higher speeds br Automatic start shutoff It automatically shuts off the engine when the vehicle comes to a stop and restarts it when the accelerator is pressed down This automation is much simpler with an electric motor Also see dual power above br br br Alternative green vehicles br br Other types of green vehicles include other vehicles that go fully or partly on alternative energy sources than fossil fuel Another option is to use alternative fuel composition i e biofuels in conventional fossil fuel based vehicles making them go partly on renewable energy sources br Other approaches include personal rapid transit a public transportation concept that offers automated on demand non stop transportation on a network of specially built guideways br br br Marketing br br br Adoption br Automakers spend around US million in marketing Hybrid vehicles each year With combined effort from many car companies the Hybrid industry has sold millions of Hybrids br Hybrid car companies like Toyota Honda Ford and BMW have pulled together to create a movement of Hybrid vehicle sales pushed by Washington lobbyists to lower the world s emissions and become less reliant on our petroleum consumption br In sales went beyond Hybrids but in retrospect that only reduced the global use for gasoline consumption by gallons per day a tiny fraction of the million gallons used per day According to Bradley Berman author of Driving Change One Hybrid at a time cold economics shows that in real dollars except for a brief spike in the s gas prices have remained remarkably steady and cheap Fuel continues to represent a small part of the overall cost of owning and operating a personal vehicle Other marketing tactics include greenwashing which is the unjustified appropriation of environmental virtue br Temma Ehrenfeld explained in an article by Newsweek Hybrids may be more efficient than many other gasoline motors as far as gasoline consumption is concerned but as far as being green and good for the environment is completely inaccurate br Hybrid car companies have a long time to go if they expect to really go green According to Harvard business professor Theodore Levitt states managing products and meeting customers needs you must adapt to consumer expectations and anticipation of future desires This means people buy what they want if they want a fuel efficient car they buy a Hybrid without thinking about the actual efficiency of the product This green myopia as Ottman calls it fails because marketers focus on the greenness of the product and not on the actual effectiveness br Researchers and analysts say people are drawn to the new technology as well as the convenience of fewer fill ups Secondly people find it rewarding to own the better newer flashier and so called greener car br br br Misleading advertising br In the term self charging hybrid became prevalent in advertising though cars referred to by this name do not offer any different functionality than a standard hybrid electric vehicle provides The only self charging effect is in energy recovery via regenerative braking which is also true of plug in hybrids fuel cell electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles br In January using this term has been prohibited in Norway for misleading advertising by Toyota and Lexus Our claim is based on the fact that customers never have to charge the battery of their vehicle as it is recharged during the vehicle use There is no intention to mislead customers on the contrary the point is to clearly explain the difference with plug in hybrid vehicles br br br Adoption rate br While the adoption rate for hybrids in the US is small today of new car sales in this compares with a share of new car sales in Japan in and it has the potential to be very large over time as more models are offered and incremental costs decline due to learning and scale benefits However forecasts vary widely For instance Bob Lutz a long time skeptic of hybrids indicated he expects hybrids will never comprise more than of the US auto market Other sources also expect hybrid penetration rates in the US will remain under for many years br More optimistic views as of include predictions that hybrids would dominate new car sales in the US and elsewhere over the next to years Another approach taken by Saurin Shah examines the penetration rates or S curves of four analogs historical and current to hybrid and electrical vehicles in an attempt to gauge how quickly the vehicle stock could be hybridized and or electrified in the United States The analogs are the electric motors in US factories in the early th century diesel electric locomotives on US railways in the period a range of new automotive features technologies introduced in the US over the past fifty years and e bike purchases in China over the past few years These analogs collectively suggest it would take at least years for hybrid and electric vehicles to capture of the US passenger vehicle stock br The EPA expects the combined market share of new gasoline hybrid light duty vehicles to reach for the model year from in the model year br br br European Union regulation standards br The European Parliament Council and European Commission have reached an agreement which is aimed at reducing the average CO passenger car emissions to g km by according to a European Commission press release br According to the release the key details of the agreement are as follows br Emissions target The agreement will reduce average CO emissions from new cars to g km from as proposed by the commission This is a reduction from the mandatory target of g km The target is an average for each manufacturer s new car fleet it allows OEMs to build some vehicles that emit less than the average and some that emit more br target The commission is required to propose a further emissions reduction target by the end to take effect in This target will be in line with the EU s long term climate goals br Super credits for low emission vehicles The Regulation will give manufacturers additional incentives to produce cars with CO emissions of g km or less which will be electric or plug in hybrid cars Each of these vehicles will be counted as two vehicles in in in and then as one vehicle from onwards These super credits will help manufacturers further reduce the average emissions of their new car fleet However to prevent the scheme from undermining the environmental integrity of the legislation there will be a g km cap per manufacturer on the contribution that super credits can make to their target in any year br br br
