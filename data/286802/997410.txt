id: 997410
The Ram pickup marketed as the Dodge Ram until when Ram Trucks was spun off from Dodge is a full size pickup truck manufactured by Stellantis North America formerly Chrysler Group LLC and FCA US LLC and marketed from onwards under the Ram Trucks brand The current fifth generation Ram debuted at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit Michigan in January of that year br Previously Ram was part of the Dodge line of light trucks The name Ram was first used in model year Dodge Trucks in October following the retiring and rebadging of the Dodge D series pickup trucks as well as B series vans though the company had used a ram s head hood ornament on some trucks as early as br Ram trucks have been named Motor Trend magazine s Truck of the Year eight times the second generation Ram won the award in the third generation Ram heavy duty won the award in the fourth generation Ram Heavy Duty won in and the fourth generation Ram won in and and the current fifth generation Ram pickup became the first truck in history to win the award three times winning in and br br br First generation D W br br The first generation Dodge Ram trucks and vans introduced in October feature a Ram hood ornament first used on Dodge vehicles from until Not all of the first generation trucks have this ornament and is most commonly seen on four wheel drive models Dodge kept the previous generation s model designations D or Ram indicate two wheel drive while W or Power Ram indicate four wheel drive Just like Ford s F Series Dodge used to indicate a half ton truck for a three quarter ton truck and for a one ton truck The truck models were offered in standard cab Club extended cab and crew cab configurations They also were offered along with ft m and ft m bed lengths and Utiline and Sweptline styled boxes along with standard boxes Externally the first generation Rams were facelifted versions of the previous generation Dodge D Series pickups introduced in The new model introduced larger wraparound tail lamps dual rectangular headlamps and squared off body lines Engine choices were pared down to the slant and and V s The interior was updated included a new bench seat a completely new dashboard and an instrument cluster with an optional three pod design a speedometer in the center with the two side pods containing an ammeter on the top left a temperature gauge on the bottom left a fuel gauge on the top right and an oil pressure gauge bottom right Models without the full gauge package had only indicator lights in the place of the temperature and oil pressure gauges Among the options offered on the Ram were front bumper guards a sliding rear cab window air conditioning cruise control tilt steering column power door locks and windows AM FM stereo with a cassette tape player styled road wheels aluminum turbine style mag wheels special paint and stripe packages two tone paint and a plow package for four wheel drive models referred to as the Sno Commander br The Club Cab was dropped from the lineup after but Dodge kept the tooling and reintroduced it nearly a decade later in the models The four door crew cab and Utiline beds were dropped after the model year to make room on the assembly line for the then upcoming Dodge Dakota and were never reintroduced in this generation br Basic Ram models were reintroduced for replacing the previous Miser trim level available on the Ram A Ram Trac shift on the fly transfer case was added for the Power Rams and both the crew cab and Utiline flared bed versions were discontinued for the latter not to return on any Chrysler built pickup In the slant engine was replaced by a L cu in fuel injected V engine first introduced with the Dodge Dakota The L cu in engine on which the L V is based also received electronic fuel injection in Because of the new computer controlled fuel injection ignition and ABS system more vehicle information needed to be displayed through any warning or notification lights so inside the cab where a small compartment was once located on the dash a new message center with four small rectangular light spots contained the check engine light and other tell tales including one for the parking brake and the ABS if the truck was so equipped The message center later included wait to start and water in fuel lights on diesel models Diagnostic fault codes were stored in the computer s memory and cycling the ignition key three times allowed the computer to flash the trouble codes through the check engine light for diagnosis of some problems Rear ABS became standard equipment in br The Ram model designation was dropped and these models folded back into the range for due to the introduction and sales success of the Dodge Dakota pickup Additionally the instrument cluster was slightly revised the ammeter was replaced by a voltmeter while maintaining the pod arrangement of the speedometer and gauges Also for Dodge reintroduced the Club Cab equipped with fold out jump seats for the models Entry was made through the passenger or driver s doors because there were no rear doors for this configuration For all versions received standard rear wheel anti lock brakes br These trucks though popular with fleets sold poorly compared to the Ford F Series and the General Motors C K trucks with sales rarely breaking units for most years of their production Part of this was due to the dated cab and chassis design which had been in production since the lack of a powerful diesel option until and the lack of a big block gasoline V option Additionally the interior had been given few updates since the October market launch br br br Engines and transmissions br For the L V received throttle body fuel injection for a hp kW gain Additionally Dodge introduced a new overdrive automatic transmission for reduced fuel consumption This light duty transmission was designated the A and was offered with the L V and L V An O D off pushbutton switch to lock out the overdrive th gear was added to the message center The A automatic saw continued use for some L engines all L engines and heavy duty applications br The grille was redesigned for but kept the large rectangular headlamps and crossbar appearance The engines were substantially upgraded for L and L and L with multi port fuel injection new manifolds and higher compression cylinder heads for noticeably higher output These newly revised engines were marketed under the Magnum name A heavy duty automatic transmission with overdrive called the A was offered with the L and L engines As part of Chrysler s overhaul of corporate transmission nomenclature the A and A were redesignated RH and RH respectively in The initial signified a speed transmission the second digit identified the transmission s relative torque capacity the letter R in the third position denoted a rear wheel drive transmission and the final letter H signified hydraulic shift control The speed automatic remained available the A was redesignated RH and the A A and A became the RH RH and RH respectively br br br Cummins Turbo Diesel br br After the Chrysler RB engine was discontinued and therefore no longer offered in Dodge pickup trucks Without a big block gasoline engine or diesel Dodge s heavier duty models had a severe power disadvantage over the competition and thus began losing potential customers in the commercial market Rather than developing a brand new engine Chrysler signed a deal with commercial engine manufacturer Cummins to use a version of its L B Series engine in the Ram trucks This proved to be a mutually beneficial deal allowing Cummins to expand its product output and Dodge to have a competitive engine for its heavy duty models The introduction of the Cummins Turbo Diesel model in coincided with the first sales increase for Ram trucks in several years The Cummins was coupled with a heavier duty version of the A automatic or a speed manual transmission and was available on and pickups and pickup based chassis cab trucks above pounds GVWR This diesel engine option was different from the diesel engines offered in Ford and GM trucks in that the Cummins features direct injection whereas the Ford and GM diesels feature indirect injection This also means that the Cummins does not have to rely on glow plugs The Cummins is a straight six engine whereas the GM and Ford diesel engines are V engines Additionally the Cummins is turbocharged while the L GM DDC and L IDI Ford IH are naturally aspirated br This was not actually the first engine to debut in Dodge pickup trucks as a diesel option The D series models were available with a Mitsubishi naturally aspirated diesel but it was seldom ordered The Cummins diesel was in short supply the first two years but for Dodge managed to ramp up production br Partway through the model year Dodge started using one ton frames in Ram Cummins and Club Cab models br br br Engines br br Gallery br br br Special editions br Prospector Prospector was a package available throughout the s that usually included a different fuel tank cloth seat and carpeting In the late s a light package as well as the large mirrors were added to the list of options This trim package was carried on until the end of production in br br br Second generation BR BE br br The second generation Dodge Ram began development in The original concept dubbed the Louisville Slugger by Chrysler s Advanced Packaging Studio was to be a modular platform that would accommodate a full size truck and full size van which would have provided a roomy cab and cargo bed The modular design was scrapped in and was replaced with a more conventional truck design when the design was moved to the American Motors design studio The more conventional design dubbed Phoenix was originally scheduled for a production when Bob Lutz showed it to the new styling designers chief designer Phillip E Payne told him It looks like nothing more than a rehash of everybody else s truck At that Lutz told him he had six months to come up with something better The exterior styling of the truck that was eventually released was the result of design concepts by Payne during A review by the Dodge pick up truck studio designers felt that modern pick ups looked too flat and sedan like while the early s Studebaker pick up and the semi trailer trucks had just the right macho look to them The design included a big rig style front end and a large grille that was deemed risky at its introduction but ultimately proved popular with consumers br Debuted on January at the North American International Auto Show and going on sale on October the redesigned Ram was a sales success and was named Truck of the Year by Motor Trend in Sales increased from units in to in in and by The latter third year it was prominently shown as the hero vehicle in the film Twister Sales of this generation peaked at just over in before declining against the redesigned Ford and GM trucks By Ram sales figures trailed those of Ford and GM trucks br The engine offerings were carried over from the last generation which were the L V L V L V and L I Cummins turbo diesel options Added to the lineup was a hp kW L gasoline V designed as an alternative for those who wanted superior pulling power but did not want a diesel similar to GM s L V thus making the former the first factory V truck The V and diesel were available in models above pounds GVWR Models were now the half ton three quarter ton and dual rear wheel only one ton in both two and four wheel drive Ram s offered both short foot m and long foot m cargo beds on both regular and extended Club Cabs Ram s offered only long beds with regular cabs or a choice of beds on Club Cabs and Ram s only offered long beds on both cabs br Dodge offered the series in two different GVWRs and pounds from to The purpose of the difference between the light duty and heavy duty trucks was for the heavy duty to take the place of the discontinued one ton single rear wheel trucks Rear axles for the light duty trucks were semi floating while the heavy duty rear axles were full floating Light duty trucks shared the frame with the were only available in regular cabs in two or four wheel drive and were equipped with either the L or L V engine All Ram s and s had eight lug wheels br On the inside special attention was paid to in cab storage features with a large glovebox a center armrest storage area and extra storage space behind the seat br br br updates br In Dodge introduced the door Quad Cab which used smaller clamshell doors directly behind the main doors This was the first extended cab pickup to have four doors the door Club Cab remained available through Other changes for included new rounded black plastic sideview mirrors new plastic fold out towing mirrors a revised interior and instrument panel dual airbags a chime replacing the buzzer for seat belts door ajar headlights and a digital odometer The OBD II system was also standard with a computer port near the driver s side footwell and a code checking system via the new digital odometer readout br In late Dodge introduced a revised front end for the model year Sport models with a restyled bumper quad beam clear lens headlamps and body color grille A speed manual transmission was made optional for diesel models in late for the model year A small percentage of the diesel engines for the and model years were subject to problems with the water jackets and fuel injectors The most problematic was the stamped engine block which had a defect that would cause fracturing in the structure of the block itself br The models offered the option of heated leather seats The braking system was upgraded to dual piston calipers in the front An Off Road Edition was offered as a package with a inch lift accomplished with stiffer front springs and rear lift blocks unique wheels all terrain tires rear axle ratio trussed Dana front axle limited slip differential and skid plates The Off Road Edition models are also distinguishable with an additional Off Road decal on the tailgate under the decal The model was cut short ending production in January to avoid a CAFE requirement After that models began production br While Dodge introduced a new Ram for the second generation Ram was carried over for the heavy duty and trucks The new third generation Ram would not debut in the or series until Part of this delay was due to the then new L Hemi engine not being ready for production br br br Mexico only applications br br Unencumbered by CAFE Corporate Average Fuel Economy restrictions DaimlerChrysler s Mexican subsidiary developed a three door SUV version of the Ram called the Ramcharger as was its predecessor It first debuted in but was never available in the United States br There were also medium duty Ram trucks that were only manufactured and marketed in Mexico br br br Drivetrain br br br Transmissions br Ram transmissions are labeled such that the first number indicates the number of gears including overdrive the second number is the capacity rating and the last letter is either E for electronic or H for hydraulic br br A RH RE lower geared light duty applications found behind the L V The RE RH are both speed automatic transmissions with identical gear ratios This transmission came available in and it is paired with a inch diameter torque converter The RH is a hydraulic governor system that is rated as a medium duty transmission The RE is an electronic hydraulic system that is considered for heavy duty use Both transmissions are also used in the Dodge Dakota and Jeep Cherokee among other Chrysler models Gear ratios in both transmissions are for first gear for second gear for third gear and for fourth gear br A RH RE for more heavy duty applications found behind the L and L V engines The RH and RE are speed automatics that were born from the A family The A was replaced by the A family in the early s The RH was the first to replace the A and was preceded by the RE The improvement with both models included the overdrive being added The difference in the two transmissions was the RH had a hydraulically controlled governor versus the computer controlled one on the RE br A RH RE for heavy duty use behind the V gasoline and Cummins diesel engines The RH was used in the and model years while the RE was used from through The RH was released first and was only used in the Ram and series trucks The transmission was able to produce lb ft of torque and was able to tow trailers up to pounds This transmission was rated to be the highest capacity in the one ton series of trucks produced by any manufacturer The RH was a hydraulically operated speed transmission with a hydraulically controlled overdrive gear The RH was later replaced by the RE however it was by name only since they are both hydraulically controlled br The NV was offered in and light duty trucks The NV was standard in heavy duty and trucks the NV HD for V and diesel models An NV was offered in and Rams and was the only transmission offered behind the High Output diesel in and br br br Transfer cases br There were a total of five transfer cases available for the four wheel drive Ram All are part time and have a low range of The featured an NP and NP HD The NP was standard on V s The and V and diesel featured an NP DLD from until In the NP DHD became an option for s and was standard on s from to br br br Axles br The Dodge Ram features a wide variety of axles For the front axle of Rams a Dana was used on all s and the early light duty s However most of the and all Rams use Dana front axles The s and some early light duty s used a Chrysler Spicer axle in the rear A Dana rear axle was used on heavy duty s with the L V A Dana rear axle was used in s with a V or diesel and automatic transmission combination A Dana rear axle was used on s with a manual transmission and V or diesel engine combination Every was made with a Dana The front drive axles in s were unique in the fact they did not have locking hubs but featured a center axle disconnect The s and s saw the eventual phase out of the center axle disconnect in favor of front axles that were permanently locked in Dodge continued to include front axles like this for its through trucks until the models br br br Engines br A natural gas powered engine debuted for the model year but was not popular and was only used in fleet vehicles on a limited production run The Cummins B Series engine was switched from the valve to the valve ISB version in the middle of the model year Dodge Rams to comply with emissions regulations The ISB featured a new computer controlled electronic injection pump and a valve head design br br br

durability rear wheel drive and trucks had class exclusive rack and pinion steering for their independent front suspension the also received rack and pinion steering for the first time This body style drew heavily from the previous generation br The redesigned trucks bolstered sales with sold during and nearly sold during a new high point for the Ram name At the same time both Ford and GM trucks
