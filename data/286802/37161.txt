Fuel injection is the introduction of fuel in an internal combustion engine most commonly automotive engines by the means of an injector This article focuses on fuel injection in reciprocating piston and Wankel rotary engines br All compression ignition engines e g diesel engines and many spark ignition engines i e petrol gasoline engines such as Otto or Wankel use fuel injection of one kind or another Mass produced diesel engines for passenger cars such as the Mercedes Benz OM became available in the late s and early s being the first fuel injected engines for passenger car use In passenger car petrol engines fuel injection was introduced in the early s and gradually gained prevalence until it had largely replaced carburetors by the early s The primary difference between carburetion and fuel injection is that fuel injection atomizes the fuel through a small nozzle under high pressure while carburetion relies on suction created by intake air accelerated through a Venturi tube to draw fuel into the airstream br The term fuel injection is vague and comprises various distinct systems with fundamentally different functional principles Typically the only thing all fuel injection systems have in common is a lack of carburetion There are two main functional principles of mixture formation systems for internal combustion engines internal mixture formation and external mixture formation A fuel injection system that uses external mixture formation is called a manifold injection system There exist two types of manifold injection systems multi point injection or port injection and single point injection or throttle body injection Internal mixture formation systems can be separated into several different varieties of direct and indirect injection the most common being the common rail injection system a variety of direct injection The term electronic fuel injection refers to any fuel injection system controlled by an engine control unit br br br System functions br The fundamental functions of a fuel injection system are described in the following sections In some systems a single component performs multiple functions br br br Pressurising fuel br Fuel injection is operated by spraying pressurised fuel into the engine Therefore a device to pressurise the fuel is needed such as a fuel pump br br br Metering fuel br The system must determine the appropriate amount of fuel to be supplied and control the fuel flow to supply this amount br Several early mechanical injection systems used relatively sophisticated helix controlled injection pump s that both metered fuel and created injection pressure Since the s electronic systems have been used to control the metering of fuel More recent systems use an electronic engine control unit which meters the fuel controls the ignition timing and controls various other engine functions br br br Injecting fuel br The fuel injector is effectively a spray nozzle that performs the final stage in the delivery of fuel into the engine The injector is located in the combustion chamber inlet manifold or less commonly the throttle body br Fuel injectors which also control the metering are called injection valves while injectors that perform all three functions are called unit injectors br br br Direct injection systems br Direct injection means that the fuel is injected into the main combustion chamber of each cylinder The air and fuel are mixed only inside the combustion chamber Therefore only air is sucked into the engine during the intake stroke The injection scheme is always intermittent either sequential or cylinder individual br This can be done either with a blast of air or hydraulically with the latter method being more common in automotive engines Typically hydraulic direct injection systems spray fuel into the air inside the cylinder or combustion chamber Direct injection can be achieved with a conventional helix controlled injection pump unit injectors or a sophisticated common rail injection system The latter is the most common system in modern automotive engines br br br Direct injection for petrol engines br br During the th century most petrol engines used either a carburettor or indirect fuel injection Use of direct injection in petrol engines has become increasingly common in the st century br br br Common rail injection systems br br In a common rail system fuel from the fuel tank is supplied to a common header called the accumulator and then sent through tubing to the injectors which inject it into the combustion chamber The accumulator has a high pressure relief valve to maintain pressure and return the excess fuel to the fuel tank The fuel is sprayed with the help of a nozzle that is opened and closed with a solenoid operated needle valve Third generation common rail diesels use piezoelectric injectors for increased precision with fuel pressures up to MPa or psi br The types of common rail systems include air guided injection and spray guided injection br br br Unit injector systems br br Used by diesel engines these systems include br br Pumpe D se br Pump rail nozzle system br br br Helix controlled pump systems br This injection method was previously used in many diesel engines Types of systems include br br Lanova direct injection br Afterchamber injection br G System sphere combustion chamber br Gardner system hemisphere combustion chamber br Saurer system torus combustion chamber br Flat piston combustion chamber between piston and head br br br Air blast injection systems br br br Other systems br The M System used in some diesel engines from the s to the s sprayed the fuel onto the walls of the combustion chamber as opposed to most other direct injection systems which spray the fuel into the middle of the chamber br br br Indirect injection systems br br br Manifold injection br br Manifold injection systems are common in petrol fuelled engines such as the Otto engine and the Wankel engine In a manifold injection system air and fuel are mixed outside the combustion chamber so that a mixture of air and fuel is sucked into the engine The main types of manifold injections systems are multi point injection and single point injection br These systems use either a continuous injection or an intermittent injection design In a continuous injection system fuel flows at all times from the fuel injectors but at a variable flow rate The most common automotive continuous injection system is the Bosch K Jetronic system introduced in and used until the mid s by various car manufacturers Intermittent injection systems can be sequential in which injection is timed to coincide with each cylinder s intake stroke batched in which fuel is injected to the cylinders in groups without precise synchronization to any particular cylinder s intake stroke simultaneous in which fuel is injected at the same time to all the cylinders or cylinder individual in which the engine control unit can adjust the injection for each cylinder individually br br br Multi point injection br br Multi point injection also called port injection injects fuel into the intake ports just upstream of each cylinder s intake valve rather than at a central point within an intake manifold Typically multi point injected systems use multiple fuel injectors but some systems such as GM s central port injection system use tubes with poppet valves fed by a central injector instead of multiple injectors br br br Single point injection br br Single point injection also called throttle body injection uses one injector in a throttle body mounted similarly to a carburettor on an intake manifold As in a carburetted induction system the fuel is mixed with the air before entering the intake manifold Single point injection was a relatively low cost way for automakers to reduce exhaust emissions to comply with tightening regulations while providing better driveability easy starting smooth running no engine stuttering than could be obtained with a carburettor Many of the carburettor s supporting components such as the air filter intake manifold and fuel line routing could be used with few or no changes This postponed the redesign and tooling costs of these components Single point injection was used extensively on American made passenger cars and light trucks during and in some European cars in the early and mid s br In the US the G engine in the Chevrolet Metro became the last engine available on an American sold vehicle to use throttle body injection br br br Diesel engines br In indirect injected engines used by diesel engines as well as Akroyd engines there are two combustion chambers the main combustion chamber and a pre chamber also called an ante chamber that is connected to the main one The fuel is injected only into the pre chamber where it begins to combust and not directly into the main combustion chamber Therefore this principle is called indirect injection There exist several slightly different indirect injection systems that have similar characteristics br Types of indirect injection used by diesel engines include br br Precombustion chamber injection br Air cell chamber injection br br br Hot bulb injection br br br History br br br s s early systems br br In George Bailey Brayton obtained a patent on an internal combustion engine that used a pneumatic fuel injection system also invented by Brayton air blast injection In Rudolf Diesel copied Brayton s air blast injection system for the diesel engine but also improved it He increased the air blast pressure from kp cm kPa to kp cm kPa In the meantime the first manifold injection system was designed by Johannes Spiel in while working at Hallesche Maschinenfabrik in Germany br In the British Herbert Akroyd oil engine became the first engine to use a pressurised fuel injection system This design called a hot bulb engine used a jerk pump to dispense fuel oil at high pressure to an injector Another development in early diesel engines was the pre combustion chamber which was invented in by Prosper l Orange to avoid the drawbacks of air blast injection systems The pre combustion chamber made it feasible to produce engines in size suitable for automobiles and MAN Truck Bus presented the first direct injected diesel engine for trucks in Higher pressure diesel injection pumps were introduced by Bosch in br In German company Deutz AG started producing four stroke petrol stationary engines with manifold injection The Antoinette V aircraft engine the world s first V engine was another early four stroke engine that used manifold injection The first petrol engine with direct injection was a two stroke aircraft engine designed by Otto Mader in Another early spark ignition engine to use direct injection was the Hesselman engine designed by Swedish engineer Jonas Hesselman This engine could run on a variety of fuels such as oil kerosene petrol or diesel oil and used a stratified charge principle whereby fuel is injected towards the end of the compression stroke then ignited with a spark plug br The Cummins Model H diesel truck engine was introduced in America in In the Mercedes Benz OM diesel engine using a precombustion chamber became one of the first fuel injected engines used in a mass production passenger car br br br s s WWII aircraft and early direct injection petrol engines br During World War II several petrol engines for aircraft used direct injection systems such as the European Junkers Jumo Daimler Benz DB BMW and the Shvetsov ASh FN M FN The German direct injection systems were based on diesel injection systems used by Bosch Deckel Junkers and l Orange By around the Rolls Royce Merlin and Wright R had switched from traditional carburettors to fuel injection called pressure carburettors at the time however these engines used throttle body manifold injection rather than the direct injection systems of the German engines From the Mitsubishi Kinsei series engine used a direct injection system along with the related Mitsubishi Kasei engine from In a low pressure fuel injection system was added to the Nakajima Homare Model radial engine br The first mass produced petrol direct injection system was developed by Bosch and initially used in small automotive two stroke petrol engines Introduced in the Goliath GP small saloon it was also added to the Gutbrod Superior engine in This mechanically controlled system was essentially a specially lubricated high pressure diesel direct injection pump of the type that is governed by the vacuum behind an intake throttle valve A Bosch mechanical direct injection system was also used in the straight eight used in the Mercedes Benz W Formula One racing car The first four stroke direct injection petrol engine for a passenger car was released the following year in the Mercedes Benz SL sports car However the engine suffered lubrication problems due to petrol diluting the engine oil and subsequent Mercedes Benz engines switched to a manifold injection design Likewise most petrol injection systems prior to the s used the less expensive manifold injection design br br br s s manifold injection for petrol engines br br Throughout the s several manufacturers introduced their manifold injection systems for petrol engines Lucas Industries had begun developing a fuel injection system in and by it was used in the Jaguar racing cars At the Hours of Le Mans the st to th placed cars were Jaguar D Type entries using a Lucas fuel injection system Also in General Motors introduced the Rochester Ramjet option consisting of a fuel injection system for the V engine in the Chevrolet Corvette During the s fuel injection systems were also produced by Hilborn SPICA and Kugelfischer br Up until this time the fuel injection systems had used a mechanical control system In the American Bendix Electrojector system was introduced which used analogue electronics for the control system The Electrojector was intended to be available for the Rambler Rebel mid size car however reliability problems meant that the fuel injection option was not offered In the Chrysler D DeSoto Adventurer Dodge D and Plymouth Fury offered the Electrojector system becoming the first cars known to use an electronic fuel injection EFI system br The Electrojector patents were subsequently sold to Bosch who developed the Electrojector into the Bosch D Jetronic The D Jetronic was produced from and first used on the VW TL E The system was a speed density system using engine speed and intake manifold air density to calculate the amount of fuel to be injected In Bosch introduced the K Jetronic system which used a continuous flow of fuel from the injectors rather than the pulsed flow of the D Jetronic system K Jetronic was a mechanical injection system using a plunger actuated by the intake manifold pressure which then controlled the fuel flow to the injectors br Also in Bosch introduced the L Jetronic system a pulsed flow system which used an air flow meter to calculate the amount of fuel required L Jetronic was widely adopted on European cars during the s and s As a system that uses electronically controlled fuel injectors which open and close to control the amount of fuel entering the engine the L Jetronic system uses the same basic principles as modern electronic fuel injection EFI systems br br br s present digital electronics and common rail injection br Prior to the electronics in fuel injection systems used analogue electronics for the control system The Bosch Motronic multi point fuel injection system also amongst the first systems where the ignition system is controlled by the same device as the fuel injection system was the first mass produced system to use digital electronics The Ford EEC III single point fuel injection system introduced in was another early digital fuel injection system These and other electronic manifold injection systems using either port injection or throttle body injection became more widespread through the s and by the early s they had replaced carburettors in most new petrol engined cars sold in developed countries br The aforementioned injection systems for petrol passenger car engines except for the Mercedes Benz SL all used manifold injection i e the injectors located at the intake ports or throttle body instead of inside the combustion chamber This began to change when the first mass produced petrol direct injection system for passenger cars was a common rail system introduced in the Mitsubishi G V engine The first common rail system for a passenger car diesel engine was the Fiat Multijet straight four engine introduced in the Alfa Romeo JTD model Since the s many petrol engines have switched to direct injection sometimes in combination with separate manifold injectors for each cylinder Similarly many modern diesel engines use a common rail design br Stratified charge injection was used in several petrol engines in the early s such as the Volkswagen FSI engine introduced in However the stratified charge systems were largely no longer in use by the late s due to increased exhaust emissions of NOx gasses and particulates along with the increased cost and complexity of the systems br br br br br br See also br br Carburettor br Common rail br Diesel engine Fuel
