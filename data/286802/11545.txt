title: Feedback
id: 11545
Feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause and effect that forms a circuit or loop The system can then be said to feed back into itself The notion of cause and effect has to be handled carefully when applied to feedback systems br br Simple causal reasoning about a feedback system is difficult because the first system influences the second and second system influences the first leading to a circular argument This makes reasoning based upon cause and effect tricky and it is necessary to analyze the system as a whole As provided by Webster feedback in business is the transmission of evaluative or corrective information about an action event or process to the original or controlling source br br br History br Self regulating mechanisms have existed since antiquity and the idea of feedback started to enter economic theory in Britain by the th century but it was not at that time recognized as a universal abstraction and so did not have a name br The first ever known artificial feedback device was a float valve for maintaining water at a constant level invented in BC in Alexandria Egypt This device illustrated the principle of feedback a low water level opens the valve the rising water then provides feedback into the system closing the valve when the required level is reached This then reoccurs in a circular fashion as the water level fluctuates br Centrifugal governors were used to regulate the distance and pressure between millstones in windmills since the th century In James Watt designed his first centrifugal governor following a suggestion from his business partner Matthew Boulton for use in the steam engines of their production Early steam engines employed a purely reciprocating motion and were used for pumping water an application that could tolerate variations in the working speed but the use of steam engines for other applications called for more precise control of the speed br In James Clerk Maxwell wrote a famous paper On governors that is widely considered a classic in feedback control theory This was a landmark paper on control theory and the mathematics of feedback br The verb phrase to feed back in the sense of returning to an earlier position in a mechanical process was in use in the US by the s and in Nobel laureate Karl Ferdinand Braun used the term feed back as a noun to refer to undesired coupling between components of an electronic circuit br By the end of researchers using early electronic amplifiers audions had discovered that deliberately coupling part of the output signal back to the input circuit would boost the amplification through regeneration but would also cause the audion to howl or sing This action of feeding back of the signal from output to input gave rise to the use of the term feedback as a distinct word by br The development of cybernetics from the s onwards was centred around the study of circular causal feedback mechanisms br Over the years there has been some dispute as to the best definition of feedback According to cybernetician Ashby mathematicians and theorists interested in the principles of feedback mechanisms prefer the definition of circularity of action which keeps the theory simple and consistent For those with more practical aims feedback should be a deliberate effect via some more tangible connection br br Practical experimenters object to the mathematician s definition pointing out that this would force them to say that feedback was present in the ordinary pendulum between its position and its momentum a feedback that from the practical point of view is somewhat mystical To this the mathematician retorts that if feedback is to be considered present only when there is an actual wire or nerve to represent it then the theory becomes chaotic and riddled with irrelevancies br Focusing on uses in management theory Ramaprasad defines feedback generally as information about the gap between the actual level and the reference level of a system parameter that is used to alter the gap in some way He emphasizes that the information by itself is not feedback unless translated into action br br br Types br br br Positive and negative feedback br br Positive feedback If the signal feedback from output is in phase with the input signal the feedback is called positive feedback br Negative feedback If the signal feedback is out of phase by with respect to the input signal the feedback is called negative feedback br As an example of negative feedback the diagram might represent a cruise control system in a car that matches a target speed such as the speed limit The controlled system is the car its input includes the combined torque from the engine and from the changing slope of the road the disturbance The car s speed status is measured by a speedometer The error signal is the difference of the speed as measured by the speedometer from the target speed set point The controller interprets the speed to adjust the accelerator commanding the fuel flow to the engine the effector The resulting change in engine torque the feedback combines with the torque exerted by the change of road grade to reduce the error in speed minimising the changing slope br The terms positive and negative were first applied to feedback prior to WWII The idea of positive feedback already existed in the s when the regenerative circuit was made Friis and Jensen described this circuit in a set of electronic amplifiers as a case where the feed back action is positive in contrast to negative feed back action which they mentioned only in passing Harold Stephen Black s classic paper first details the use of negative feedback in electronic amplifiers According to Black br br Positive feed back increases the gain of the amplifier negative feed back reduces it br According to Mindell confusion in the terms arose shortly after this br br Friis and Jensen had made the same distinction Black used between positive feed back and negative feed back based not on the sign of the feedback itself but rather on its effect on the amplifier s gain In contrast Nyquist and Bode when they built on Black s work referred to negative feedback as that with the sign reversed Black had trouble convincing others of the utility of his invention in part because confusion existed over basic matters of definition br Even before these terms were being used James Clerk Maxwell had described their concept through several kinds of component motions associated with the centrifugal governors used in steam engines He distinguished those that lead to a continued increase in a disturbance or the amplitude of a wave or oscillation from those that lead to a decrease of the same quality br br br Terminology br The terms positive and negative feedback are defined in different ways within different disciplines br br the change of the gap between reference and actual values of a parameter or trait based on whether the gap is widening positive or narrowing negative br the valence of the action or effect that alters the gap based on whether it makes the recipient or observer happy positive or unhappy negative br The two definitions may be confusing like when an incentive reward is used to boost poor performance narrow a gap Referring to definition some authors use alternative terms replacing positive and negative with self reinforcing and self correcting reinforcing and balancing discrepancy enhancing and discrepancy reducing or regenerative and degenerative respectively And for definition some authors promote describing the action or effect as positive and negative reinforcement or punishment rather than feedback br Yet even within a single discipline an example of feedback can be called either positive or negative depending on how values are measured or referenced br This confusion may arise because feedback can be used to provide information or motivate and often has both a qualitative and a quantitative component As Connellan and Zemke put it br br Quantitative feedback tells us how much and how many Qualitative feedback tells us how good bad or indifferent br br br Limitations of negative and positive feedback br While simple systems can sometimes be described as one or the other type many systems with feedback loops cannot be shoehorned into either type and this is especially true when multiple loops are present br br When there are only two parts joined so that each affects the other the properties of the feedback give important and useful information about the properties of the whole But when the parts rise to even as few as four if every one affects the other three then twenty circuits can be traced through them and knowing the properties of all the twenty circuits does not give complete information about the system br br br Other types of feedback br In general feedback systems can have many signals fed back and the feedback loop frequently contain mixtures of positive and negative feedback where positive and negative feedback can dominate at different frequencies or different points in the state space of a system br The term bipolar feedback has been coined to refer to biological systems where positive and negative feedback systems can interact the output of one affecting the input of another and vice versa br Some systems with feedback can have very complex behaviors such as chaotic behaviors in non linear systems while others have much more predictable behaviors such as those that are used to make and design digital systems br Feedback is used extensively in digital systems For example binary counters and similar devices employ feedback where the current state and inputs are used to calculate a new state which is then fed back and clocked back into the device to update it br br br Applications br br br Mathematics and dynamical systems br br By using feedback properties the behavior of a system can be altered to meet the needs of an application systems can be made stable responsive or held constant It is shown that dynamical systems with a feedback experience an adaptation to the edge of chaos br br br Physics br Physical systems present feedback through the mutual interactions of its parts Feedback is also relevant for the regulation of experimental conditions noise reduction and signal control The thermodynamics of feedback controlled systems has intrigued physicist since the Maxwell s demon with recent advances on the consequences for entropy reduction and performance increase br br br Biology br br In biological systems such as organisms ecosystems or the biosphere most parameters must stay under control within a narrow range around a certain optimal level under certain environmental conditions The deviation of the optimal value of the controlled parameter can result from the changes in internal and external environments A change of some of the environmental conditions may also require change of that range to change for the system to function The value of the parameter to maintain is recorded by a reception system and conveyed to a regulation module via an information channel An example of this is insulin oscillations br Biological systems contain many types of regulatory circuits both positive and negative As in other contexts positive and negative do not imply that the feedback causes good or bad effects A negative feedback loop is one that tends to slow down a process whereas the positive feedback loop tends to accelerate it The mirror neurons are part of a social feedback system when an observed action is mirrored by the brain like a self performed action br Normal tissue integrity is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted molecules that act as mediators failure of key feedback mechanisms in cancer disrupts tissue function br In an injured or infected tissue inflammatory mediators elicit feedback responses in cells which alter gene expression and change the groups of molecules expressed and secreted including molecules that induce diverse cells to cooperate and restore tissue structure and function This type of feedback is important because it enables coordination of immune responses and recovery from infections and injuries During cancer key elements of this feedback fail This disrupts tissue function and immunity br Mechanisms of feedback were first elucidated in bacteria where a nutrient elicits changes in some of their metabolic functions br Feedback is also central to the operations of genes and gene regulatory networks Repressor see Lac repressor and activator proteins are used to create genetic operons which were identified by Fran ois Jacob and Jacques Monod in as feedback loops These feedback loops may be positive as in the case of the coupling between a sugar molecule and the proteins that import sugar into a bacterial cell or negative as is often the case in metabolic consumption br On a larger scale feedback can have a stabilizing effect on animal populations even when profoundly affected by external changes although time lags in feedback response can give rise to predator prey cycles br In zymology feedback serves as regulation of activity of an enzyme by its direct product s or downstream metabolite s in the metabolic pathway see Allosteric regulation br The hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis is largely controlled by positive and negative feedback much of which is still unknown br In psychology the body receives a stimulus from the environment or internally that causes the release of hormones Release of hormones then may cause more of those hormones to be released causing a positive feedback loop This cycle is also found in certain behaviour For example shame loops occur in people who blush easily When they realize that they are blushing they become even more embarrassed which leads to further blushing and so on br br br Climate science br br The climate system is characterized by strong positive and negative feedback loops between processes that affect the state of the atmosphere ocean and land A simple example is the ice albedo positive feedback loop whereby melting snow exposes more dark ground of lower albedo which in turn absorbs heat and causes more snow to melt br br br Control theory br br Feedback is extensively used in control theory using a variety of methods including state space controls full state feedback and so forth In the context of control theory feedback is traditionally assumed to specify negative feedback br br The most common general purpose controller using a control loop feedback mechanism is a proportional integral derivative PID controller Heuristically the terms of a PID controller can be interpreted as corresponding to time the proportional term depends on the present error the integral term on the accumulation of past errors and the derivative term is a prediction of future error based on current rate of change br br br Education br For feedback in the educational context see corrective feedback br br br Mechanical engineering br In ancient times the float valve was used to regulate the flow of water in Greek and Roman water clocks similar float valves are used to regulate fuel in a carburettor and also used to regulate tank water level in the flush toilet br The Dutch inventor Cornelius Drebbel built thermostats c to control the temperature of chicken incubators and chemical furnaces In the windmill was improved by blacksmith Edmund Lee who added a fantail to keep the face of the windmill pointing into the wind In Tom Mead regulated the rotation speed of a windmill by using a centrifugal pendulum to adjust the distance between the bedstone and the runner stone i e to adjust the load br The use of the centrifugal governor by James Watt in to regulate the speed of his steam engine was one factor leading to the Industrial Revolution Steam engines also use float valves and pressure release valves as mechanical regulation devices A mathematical analysis of Watt s governor was done by James Clerk Maxwell in br The Great Eastern was one of the largest steamships of its time and employed a steam powered rudder with feedback mechanism designed in by John McFarlane Gray Joseph Farcot coined the word servo in to describe steam powered steering systems Hydraulic servos were later used to position guns Elmer Ambrose Sperry of the Sperry Corporation designed the first autopilot in Nicolas Minorsky published a theoretical analysis of automatic ship steering in and described the PID controller br Internal combustion engines of the late th century employed mechanical feedback mechanisms such as the vacuum timing advance but mechanical feedback was replaced by electronic engine management systems once small robust and powerful single chip microcontrollers became affordable br br br Electronic engineering br br The use of feedback is widespread in the design of electronic components such as amplifiers oscillators and stateful logic circuit elements such as flip flops and counters Electronic feedback systems are also very commonly used to control mechanical thermal and other physical processes br If the signal is inverted on its way round the control loop the system is said to have negative feedback otherwise the feedback is said to be positive Negative feedback is often deliberately introduced to increase the stability and accuracy of a system by correcting or reducing the influence of unwanted changes This scheme can fail if the input changes faster than the system can respond to it When this happens the lag in arrival of the correcting signal can result in over correction causing the output to oscillate or hunt While often an unwanted consequence of system behaviour this effect is used deliberately in electronic oscillators br Harry Nyquist at Bell Labs derived the Nyquist stability criterion for determining the stability of feedback systems An easier method but less general is to use Bode plots developed by Hendrik Bode to determine the gain margin and phase margin Design to ensure stability often involves frequency compensation to control the location of the poles of the amplifier br Electronic feedback loops are used to control the output of electronic devices such as amplifiers A feedback loop is created when all or some portion of the output is fed back to the input A device is said to be operating open loop if no output feedback is being employed and closed loop if feedback is being used br When two or more amplifiers are cross coupled using positive feedback complex behaviors can be created These multivibrators are widely used and include br br astable circuits which act as oscillators br monostable circuits which can be pushed into a state and will return to the stable state after some time br bistable circuits which have two stable states that the circuit can be switched between br br br Negative feedback br Negative feedback occurs when the fed back output signal has a relative phase of with respect to the input signal upside down This situation is sometimes referred to as being out of phase but that term also is used to indicate other phase separations as in out of phase Negative feedback can be used to correct output errors or to desensitize a system to unwanted fluctuations In feedback amplifiers this correction is generally for waveform distortion reduction or to establish a specified gain level A general expression for the gain of a negative feedback amplifier is the asymptotic gain model br br br Positive feedback br Positive feedback occurs when the fed back signal is in phase with the input signal Under certain gain conditions positive feedback reinforces the input signal to the point where the output of the device oscillates between its maximum and minimum possible states Positive feedback may also introduce hysteresis into a circuit This can cause the circuit to ignore small signals and respond only to large ones It is sometimes used to eliminate noise from a digital signal Under some circumstances positive feedback may cause a device to latch i e to reach a condition in which the output is locked to its maximum or minimum state This fact is very widely used in digital electronics to make bistable circuits for volatile storage of information br The loud squeals that sometimes occurs in audio systems PA systems and rock music are known as audio feedback If a microphone is in front of a loudspeaker that it is connected to sound that the microphone picks up comes out of the speaker and is picked up by the microphone and re amplified If the loop gain is sufficient howling or squealing at the maximum power of the amplifier is possible br br br Oscillator br br An electronic oscillator is an electronic circuit that produces a periodic oscillating electronic signal often a sine wave or a square wave Oscillators convert direct current DC from a power supply to an alternating current signal They are widely used in many electronic devices Common examples of signals generated by oscillators include signals broadcast by radio and television transmitters clock signals that regulate computers and quartz clocks and the sounds produced by electronic beepers and video games br Oscillators are often characterized by the frequency of their output signal br br A low frequency oscillator LFO is an electronic oscillator that generates a frequency below Hz This term is typically used in the field of audio synthesizers to distinguish it from an audio frequency oscillator br An audio oscillator produces frequencies in the audio range about Hz to kHz br An RF oscillator produces signals in the radio frequency RF range of about kHz to GHz br Oscillators designed to produce a high power AC output from a DC supply are usually called inverters br There are two main types of electronic oscillator the linear or harmonic oscillator and the nonlinear or relaxation oscillator br br br Latches and flip flops br br A latch or a flip flop is a circuit that has two stable states and can be used to store state information They typically constructed using feedback that crosses over between two arms of the circuit to provide the circuit with a state The circuit can be made to change state by signals applied to one or more control inputs and will have one or two outputs It is the basic storage element in sequential logic Latches and flip flops are fundamental building blocks of digital electronics systems used in computers communications and many other types of systems br Latches and flip flops are used as data storage elements Such data storage can be used for storage of state and such a circuit is described as sequential logic When used in a finite state machine the output and next state depend not only on its current input but also on its current state and hence previous inputs It can also be used for counting of pulses and for synchronizing variably timed input signals to some reference timing signal br Flip flops can be either simple transparent or opaque or clocked synchronous or edge triggered Although the term flip flop has historically referred generically to both simple and clocked circuits in modern usage it is common to reserve the term flip flop exclusively for discussing clocked circuits the simple ones are commonly called latches br Using this terminology a latch is level sensitive whereas a flip flop is edge sensitive That is when a latch is enabled it becomes transparent while a flip flop s output only changes on a single type positive going or negative going of clock edge br br br Software br Feedback loops provide generic mechanisms for controlling the running maintenance and evolution of software and computing systems Feedback loops are important models in the engineering of adaptive software as they define the behaviour of the interactions among the control elements over the adaptation process to guarantee system properties at run time Feedback loops and foundations of control theory have been successfully applied to computing systems In particular they have been applied to the development of products such as IBM Db and IBM Tivoli From a software perspective the autonomic MAPE monitor analyze plan execute loop proposed by researchers of IBM is another valuable contribution to the application of feedback loops to the control of dynamic properties and the design and evolution of autonomic software systems br br br Software Development br br br User interface design br br Feedback is also a useful design principle for designing user interfaces br br br Video feedback br Video feedback is the video equivalent of acoustic feedback It involves a loop between a video camera input and a video output e g a television screen or monitor Aiming the camera at the display produces a complex video image based on the feedback br br br Human resource management br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br Katie Salen and Eric
