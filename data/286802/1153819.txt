Cordierite mineralogy or iolite gemology is a magnesium iron aluminium cyclosilicate Iron is almost always present and a solid solution exists between Mg rich cordierite and Fe rich sekaninaite with a series formula Mg Fe Al Si AlO to Fe Mg Al Si AlO A high temperature polymorph exists indialite which is isostructural with beryl and has a random distribution of Al in the Si Al O rings Cordierite is also synthesized and used in high temperature applications such as catalytic converters and pizza stones br br br Name and discovery br Cordierite which was discovered in in specimens from N jar Almer a Spain is named after the French geologist Louis Cordier br br br Occurrence br Cordierite typically occurs in contact or regional metamorphism of pelitic rocks It is especially common in hornfels produced by contact metamorphism of pelitic rocks Two common metamorphic mineral assemblages include sillimanite cordierite spinel and cordierite spinel plagioclase orthopyroxene Other associated minerals include garnet cordierite garnet sillimanite gneisses and anthophyllite Cordierite also occurs in some granites pegmatites and norites in gabbroic magmas Alteration products include mica chlorite and talc Cordierite occurs for example in the granite contact zone at Geevor Tin Mine in Cornwall br br br Commercial use br Catalytic converters are commonly made from ceramics containing a large proportion of synthetic cordierite The manufacturing process deliberately aligns the cordierite crystals to make use of the very low thermal expansion along one axis This prevents thermal shock cracking from taking place when the catalytic converter is used br br br Gem variety br As the transparent variety iolite it is often used as a gemstone The name iolite comes from the Greek word for violet Another old name is dichroite a Greek word meaning two colored rock a reference to cordierite s strong pleochroism It has also been called water sapphire and Vikings Compass because of its usefulness in determining the direction of the sun on overcast days the Vikings having used it for this purpose This works by determining the direction of polarization of the sky overhead Light scattered by air molecules is polarized and the direction of the polarization is at right angles to a line to the sun even when the sun s disk itself is obscured by dense fog or lies just below the horizon br Gem quality iolite varies in color from sapphire blue to blue violet to yellowish gray to light blue as the light angle changes Iolite is sometimes used as an inexpensive substitute for sapphire It is much softer than sapphires and is abundantly found in Australia Northern Territory Brazil Burma Canada Yellowknife area of the Northwest Territories India Madagascar Namibia Sri Lanka Tanzania and the United States Connecticut The largest iolite crystal found weighed more than carats g and was discovered in Wyoming US br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Another name for blue iolite is steinheilite after Fabian Steinheil the Russian military governor of Finland who observed that it was a different mineral from quartz Praseolite is another iolite variety which results from heat treatment It should not be confused with prasiolite br br br See also br List of minerals br List of minerals named after people br Sunstone medieval br br br br br br External links br Mineral galleries br https www gemstone org education gem by gem iolite
