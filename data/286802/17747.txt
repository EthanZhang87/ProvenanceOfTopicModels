Lead is a chemical element it has symbol Pb from Latin plumbum and atomic number It is a heavy metal that is denser than most common materials Lead is soft and malleable and also has a relatively low melting point When freshly cut lead is a shiny gray with a hint of blue It tarnishes to a dull gray color when exposed to air Lead has the highest atomic number of any stable element and three of its isotopes are endpoints of major nuclear decay chains of heavier elements br Lead is a relatively unreactive post transition metal Its weak metallic character is illustrated by its amphoteric nature lead and lead oxides react with acids and bases and it tends to form covalent bonds Compounds of lead are usually found in the oxidation state rather than the state common with lighter members of the carbon group Exceptions are mostly limited to organolead compounds Like the lighter members of the group lead tends to bond with itself it can form chains and polyhedral structures br Since lead is easily extracted from its ores prehistoric people in the Near East were aware of it Galena is a principal ore of lead which often bears silver Interest in silver helped initiate widespread extraction and use of lead in ancient Rome Lead production declined after the fall of Rome and did not reach comparable levels until the Industrial Revolution Lead played a crucial role in the development of the printing press as movable type could be relatively easily cast from lead alloys In the annual global production of lead was about ten million tonnes over half of which was from recycling Lead s high density low melting point ductility and relative inertness to oxidation make it useful These properties combined with its relative abundance and low cost resulted in its extensive use in construction plumbing batteries bullets and shot weights solders pewters fusible alloys white paints leaded gasoline and radiation shielding br Lead is a neurotoxin that accumulates in soft tissues and bones It damages the nervous system and interferes with the function of biological enzymes causing neurological disorders ranging from behavioral problems to brain damage and also affects general health cardiovascular and renal systems Lead s toxicity was first documented by ancient Greek and Roman writers who noted some of the symptoms of lead poisoning but became widely recognized in Europe in the late th century br br br Physical properties br br br Atomic br A lead atom has electrons arranged in an electron configuration of Xe f d s p The sum of lead s first and second ionization energies the total energy required to remove the two p electrons is close to that of tin lead s upper neighbor in the carbon group This is unusual ionization energies generally fall going down a group as an element s outer electrons become more distant from the nucleus and more shielded by smaller orbitals br The sum of the first four ionization energies of lead exceeds that of tin contrary to what periodic trends would predict This is explained by relativistic effects which become significant in heavier atoms which contract s and p orbitals such that lead s s electrons have larger binding energies than its s electrons A consequence is the so called inert pair effect the s electrons of lead become reluctant to participate in bonding stabilising the oxidation state and making the distance between nearest atoms in crystalline lead unusually long br Lead s lighter carbon group congeners form stable or metastable allotropes with the tetrahedrally coordinated and covalently bonded diamond cubic structure The energy levels of their outer s and p orbitals are close enough to allow mixing into four hybrid sp orbitals In lead the inert pair effect increases the separation between its s and p orbitals and the gap cannot be overcome by the energy that would be released by extra bonds following hybridization Rather than having a diamond cubic structure lead forms metallic bonds in which only the p electrons are delocalized and shared between the Pb ions Lead consequently has a face centered cubic structure like the similarly sized divalent metals calcium and strontium br br br Bulk br Pure lead has a bright shiny gray appearance with a hint of blue It tarnishes on contact with moist air and takes on a dull appearance the hue of which depends on the prevailing conditions Characteristic properties of lead include high density malleability ductility and high resistance to corrosion due to passivation br br Lead s close packed face centered cubic structure and high atomic weight result in a density of g cm which is greater than that of common metals such as iron g cm copper g cm and zinc g cm This density is the origin of the idiom to go over like a lead balloon Some rarer metals are denser tungsten and gold are both at g cm and osmium the densest metal known has a density of g cm almost twice that of lead br Lead is a very soft metal with a Mohs hardness of it can be scratched with a fingernail It is quite malleable and somewhat ductile The bulk modulus of lead a measure of its ease of compressibility is GPa In comparison that of aluminium is GPa copper GPa and mild steel GPa Lead s tensile strength at MPa is low that of aluminium is times higher copper times and mild steel times higher it can be strengthened by adding small amounts of copper or antimony br The melting point of lead at C F is very low compared to most metals Its boiling point of C F is the lowest among the carbon group elements The electrical resistivity of lead at C is nanoohm meters almost an order of magnitude higher than those of other industrial metals copper at n m gold n m and aluminium at n m Lead is a superconductor at temperatures lower than K this is the highest critical temperature of all type I superconductors and the third highest of the elemental superconductors br br br Isotopes br br Natural lead consists of four stable isotopes with mass numbers of and and traces of six short lived radioisotopes with mass numbers inclusive The high number of isotopes is consistent with lead s atomic number being even Lead has a magic number of protons for which the nuclear shell model accurately predicts an especially stable nucleus Lead has neutrons another magic number which may explain why lead is extraordinarily stable br With its high atomic number lead is the heaviest element whose natural isotopes are regarded as stable lead is the heaviest stable nucleus This distinction formerly fell to bismuth with an atomic number of until its only primordial isotope bismuth was found in to decay very slowly The four stable isotopes of lead could theoretically undergo alpha decay to isotopes of mercury with a release of energy but this has not been observed for any of them their predicted half lives range from to years at least times the current age of the universe br Three of the stable isotopes are found in three of the four major decay chains lead lead and lead are the final decay products of uranium uranium and thorium respectively These decay chains are called the uranium chain the actinium chain and the thorium chain Their isotopic concentrations in a natural rock sample depends greatly on the presence of these three parent uranium and thorium isotopes For example the relative abundance of lead can range from in normal samples to in thorium ores for this reason the standard atomic weight of lead is given to only one decimal place As time passes the ratio of lead and lead to lead increases since the former two are supplemented by radioactive decay of heavier elements while the latter is not this allows for lead lead dating As uranium decays into lead their relative amounts change this is the basis for uranium lead dating Lead exhibits nuclear magnetic resonance a property that has been used to study its compounds in solution and solid state including in the human body br br Apart from the stable isotopes which make up almost all lead that exists naturally there are trace quantities of a few radioactive isotopes One of them is lead although it has a half life of only years small quantities occur in nature because lead is produced by a long decay series that starts with uranium that has been present for billions of years on Earth Lead and are present in the decay chains of uranium thorium and uranium respectively so traces of all three of these lead isotopes are found naturally Minute traces of lead arise from the very rare cluster decay of radium one of the daughter products of natural uranium and the decay chain of neptunium traces of which are produced by neutron capture in uranium ores Lead also occurs in the decay chain of neptunium Lead is particularly useful for helping to identify the ages of samples by measuring its ratio to lead both isotopes are present in a single decay chain br In total lead isotopes have been synthesized with mass numbers Lead is the most stable radioisotope with a half life of around years The second most stable is lead which has a half life of about years longer than any of the natural trace radioisotopes br br br Chemistry br br Bulk lead exposed to moist air forms a protective layer of varying composition Lead II carbonate is a common constituent the sulfate or chloride may also be present in urban or maritime settings This layer makes bulk lead effectively chemically inert in the air Finely powdered lead as with many metals is pyrophoric and burns with a bluish white flame br Fluorine reacts with lead at room temperature forming lead II fluoride The reaction with chlorine is similar but requires heating as the resulting chloride layer diminishes the reactivity of the elements Molten lead reacts with the chalcogens to give lead II chalcogenides br Lead metal resists sulfuric and phosphoric acid but not hydrochloric or nitric acid the outcome depends on insolubility and subsequent passivation of the product salt Organic acids such as acetic acid dissolve lead in the presence of oxygen Concentrated alkalis will dissolve lead and form plumbites br br br Inorganic compounds br br Lead shows two main oxidation states and The tetravalent state is common for the carbon group The divalent state is rare for carbon and silicon minor for germanium important but not prevailing for tin and is the more important of the two oxidation states for lead This is attributable to relativistic effects specifically the inert pair effect which manifests itself when there is a large difference in electronegativity between lead and oxide halide or nitride anions leading to a significant partial positive charge on lead The result is a stronger contraction of the lead s orbital than is the case for the p orbital making it rather inert in ionic compounds The inert pair effect is less applicable to compounds in which lead forms covalent bonds with elements of similar electronegativity such as carbon in organolead compounds In these the s and p orbitals remain similarly sized and sp hybridization is still energetically favorable Lead like carbon is predominantly tetravalent in such compounds br There is a relatively large difference in the electronegativity of lead II at and lead IV at This difference marks the reversal in the trend of increasing stability of the oxidation state going down the carbon group tin by comparison has values of in the oxidation state and in the state br br br Lead II br Lead II compounds are characteristic of the inorganic chemistry of lead Even strong oxidizing agents like fluorine and chlorine react with lead to give only PbF and PbCl Lead II ions are usually colorless in solution and partially hydrolyze to form Pb OH and finally Pb OH in which the hydroxyl ions act as bridging ligands but are not reducing agents as tin II ions are Techniques for identifying the presence of the Pb ion in water generally rely on the precipitation of lead II chloride using dilute hydrochloric acid As the chloride salt is sparingly soluble in water in very dilute solutions the precipitation of lead II sulfide is instead achieved by bubbling hydrogen sulfide through the solution br Lead monoxide exists in two polymorphs litharge PbO red and massicot PbO yellow the latter being stable only above around C Litharge is the most commonly used inorganic compound of lead There is no lead II hydroxide increasing the pH of solutions of lead II salts leads to hydrolysis and condensation br Lead commonly reacts with heavier chalcogens Lead sulfide is a semiconductor a photoconductor and an extremely sensitive infrared radiation detector The other two chalcogenides lead selenide and lead telluride are likewise photoconducting They are unusual in that their color becomes lighter going down the group br br Lead dihalides are well characterized this includes the diastatide and mixed halides such as PbFCl The relative insolubility of the latter forms a useful basis for the gravimetric determination of fluorine The difluoride was the first solid ionically conducting compound to be discovered in by Michael Faraday The other dihalides decompose on exposure to ultraviolet or visible light especially the diiodide Many lead II pseudohalides are known such as the cyanide cyanate and thiocyanate Lead II forms an extensive variety of halide coordination complexes such as PbCl PbCl and the Pb Cl n n chain anion br Lead II sulfate is insoluble in water like the sulfates of other heavy divalent cations Lead II nitrate and lead II acetate are very soluble and this is exploited in the synthesis of other lead compounds br br br Lead IV br Few inorganic lead IV compounds are known They are only formed in highly oxidizing solutions and do not normally exist under standard conditions Lead II oxide gives a mixed oxide on further oxidation Pb O It is described as lead II IV oxide or structurally PbO PbO and is the best known mixed valence lead compound Lead dioxide is a strong oxidizing agent capable of oxidizing hydrochloric acid to chlorine gas This is because the expected PbCl that would be produced is unstable and spontaneously decomposes to PbCl and Cl Analogously to lead monoxide lead dioxide is capable of forming plumbate anions Lead disulfide and lead diselenide are only stable at high pressures Lead tetrafluoride a yellow crystalline powder is stable but less so than the difluoride Lead tetrachloride a yellow oil decomposes at room temperature lead tetrabromide is less stable still and the existence of lead tetraiodide is questionable br br br Other oxidation states br br Some lead compounds exist in formal oxidation states other than or Lead III may be obtained as an intermediate between lead II and lead IV in larger organolead complexes this oxidation state is not stable as both the lead III ion and the larger complexes containing it are radicals The same applies for lead I which can be found in such radical species br Numerous mixed lead II IV oxides are known When PbO is heated in air it becomes Pb O at C Pb O at C Pb O at C and finally PbO at C A further sesquioxide Pb O can be obtained at high pressure along with several non stoichiometric phases Many of them show defective fluorite structures in which some oxygen atoms are replaced by vacancies PbO can be considered as having such a structure with every alternate layer of oxygen atoms absent br Negative oxidation states can occur as Zintl phases as either free lead anions as in Ba Pb with lead formally being lead IV or in oxygen sensitive ring shaped or polyhedral cluster ions such as the trigonal bipyramidal Pb ion where two lead atoms are lead I and three are lead In such anions each atom is at a polyhedral vertex and contributes two electrons to each covalent bond along an edge from their sp hybrid orbitals the other two being an external lone pair They may be made in liquid ammonia via the reduction of lead by sodium br br br Organolead br br Lead can form multiply bonded chains a property it shares with its lighter homologs in the carbon group Its capacity to do so is much less because the Pb Pb bond energy is over three and a half times lower than that of the C C bond With itself lead can build metal metal bonds of an order up to three With carbon lead forms organolead compounds similar to but generally less stable than typical organic compounds due to the Pb C bond being rather weak This makes the organometallic chemistry of lead far less wide ranging than that of tin Lead predominantly forms organolead IV compounds even when starting with inorganic lead II reactants very few organolead II compounds are known The most well characterized exceptions are Pb CH SiMe and Pb C H br The lead analog of the simplest organic compound methane is plumbane Plumbane may be obtained in a reaction between metallic lead and atomic hydrogen Two simple derivatives tetramethyllead and tetraethyllead are the best known organolead compounds These compounds are relatively stable tetraethyllead only starts to decompose if heated or if exposed to sunlight or ultraviolet light With sodium metal lead readily forms an equimolar alloy that reacts with alkyl halides to form organometallic compounds such as tetraethyllead The oxidizing nature of many organolead compounds is usefully exploited lead tetraacetate is an important laboratory reagent for oxidation in organic synthesis Tetraethyllead once added to automotive gasoline was produced in larger quantities than any other organometallic compound and is still widely used in fuel for small aircraft br Other organolead compounds are less chemically stable For many organic compounds a lead analog does not exist br br br Origin and occurrence br br br In space br Lead s per particle abundance in the Solar System is ppb parts per billion This figure is two and a half times higher than that of platinum eight times more than mercury and seventeen times more than gold The amount of lead in the universe is slowly increasing as most heavier atoms all of which are unstable gradually decay to lead The abundance of lead in the Solar System since its formation billion years ago has increased by about The solar system abundances table shows that lead despite its relatively high atomic number is more prevalent than most other elements with atomic numbers greater than br Primordial lead which comprises the isotopes lead lead lead and lead was mostly created as a result of repetitive neutron capture processes occurring in stars The two main modes of capture are the s and r processes br In the s process s is for slow captures are separated by years or decades allowing less stable nuclei to undergo beta decay A stable thallium nucleus can capture a neutron and become thallium this undergoes beta decay to give stable lead on capturing another neutron it becomes lead which has a half life of around million years Further captures result in lead lead and lead On capturing another neutron lead becomes lead which quickly decays into bismuth On capturing another neutron bismuth becomes bismuth and this beta decays to polonium which alpha decays to lead The cycle hence ends at lead lead lead and bismuth br br In the r process r is for rapid captures happen faster than nuclei can decay This occurs in environments with a high neutron density such as a supernova or the merger of two neutron stars The neutron flux involved may be on the order of neutrons per square centimeter per second The r process does not form as much lead as the s process It tends to stop once neutron rich nuclei reach neutrons At this point the neutrons are arranged in complete shells in the atomic nucleus and it becomes harder to energetically accommodate more of them When the neutron flux subsides these nuclei beta decay into stable isotopes of osmium iridium and platinum br br br On Earth br Lead is classified as a chalcophile under the Goldschmidt classification meaning it is generally found combined with sulfur It rarely occurs in its native metallic form Many lead minerals are relatively light and over the course of the Earth s history have remained in the crust instead of sinking deeper into the Earth s interior This accounts for lead s relatively high crustal abundance of ppm it is the th most abundant element in the crust br The main lead bearing mineral is galena PbS which is mostly found with zinc ores Most other lead minerals are related to galena in some way boulangerite Pb Sb S is a mixed sulfide derived from galena anglesite PbSO is a product of galena oxidation and cerussite or white lead ore PbCO is a decomposition product of galena Arsenic tin antimony silver gold copper and bismuth are common impurities in lead minerals br br World lead resources exceed two billion tons Significant deposits are located in Australia China Ireland Mexico Peru Portugal Russia and the United States Global reserves resources that are economically feasible to extract totaled million tons in of which Australia had million China million and Russia million br Typical background concentrations of lead do not exceed g m in the atmosphere mg kg in soil mg kg in vegetation and g L in freshwater and seawater br br br Etymology br The modern English word lead is of Germanic origin it comes from the Middle English leed and Old English l ad with the macron above the e signifying that the vowel sound of that letter is long The Old English word is derived from the hypothetical reconstructed Proto Germanic lauda lead According to linguistic theory this word bore descendants in multiple Germanic languages of exactly the same meaning br There is no consensus on the origin of the Proto Germanic lauda One hypothesis suggests it is derived from Proto Indo European lAudh lead capitalization of the vowel is equivalent to the macron Another hypothesis suggests it is borrowed from Proto Celtic loud io lead This word is related to the Latin plumbum which gave the element its chemical symbol Pb The word loud io is thought to be the origin of Proto Germanic bliwa which also means lead from which stemmed the German Blei br The name of the chemical element is not related to the verb of the same spelling which is derived from Proto Germanic laidijan to lead br br br History br br br Prehistory and early history br Metallic lead beads dating back to BC have been found in Asia Minor and may represent the first example of metal smelting At that time lead had few if any applications due to its softness and dull appearance The major reason for the spread of lead production was its association with silver which may be obtained by burning galena a common lead mineral The Ancient Egyptians were the first to use lead minerals in cosmetics an application that spread to Ancient Greece and beyond the Egyptians may have used lead for sinkers in fishing nets glazes glasses enamels and for ornaments Various civilizations of the Fertile Crescent used lead as a writing material as coins and as a construction material Lead was used in the Ancient Chinese royal court as a stimulant as currency and as a contraceptive the Indus Valley civilization and the Mesoamericans used it for making amulets and the eastern and southern African peoples used lead in wire drawing br br br Classical era br Because silver was extensively used as a decorative material and an exchange medium lead deposits came to be worked in Asia Minor from BC later lead deposits were developed in the Aegean and Laurion These three regions collectively dominated production of mined lead until c BC Beginning c BC the Phoenicians worked deposits in the Iberian peninsula by BC lead mining existed in Cyprus Greece and Sardinia br br Rome s territorial expansion in Europe and across the Mediterranean and its development of mining led to it becoming the greatest producer of lead during the classical era with an estimated annual output peaking at tonnes Like their predecessors the Romans obtained lead mostly as a by product of silver smelting Lead mining occurred in Central Europe Britain the Balkans Greece Anatolia and Hispania the latter accounting for of world production br br Lead tablets were commonly used as a material for letters Lead coffins cast in flat sand forms and with interchangeable motifs to suit the faith of the deceased were used in ancient Judea Lead was used to make sling bullets from the th century BC In Roman times lead sling bullets were amply used and were effective at a distance of between and meters The Balearic slingers used as mercenaries in Carthaginian and Roman armies were famous for their shooting distance and accuracy br br Lead was used for making water pipes in the Roman Empire the Latin word for the metal plumbum is the origin of the English word plumbing Its ease of working its low melting point enabling the easy fabrication of completely waterproof welded joints and its resistance to corrosion ensured its widespread use in other applications including pharmaceuticals roofing currency and warfare Writers of the time such as Cato the Elder Columella and Pliny the Elder recommended lead or lead coated vessels for the preparation of sweeteners and preservatives added to wine and food The lead conferred an agreeable taste due to the formation of sugar of lead lead II acetate whereas copper or bronze vessels could impart a bitter flavor through verdigris formation br br The Roman author Vitruvius reported the health dangers of lead and modern writers have suggested that lead poisoning played a major role in the decline of the Roman Empire Other researchers have criticized such claims pointing out for instance that not all abdominal pain is caused by lead poisoning According to archaeological research Roman lead pipes increased lead levels in tap water but such an effect was unlikely to have been truly harmful When lead poisoning did occur victims were called saturnine dark and cynical after the ghoulish father of the gods Saturn By association lead was considered the father of all metals Its status in Roman society was low as it was readily available and cheap br br br Confusion with tin and antimony br Since the Bronze Age metallurgists and engineers have understood the difference between rare and valuable tin essential for alloying with copper to produce tough and corrosion resistant bronze and cheap and cheerful lead However the nomenclature in some languages is similar Romans called lead plumbum nigrum black lead and tin plumbum candidum bright lead The association of lead and tin can be seen in other languages the word olovo in Czech translates to lead but in Russian its cognate olovo means tin To add to the confusion lead bore a close relation to antimony both elements commonly occur as sulfides galena and stibnite often together Pliny incorrectly wrote that stibnite would give lead on heating instead of antimony In countries such as Turkey and India the originally Persian name surma came to refer to either antimony sulfide or lead sulfide and in some languages such as Russian gave its name to antimony br br br Middle Ages and the Renaissance br br Lead mining in Western Europe declined after the fall of the Western Roman Empire with Arabian Iberia being the only region having a significant output The largest production of lead occurred in South and East Asia especially China and India where lead mining grew rapidly br In Europe lead production began to increase in the th and th centuries when it was again used for roofing and piping Starting in the th century lead was used to create stained glass In the European and Arabian traditions of alchemy lead symbol in the European tradition was considered an impure base metal which by the separation purification and balancing of its constituent essences could be transformed to pure and incorruptible gold During the period lead was used increasingly for adulterating wine The use of such wine was forbidden for use in Christian rites by a papal bull in but it continued to be imbibed and resulted in mass poisonings up to the late th century Lead was a key material in parts of the printing press and lead dust was commonly inhaled by print workers causing lead poisoning Lead also became the chief material for making bullets for firearms it was cheap less damaging to iron gun barrels had a higher density which allowed for better retention of velocity and its lower melting point made the production of bullets easier as they could be made using a wood fire Lead in the form of Venetian ceruse was extensively used in cosmetics by Western European aristocracy as whitened faces were regarded as a sign of modesty This practice later expanded to white wigs and eyeliners and only faded out with the French Revolution in the late th century A similar fashion appeared in Japan in the th century with the emergence of the geishas a practice that continued long into the th century The white faces of women came to represent their feminine virtue as Japanese women with lead commonly used in the whitener br br br Outside Europe and Asia br In the New World lead production was recorded soon after the arrival of European settlers The earliest record dates to in the English Colony of Virginia fourteen years after its foundation In Australia the first mine opened by colonists on the continent was a lead mine in In Africa lead mining and smelting were known in the Benue Trough and the lower Congo Basin where lead was used for trade with Europeans and as a currency by the th century well before the scramble for Africa br br br Industrial Revolution br br In the second half of the th century Britain and later continental Europe and the United States experienced the Industrial Revolution This was the first time during which lead production rates exceeded those of Rome Britain was the leading producer losing this status by the mid th century with the depletion of its mines and the development of lead mining in Germany Spain and the United States By the United States was the leader in global lead production and other non European nations Canada Mexico and Australia had begun significant production production outside Europe exceeded that within A great share of the demand for lead came from plumbing and painting lead paints were in regular use At this time more working class people were exposed to the metal and lead poisoning cases escalated This led to research into the effects of lead intake Lead was proven to be more dangerous in its fume form than as a solid metal Lead poisoning and gout were linked British physician Alfred Baring Garrod noted a third of his gout patients were plumbers and painters The effects of chronic ingestion of lead including mental disorders were also studied in the th century The first laws aimed at decreasing lead poisoning in factories were enacted during the s and s in the United Kingdom br br br Modern era br Further evidence of the threat that lead posed to humans was discovered in the late th and early th centuries Mechanisms of harm were better understood lead blindness was documented and the element was phased out of public use in the United States and Europe The United Kingdom introduced mandatory factory inspections in and appointed the first Medical Inspector of Factories in as a result a fold decrease in lead poisoning incidents from to was reported Most European countries banned lead paint commonly used because of its opacity and water resistance for interiors by br The last major human exposure to lead was the addition of tetraethyllead to gasoline as an antiknock agent a practice that originated in the United States in It was phased out in the United States and the European Union by br In the s the United States and Western European countries introduced legislation to reduce lead air pollution The impact was significant while a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States in showed that of the population had elevated blood lead levels in a study by the same institute showed the share of people with such high levels dropped to The main product made of lead by the end of the th century was the lead acid battery br From to lead output in the Western Bloc grew by about The share of the world s lead production by the Eastern Bloc increased from to from to with the Soviet Union being the world s largest producer during the mid s and the s and China starting major lead production in the late th century Unlike the European communist countries China was largely unindustrialized by the mid th century in China surpassed Australia as the largest producer of lead As was the case during European industrialization lead has had a negative effect on health in China br br br Production br br As of production of lead is increasing worldwide due to its use in lead acid batteries There are two major categories of production primary from mined ores and secondary from scrap In million metric tons came from primary production and million from secondary production The top three producers of mined lead concentrate in that year were China Australia and the United States The top three producers of refined lead were China the United States and India According to the International Resource Panel s Metal Stocks in Society report of the total amount of lead in use stockpiled discarded or dissipated into the environment on a global basis is kg per capita Much of this is in more developed countries kg per capita rather than less developed ones kg per capita br The primary and secondary lead production processes are similar Some primary production plants now supplement their operations with scrap lead and this trend is likely to increase in the future Given adequate techniques lead obtained via secondary processes is indistinguishable from lead obtained via primary processes Scrap lead from the building trade is usually fairly clean and is re melted without the need for smelting though refining is sometimes needed Secondary lead production is therefore cheaper in terms of energy requirements than is primary production often by or more br br br Primary br Most lead ores contain a low percentage of lead rich ores have a typical content of which must be concentrated for extraction During initial processing ores typically undergo crushing dense medium separation grinding froth flotation and drying The resulting concentrate which has a lead content of by mass regularly is then turned into impure lead metal br There are two main ways of doing this a two stage process involving roasting followed by blast furnace extraction carried out in separate vessels or a direct process in which the extraction of the concentrate occurs in a single vessel The latter has become the most common route though the former is still significant br br br Two stage process br First the sulfide concentrate is roasted in air to oxidize the lead sulfide br br PbS s O g PbO s SO g br As the original concentrate was not pure lead sulfide roasting yields not only the desired lead II oxide but a mixture of oxides sulfates and silicates of lead and of the other metals contained in the ore This impure lead oxide is reduced in a coke fired blast furnace to the again impure metal br br PbO s C s Pb s CO g br Impurities are mostly arsenic antimony bismuth zinc copper silver and gold Typically they are removed in a series of pyrometallurgical processes The melt is treated in a reverberatory furnace with air steam and sulfur which oxidizes the impurities except for silver gold and bismuth Oxidized contaminants float to the top of the melt and are skimmed off Metallic silver and gold are removed and recovered economically by means of the Parkes process in which zinc is added to lead Zinc which is immiscible in lead dissolves the silver and gold The zinc solution can be separated from the lead and the silver and gold retrieved De silvered lead is freed of bismuth by the Betterton Kroll process treating it with metallic calcium and magnesium The resulting bismuth dross can be skimmed off br Alternatively to the pyrometallurgical processes very pure lead can be obtained by processing smelted lead electrolytically using the Betts process Anodes of impure lead and cathodes of pure lead are placed in an electrolyte of lead fluorosilicate PbSiF Once electrical potential is applied impure lead at the anode dissolves and plates onto the cathode leaving the majority of the impurities in solution This is a high cost process and thus mostly reserved for refining bullion containing high percentages of impurities br br br Direct process br In this process lead bullion and slag is obtained directly from lead concentrates The lead sulfide concentrate is melted in a furnace and oxidized forming lead monoxide Carbon as coke or coal gas is added to the molten charge along with fluxing agents The lead monoxide is thereby reduced to metallic lead in the midst of a slag rich in lead monoxide br If the input is rich in lead as much as of the original lead can be obtained as bullion the remaining forms a slag rich in lead monoxide For a low grade feed all of the lead can be oxidized to a high lead slag Metallic lead is further obtained from the high lead slags via submerged fuel combustion or injection reduction assisted by an electric furnace or a combination of both br br br Alternatives br Research on a cleaner less energy intensive lead extraction process continues a major drawback is that either too much lead is lost as waste or the alternatives result in a high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal Hydrometallurgical extraction in which anodes of impure lead are immersed into an electrolyte and pure lead is deposited electrowound onto a cathode is a technique that may have potential but is not currently economical except in cases where electricity is very cheap br br br Secondary br br Smelting which is an essential part of the primary production is often skipped during secondary production It is only performed when metallic lead has undergone significant oxidation The process is similar to that of primary production in either a blast furnace or a rotary furnace with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields blast furnaces produce hard lead antimony while reverberatory and rotary kiln furnaces produce semisoft lead antimony br The ISASMELT process is a more recent smelting method that may act as an extension to primary production battery paste from spent lead acid batteries containing lead sulfate and lead oxides has its sulfate removed by treating it with alkali and is then treated in a coal fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen which yields impure lead with antimony the most common impurity Refining of secondary lead is similar to that of primary lead some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination br Of the sources of lead for recycling lead acid batteries are the most important lead pipe sheet and cable sheathing are also significant br br br Applications br br Contrary to popular belief pencil leads in wooden pencils have never been made from lead When the pencil originated as a wrapped graphite writing tool the particular type of graphite used was named plumbago literally act for lead or lead mockup br br br Elemental form br Lead metal has several useful mechanical properties including high density low melting point ductility and relative inertness Many metals are superior to lead in some of these aspects but are generally less common and more difficult to extract from parent ores Lead s toxicity has led to its phasing out for some uses br Lead has been used for bullets since their invention in the Middle Ages It is inexpensive its low melting point means small arms ammunition and shotgun pellets can be cast with minimal technical equipment and it is denser than other common metals which allows for better retention of velocity It remains the main material for bullets alloyed with other metals as hardeners Concerns have been raised that lead bullets used for hunting can damage the environment br Lead s high density and resistance to corrosion have been exploited in a number of related applications It is used as ballast in sailboat keels its density allows it to take up a small volume and minimize water resistance thus counterbalancing the heeling effect of wind on the sails It is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver s buoyancy In the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with tonnes of lead Because of its corrosion resistance lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables br br Lead has many uses in the construction industry lead sheets are used as architectural metals in roofing material cladding flashing gutters and gutter joints and on roof parapets Lead is still used in statues and sculptures including for armatures In the past it was often used to balance the wheels of cars for environmental reasons this use is being phased out in favor of other materials br Lead is added to copper alloys such as brass and bronze to improve machinability and for its lubricating qualities Being practically insoluble in copper the lead forms solid globules in imperfections throughout the alloy such as grain boundaries In low concentrations as well as acting as a lubricant the globules hinder the formation of swarf as the alloy is worked thereby improving machinability Copper alloys with larger concentrations of lead are used in bearings The lead provides lubrication and the copper provides the load bearing support br Lead s high density atomic number and formability form the basis for use of lead as a barrier that absorbs sound vibration and radiation Lead has no natural resonance frequencies as a result sheet lead is used as a sound deadening layer in the walls floors and ceilings of sound studios Organ pipes are often made from a lead alloy mixed with various amounts of tin to control the tone of each pipe Lead is an established shielding material from radiation in nuclear science and in X ray rooms due to its denseness and high attenuation coefficient Molten lead has been used as a coolant for lead cooled fast reactors br br br Batteries br The largest use of lead in the early st century is in lead acid batteries The lead in batteries undergoes no direct contact with humans so there are fewer toxicity concerns People who work in lead battery production or recycling plants may be exposed to lead dust and inhale it The reactions in the battery between lead lead dioxide and sulfuric acid provide a reliable source of voltage Supercapacitors incorporating lead acid batteries have been installed in kilowatt and megawatt scale applications in Australia Japan and the United States in frequency regulation solar smoothing and shifting wind smoothing and other applications These batteries have lower energy density and charge discharge efficiency than lithium ion batteries but are significantly cheaper br br br Coating for cables br Lead is used in high voltage power cables as shell material to prevent water diffusion into insulation this use is decreasing as lead is being phased out Its use in solder for electronics is also being phased out by some countries to reduce the amount of environmentally hazardous waste Lead is one of three metals used in the Oddy test for museum materials helping detect organic acids aldehydes and acidic gases br br br Compounds br br In addition to being the main application for lead metal lead acid batteries are also the main consumer of lead compounds The energy storage release reaction used in these devices involves lead sulfate and lead dioxide br br Pb s PbO s H SO aq PbSO s H O l br Other applications of lead compounds are very specialized and often fading Lead based coloring agents are used in ceramic glazes and glass especially for red and yellow shades While lead paints are phased out in Europe and North America they remain in use in less developed countries such as China India or Indonesia Lead tetraacetate and lead dioxide are used as oxidizing agents in organic chemistry Lead is frequently used in the polyvinyl chloride coating of electrical cords It can be used to treat candle wicks to ensure a longer more even burn Because of its toxicity European and North American manufacturers use alternatives such as zinc Lead glass is composed of lead oxide changing its optical characteristics and reducing the transmission of ionizing radiation a property used in old TVs and computer monitors with cathode ray tubes Lead based semiconductors such as lead telluride and lead selenide are used in photovoltaic cells and infrared detectors br br br Biological effects br br Lead has no confirmed biological role and there is no confirmed safe level of lead exposure A Canadian American study concluded that even at levels that are considered to pose little to no risk lead may cause adverse mental health outcomes Its prevalence in the human body at an adult average of mg is nevertheless exceeded only by zinc mg and iron mg among the heavy metals Lead salts are very efficiently absorbed by the body A small amount of lead is stored in bones the rest is excreted in urine and feces within a few weeks of exposure Only about a third of lead is excreted by a child Continual exposure may result in the bioaccumulation of lead br br br Toxicity br Lead is a highly poisonous metal whether inhaled or swallowed affecting almost every organ and system in the human body At airborne levels of mg m it is immediately dangerous to life and health Most ingested lead is absorbed into the bloodstream The primary cause of its toxicity is its predilection for interfering with the proper functioning of enzymes It does so by binding to the sulfhydryl groups found on many enzymes or mimicking and displacing other metals which act as cofactors in many enzymatic reactions The essential metals that lead interacts with include calcium iron and zinc High levels of calcium and iron tend to provide some protection from lead poisoning low levels cause increased susceptibility br br br Effects br Lead can cause severe damage to the brain and kidneys and ultimately death By mimicking calcium lead can cross the blood brain barrier It degrades the myelin sheaths of neurons reduces their numbers interferes with neurotransmission routes and decreases neuronal growth In the human body lead inhibits porphobilinogen synthase and ferrochelatase preventing both porphobilinogen formation and the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin IX the final step in heme synthesis This causes ineffective heme synthesis and microcytic anemia br br Symptoms of lead poisoning include nephropathy colic like abdominal pains and possibly weakness in the fingers wrists or ankles Small blood pressure increases particularly in middle aged and older people may be apparent and can cause anemia Several studies mostly cross sectional found an association between increased lead exposure and decreased heart rate variability In pregnant women high levels of exposure to lead may cause miscarriage Chronic high level exposure has been shown to reduce fertility in males br In a child s developing brain lead interferes with synapse formation in the cerebral cortex neurochemical development including that of neurotransmitters and the organization of ion channels Early childhood exposure has been linked with an increased risk of sleep disturbances and excessive daytime drowsiness in later childhood High blood levels are associated with delayed puberty in girls The rise and fall in exposure to airborne lead from the combustion of tetraethyl lead in gasoline during the th century has been linked with historical increases and decreases in crime levels br br br Exposure sources br Lead exposure is a global issue since lead mining and smelting and battery manufacturing disposal and recycling are common in many countries Lead enters the body via inhalation ingestion or skin absorption Almost all inhaled lead is absorbed into the body for ingestion the rate is with children absorbing a higher percentage than adults br Poisoning typically results from ingestion of food or water contaminated with lead and less commonly after accidental ingestion of contaminated soil dust or lead based paint Seawater products can contain lead if affected by nearby industrial waters Fruit and vegetables can be contaminated by high levels of lead in the soils they were grown in Soil can be contaminated through particulate accumulation from lead in pipes lead paint and residual emissions from leaded gasoline br The use of lead for water pipes is a problem in areas with soft or acidic water Hard water forms insoluble protective layers on the inner surface of the pipes whereas soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes Dissolved carbon dioxide in the carried water may result in the formation of soluble lead bicarbonate oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as lead II hydroxide Drinking such water over time can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead The harder the water the more calcium bicarbonate and sulfate it will contain and the more the inside of the pipes will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate br br Ingestion of applied lead based paint is the major source of exposure for children br a direct source is chewing on old painted window sills Additionally as lead paint on a surface deteriorates it peels and is pulverized into dust The dust then enters the body through hand to mouth contact or contaminated food or drink Ingesting certain home remedies may result in exposure to lead or its compounds br Inhalation is the second major exposure pathway affecting smokers and especially workers in lead related occupations Cigarette smoke contains among other toxic substances radioactive lead As a result of EPA s regulatory efforts levels of lead in the air in the United States decreased by percent between and The concentration of lead in the air in the United States fell below the national standard of g m in br Skin exposure may be significant for people working with organic lead compounds The rate of skin absorption is lower for inorganic lead br br br Lead in foods br Lead may be found in food when food is grown in soil that is high in lead airborne lead contaminates the crops animals eat lead in their diet or lead enters the food either from what it was stored or cooked in Ingestion of lead paint and batteries is also a route of exposure for livestock which can subsequently affect humans Milk produced by contaminated cattle can be diluted to a lower lead concentration and sold for consumption br In Bangladesh lead compounds have been added to turmeric to make it more yellow This is believed to have started in the s and continues as of It is believed to be one of the main sources of high lead levels in the country In Hong Kong the maximum allowed lead level in food is parts per million in solids and part per million in liquids br Lead containing dust can settle on drying cocoa beans when they are set outside near polluting industrial plants In December Consumer Reports tested dark chocolate brands and found that of them contained potentially harmful levels of lead cadmium or both They have urged the chocolate makers to reduce the level of lead which could be harmful especially to a developing fetus br br br Lead in plastic toys br According to the United States Center for Disease Control the use of lead in plastics has not been banned as of Lead softens the plastic and makes it more flexible so that it can go back to its original shape Habitual chewing on colored plastic insulation from stripped electrical wires was found to cause elevated lead levels in a year old man Lead may be used in plastic toys to stabilize molecules from heat Lead dust can be formed when plastic is exposed to sunlight air and detergents that break down the chemical bond between the lead and plastics br br br Treatment br br Treatment for lead poisoning normally involves the administration of dimercaprol and succimer Acute cases may require the use of disodium calcium edetate the calcium chelate and the disodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA It has a greater affinity for lead than calcium with the result that lead chelate is formed by exchange and excreted in the urine leaving behind harmless calcium br br br Environmental effects br br The extraction production use and disposal of lead and its products have caused significant contamination of the Earth s soils and waters Atmospheric emissions of lead were at their peak during the Industrial Revolution and the leaded gasoline period in the second half of the twentieth century br Lead releases originate from natural sources i e concentration of the naturally occurring lead industrial production incineration and recycling and mobilization of previously buried lead In particular as lead has been phased out from other uses in the Global South lead recycling operations designed to extract cheap lead used for global manufacturing have become a well documented source of exposure Elevated concentrations of lead persist in soils and sediments in post industrial and urban areas industrial emissions including those arising from coal burning continue in many parts of the world particularly in the developing countries br Lead can accumulate in soils especially those with a high organic content where it remains for hundreds to thousands of years Environmental lead can compete with other metals found in and on plant surfaces potentially inhibiting photosynthesis and at high enough concentrations negatively affecting plant growth and survival Contamination of soils and plants can allow lead to ascend the food chain affecting microorganisms and animals In animals lead exhibits toxicity in many organs damaging the nervous renal reproductive hematopoietic and cardiovascular systems after ingestion inhalation or skin absorption Fish uptake lead from both water and sediment bioaccumulation in the food chain poses a hazard to fish birds and sea mammals br Anthropogenic lead includes lead from shot and sinkers These are among the most potent sources of lead contamination along with lead production sites Lead was banned for shot and sinkers in the United States in although that ban was only effective for a month and a similar ban is being considered in the European Union br Analytical methods for the determination of lead in the environment include spectrophotometry X ray fluorescence atomic spectroscopy and electrochemical methods A specific ion selective electrode has been developed based on the ionophore S S methylenebis N N diisobutyldithiocarbamate An important biomarker assay for lead poisoning is aminolevulinic acid levels in plasma serum and urine br br br Restriction and remediation br br By the mid s there was significant decline in the use of lead in industry In the United States environmental regulations reduced or eliminated the use of lead in non battery products including gasoline paints solders and water systems Particulate control devices were installed in coal fired power plants to capture lead emissions In U S Congress required the Environmental Protection Agency to reduce the blood lead levels of the country s children Lead use was further curtailed by the European Union s Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive A large drop in lead deposition occurred in the Netherlands after the national ban on use of lead shot for hunting and sport shooting from tonnes in to tonnes in br In the United States the permissible exposure limit for lead in the workplace comprising metallic lead inorganic lead compounds and lead soaps was set at g m over an hour workday and the blood lead level limit at g per g of blood in Lead may still be found in harmful quantities in stoneware vinyl such as that used for tubing and the insulation of electrical cords and Chinese brass Old houses may still contain lead paint White lead paint has been withdrawn from sale in industrialized countries but specialized uses of other pigments such as yellow lead chromate remain especially in road pavement marking paint br Stripping old paint by sanding produces dust which can be inhaled Lead abatement programs have been mandated by some authorities in properties where young children live br Lead waste depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the waste may be treated as household waste to facilitate lead abatement activities or potentially hazardous waste requiring specialized treatment or storage Lead is released into the environment in shooting places and a number of lead management practices have been developed to counter the lead contamination Lead migration can be enhanced in acidic soils to counter that it is advised soils be treated with lime to neutralize the soils and prevent leaching of lead br Research has been conducted on how to remove lead from biosystems by biological means Fish bones are being researched for their ability to bioremediate lead in contaminated soil The fungus Aspergillus versicolor is effective at absorbing lead ions from industrial waste before being released to water bodies Several bacteria have been researched for their ability to remove lead from the environment including the sulfate reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio and Desulfotomaculum both of which are highly effective in aqueous solutions Millet grass Urochloa ramosa has the ability to accumulate significant amounts of metals such as lead and zinc in its shoot and root tissues making it an important plant for remediation of contaminated soils Lakshmi et al br br br See also br Derek Bryce Smith one of the earliest
