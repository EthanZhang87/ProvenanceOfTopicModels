A crankshaft is a mechanical component used in a piston engine to convert the reciprocating motion into rotational motion The crankshaft is a rotating shaft containing one or more crankpins that are driven by the pistons via the connecting rods br The crankpins are also called rod bearing journals and they rotate within the big end of the connecting rods br Most modern crankshafts are located in the engine block They are made from steel or cast iron using either a forging casting or machining process br br br Design br br The crankshaft is located within the engine block and held in place via main bearings which allow the crankshaft to rotate within the block The up down motion of each piston is transferred to the crankshaft via connecting rods A flywheel is often attached to one end of the crankshaft in order to smoothen the power delivery and reduce vibration br A crankshaft is subjected to enormous stresses in some cases more than tonnes pounds per cylinder Crankshafts for single cylinder engines are usually a simpler design than for engines with multiple cylinders br br br Bearings br br The crankshaft is able to rotate in the engine block due to the main bearings Since the crankshaft is subject to large horizontal and torsional forces from each cylinder these main bearings are located at various points along the crankshaft rather than just one at each end The number of main bearings is determined based on the overall load factor and the maximum engine speed Crankshafts in diesel engines often use a main bearing between every cylinder and at both ends of the crankshaft due to the high forces of combustion present br Flexing of the crankshaft was a factor in V engines replacing straight eight engines in the s the long crankshafts of the latter suffered from an unacceptable amount of flex when engine designers began using higher compression ratios and higher engine speeds RPM br br br Piston stroke br The distance between the axis of the crankpins and the axis of the crankshaft determines the stroke length of the engine br Most modern car engines are classified as over square or short stroke wherein the stroke is less than the diameter of the cylinder bore A common way to increase the low RPM torque of an engine is to increase the stroke sometimes known as stroking the engine Historically the trade off for a long stroke engine was a lower rev limit and increased vibration at high RPM due to the increased piston velocity br br br Cross plane and flat plane configurations br When designing an engine the crankshaft configuration is closely related to the engine s firing order br Most production V engines such as the Ford Modular engine and the General Motors LS engine use a cross plane crank whereby the crank throws are spaced degrees apart However some high performance V engines such as the Ferrari instead use a flat plane crank whereby the throws are spaced apart which essentially results in two inline four engines sharing a common crankcase Flat plane engines are usually able to operate at higher RPM however they have higher second order vibrations so they are better suited to racing car engines br br br Engine balance br For some engines it is necessary to provide counterweights for the reciprocating mass of the piston conrods and crankshaft in order to improve the engine balance These counterweights are typically cast as part of the crankshaft but occasionally are bolt on pieces br br br Flying arms br br In some engines the crankshaft contains direct links between adjacent crank pins without the usual intermediate main bearing These links are called flying arms This arrangement is sometimes used in V and V engines in order to maintain an even firing interval while using different V angles and to reduce the number of main bearings required The downside of flying arms is that the rigidity of the crankshaft is reduced which can cause problems at high RPM or high power outputs br br br Counter rotating crankshafts br In most engines each connecting rod is attached a single crankshaft which results in the angle of the connecting rod varying as the piston moves through its stroke This variation in angle pushes the pistons against the cylinder wall which causes friction between the piston and cylinder wall To prevent this some early engines such as the Lanchester Engine Company flat twin engines connected each piston to two crankshafts that are rotating in opposite directions This arrangement cancels out the lateral forces and reduces the requirement for counterweights This design is rarely used however a similar principle applies to balance shafts which are occasionally used br br br Construction br br br Forged crankshafts br br Crankshafts can be created from a steel bar using roll forging Today manufacturers tend to favour the use of forged crankshafts due to their lighter weight more compact dimensions and better inherent damping With forged crankshafts vanadium micro alloyed steels are mainly used as these steels can be air cooled after reaching high strengths without additional heat treatment except for the surface hardening of the bearing surfaces The low alloy content also makes the material cheaper than high alloy steels Carbon steels also require additional heat treatment to reach the desired properties br br br Cast crankshafts br Another construction method is to cast the crankshaft from ductile Cast iron crankshafts are today mostly found in cheaper production engines where the loads are lower br br br Machined crankshafts br Crankshafts can also be machined from billet often a bar of high quality vacuum remelted steel Though the fiber flow local inhomogeneities of the material s chemical composition generated during casting does not follow the shape of the crankshaft which is undesirable this is usually not a problem since higher quality steels which normally are difficult to forge can be used Per unit these crankshafts tend to be very expensive due to the large amount of material that must be removed with lathes and milling machines the high material cost and the additional heat treatment required However since no expensive tooling is needed this production method allows small production runs without high up front costs br br br History br br br China br br The earliest hand operated cranks appeared in China during the Han dynasty BC AD They were used for silk reeling hemp spinning for the agricultural winnowing fan in the water powered flour sifter for hydraulic powered metallurgic bellows and in the well windlass The rotary winnowing fan greatly increased the efficiency of separating grain from husks and stalks However the potential of the crank of converting circular motion into reciprocal motion never seems to have been fully realized in China and the crank was typically absent from such machines until the turn of the th century br br br Europe br br A crank in the form of an eccentrically mounted handle of the rotary handmill appeared in th century BC Celtiberian Spain and ultimately spread across the Roman Empire A Roman iron crank dating to the nd century AD was excavated in Augusta Raurica Switzerland The crank operated Roman mill is dated to the late nd century br br Evidence for the crank combined with a connecting rod appears in the Hierapolis mill dating to the rd century they are also found in stone sawmills in Roman Syria and Ephesus dating to the th century The pediment of the Hierapolis mill shows a waterwheel fed by a mill race powering via a gear train two frame saws which cut blocks by the way of some kind of connecting rods and cranks The crank and connecting rod mechanisms of the other two archaeologically attested sawmills worked without a gear train Water powered marble saws in Germany were mentioned by the late th century poet Ausonius about the same time these mill types seem also to be indicated by Gregory of Nyssa from Anatolia br A rotary grindstone operated by a crank handle is shown in the Carolingian manuscript Utrecht Psalter the pen drawing of around goes back to a late antique original Cranks used to turn wheels are also depicted or described in various works dating from the tenth to thirteenth centuries br The first depictions of the compound crank in the carpenter s brace appear between and in northern European artwork The rapid adoption of the compound crank can be traced in the works of an unknown German engineer writing on the state of military technology during the Hussite Wars first the connecting rod applied to cranks reappeared second double compound cranks also began to be equipped with connecting rods and third the flywheel was employed for these cranks to get them over the dead spot The concept was much improved by the Italian engineer and writer Roberto Valturio in who devised a boat with five sets where the parallel cranks are all joined to a single power source by one connecting rod an idea also taken up by his compatriot Italian painter Francesco di Giorgio br The crank had become common in Europe by the early th century as seen in the works of the military engineer Konrad Kyeser after Devices depicted in Kyeser s Bellifortis include cranked windlasses for spanning siege crossbows cranked chain of buckets for water lifting and cranks fitted to a wheel of bells Kyeser also equipped the Archimedes screws for water raising with a crank handle an innovation which subsequently replaced the ancient practice of working the pipe by treading br Pisanello painted a piston pump driven by a water wheel and operated by two simple cranks and two connecting rods br br The th century also saw the introduction of cranked rack and pinion devices called cranequins which were fitted to the crossbow s stock as a means of exerting even more force while spanning the missile weapon In the textile industry cranked reels for winding skeins of yarn were introduced br The Italian physician Guido da Vigevano c c planning for a new crusade made illustrations for a paddle boat and war carriages that were propelled by manually turned compound cranks and gear wheels identified as an early crankshaft prototype by Lynn Townsend White The Luttrell Psalter dating to around describes a grindstone which was rotated by two cranks one at each end of its axle the geared hand mill operated either with one or two cranks appeared later in the th century br br Around the early medieval rotary grindstone was improved with a treadle and crank mechanism Cranks mounted on push carts first appear in a German engraving of Crankshafts were also described by Leonardo da Vinci and a Dutch farmer and windmill owner by the name Cornelis Corneliszoon van Uitgeest in His wind powered sawmill used a crankshaft to convert a windmill s circular motion into a back and forward motion powering the saw Corneliszoon was granted a patent for his crankshaft in br From the th century onwards evidence of cranks and connecting rods integrated into machine design becomes abundant in the technological treatises of the period Agostino Ramelli s The Diverse and Artifactitious Machines of depicts eighteen examples a number that rises in the Theatrum Machinarum Novum by Georg Andreas B ckler to different machines Cranks were formerly common on some machines in the early th century for example almost all phonographs before the s were powered by clockwork motors wound with cranks Reciprocating piston engines use cranks to convert the linear piston motion into rotational motion Internal combustion engines of early th century automobiles were usually started with hand cranks before electric starters came into general use br br br Western Asia br The non manual crank appears in several of the hydraulic devices described by the Ban M s brothers in their th century Book of Ingenious Devices These automatically operated cranks appear in several devices two of which contain an action which approximates to that of a crankshaft The automatic crank described by the Ban M s would not have allowed a full rotation however but only a small modification was required to convert it to a crankshaft br br br See also br br br br br br Sources br Frankel Rafael The Olynthus Mill Its Origin and Diffusion Typology and Distribution American Journal of Archaeology doi aja S
