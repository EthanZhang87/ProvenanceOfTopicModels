id: 227381
Nickel carbonyl IUPAC name tetracarbonylnickel is a nickel organometallic compound with the formula Ni CO This colorless liquid is the principal carbonyl of nickel It is an intermediate in the Mond process for producing very high purity nickel and a reagent in organometallic chemistry although the Mond Process has fallen out of common usage due to the health hazards in working with the compound Nickel carbonyl is one of the most dangerous substances yet encountered in nickel chemistry due to its very high toxicity compounded with high volatility and rapid skin absorption br br br Structure and bonding br In nickel tetracarbonyl the oxidation state for nickel is assigned as zero because the Ni C bonding electrons come from the C atom and are still assigned to C in the hypothetical ionic bond which determines the oxidation states The formula conforms to the electron rule The molecule is tetrahedral with four carbonyl carbon monoxide ligands Electron diffraction studies have been performed on this molecule and the Ni C and C O distances have been calculated to be and angstroms respectively br br br Preparation br Ni CO was first synthesised in by Ludwig Mond by the direct reaction of nickel metal with carbon monoxide This pioneering work foreshadowed the existence of many other metal carbonyl compounds including those of vanadium chromium manganese iron and cobalt It was also applied industrially to the purification of nickel by the end of the th century br At K C F carbon monoxide is passed over impure nickel The optimal rate occurs at C br br br Laboratory routes br Ni CO is not readily available commercially It is conveniently generated in the laboratory by carbonylation of commercially available bis cyclooctadiene nickel It can also be prepared by reduction of ammoniacal solutions of nickel sulfate with sodium dithionite under an atmosphere of CO br br br Reactions br br br Thermal decarbonylation br On moderate heating Ni CO decomposes to carbon monoxide and nickel metal Combined with the easy formation from CO and even very impure nickel this decomposition is the basis for the Mond process for the purification of nickel or plating onto surfaces Thermal decomposition commences near C F and increases at higher temperature br br br Reactions with nucleophiles and reducing agents br Like other low valent metal carbonyls Ni CO is susceptible to attack by nucleophiles Attack can occur at nickel center resulting in displacement of CO ligands or at CO Thus donor ligands such as triphenylphosphine react to give Ni CO PPh and Ni CO PPh Bipyridine and related ligands behave similarly The monosubstitution of nickel tetracarbonyl with other ligands can be used to determine the Tolman electronic parameter a measure of the electron donating or withdrawing ability of a given ligand br br Treatment with hydroxides gives clusters such as Ni CO and Ni CO These compounds can also be obtained by reduction of nickel carbonyl br Thus treatment of Ni CO with carbon nucleophiles Nu results in acyl derivatives such as Ni CO C O Nu br br br Reactions with electrophiles and oxidizing agents br Nickel carbonyl can be oxidized Chlorine oxidizes nickel carbonyl into NiCl releasing CO gas Other halogens behave analogously This reaction provides a convenient method for precipitating the nickel portion of the toxic compound br Reactions of Ni CO with alkyl and aryl halides often result in carbonylated organic products Vinylic halides such as PhCH CHBr are converted to the unsaturated esters upon treatment with Ni CO followed by sodium methoxide Such reactions also probably proceed via oxidative addition Allylic halides give the allylnickel compounds such as allyl Ni Cl br Ni CO ClCH CH CH Ni Cl C H CO br br br Toxicology and safety considerations br The hazards of Ni CO are far greater than that implied by its CO content reflecting the effects of the nickel if released in the body Nickel carbonyl may be fatal if absorbed through the skin or more likely inhaled due to its high volatility Its LC for a minute exposure has been estimated at ppm and the concentration that is immediately fatal to humans would be ppm Some subjects exposed to puffs up to ppm described the odour as musty or sooty but because the compound is so exceedingly toxic its smell provides no reliable warning against a potentially fatal exposure br The vapours of Ni CO can autoignite The vapor decomposes quickly in air with a half life of about seconds br Nickel carbonyl poisoning is characterized by a two stage illness The first consists of headaches and chest pain lasting a few hours usually followed by a short remission The second phase is a chemical pneumonitis which starts after typically hours with symptoms of cough breathlessness and extreme fatigue These reach greatest severity after four days possibly resulting in death from cardiorespiratory or acute kidney injury Convalescence is often extremely protracted often complicated by exhaustion depression and dyspnea on exertion Permanent respiratory damage is unusual The carcinogenicity of Ni CO is a matter of debate but is presumed to be significant br It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section of the U S Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act U S C and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce store or use it in significant quantities br br br In popular culture br Requiem for the Living an episode of Quincy M E features a poisoned dying crime lord who asks Dr Quincy to autopsy his still living body Quincy identifies the poison nickel carbonyl br In the novella Amanda Morgan by Gordon R Dickson the remaining inhabitants of a mostly evacuated village resist an occupying military force by directing the exhaust from a poorly tuned internal combustion engine onto a continually renewed waste heap of powdered nickel outside a machine shop under the guise of civilian business in order to eliminate the occupiers at the cost of their own lives br In chapter of the manga Dr Stone a machine is made that purifies nickel via the Mond Process It is mentioned that the process creates a fatal toxin nickel carbonyl br In the novel Delta v from New York Times bestselling author Daniel Suarez a team of eight private miners reach a near earth asteroid to extract volatiles water CO etc and metals iron nickel and cobalt these are stored as solid carbonyl for transfer back to near Earth orbit and used for in situ fabrication of a spacecraft via
