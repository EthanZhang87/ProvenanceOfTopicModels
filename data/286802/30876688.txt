title: Particulates
id: 30876688
Particulates or atmospheric particulate matter see below for other names are microscopic particles of solid or liquid matter suspended in the air The term aerosol commonly refers to the particulate air mixture as opposed to the particulate matter alone Sources of particulate matter can be natural or anthropogenic They have impacts on climate and precipitation that adversely affect human health in ways additional to direct inhalation br br Types of atmospheric particles include suspended particulate matter thoracic and respirable particles inhalable coarse particles designated PM which are coarse particles with a diameter of micrometers m or less fine particles designated PM with a diameter of m or less ultrafine particles with a diameter of nm or less and soot br Airborne particulate matter is a Group carcinogen Particulates are the most harmful form other than ultra fines of air pollution as they can penetrate deep into the lungs and brain from blood streams causing health problems such as heart disease lung disease cancer and preterm birth There is no safe level of particulates Worldwide exposure to PM contributed to million deaths from heart disease stroke lung cancer chronic lung disease and respiratory infections in Overall ambient particulate matter is one of the leading risk factor for premature death globally br br br Sources br br Human activities generate significant amounts of particulates For example br br Burning of fossil fuels e g aircraft joss paper waste firecrackers and biomass including wood and crop residue br Construction including activities of building rehabilitation refurbishment or demolition br Renovation br Roadworks diesel exhausts of the heavy equipments used emission from the production of building materials etc br Dusty materials that are not cleaned up or properly covered e g in construction sites landfills and ceramics production facilities ashes left from burning or wildfires br Metalworking e g welding br Woodworking br Glass reprocessing br Industries br Cooking frying boiling grilling br Agricultural activities e g ploughing and soil tilling br Power plants br Waste incineration br Road dust from tyre and road wear and road dust from unpaved road br Wet cooling towers in cooling systems br Various industrial processes such as mining smelting and oil refining br Disasters both natural or caused by humans e g wildfires earthquakes wars and September attacks etc br Microplastics gaining attention as a type of airborne PM br Human made anthropogenic aerosols account for about percent of the total mass of aerosols in the atmosphere as estimated in The remaining percent comes from natural sources such as volcanoes dust storms forest and grassland fires living vegetation and sea spray emitting particulates such as volcanic ash desert dust soot and sea salt br br br Domestic combustion and wood smoke br br In the United Kingdom domestic combustion is the largest single source of PM and PM annually with domestic wood burning in both closed stoves and open fires responsible for of PM in To tackle the problem some new laws were introduced since In some towns and cities in New South Wales wood smoke may be responsible for of fine particle air pollution in the winter br There are a few ways to reduce wood smoke e g buying the right wood heater and maintaining it well choosing the right firewood and burning it the right way There are also regulations in some countries where people can report smoke pollution to the local council br br br Composition br br The composition and toxicity of aerosols including particles depends on their source and atmospheric chemistry and varies widely br Wind blown mineral dust tends to be made of mineral oxides and other material blown from the Earth s crust this particulate is light absorbing Sea salt is considered the second largest contributor in the global aerosol budget and consists mainly of sodium chloride originated from sea spray other constituents of atmospheric sea salt reflect the composition of sea water and thus include magnesium sulfate calcium potassium and others In addition sea spray aerosols may contain organic compounds like fatty acids and sugars which influence their chemistry br Some secondary particles derive from the oxidation of primary gases such as sulfur and nitrogen oxides into sulfuric acid liquid and nitric acid gaseous or from biogenic emissions The precursors for these aerosols i e the gases from which they originate may have an anthropogenic origin from biomass and fossil fuel combustion as well as a natural biogenic origin In the presence of ammonia secondary aerosols often take the form of ammonium salts i e ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate both can be dry or in aqueous solution in the absence of ammonia secondary compounds take an acidic form as sulfuric acid liquid aerosol droplets and nitric acid atmospheric gas all of which probably contribute to the health effects of particulates br Secondary sulfate and nitrate aerosols are strong light scatterers This is mainly because the presence of sulfate and nitrate causes the aerosols to increase to a size that scatters light effectively br Organic matter OM found in aerosols can be either primary or secondary the latter part deriving from the oxidation of volatile organic compounds VOCs organic material in the atmosphere may either be biogenic or anthropogenic Organic matter influences the atmospheric radiation field by both scattering and absorption Some aerosols are predicted to include strongly light absorbing material and are thought to yield large positive radiative forcing Some secondary organic aerosols SOAs resulting from combustion products of internal combustion engines have been identified as a danger to health Particulate toxicity has been found to vary by region and source contribution which affects the particles chemical composition br The chemical composition of the aerosol directly affects how it interacts with solar radiation The chemical constituents within the aerosol change the overall refractive index The refractive index will determine how much light is scattered and absorbed br The composition of particulate matter that generally causes visual effects haze consists of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides carbon monoxide mineral dust and organic matter The particles are hygroscopic due to the presence of sulfur and SO is converted to sulfate when high humidity and low temperatures are present This causes reduced visibility and red orange yellow colors br br br Size distribution br br Human produced aerosols such as particle pollution tend to have a smaller radius than aerosol particles of natural origin such as windblown dust The false color maps in the map of distribution of aerosol particles on the right show where there are natural aerosols human pollution or a mixture of both monthly br br br Smaller aerosols in the North br The size distribution time series shows that in the planet s most southerly latitudes nearly all the aerosols are large but in the high northern latitudes smaller aerosols are very abundant Most of the Southern Hemisphere is covered by the ocean where the largest source of aerosols is natural sea salt from dried sea spray Because the land is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere the amount of small aerosols from fires and human activities is greater there than in the Southern Hemisphere Overland patches of large radius aerosols appear over deserts and arid regions most prominently the Sahara Desert in North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula where dust storms are common Places where human triggered or natural fire activity is common land clearing fires in the Amazon from August October for example or lightning triggered fires in the forests of northern Canada in Northern Hemisphere summer are dominated by smaller aerosols Human produced fossil fuel pollution is largely responsible for the areas of small aerosols over developed areas such as the eastern United States and Europe especially in their summer br Satellite measurements of aerosols called aerosol optical thickness are based on the fact that the particles change the way the atmosphere reflects and absorbs visible and infrared light As shown in this page an optical thickness of less than palest yellow indicates a crystal clear sky with maximum visibility whereas a value of reddish brown indicates very hazy conditions br br br Deposition processes br br In general the smaller and lighter a particle is the longer it will stay in the air Larger particles greater than micrometers in diameter tend to settle to the ground by gravity in a matter of hours The smallest particles less than micrometer can stay in the atmosphere for weeks and are mostly removed by precipitation There are evidence that aerosols can travel across the ocean For example in September wildfires burning across the western United States and Canada and the smoke was found to have arrived over the United Kingdom and northern France in three days as shown by satellite images Diesel particulate matter is highest near the source of emission Any information regarding DPM and the atmosphere flora height and distance from major sources is useful to determine health effects br br br Control br br br Technologies br br Particulate matter emissions are highly regulated in most industrialized countries Due to environmental concerns most industries are required to operate some kind of dust collection system These systems include inertial collectors cyclonic separators fabric filter collectors baghouses electrostatic filters used in facemasks wet scrubbers and electrostatic precipitators br Cyclonic separators are useful for removing large coarse particles and are often employed as a first step or pre cleaner to other more efficient collectors Well designed cyclonic separators can be very efficient in removing even fine particulates and may be operated continuously without requiring frequent shutdowns for maintenance br Fabric filters or baghouses are the most commonly employed in general industry They work by forcing dust laden air through a bag shaped fabric filter leaving the particulate to collect on the outer surface of the bag and allowing the now clean air to pass through to either be exhausted into the atmosphere or in some cases recirculated into the facility Common fabrics include polyester and fiberglass and common fabric coatings include PTFE commonly known as Teflon The excess dust buildup is then cleaned from the bags and removed from the collector br br Wet scrubbers pass the dirty air through a scrubbing solution usually a mixture of water and other compounds allowing the particulate to attach to the liquid molecules Electrostatic precipitators electrically charge the dirty air as it passes through The now charged air then passes through large electrostatic plates which attract the charged particle in the airstream collecting them and leaving the now clean air to be exhausted or recirculated br br br Measures br For general building construction some places that have acknowledged the possible health risks of construction dust for decades legally require the relevant contractor to adopt effective dust control measures although inspections fines and imprisonments are rare in recent years for example two prosecutions with a total fines of HKD in Hong Kong in the year br Some of the mandatory dust control measures include load unload handle transfer store or dispose of cement or dry pulverized fuel ash in a completely enclosed system or facility and fit any vent or exhaust with an effective fabric filter or equivalent air pollution control system or equipment enclose the scaffolding of the building with dust screens use impervious sheeting to enclose both material hoist and debris chute wet debris with water before it is dumped into a debris chute have water sprayed on the facade surface before and during grinding work use grinder equipped with vacuum cleaner for facade grinding work spray water continuously on the surface for any pneumatic or power driven drilling cutting polishing or other mechanical breaking operation that causes dust emission unless there is the operation of an effective dust extraction and filtering device provide hoarding of not less than m in height along the whole length of the site boundary have hard paving on open area and wash every vehicle that leaves the construction sites Use of automatic sprinkler equipment automatic carwash equipment and installation of video surveillance system for the pollution control facilities and retain the videos for one month for future inspections br Besides removing particulates from the source of pollution they may also be cleaned in the open air e g smog tower moss wall and water truck while other control measures employ the use of barriers br br br Measurement br br Particulates have been measured in increasingly sophisticated ways since air pollution was first systematically studied in the early th century The earliest methods included relatively crude Ringelmann charts which were grey shaded cards against which emissions from smokestacks could be visually compared and deposit gauges which collected the soot deposited in a particular location so it could be weighed Automated modern methods of measuring particulates include optical photodetectors tapered element oscillating microbalances and Aethalometers Besides measuring the total mass of particles per unit volume of air particle mass concentration sometimes it is more useful to measure the total number of particles per unit volume of air particle number concentration This can be done by using a condensation particle counter CPC br To measure the atomic composition of particulate samples techniques such as X ray spectrometry can be used br br br Climate effects br br Atmospheric aerosols affect the climate of the Earth by changing the amount of incoming solar radiation and outgoing terrestrial longwave radiation retained in the Earth s system This occurs through several distinct mechanisms which are split into direct indirect and semi direct aerosol effects The aerosol climate effects are the biggest source of uncertainty in future climate predictions The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC stated in While the radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases may be determined to a reasonably high degree of accuracy the uncertainties relating to aerosol radiative forcings remain large and rely to a large extent on the estimates from global modeling studies that are difficult to verify at the present time br br br Aerosol radiative br br br Direct br br The direct aerosol effect consists of any direct interaction of radiation with atmospheric aerosols such as absorption or scattering It affects both short and longwave radiation to produce a net negative radiative forcing The magnitude of the resultant radiative forcing due to the direct effect of an aerosol is dependent on the albedo of the underlying surface as this affects the net amount of radiation absorbed or scattered to space For example if a highly scattering aerosol is above a surface of low albedo it has a greater radiative forcing than if it was above a surface of high albedo The converse is true of absorbing aerosol with the greatest radiative forcing arising from a highly absorbing aerosol over a surface of high albedo The direct aerosol effect is a first order effect and is therefore classified as a radiative forcing by the IPCC The interaction of an aerosol with radiation is quantified by the single scattering albedo SSA the ratio of scattering alone to scattering plus absorption extinction of radiation by a particle The SSA tends to unity if scattering dominates with relatively little absorption and decreases as absorption increases becoming zero for infinite absorption For example the sea salt aerosol has an SSA of as a sea salt particle only scatters whereas soot has an SSA of showing that it is a major atmospheric aerosol absorber br br br Indirect br The Indirect aerosol effect consists of any change to the Earth s radiative budget due to the modification of clouds by atmospheric aerosols and consists of several distinct effects Cloud droplets form onto pre existing aerosol particles known as cloud condensation nuclei CCN Droplets condensing around human produced aerosols such as found in particulate pollution tend to be smaller and more numerous than those forming around aerosol particles of natural origin such as windblown dust br For any given meteorological conditions an increase in CCN leads to an increase in the number of cloud droplets This leads to more scattering of shortwave radiation i e an increase in the albedo of the cloud known as the cloud albedo effect First indirect effect or Twomey effect Evidence supporting the cloud albedo effect has been observed from the effects of ship exhaust plumes and biomass burning on cloud albedo compared to ambient clouds The Cloud albedo aerosol effect is a first order effect and therefore classified as a radiative forcing by the IPCC br An increase in cloud droplet number due to the introduction of aerosol acts to reduce the cloud droplet size as the same amount of water is divided into more droplets This has the effect of suppressing precipitation increasing the cloud lifetime known as the cloud lifetime aerosol effect second indirect effect or Albrecht effect This has been observed as the suppression of drizzle in ship exhaust plume compared to ambient clouds and inhibited precipitation in biomass burning plumes This cloud lifetime effect is classified as a climate feedback rather than a radiative forcing by the IPCC due to the interdependence between it and the hydrological cycle However it has previously been classified as a negative radiative forcing br br br Semi direct br The Semi direct effect concerns any radiative effect caused by absorbing atmospheric aerosol such as soot apart from direct scattering and absorption which is classified as the direct effect It encompasses many individual mechanisms and in general is more poorly defined and understood than the direct and indirect aerosol effects For instance if absorbing aerosols are present in a layer aloft in the atmosphere they can heat surrounding air which inhibits the condensation of water vapour resulting in less cloud formation Additionally heating a layer of the atmosphere relative to the surface results in a more stable atmosphere due to the inhibition of atmospheric convection This inhibits the convective uplift of moisture which in turn reduces cloud formation The heating of the atmosphere aloft also leads to a cooling of the surface resulting in less evaporation of surface water The effects described here all lead to a reduction in cloud cover i e an increase in planetary albedo The semi direct effect classified as a climate feedback by the IPCC due to the interdependence between it and the hydrological cycle However it has previously been classified as a negative radiative forcing br br br Specific aerosol roles br br br Sulfate br br Sulfate aerosols are mostly inorganic sulfur compounds like SO HSO and H SO which are mainly produced when sulfur dioxide reacts with water vapor to form gaseous sulfuric acid and various salts often through an oxidation reaction in the clouds which are then thought to experience hygroscopic growth and coagulation and then shrink through evaporation Some of them are biogenic typically produced via atmospheric chemical reactions with dimethyl sulfide from mostly marine plankton or geological via volcanoes or weather driven from wildfires and other natural combustion events but in the recent decades anthropogenic sulfate aerosols produced through combustion of fossil fuels with a high sulfur content primarily coal and certain less refined fuels like aviation and bunker fuel had dominated By global human caused emissions of sulfur into the atmosphere became at least as large as all natural emissions of sulfur containing compounds combined and were at least times more numerous than the natural aerosols in the most polluted regions of Europe and North America where they accounted for or more of all air pollution This led to acid rain and also contributed to heart and lung conditions and even the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight Sulfate pollution also has a complex relationship with NOx pollution and ozone reducing the also harmful ground level ozone yet capable of damaging the stratospheric ozone layer as well br br Once the problem became clear the efforts to remove this pollution through flue gas desulfurization measures and other pollution controls were largely successful reducing their prevalence by and causing healthcare savings valued at billion annually in the United States alone Yet around the same time research had shown that sulfate aerosols were affecting both the visible light received by the Earth and its surface temperature and as the so called global dimming began to reverse in the s in line with the reduced anthropogenic sulfate pollution climate change accelerated As of state of the art CMIP models estimate that total cooling from the currently present aerosols is between C F to C F the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report uses the best estimate of C F with the uncertainty mainly caused by contradictory research on the impacts of aerosols of clouds Some are certain that they cool the planet though and this led to solar geoengineering proposals known as stratospheric aerosol injection which seeks to replicate and enhance the cooling from sulfate pollution while minimizing the negative effects on health through deploying in the stratosphere where only a fraction of the current sulfur pollution would be needed to avoid multiple degrees of warming but the assessment of costs and benefits remains incomplete even with hundreds of studies into the subject completed by the early s br br br Black carbon br Black carbon BC or carbon black or elemental carbon EC often called soot is composed of pure carbon clusters skeleton balls and fullerenes and is one of the most important absorbing aerosol species in the atmosphere It should be distinguished from organic carbon OC clustered or aggregated organic molecules on their own or permeating an EC buckyball Black carbon from fossil fuels is estimated by the IPCC in the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC AR to contribute a global mean radiative forcing of W m was W m in the Second Assessment Report of the IPCC SAR with a range to W m A study published in however states that the best estimate for the industrial era to direct radiative forcing of atmospheric black carbon is W m with uncertainty bounds of W m with total direct forcing by all black carbon sources without subtracting the preindustrial background is estimated as W m br br br Instances br br Volcanoes are a large natural source of aerosol and have been linked to changes in the Earth s climate often with consequences for the human population Eruptions linked to changes in climate include the eruption of Huaynaputina which was linked to the Russian famine of leading to the deaths of two million and the eruption of Mount Pinatubo which caused a global cooling of approximately C lasting several years Research tracking the effect of light scattering aerosols in the stratosphere during and and comparing its pattern to volcanic activity show a close correlation Simulations of the effect of anthropogenic particles showed little influence at present levels br Aerosols are also thought to affect weather and climate on a regional scale The failure of the Indian monsoon has been linked to the suppression of evaporation of water from the Indian Ocean due to the semi direct effect of anthropogenic aerosol br Recent studies of the Sahel drought and major increases since in rainfall in Australia over the Northern Territory Kimberley Pilbara and around the Nullarbor Plain have led some scientists to conclude that the aerosol haze over South and East Asia has been steadily shifting tropical rainfall in both hemispheres southward br br br Health effects br br br Size shape and solubility matter br br br Size br Particle size is the main determinant of where in the respiratory tract it will come to rest when inhaled Larger particles are generally filtered in the nose and throat via cilia and mucus but particulate matter smaller than about micrometers can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems The micrometer size does not represent a strict boundary between respirable and non respirable particles but has been agreed upon for monitoring of airborne PM by most regulatory agencies Because of their small size particles on the order of micrometers or less coarse particulate matter PM can penetrate the deepest part of the lungs such as the bronchioles or alveoli When asthmatics are exposed to these conditions it can trigger bronchoconstriction br Similarly fine particulate matter PM tends to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung alveoli and very small particles ultrafine particulate matter PM may pass through the lungs to affect other organs Penetration of particles is not wholly dependent on their size shape and chemical composition also play a part To avoid this complication simple nomenclature is used to indicate the different degrees of relative penetration of a PM particle into the cardiovascular system Inhalable particles penetrate no further than the bronchi as they are filtered out by the cilia Thoracic particles can penetrate right into terminal bronchioles whereas PM which can penetrate to alveoli the gas exchange area and hence the circulatory system are termed respirable particles br In analogy the inhalable dust fraction is the fraction of dust entering the nose and mouth which may be deposited anywhere in the respiratory tract The thoracic fraction is the fraction that enters the thorax and is deposited within the lung s airways The respirable fraction is what is deposited in the gas exchange regions alveoli br The smallest particles nanoparticles which are less than nanometers in size may be even more damaging to the cardiovascular system Nanoparticles can pass through cell membranes and migrate into other organs including the brain Particles emitted from modern diesel engines commonly referred to as Diesel Particulate Matter or DPM are typically in the size range of nanometers micrometers These soot particles also carry carcinogens like benzopyrenes adsorbed on their surface br Particulate mass is not a proper measure of the health hazard A particle of m diameter has approximately the same mass as million particles of nm diameter but is much less hazardous as it is unlikely to enter the alveoli Legislative limits for engine emissions based on mass are therefore not protective Proposals for new regulations exist in some countries with suggestions to limit the particle surface area or the particle count numerical quantity particle number concentration PNC instead br br br Solubility br The site and extent of absorption of inhaled gases and vapors are determined by their solubility in water Absorption is also dependent upon air flow rates and the partial pressure of the gases in the inspired air The fate of a specific contaminant is dependent upon the form in which it exists aerosol or particulate Inhalation also depends upon the breathing rate of the subject br br br Shape br Another complexity not entirely documented is how the shape of PM can affect health except for the needle like shape of asbestos fibres which can lodge in the lungs Geometrically angular shapes have more surface area than rounder shapes which in turn affects the binding capacity of the particle to other possibly more dangerous substances The table below lists the colours and shapes of some common atmospheric particulates br br br Composition quantity and duration are important br br Composition of particles can vary greatly depending on their sources and how they are produced For example dust emitted from the burning of living and dead vegetation would be different from those emitted from the burning of joss paper or construction wastes Particles emitted from fuel combustion are not the same as those emitted from waste combustion The particulate matter generated from the fire of a recycling yard or a ship full of scrap metal may contain more toxic substances than other types of burning br Different types of building refurbishment activities produce different kinds of dust too The composition of PM generated from cutting or mixing concrete made with Portland Cement would be different from those generated from cutting or mixing concrete made with different types of slag e g GGBFS EAF slag fly ash or even EAF dust EAFD while EFAD slag and fly ash are likely to be more toxic as they contain heavy metals Besides slag cement that is sold and used as an environmental friendly product fake adulterated cement where different types of slag fly ash or other unknown substances are added is also very common in some places due to the much lower production cost To address to the quality and toxicity problems some places are starting to ban the use of EAF slag in cement used in buildings Composition of welding fumes varies a lot as well and it depends on the metals in the material being welded the composition of the coatings electrode etc and hence a lot of health problems e g lead poisoning metal Fume Fever cancers nausea irritation kidney and liver damage central nervous system problems asthma pneumonia etc can be resulted from the different types of toxic emissions br Studies have found that blood lead levels of people in China are highly correlated to ambient PM concentration as well as top soil lead content indicating that air and soil e g by the inhalation of resuspended soil particles consuming of contaminated crops or water etc are important sources of lead exposure br Besides composition quantity and duration of exposure are also important since they would affect the triggering and severity of a disease Particles that get into indoor would directly affect indoor air quality Possible secondary contamination similar to third hand smoke is also of concern br In a nutshell while background concentration is important only improvement in air quality or decrease in ambient concentration of PM do not necessarily mean better health The health impact mainly depends on the toxicity or source of the particulate matter a person is exposed to the amount he is exposed to and for how long and also the size shape and solubility of the PM br Since construction and refurbishment projects are prominent sources of particulate matter it implicates that such projects which are very common in some places should be avoided in health facilities that already commenced and under operation as far as possible For inevitable projects better plannings and mitigation measures regarding PM emission should be introduced Use of power tools heavy equipments diesel fuels and potentially toxic building materials e g concrete metals solder paint etc should be strictly monitored to ensure that patients who are there seeking for disease treatments or chances to survive are not adversely affected br br br Health problems br br The effects of inhaling particulate matter that have been widely studied in humans and animals include COVID asthma lung cancer respiratory diseases like silicosis br br cardiovascular disease premature delivery birth defects low birth weight developmental disorders neurodegenerative disorders mental disorders and premature death Outdoor fine particulates with diameter less than microns accounts for million annual deaths worldwide and more than million disability adjusted life years lost making it the fifth leading risk factor for death Air pollution has also been linked to a range of other psychosocial problems Particulates may cause tissue damage by entering organs directly or indirectly by systemic inflammation Adverse effects may occur even at exposure levels lower than published air quality standards deemed safe br br br Anthropogenic fine particulates as main hazard br br Increased levels of fine particles in the air as a result of anthropogenic particulate air pollution is consistently and independently related to the most serious effects including lung cancer and other cardiopulmonary mortality The association between a large number of deaths and other health problems and particulate pollution was first demonstrated in the early s and has been reproduced many times since PM pollution is estimated to cause deaths per year in the United States from contributed to premature deaths in Europe during and million deaths globally in per the global burden of disease collaboration A study by the European Environment Agency estimates that people have died prematurely in due to fine particle pollution in the EU member states br A study in conducted in the U S explored how fine particulate matter may be more harmful than coarse particulate matter The study was based on six different cities They found that deaths and hospital visits that were caused by particulate matter in the air were primarily due to fine particulate matter Similarly a study of American air pollution data found that fine particles and sulfates as opposed to coarser particles most consistently and significantly correlated to total annual mortality rates in standard metropolitan statistical areas br A study published in in GeoHealth concluded that eliminating energy related fossil fuel emissions in the United States would prevent premature deaths each year and provide billion in benefits from avoided PM related illness and death br br br Infertility pregnancy fetuses and birth defects br Higher rates of infertility have been correlated with exposure to particulates Maternal PM exposure during pregnancy is also associated with high blood pressure in children br Inhalation of PM PM is associated with elevated risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight Exposure to PM has been associated with greater reductions in birth weight than exposure to PM PM exposure can cause inflammation oxidative stress endocrine disruption and impaired oxygen transport access to the placenta all of which are mechanisms for heightening the risk of low birth weight Overall epidemiologic and toxicological evidence suggests that a causal relationship exists between long term exposures to PM and developmental outcomes i e low birth weight Studies investigating the significance of trimester specific exposure have proven to be inconclusive and results of international studies have been inconsistent in drawing associations of prenatal particulate matter exposure and low birth weight As perinatal outcomes have been associated with lifelong health and exposure to particulate matter is widespread this issue is of critical public health importance br br br Cardiovascular and respiratory disease br br PM leads to high plaque deposits in arteries causing vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis a hardening of the arteries that reduces elasticity which can lead to heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems A meta analysis reported that long term exposure to particulate matter is linked to coronary events The study included cohorts participating in the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects ESCAPE with participants followed for an average of years An increase in estimated annual exposure to PM of just g m was linked with a increased risk of heart attacks Not only affecting human cells and tissues PM also impacts bacteria which cause disease in humans Biofilm formation antibiotic tolerance and colonisation of both Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae was altered by black carbon exposure br The largest US study on acute health effects of coarse particle pollution between and micrometers in diameter was published and found an association with hospital admissions for cardiovascular diseases but no evidence of an association with the number of hospital admissions for respiratory diseases After taking into account fine particle levels PM and less the association with coarse particles remained but was no longer statistically significant which means the effect is due to the subsection of fine particles br The Mongolian government agency recorded a increase in the rate of respiratory illness in the past five years reported in Bronchial asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial pneumonia were the most common ailments treated by area hospitals Levels of premature death chronic bronchitis and cardiovascular disease are increasing at a rapid rate br br br Cognitive hazards and mental health br br The effects of air pollution and particulate matter on cognitive performance has become an active area of research br Air pollution may increase the risk of developmental disorders e g autism neurodegenerative disorders mental disorders and suicide although studies on the link between depression and some air pollutants are not consistent At least one study has identified the abundant presence in the human brain of magnetite nanoparticles that match precisely the high temperature magnetite nanospheres formed by combustion and or friction derived heating which are prolific in urban airborne particulate matter PM br Particulates also appear to have a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer s disease and premature brain aging There is increasing evidence to suggest a correlation between PM exposure and the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s Several epidemiological studies have suggested a link between PM exposure and cognitive decline particularly in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer s br Using geospatial analytical techniques NIEHS funded researchers were able to confirm a strong association between cases of Parkinson s disease and fine particulate matter known as PM across the U S In the study regions of the country with a high rate of Parkinson s disease were associated generally with higher levels of PM of which sources include motor vehicles wildfires and power plants While the exact mechanisms behind the link between PM exposure and cognitive decline are not fully understood research suggests that the fine particles may be able to enter the brain through the olfactory nerve and cause inflammation and oxidative stress which can damage brain cells and contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases br br br Increased death br The World Health Organization WHO estimated in that fine particulate air pollution PM causes about of mortality from cardiopulmonary disease about of mortality from cancer of the trachea bronchus and lung and about of mortality from acute respiratory infections in children under years worldwide A study concluded that traffic exhaust is the single most serious preventable cause of heart attack in the general public the cause of of all attacks br Particulate matter studies in Bangkok Thailand from indicated a increased risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and risk of all disease for every micrograms per cubic meter Levels averaged in in and in Decreasing levels may be attributed to conversions of diesel to natural gas combustion as well as improved regulations br br br Racial disparities br There have been many studies linking race to increased proximity to particulate matter and thus susceptibility to adverse health effects of long term exposure A U S study showed that the proportions of Black residents in a tract was linked to higher asthma rates Many scholars link this disproportionality to racial housing segregation and their respective inequalities in toxic exposures This reality is made worse by the finding that health care occurs in the context of broader historic and contemporary social and economic inequality and persistent racial and ethnic discrimination in many sectors of American life Residential proximity to particulate emitting facilities increases exposure to PM which is linked to increased morbidity and mortality rates Multiple studies confirm the burden of PM emissions is higher among non White and poverty ridden populations though some say that income does not drive these differences This correlation between race and housing related health repercussions stems from a longstanding environmental justice problem linked to the practice of historic redlining An example of these factors contextualized is an area of Southeastern Louisiana colloquially dubbed Cancer Alley for its high concentration of cancer related deaths due to neighboring chemical plants Cancer Alley being a majority African American community with the neighborhood nearest to the plant being Black perpetuates the scientific narrative that Black populations are located disproportionately closer to areas of high PM output than White populations A article relates the long term health effects of living in high PM concentrations to increased risk spread and mortality rates from the SARS CoV or COVID and faults a history of racism for this outcome br br br Wildfire smoke risk br In regions where wildfires are persistent the risk of particulate exposure increased Smoke from wildfires may impact sensitive groups such as the elderly children pregnant women and people with lung and cardiovascular disease It was found that in the wildfire season in California the particulate matter was much more toxic to human lungs as increased neutrophil infiltrate cell influx and edema was observed versus particulate matter from ambient air Furthermore particulate matter from wildfires have been linked to be a triggering factor of acute coronary events such as ischemic heart disease Wildfires also have been associated with increased emergency department visits due to particulate matter exposure as well as an increased risk of asthma related events A link between PM from wildfires and increased risk of hospitalizations for cardiopulmonary diseases has been discovered Evidence also suggest wildfire smoke reduces mental performance br br br Energy industry knowledge and response to adverse health effects br br Major energy companies understood at least since the s that use of their products causes widespread adverse health effects and death but continued aggressive political lobbying in the United States and elsewhere against clean air regulation and launched major corporate propaganda campaigns to sow doubt regarding the causative link between the burning of fossil fuels and major risks to human life Internal company memoranda reveal that energy industry scientists and executives knew that air pollutants created by fossil fuels lodge deep in human lung tissue and cause birth defects in children of oil industry workers The industry memos acknowledge that automobiles are by far the greatest sources of air pollution and also that air pollution causes adverse health effects and lodges toxins including carcinogens deep into the lungs which would otherwise be removed in the throat br In response to mounting public concern the industry eventually created the Global Climate Coalition an industry lobby group to derail governments attempts to regulate air pollution and to create confusion in the public mind about the necessity of such regulation Similar lobbying and corporate public relations efforts were undertaken by the American Petroleum Institute a trade association of the oil and gas industry and the climate change denier private think tank The Heartland Institute The response from fossil fuel interests has been from the same playbook first they know then they scheme then they deny and then they delay They ve fallen back on delay subtle forms of propaganda and the undermining of regulation said Geoffrey Supran a Harvard University researcher of the history of fossil fuel companies and climate change These efforts have been compared by policy analysts such as Carroll Muffett of the Center for International Environmental Law to the tobacco industry strategy of lobbying and corporate propaganda campaigns to create doubt regarding the causal connection between cigarette smoking and cancer and to forestall its regulation In addition industry funded advocates when appointed to senior government positions in the United States have revised scientific findings showing the deadly effects of air pollution and have rolled back its regulation br br br Effects on vegetation br br Particulate matter can clog stomatal openings of plants and interfere with photosynthesis functions In this manner high particulate matter concentrations in the atmosphere can lead to growth stunting or mortality in some plant species br br br Regulation br Most governments have created regulations both for the emissions allowed from certain types of pollution sources motor vehicles industrial emissions etc and for the ambient concentration of particulates The IARC and WHO designate particulates a Group carcinogen Particulates are the deadliest form of air pollution due to their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and blood streams unfiltered causing respiratory diseases heart attacks and premature death In the ESCAPE study involving people in nine European countries revealed that there was no safe level of particulates and that for every increase of g m in PM the lung cancer rate rose For PM there was a increase in lung cancer per g m In a meta analysis of studies globally including the ESCAPE data for every increase of g m in PM the lung cancer rate rose br br br Limits standards set by governments br br br Canada br In Canada the standard for particulate matter is set nationally by the federal provincial Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment CCME Jurisdictions provinces and territories may set more stringent standards The CCME standard for particulate matter PM as of is g m calculated using the year average of the annual th percentile of the daily hr average concentrations and g m year average of annual mean PM standards will increase in stringency in br br br European Union br The European Union has established the European emission standards which include limits for particulates in the air br br br United Kingdom br To mitigate the problem of wood burning starting from May traditional house coal bituminous coal and wet wood two of the most polluting fuels can no longer be sold Wood sold in volumes of less than m must be certified as Ready to Burn which means it has a moisture content of or less Manufactured solid fuels must also be certified as Ready to Burn to ensure they meet sulphur and smoke emission limits Starting from January all new wood burning stoves have to meet new EcoDesign standards Ecodesign stoves produce times more toxic air pollution than gas central heating Older stoves which are now banned from sale produce times more br In the amount of smoke that

criminal record br br br United States br br The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA has set standards for PM and PM concentrations See National Ambient Air Quality Standards br br br California br br In October the Department of Toxic Substances Control DTSC within the California Environmental Protection Agency announced its intent to request information regarding analytical test methods fate and transport in the environment and other relevant information from manufacturers of carbon nanotubes DTSC is exercising its authority under the California Health and Safety Code Chapter sections These sections were added as a result of the adoption of Assembly Bill AB They are intended to make information on the fate and transport detection and analysis and other information on chemicals more available The law places the responsibility to provide this information to the department on those who manufacture or import the chemicals br On January a formal information request letter was sent to manufacturers who produce or import carbon nanotubes in California or who may export carbon nanotubes into the State This letter constitutes the first formal implementation of the authorities placed into statute by AB and is directed to manufacturers of carbon nanotubes both industry and academia within the State and to manufacturers outside California who export carbon nanotubes to California This request for information must be met by the manufacturers within one year DTSC is waiting for the upcoming January deadline for responses to the data call in br The California Nano Industry Network and DTSC hosted a full day symposium on November in Sacramento California This symposium provided an opportunity to hear from nanotechnology industry experts and discuss future regulatory considerations in California br DTSC is expanding the Specific Chemical Information Call in to members of the nanometal oxides the latest information can be found on their website br br br Colorado br br Key points in the Colorado Plan include reducing emission levels and solutions by sector Agriculture transportation green electricity and renewable energy research are the main concepts and goals in this plan Political programs such as mandatory vehicle emissions testing and the prohibition of smoking indoors are actions taken by local government to create public awareness and participation in cleaner air The location of Denver next to the Rocky Mountains and wide expanse of plains makes the metro area of Colorado s capital city a likely place for smog and visible air pollution br br br Affected areas br br To analyse the air pollution trend cities around the world Ukraine excluded was mapped by air experts to calculate the average PM level of the first nine months of against that of Average levels of PM were measured using aqicn org s World Air Quality Index data and a formula developed by AirNow was used to convert the PM figure into micrograms per cubic meter of air g m values br Among the capital cities investigated Baghdad Iraq is the worst performing one with PM levels going up g m Ulan Bator Ulaanbaatar the capital city of Mongolia is performing the best with PM levels dropping by g m Previously it was as one of the most polluted capital cities in the world An air quality improvement plan in appears to be showing positive results br Out of the cities Dammam in Saudi Arabia is performing the worst with PM levels going up g m The city is a significant center for the Saudi oil industry and home to both the largest airport in the world and the largest port in the Persian Gulf It is currently the most polluted city surveyed br In Europe the worst performing cities are located in Spain They are Salamanca and Palma with PM levels increase by g m and g m respectively The best performing city is Skopje the capital city of North Macedonia with PM levels dropping by g m It was once the most polluted capital city in Europe and still has a long way to go to achieve clean air br In the U S Salt Lake City Utah and Miami Florida are the two cities with the highest PM level increases g m Salt Lake City suffers from a weather event known as inversion Located in a valley cooler polluted air is trapped close to ground level under the warmer air above when inversion occurs On the other hand Omaha Nebraska is performing the best and has a decrease of g m in PM levels br The cleanest city in this report is Z rich Switzerland with PM levels of just g m placed first in both and The second cleanest city is Perth with g m and PM levels dropping by g m since Of the top ten cleanest cities five are from Australia They are Hobart Wollongong Launceston Sydney and Perth Honolulu is the only U S city in the top ten list ranking tenth with levels of g m with a tiny increase since br Almost all of the top ten most polluted cities are in the Middle East and Asia The worst is Dammam in Saudi Arabia with a PM level of g m Lahore in Pakistan is the second worst with g m The third is Dubai home to the world s tallest building In the bottom ten are three cities from India Muzaffarnagar Delhi and New Delhi Here is a list of the most polluted cities by PM Jan to Sep br br There are limits to the above survey For example not every city in the world is covered and that the number of monitoring stations for each city would not be the same The data is for reference only br br br Australia br PM pollution in coal mining areas in Australia such as the Latrobe Valley in Victoria and the Hunter Region in New South Wales significantly increased during to Although the increase did not significantly add to non attainment statistics the rate of increase has risen each year during to br br br China br br Some cities in Northern China and South Asia have had concentrations above g m The PM levels in Chinese cities were extreme between reaching an all time high in Beijing on January of g m but has been improving thanks to clean air actions br To monitor the air quality of south China the U S Consulate Guangzhou set a PM and PM monitor on Shamian Island in Guangzhou and displays readings on its official website and social platforms br br br Europe br br br Italy br br br South Korea br As of South Korea has the worst air pollution among the developed nations in the OECD Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development According to a study conducted by NASA and NIER of PM measured in Olympic Park Seoul in May and June came from local emissions The rest was trans boundary pollution coming from China s Shandong Province North Korea Beijing Shanghai and a combined from China s Liaoning Province Japan and the West Sea In December the environmental ministers from South Korea and China signed the China Korea Environmental Cooperation Plan a five year plan to jointly solve issues in the air water soil and waste An environmental cooperation centre was also launched in to aid cooperation br br br Thailand br Air quality of Thailand is getting worse in which is described as a post COVID back to normal situation In addition to the capital Bangkok air quality in Chiang Mai a popular tourist destination is also deteriorating Chiang Mai was listed as the most polluted city in a live ranking by a Swiss air quality company on March The ranking includes data from about world cities for which measured PM data is available br br br Ulaanbaatar br Mongolia s capital city Ulaanbaatar has an annual average mean temperature of about C making it the world s coldest capital city About of the population lives in apartments of which are supplied with central heating systems from three combined heat and power plants In the power plants consumed almost million tons of coal The pollution control technology is in poor condition br The other of the population reside in shantytowns Ger districts which have developed due to the country s new market economy and the very cold winter seasons The poor in these districts cook and heat their wood houses with indoor stoves fueled by wood or coal The resulting air pollution is characterized by raised sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide levels and very high concentrations of airborne particles and particulate matter PM br Annual seasonal average particulate matter concentrations have been recorded as high as g m micrograms per cubic meter The World Health Organization s recommended annual mean PM level is g m which means that Ulaanbaatar s PM annual mean levels are times higher than recommended br During the winter months in particular the air pollution obscures the air affecting the visibility in the city to such an extent that airplanes on some occasions are prevented from landing at the airport br In addition to stack emissions another source unaccounted for in the emission inventory is fly ash from ash ponds the final disposal place for fly ash that has been collected in settling tanks Ash ponds are continually eroded by wind during the winter br br br United States br br br br br br br br br br br From the State of Air report compiled by the American Lung Association using data from the U S Environmental Protection Agency from to California cities are the most polluted cities by PM in the U S while the East Coast is cleaner br However another study has come up with a very different conclusion According to Forbes a travel insurance comparison site InsureMyTrip conducted a survey of U S cities in and ranked them by cleanliness with criteria like hand sanitizer demand cleanliness of restaurants quantity of recycling collectors satisfaction of garbage disposal electric vehicle market share and pollution On their top ten cleanest cities list seven are from California including Long Beach No San Diego No Sacramento No San Jose No Oakland No Bakersfield No and San Francisco No The discrepancies maybe due to the differences in data choice calculation methods definitions of cleanliness and a large variation of air quality across the same state etc This again shows that one need to be very careful when drawing conclusions from the many air quality rankings available on the internet br In mid air quality in eastern U S lowered significantly as particulates from Canada s wildfires blew down According to NASA some of the fires were ignited by lightning br br br See
