Nitrous oxide dinitrogen oxide or dinitrogen monoxide commonly known as laughing gas nitrous nitro or nos is a chemical compound an oxide of nitrogen with the formula N O At room temperature it is a colourless non flammable gas and has a slightly sweet scent and taste At elevated temperatures nitrous oxide is a powerful oxidiser similar to molecular oxygen br Nitrous oxide has significant medical uses especially in surgery and dentistry for its anaesthetic and pain reducing effects Its colloquial name laughing gas coined by Humphry Davy is due to the euphoric effects upon inhaling it a property that has led to its recreational use as a dissociative anaesthetic It is on the World Health Organization s List of Essential Medicines It is also used as an oxidiser in rocket propellants and in motor racing to increase the power output of engines br Nitrous oxide s atmospheric concentration reached parts per billion ppb in increasing at a rate of about ppb annually It is a major scavenger of stratospheric ozone with an impact comparable to that of CFCs About of human caused emissions are from agriculture Nitrogen is added to the soil via animal urine and dung and synthetic fertilisers micro organisms then release it in nitrous oxide Being the third most important greenhouse gas nitrous oxide substantially contributes to global warming Reduction of emissions is a popular topic in the politics of climate change br Nitrous oxide is used as a propellant and has a variety of applications from rocketry to making whipped cream It is used as a recreational drug for its potential to induce a brief high When used chronically nitrous oxide has the potential to cause neurological damage through inactivation of vitamin B br br br Uses br br br Rocket motors br Nitrous oxide may be used as an oxidiser in a rocket motor It has advantages over other oxidisers in that it is much less toxic and because of its stability at room temperature it is also easier to store and relatively safe to carry on a flight As a secondary benefit it may be decomposed readily to form breathing air Its high density and low storage pressure when maintained at low temperatures enable it to be highly competitive with stored high pressure gas systems br In a patent American rocket pioneer Robert Goddard suggested nitrous oxide and gasoline as possible propellants for a liquid fuelled rocket Nitrous oxide has been the oxidiser of choice in several hybrid rocket designs using solid fuel with a liquid or gaseous oxidiser The combination of nitrous oxide with hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene fuel has been used by SpaceShipOne and others It also is notably used in amateur and high power rocketry with various plastics as the fuel br Nitrous oxide also may be used in a monopropellant rocket In the presence of a heated catalyst N O will decompose exothermically into nitrogen and oxygen at a temperature of approximately F C Because of the large heat release the catalytic action rapidly becomes secondary as thermal autodecomposition becomes dominant In a vacuum thruster this may provide a monopropellant specific impulse Isp of as much as s While noticeably less than the Isp available from hydrazine thrusters monopropellant or bipropellant with dinitrogen tetroxide the decreased toxicity makes nitrous oxide an option worth investigating br Nitrous oxide is said to deflagrate at approximately C F at a pressure of psi atmospheres At psi for example the required ignition energy is only joules whereas N O at psi a joule ignition energy input is insufficient br br br Internal combustion engine br br In vehicle racing nitrous oxide often called nitrous allows the engine to burn more fuel by providing more oxygen during combustion The increase in oxygen allows an increase in the injection of fuel allowing the engine to produce more engine power The gas is not flammable at a low pressure temperature but it delivers more oxygen than atmospheric air by breaking down at elevated temperatures about degrees F C Therefore it often is mixed with another fuel that is easier to deflagrate Nitrous oxide is a strong oxidising agent roughly equivalent to hydrogen peroxide and much stronger than oxygen gas br Nitrous oxide is stored as a compressed liquid the evaporation and expansion of liquid nitrous oxide in the intake manifold causes a large drop in intake charge temperature resulting in a denser charge further allowing more air fuel mixture to enter the cylinder Sometimes nitrous oxide is injected into or prior to the intake manifold whereas other systems directly inject right before the cylinder direct port injection to increase power br The technique was used during World War II by Luftwaffe aircraft with the GM system to boost the power output of aircraft engines Originally meant to provide the Luftwaffe standard aircraft with superior high altitude performance technological considerations limited its use to extremely high altitudes Accordingly it was only used by specialised planes such as high altitude reconnaissance aircraft high speed bombers and high altitude interceptor aircraft It sometimes could be found on Luftwaffe aircraft also fitted with another engine boost system MW a form of water injection for aviation engines that used methanol for its boost capabilities br One of the major problems of using nitrous oxide in a reciprocating engine is that it can produce enough power to damage or destroy the engine Very large power increases are possible and if the mechanical structure of the engine is not properly reinforced the engine may be severely damaged or destroyed during this type of operation It is important with nitrous oxide augmentation of petrol engines to maintain proper operating temperatures and fuel levels to prevent pre ignition or detonation sometimes referred to as knock Most problems that are associated with nitrous oxide do not come from mechanical failure due to the power increases Since nitrous oxide allows a much denser charge into the cylinder it dramatically increases cylinder pressures The increased pressure and temperature can cause problems such as melting the pistons or valves It also may crack or warp the piston or cylinder head and cause pre ignition due to uneven heating br Automotive grade liquid nitrous oxide differs slightly from medical grade nitrous oxide A small amount of sulfur dioxide SO is added to prevent substance abuse br br br Aerosol propellant br br The gas is approved for use as a food additive E number E specifically as an aerosol spray propellant Its most common uses in this context are in aerosol whipped cream canisters and cooking sprays br The gas is extremely soluble in fatty compounds In aerosol whipped cream it is dissolved in the fatty cream until it leaves the can when it becomes gaseous and thus creates foam Used in this way it produces whipped cream which is four times the volume of the liquid whereas whipping air into cream only produces twice the volume If air were used as a propellant oxygen would accelerate rancidification of the butterfat but nitrous oxide inhibits such degradation Carbon dioxide cannot be used for whipped cream because it is acidic in water which would curdle the cream and give it a seltzer like sparkling sensation br The whipped cream produced with nitrous oxide is unstable and will return to a more liquid state within half an hour to one hour Thus the method is not suitable for decorating food that will not be served immediately br In December some manufacturers reported a shortage of aerosol whipped creams in the United States due to an explosion at the Air Liquide nitrous oxide facility in Florida in late August With a major facility offline the disruption caused a shortage resulting in the company diverting the supply of nitrous oxide to medical customers rather than to food manufacturing The shortage came during the Christmas and holiday season when canned whipped cream use is normally at its highest br Similarly cooking spray which is made from various types of oils combined with lecithin an emulsifier may use nitrous oxide as a propellant Other propellants used in cooking spray include food grade alcohol and propane br br br Medicine br br Nitrous oxide has been used in dentistry and surgery as an anaesthetic and analgesic since In the early days the gas was administered through simple inhalers consisting of a breathing bag made of rubber cloth Today the gas is administered in hospitals by means of an automated relative analgesia machine with an anaesthetic vaporiser and a medical ventilator that delivers a precisely dosed and breath actuated flow of nitrous oxide mixed with oxygen in a ratio br Nitrous oxide is a weak general anaesthetic and so is generally not used alone in general anaesthesia but used as a carrier gas mixed with oxygen for more powerful general anaesthetic drugs such as sevoflurane or desflurane It has a minimum alveolar concentration of and a blood gas partition coefficient of The use of nitrous oxide in anaesthesia can increase the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting br Dentists use a simpler machine which only delivers an N O O mixture for the patient to inhale while conscious but must still be a recognised purpose designed dedicated relative analgesic flowmeter with a minimum of oxygen at all times and a maximum upper limit of nitrous oxide The patient is kept conscious throughout the procedure and retains adequate mental faculties to respond to questions and instructions from the dentist br Inhalation of nitrous oxide is used frequently to relieve pain associated with childbirth trauma oral surgery and acute coronary syndrome including heart attacks Its use during labour has been shown to be a safe and effective aid for birthing women Its use for acute coronary syndrome is of unknown benefit br In Canada and the UK Entonox and Nitronox are used commonly by ambulance crews including unregistered practitioners as rapid and highly effective analgesic gas br Fifty per cent nitrous oxide can be considered for use by trained non professional first aid responders in prehospital settings given the relative ease and safety of administering nitrous oxide as an analgesic The rapid reversibility of its effect would also prevent it from precluding diagnosis br br br Recreational use br br Recreational inhalation of nitrous oxide with the purpose of causing euphoria and or slight hallucinations began as a phenomenon for the British upper class in known as laughing gas parties br Starting in the th century the widespread availability of the gas for medical and culinary purposes allowed for recreational use to expand greatly globally In the UK as of nitrous oxide was estimated to be used by almost half a million young people at nightspots festivals and parties br Widespread recreational use of the drug throughout the UK was featured in the Vice documentary Inside The Laughing Gas Black Market in which journalist Matt Shea met with dealers of the drug who stole it from hospitals br A significant issue cited in London s press is the effect of nitrous oxide canister littering which is highly visible and causes significant complaints from communities br Prior to November nitrous oxide was subject to the Psychoactive Substances Act in the UK It was already illegal to produce supply import or export nitrous oxide for recreational use However the UK government updated the law on November to include possession of nitrous oxide by classifying it as a Class C drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act br While casual use of nitrous oxide is understood by most recreational users to be a route to a safe high many are unaware that excessive consumption has the potential to cause neurological harm which if left untreated can result in permanent neurological damage In Australia recreation use became a public health concern following a rise in reported cases of neurotoxicity and a rise in emergency room admissions and in the state of South Australia legislation was passed in to restrict canister sales br br br Safety br Nitrous oxide is a significant occupational hazard for surgeons dentists and nurses Because nitrous oxide is minimally metabolised in humans with a rate of it retains its potency when exhaled into the room by the patient and can pose an intoxicating and prolonged exposure hazard to the clinic staff if the room is poorly ventilated Where nitrous oxide is administered a continuous flow fresh air ventilation system or N O scavenger system is used to prevent a waste gas buildup br The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends that workers exposure to nitrous oxide should be controlled during the administration of anaesthetic gas in medical dental and veterinary operators It set a recommended exposure limit REL of ppm mg m to escaped anaesthetic br br br Mental and manual impairment br Exposure to nitrous oxide causes short term decreases in mental performance audiovisual ability and manual dexterity These effects coupled with the induced spatial and temporal disorientation could result in physical harm to the user from environmental hazards br br br Neurotoxicity and neuroprotection br Nitrous oxide is neurotoxic and there is evidence that medium or long term habitual consumption of significant quantities can cause neurological harm with the potential for permanent damage if left untreated br Like other NMDA receptor antagonists it has been suggested that N O produces neurotoxicity in the form of Olney s lesions in rodents upon prolonged several hour exposure br It has been argued that because N O is rapidly expelled from the body under normal circumstances it is less likely to be neurotoxic than other NMDAR antagonists Indeed in rodents short term exposure results in only mild injury that is rapidly reversible and neuronal death occurs only after constant and sustained exposure Nitrous oxide also may cause neurotoxicity after extended exposure because of hypoxia This is especially true of non medical formulations such as whipped cream chargers also known as whippets or nangs which never contain oxygen since oxygen makes cream rancid br In heavy g or L of N O gas in one session or frequent regular i e daily or weekly users reported to poison control centers signs of peripheral neuropathy have been noted the presence of ataxia gait abnormalities or paresthesia perception of abnormal sensations e g tingling numbness prickling mostly in the extremities These are considered an early sign of neurological damage and indicates chronic toxicity br Nitrous oxide at by volume reduces ischemia induced neuronal death induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rodents and decreases NMDA induced Ca influx in neuronal cell cultures a critical event involved in excitotoxicity br br br DNA damage br Occupational exposure to ambient nitrous oxide has been associated with DNA damage due to interruptions in DNA synthesis This correlation is dose dependent and does not appear to extend to casual recreational use however further research is needed to confirm the duration and quantity of exposure needed to cause damage br br br Oxygen deprivation br If pure nitrous oxide is inhaled without oxygen oxygen deprivation can occur resulting in low blood pressure fainting and even heart attacks This can occur if the user inhales large quantities continuously as with a strap on mask connected to a gas canister It can also happen if the user engages in excessive breath holding or uses any other inhalation system that cuts off a supply of fresh air br br br Vitamin B deficiency br Long term exposure to nitrous oxide may cause vitamin B deficiency This can cause serious neurotoxicity if the user has preexisting vitamin B deficiency It inactivates the cobalamin form of vitamin B by oxidation Symptoms of vitamin B deficiency including sensory neuropathy myelopathy and encephalopathy may occur within days or weeks of exposure to nitrous oxide anaesthesia in people with subclinical vitamin B deficiency br Symptoms are treated with high doses of vitamin B but recovery can be slow and incomplete br People with normal vitamin B levels have stores to make the effects of nitrous oxide insignificant unless exposure is repeated and prolonged nitrous oxide abuse Vitamin B levels should be checked in people with risk factors for vitamin B deficiency prior to using nitrous oxide anaesthesia br br br Prenatal development br Several experimental studies in rats indicate that chronic exposure of pregnant females to nitrous oxide may have adverse effects on the developing fetus br br br Chemical physical risks br At room temperature C F the saturated vapour pressure is bar rising up to bar at C F the critical temperature The pressure curve is thus unusually sensitive to temperature br As with many strong oxidisers contamination of parts with fuels have been implicated in rocketry accidents where small quantities of nitrous fuel mixtures explode due to water hammer like effects sometimes called dieseling heating due to adiabatic compression of gases can reach decomposition temperatures Some common building materials such as stainless steel and aluminium can act as fuels with strong oxidisers such as nitrous oxide as can contaminants that may ignite due to adiabatic compression br There also have been incidents where nitrous oxide decomposition in plumbing has led to the explosion of large tanks br br br Mechanism of action br The pharmacological mechanism of action of N O in medicine is not fully known However it has been shown to directly modulate a broad range of ligand gated ion channels and this likely plays a major role in many of its effects It moderately blocks NMDAR and subunit containing nACh channels weakly inhibits AMPA kainate GABAC and HT receptors and slightly potentiates GABAA and glycine receptors It also has been shown to activate two pore domain K channels While N O affects quite a few ion channels its anaesthetic hallucinogenic and euphoriant effects are likely caused predominantly or fully via inhibition of NMDA receptor mediated currents In addition to its effects on ion channels N O may act to imitate nitric oxide NO in the central nervous system and this may be related to its analgesic and anxiolytic properties Nitrous oxide is to times more soluble than nitrogen br The effects of inhaling sub anaesthetic doses of nitrous oxide have been known to vary based on several factors including settings and individual differences however from his discussion Jay suggests that it has been reliably known to induce the following states and sensations br br Intoxication br Euphoria dysphoria br Spatial disorientation br Temporal disorientation br Reduced pain sensitivity br A minority of users also will present with uncontrolled vocalisations and muscular spasms These effects generally disappear minutes after removal of the nitrous oxide source br br br Anxiolytic effect br In behavioural tests of anxiety a low dose of N O is an effective anxiolytic and this anti anxiety effect is associated with enhanced activity of GABAA receptors as it is partially reversed by benzodiazepine receptor antagonists Mirroring this animals that have developed tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines are partially tolerant to N O Indeed in humans given N O benzodiazepine receptor antagonists reduced the subjective reports of feeling high but did not alter psychomotor performance in human clinical studies br br br Analgesic effect br The analgesic effects of N O are linked to the interaction between the endogenous opioid system and the descending noradrenergic system When animals are given morphine chronically they develop tolerance to its pain killing effects and this also renders the animals tolerant to the analgesic effects of N O Administration of antibodies that bind and block the activity of some endogenous opioids not endorphin also block the antinociceptive effects of N O Drugs that inhibit the breakdown of endogenous opioids also potentiate the antinociceptive effects of N O Several experiments have shown that opioid receptor antagonists applied directly to the brain block the antinociceptive effects of N O but these drugs have no effect when injected into the spinal cord br Apart from an indirect action nitrous oxide like morphine also interacts directly with the endogenous opioid system by binding at opioid receptor binding sites br Conversely adrenoceptor antagonists block the pain reducing effects of N O when given directly to the spinal cord but not when applied directly to the brain Indeed B adrenoceptor knockout mice or animals depleted in norepinephrine are nearly completely resistant to the antinociceptive effects of N O Apparently N O induced release of endogenous opioids causes disinhibition of brainstem noradrenergic neurons which release norepinephrine into the spinal cord and inhibit pain signalling Exactly how N O causes the release of endogenous opioid peptides remains uncertain br br br Properties and reactions br Nitrous oxide is a colourless gas with a faint sweet odour br Nitrous oxide supports combustion by releasing the dipolar bonded oxygen radical and can thus relight a glowing splint br N O is inert at room temperature and has few reactions At elevated temperatures its reactivity increases For example nitrous oxide reacts with NaNH at C F to give NaN br br NaNH N O NaN NaOH NH br The above reaction is the route adopted by the commercial chemical industry to produce azide salts which are used as detonators br br br History br The gas was first synthesised in by English natural philosopher and chemist Joseph Priestley who called it dephlogisticated nitrous air see phlogiston theory or inflammable nitrous air Priestley published his discovery in the book Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air where he described how to produce the preparation of nitrous air diminished by heating iron filings dampened with nitric acid br br br Early use br br The first important use of nitrous oxide was made possible by Thomas Beddoes and James Watt who worked together to publish the book Considerations on the Medical Use and on the Production of Factitious Airs This book was important for two reasons First James Watt had invented a novel machine to produce factitious airs including nitrous oxide and a novel breathing apparatus to inhale the gas Second the book also presented the new medical theories by Thomas Beddoes that tuberculosis and other lung diseases could be treated by inhalation of Factitious Airs br br The machine to produce Factitious Airs had three parts a furnace to burn the needed material a vessel with water where the produced gas passed through in a spiral pipe for impurities to be washed off and finally the gas cylinder with a gasometer where the gas produced air could be tapped into portable air bags made of airtight oily silk The breathing apparatus consisted of one of the portable air bags connected with a tube to a mouthpiece With this new equipment being engineered and produced by the way was paved for clinical trials which began in when Thomas Beddoes established the Pneumatic Institution for Relieving Diseases by Medical Airs in Hotwells Bristol In the basement of the building a large scale machine was producing the gases under the supervision of a young Humphry Davy who was encouraged to experiment with new gases for patients to inhale The first important work of Davy was examination of the nitrous oxide and the publication of his results in the book Researches Chemical and Philosophical In that publication Davy notes the analgesic effect of nitrous oxide at page and its potential to be used for surgical operations at page Davy coined the name laughing gas for nitrous oxide br Despite Davy s discovery that inhalation of nitrous oxide could relieve a conscious person from pain another years elapsed before doctors attempted to use it for anaesthesia The use of nitrous oxide as a recreational drug at laughing gas parties primarily arranged for the British upper class became an immediate success beginning in While the effects of the gas generally make the user appear stuporous dreamy and sedated some people also get the giggles in a state of euphoria and frequently erupt in laughter br One of the earliest commercial producers in the U S was George Poe cousin of the poet Edgar Allan Poe who also was the first to liquefy the gas br br br Anaesthetic use br br The first time nitrous oxide was used as an anaesthetic drug in the treatment of a patient was when dentist Horace Wells with assistance by Gardner Quincy Colton and John Mankey Riggs demonstrated insensitivity to pain from a dental extraction on December In the following weeks Wells treated the first to patients with nitrous oxide in Hartford Connecticut and according to his own record only failed in two cases In spite of these convincing results having been reported by Wells to the medical society in Boston in December this new method was not immediately adopted by other dentists The reason for this was most likely that Wells in January at his first public demonstration to the medical faculty in Boston had been partly unsuccessful leaving his colleagues doubtful regarding its efficacy and safety The method did not come into general use until when Gardner Quincy Colton successfully started to use it in all his Colton Dental Association clinics that he had just established in New Haven and New York City Over the following three years Colton and his associates successfully administered nitrous oxide to more than patients Today nitrous oxide is used in dentistry as an anxiolytic as an adjunct to local anaesthetic br Nitrous oxide was not found to be a strong enough anaesthetic for use in major surgery in hospital settings however Instead diethyl ether being a stronger and more potent anaesthetic was demonstrated and accepted for use in October along with chloroform in When Joseph Thomas Clover invented the gas ether inhaler in however it became a common practice at hospitals to initiate all anaesthetic treatments with a mild flow of nitrous oxide and then gradually increase the anaesthesia with the stronger ether or chloroform Clover s gas ether inhaler was designed to supply the patient with nitrous oxide and ether at the same time with the exact mixture being controlled by the operator of the device It remained in use by many hospitals until the s Although hospitals today use a more advanced anaesthetic machine these machines still use the same principle launched with Clover s gas ether inhaler to initiate the anaesthesia with nitrous oxide before the administration of a more powerful anaesthetic br br br As a patent medicine br Colton s popularisation of nitrous oxide led to its adoption by a number of less than reputable quacksalvers who touted it as a cure for consumption scrofula catarrh and other diseases of the blood throat and lungs Nitrous oxide treatment was administered and licensed as a patent medicine by the likes of C L Blood and Jerome Harris in Boston and Charles E Barney of Chicago br br br Production br Reviewing various methods of producing nitrous oxide is published br br br Industrial methods br br Nitrous oxide is prepared on an industrial scale by carefully heating ammonium nitrate at about C which decomposes into nitrous oxide and water vapour br br NH NO H O N O br The addition of various phosphate salts favours formation of a purer gas at slightly lower temperatures This reaction may be difficult to control resulting in detonation br br br Laboratory methods br The decomposition of ammonium nitrate is also a common laboratory method for preparing the gas Equivalently it can be obtained by heating a mixture of sodium nitrate and ammonium sulfate br br NaNO NH SO Na SO N O H O br Another method involves the reaction of urea nitric acid and sulfuric acid br br NH CO HNO H SO N O CO NH SO H O br Direct oxidation of ammonia with a manganese dioxide bismuth oxide catalyst has been reported cf Ostwald process br br NH O N O H O br Hydroxylammonium chloride reacts with sodium nitrite to give nitrous oxide If the nitrite is added to the hydroxylamine solution the only remaining by product is salt water If the hydroxylamine solution is added to the nitrite solution nitrite is in excess however then toxic higher oxides of nitrogen also are formed br br NH OHCl NaNO N O NaCl H O br Treating HNO with SnCl and HCl also has been demonstrated br br HNO HCl SnCl H O SnCl N O br Hyponitrous acid decomposes to N O and water with a half life of days at C at pH br br H N O H O N O br br br Atmospheric occurrence br br Nitrous oxide is a minor component of Earth s atmosphere and is an active part of the planetary nitrogen cycle Based on analysis of air samples gathered from sites around the world its concentration surpassed ppb in The growth rate of about ppb per year has also accelerated during recent decades Nitrous oxide s atmospheric abundance has grown more than from a base level of about ppb in year br Important atmospheric properties of N O are summarized in the following table br br In the IPCC reported that The human perturbation of the natural nitrogen cycle through the use of synthetic fertilizers and manure as well as nitrogen deposition resulting from land based agriculture and fossil fuel burning has been the largest driver of the increase in atmospheric N O of ppb between and br br br Emissions by source br to million tonnes total annual average nitrogen in N O was emitted in About of N O emissions are from humans and the rest are part of the natural nitrogen cycle The N O emitted each year by humans has a greenhouse effect equivalent to about billion tonnes of carbon dioxide for comparison humans emitted billion tonnes of actual carbon dioxide in and methane equivalent to billion tonnes of carbon dioxide br Most of the N O emitted into the atmosphere from natural and anthropogenic sources is produced by microorganisms such as denitrifying bacteria and fungi in soils and oceans Soils under natural vegetation are an important source of nitrous oxide accounting for of all naturally produced emissions Other natural sources include the oceans and atmospheric chemical reactions Wetlands can also be emitters of nitrous oxide Emissions from thawing permafrost may be significant but as of this is not certain br The main components of anthropogenic emissions are fertilised agricultural soils and livestock manure runoff and leaching of fertilisers biomass burning fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes biological degradation of other nitrogen containing atmospheric emissions and human sewage Agriculture enhances nitrous oxide production through soil cultivation the use of nitrogen fertilisers and animal waste handling These activities stimulate naturally occurring bacteria to produce more nitrous oxide Nitrous oxide emissions from soil can be challenging to measure as they vary markedly over time and space and the majority of a year s emissions may occur when conditions are favorable during hot moments and or at favorable locations known as hotspots br Among industrial emissions the production of nitric acid and adipic acid are the largest sources of nitrous oxide emissions The adipic acid emissions specifically arise from the degradation of the nitrolic acid intermediate derived from the nitration of cyclohexanone br br br Biological processes br Natural processes that generate nitrous oxide may be classified as nitrification and denitrification Specifically they include br br aerobic autotrophic nitrification the stepwise oxidation of ammonia NH to nitrite NO and to nitrate NO br anaerobic heterotrophic denitrification the stepwise reduction of NO to NO nitric oxide NO N O and ultimately N where facultative anaerobe bacteria use NO as an electron acceptor in the respiration of organic material in the condition of insufficient oxygen O br nitrifier denitrification which is carried out by autotrophic NH oxidising bacteria and the pathway whereby ammonia NH is oxidised to nitrite NO followed by the reduction of NO to nitric oxide NO N O and molecular nitrogen N br heterotrophic nitrification br aerobic denitrification by the same heterotrophic nitrifiers br fungal denitrification br non biological chemodenitrification br These processes are affected by soil chemical and physical properties such as the availability of mineral nitrogen and organic matter acidity and soil type as well as climate related factors such as soil temperature and water content br The emission of the gas to the atmosphere is limited greatly by its consumption inside the cells by a process catalysed by the enzyme nitrous oxide reductase br br br Environmental impact br Global accounting of N O sources and sinks over the decade ending indicates that about of the average TgN yr teragrams or million metric tons of nitrogen per year of emissions originated from human activity and shows that emissions growth chiefly came from expanding agriculture br br br Greenhouse effect br br Nitrous oxide has significant global warming potential as a greenhouse gas On a per molecule basis considered over a year period nitrous oxide has times the atmospheric heat trapping ability of carbon dioxide CO However because of its low concentration less than of that of CO its contribution to the greenhouse effect is less than one third that of carbon dioxide and also less than methane On the other hand since about of the N O entering the atmosphere is the result of human activity control of nitrous oxide is part of efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions br Most human caused nitrous oxide released into the atmosphere is a greenhouse gas emission from agriculture when farmers add nitrogen based fertilizers onto the fields and through the breakdown of animal manure Reduction of emissions can be a hot topic in the politics of climate change br Nitrous oxide is also released as a by product of burning fossil fuel though the amount released depends on which fuel was used It is also emitted through the manufacture of nitric acid which is used in the synthesis of nitrogen fertilizers The production of adipic acid a precursor to nylon and other synthetic clothing fibres also releases nitrous oxide br A rise in atmospheric nitrous oxide concentrations has been implicated as a possible contributor to the extremely intense global warming during the Cenomanian Turonian boundary event br br br Ozone layer depletion br Nitrous oxide has also been implicated in thinning the ozone layer A study suggested that N O emission was the single most important ozone depleting emission and it was expected to remain the largest throughout the st century br br br Legality br br br India br Transfer of nitrous oxide from bulk cylinders to smaller more transportable E type litre capacity tanks is legal when the intended use of the gas is for medical anaesthesia br br br New Zealand br The Ministry of Health has warned that nitrous oxide is a prescription medicine and its sale or possession without a prescription is an offense under the Medicines Act This statement would seemingly prohibit all non medicinal uses of nitrous oxide although it is implied that only recreational use will be targeted legally br br br UK br In August the Council of the London Borough of Lambeth UK banned the use of the drug for recreational purposes making offenders liable to an on the spot fine of up to br In September the Government announced that nitrous oxide would be made illegal by the end of the year with possession potentially carrying up to a two year prison sentence or an unlimited fine br br br US br Possession of nitrous oxide is legal under federal law and is not subject to DEA purview It is however regulated by the Food and Drug Administration under the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act prosecution is possible under its misbranding clauses prohibiting the sale or distribution of nitrous oxide for the purpose of human consumption Many states have laws regulating the possession sale and distribution of nitrous oxide Such laws usually ban distribution to minors or limit the amount of nitrous oxide that may be sold without special license For example in the state of California possession for recreational use is prohibited and qualifies as a misdemeanor
