title: Oxygenate
id: 2195504
To oxygenate means to impregnate combine or supply something with oxygen while oxygenates are hydrocarbons containing at least one oxygen atom that are used as fuel additives to promote complete combustion in fuel mixtures Oxygenates can also be employed to reduce air pollution by reducing carbon monoxide production and soot particle size and compounds such as aromatic hydrocarbons polyaromatic hydrocarbons and nitrated polyaromatic hydrocarbons that are side products caused by incomplete combustion br The most common oxygenates are either alcohols or ethers but ketones and aldehydes are also included in this distinction Carboxylic acids and esters can be grouped with oxygenates in the simple definition that they contain at least one oxygen atom However they are usually unwanted in oils and therefore likely fuels due to their environmental toxicity and tendency to cause catalyst poisoning and corrosion during oil production and refining br br Alcohols br Methanol MeOH br Ethanol EtOH see also Common ethanol fuel mixtures br Isopropyl alcohol IPA br n Butanol BuOH br Gasoline grade tert butanol GTBA br Ethers br Methyl tert butyl ether MTBE br tert Amyl methyl ether TAME br tert Hexyl methyl ether THEME br Ethyl tert butyl ether ETBE br tert Amyl ethyl ether TAEE br Diisopropyl ether DIPE br br br In the United States br In the United States the Environmental Protection Agency EPA had authority to mandate that minimum proportions of oxygenates be added to automotive gasoline on regional and seasonal basis from until in an attempt to reduce air pollution in particular ground level ozone and smog As of the EPA continues to require the use of oxygenated gasoline in certain areas during winter to regulate carbon monoxide emissions however the programs to fulfill its conditions are implemented by the states In addition to this North American automakers from onwards promoted a blend of ethanol and gasoline marketed as E and their flex fuel vehicles e g GM s Live Green Go Yellow campaign US Corporate Average Fuel Economy CAFE standards give an artificial fuel efficiency bonus to vehicles capable of running on alcohol blends over vehicles not adapted to run on alcohol blends There is also alcohols intrinsically cleaner combustion however due to its lower energy density it is not capable of producing as much energy per gallon as gasoline Much gasoline sold in the United States is blended with up to of an oxygenating agent This is known as oxygenated fuel and often but not entirely correctly as there are reformulated gasolines without oxygenate as reformulated gasoline Methyl tert butyl ether MTBE was the most common fuel additive in the United States prior to government mandated use of ethanol Typically gasoline with added MTBE is called reformulated gasoline while gasoline with ethanol is called oxygenated gasoline br br br br br br External links br EPA Definition of Oxygenates br USGS Definition of Oxygenates
