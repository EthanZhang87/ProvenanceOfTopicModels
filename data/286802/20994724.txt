Colloidal silicas are suspensions of fine amorphous nonporous and typically spherical silica particles in a liquid phase It may be produced by St ber process from Tetraethyl orthosilicate TEOS br br br Properties br Usually they are suspended in an aqueous phase that is stabilized electrostatically Colloidal silicas exhibit particle densities in the range of to g cm br Most colloidal silicas are prepared as monodisperse suspensions with particle sizes ranging from approximately to nm in diameter Polydisperse suspensions can also be synthesized and have roughly the same limits in particle size Smaller particles are difficult to stabilize while particles much greater than nanometers are subject to sedimentation br br br Manufacture br Colloidal silicas are most often prepared in a multi step process where an alkali silicate solution is partially neutralized leading to the formation of silica nuclei The subunits of colloidal silica particles are typically in the range of to nm Whether or not these subunits are joined depends on the conditions of polymerization Initial acidification of a water glass sodium silicate solution yields Si OH br If the pH is reduced below or if salt is added then the units tend to fuse together in chains These products are often called silica gels If the pH is kept slightly on the alkaline side of neutral then the subunits stay separated and they gradually grow These products are often called precipitated silica or silica sols Hydrogen ions from the surface of colloidal silica tend to dissociate in aqueous solution yielding a high negative charge Substitution of some of the Si atoms by Al is known increase the negative colloidal charge especially when it is evaluated at pH below the neutral point Because of the very small size the surface area of colloidal silica is very high br The colloidal suspension is stabilized by pH adjustment and then concentrated usually by evaporation The maximum concentration obtainable depends on the on particle size For example nm particles can be concentrated to greater than wt solids while nm particles can only be concentrated to approximately wt solids before the suspension becomes too unstable br br br Applications br In papermaking colloidal silica is used as a drainage aid It increases the amount of cationic starch that can be retained in the paper Cationic starch is added as sizing agent to increase the dry strength of the paper br High temperature binders br Investment casting used as the inorganic binder in moulds br An abrasive for polishing silicon wafers br Carbonless paper br As binder or silica source in catalysts br Desiccant br As lubricant in the manufacture of pharmaceutical capsules and tablets br Stabilizing and rigidizing refractory ceramic fiber blankets br Abrasion resistant coatings br Increasing friction used to coat waxed floors textile fibers cardboards and railway tracks to promote traction br Antisoiling fills micropores to prevent take up of dirt and other particles into textiles br Surfactant used for flocculating coagulating dispersing stabilising etc br Liquid silicon dioxide colloidal silica is used as a wine and juice fining agent br Absorbent br Colloidal silica is used in concrete densifiers and polished concrete br In manufacturing Quantum dots small semi conductors used in various scientific research settings br Reduced porosity and increased protection from alkali silica reaction ASR br br br See also br Silica dioxide br br br
