id: 21175
Nitrogen is a chemical element it has symbol N and atomic number Nitrogen is a nonmetal and the lightest member of group of the periodic table often called the pnictogens It is a common element in the universe estimated at seventh in total abundance in the Milky Way and the Solar System At standard temperature and pressure two atoms of the element bond to form N a colorless and odorless diatomic gas N forms about of Earth s atmosphere making it the most abundant chemical species in air Because of the volatility of nitrogen compounds nitrogen is relatively rare in the solid parts of the Earth br It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in and independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish at about the same time The name nitrog ne was suggested by French chemist Jean Antoine Claude Chaptal in when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name azote from the Ancient Greek no life as it is an asphyxiant gas this name is used in a number of languages and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine azides and azo compounds br Elemental nitrogen is usually produced from air by pressure swing adsorption technology About of commercially produced elemental nitrogen is used as an inert oxygen free gas for commercial uses such as food packaging and much of the rest is used as liquid nitrogen in cryogenic applications Many industrially important compounds such as ammonia nitric acid organic nitrates propellants and explosives and cyanides contain nitrogen The extremely strong triple bond in elemental nitrogen N N the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide CO dominates nitrogen chemistry This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N into useful compounds but at the same time it means that burning exploding or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of water systems Apart from its use in fertilisers and energy stores nitrogen is a constituent of organic compounds as diverse as aramids used in high strength fabric and cyanoacrylate used in superglue br Nitrogen occurs in all organisms primarily in amino acids and thus proteins in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA and in the energy transfer molecule adenosine triphosphate The human body contains about nitrogen by mass the fourth most abundant element in the body after oxygen carbon and hydrogen The nitrogen cycle describes the movement of the element from the air into the biosphere and organic compounds then back into the atmosphere Nitrogen is a constituent of every major pharmacological drug class including antibiotics Many drugs are mimics or prodrugs of natural nitrogen containing signal molecules for example the organic nitrates nitroglycerin and nitroprusside control blood pressure by metabolizing into nitric oxide Many notable nitrogen containing drugs such as the natural caffeine and morphine or the synthetic amphetamines act on receptors of animal neurotransmitters br br br History br br Nitrogen compounds have a very long history ammonium chloride having been known to Herodotus They were well known by the Middle Ages Alchemists knew nitric acid as aqua fortis strong water as well as other nitrogen compounds such as ammonium salts and nitrate salts The mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids was known as aqua regia royal water celebrated for its ability to dissolve gold the king of metals br The discovery of nitrogen is attributed to the Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in who called it noxious air Though he did not recognise it as an entirely different chemical substance he clearly distinguished it from Joseph Black s fixed air or carbon dioxide The fact that there was a component of air that does not support combustion was clear to Rutherford although he was not aware that it was an element Nitrogen was also studied at about the same time by Carl Wilhelm Scheele Henry Cavendish and Joseph Priestley who referred to it as burnt air or phlogisticated air French chemist Antoine Lavoisier referred to nitrogen gas as mephitic air or azote from the Greek word azotikos no life due to it being asphyxiant In an atmosphere of pure nitrogen animals died and flames were extinguished Though Lavoisier s name was not accepted in English since it was pointed out that all gases but oxygen are either asphyxiant or outright toxic it is used in many languages French Italian Portuguese Polish Russian Albanian Turkish etc the German Stickstoff similarly refers to the same characteristic viz ersticken to choke or suffocate and still remains in English in the common names of many nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine and compounds of the azide ion Finally it led to the name pnictogens for the group headed by nitrogen from the Greek to choke br The English word nitrogen entered the language from the French nitrog ne coined in by French chemist Jean Antoine Chaptal from the French nitre potassium nitrate also called saltpeter and the French suffix g ne producing from the Greek genes begotten Chaptal s meaning was that nitrogen is the essential part of nitric acid which in turn was produced from nitre In earlier times niter had been confused with Egyptian natron sodium carbonate called nitron in Greek which despite the name contained no nitrate br The earliest military industrial and agricultural applications of nitrogen compounds used saltpeter sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate most notably in gunpowder and later as fertiliser In Lord Rayleigh discovered that an electrical discharge in nitrogen gas produced active nitrogen a monatomic allotrope of nitrogen The whirling cloud of brilliant yellow light produced by his apparatus reacted with mercury to produce explosive mercury nitride br For a long time sources of nitrogen compounds were limited Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions Nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the Frank Caro process and Haber Bosch process eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds to the extent that half of global food production now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers At the same time use of the Ostwald process to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock in the manufacture of explosives in the World Wars of the th century br br br Properties br br br Atomic br br A nitrogen atom has seven electrons In the ground state they are arranged in the electron configuration s s p x p y p z It therefore has five valence electrons in the s and p orbitals three of which the p electrons are unpaired It has one of the highest electronegativities among the elements on the Pauling scale exceeded only by chlorine oxygen and fluorine The light noble gases helium neon and argon would presumably also be more electronegative and in fact are on the Allen scale Following periodic trends its single bond covalent radius of pm is smaller than those of boron pm and carbon pm while it is larger than those of oxygen pm and fluorine pm The nitride anion N is much larger at pm similar to that of the oxide O pm and fluoride F pm anions The first three ionisation energies of nitrogen are and MJ mol and the sum of the fourth and fifth is MJ mol Due to these very high figures nitrogen has no simple cationic chemistry br The lack of radial nodes in the p subshell is directly responsible for many of the anomalous properties of the first row of the p block especially in nitrogen oxygen and fluorine The p subshell is very small and has a very similar radius to the s shell facilitating orbital hybridisation It also results in very large electrostatic forces of attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons in the s and p shells resulting in very high electronegativities Hypervalency is almost unknown in the p elements for the same reason because the high electronegativity makes it difficult for a small nitrogen atom to be a central atom in an electron rich three center four electron bond since it would tend to attract the electrons strongly to itself Thus despite nitrogen s position at the head of group in the periodic table its chemistry shows huge differences from that of its heavier congeners phosphorus arsenic antimony and bismuth br Nitrogen may be usefully compared to its horizontal neighbours carbon and oxygen as well as its vertical neighbours in the pnictogen column phosphorus arsenic antimony and bismuth Although each period element from lithium to oxygen shows some similarities to the period element in the next group from magnesium to chlorine these are known as diagonal relationships their degree drops off abruptly past the boron silicon pair The similarities of nitrogen to sulfur are mostly limited to sulfur nitride ring compounds when both elements are the only ones present br Nitrogen does not share the proclivity of carbon for catenation Like carbon nitrogen tends to form ionic or metallic compounds with metals Nitrogen forms an extensive series of nitrides with carbon including those with chain graphitic and fullerenic like structures br It resembles oxygen with its high electronegativity and concomitant capability for hydrogen bonding and the ability to form coordination complexes by donating its lone pairs of electrons There are some parallels between the chemistry of ammonia NH and water H O For example the capacity of both compounds to be protonated to give NH and H O or deprotonated to give NH and OH with all of these able to be isolated in solid compounds br Nitrogen shares with both its horizontal neighbours a preference for forming multiple bonds typically with carbon oxygen or other nitrogen atoms through p p interactions Thus for example nitrogen occurs as diatomic molecules and therefore has very much lower melting C and boiling points C than the rest of its group as the N molecules are only held together by weak van der Waals interactions and there are very few electrons available to create significant instantaneous dipoles This is not possible for its vertical neighbours thus the nitrogen oxides nitrites nitrates nitro nitroso azo and diazo compounds azides cyanates thiocyanates and imino derivatives find no echo with phosphorus arsenic antimony or bismuth By the same token however the complexity of the phosphorus oxoacids finds no echo with nitrogen Setting aside their differences nitrogen and phosphorus form an extensive series of compounds with one another these have chain ring and cage structures br Table of thermal and physical properties of nitrogen N at atmospheric pressure br br br Isotopes br br Nitrogen has two stable isotopes N and N The first is much more common making up of natural nitrogen and the second which is slightly heavier makes up the remaining This leads to an atomic weight of around u Both of these stable isotopes are produced in the CNO cycle in stars but N is more common as its proton capture is the rate limiting step N is one of the five stable odd odd nuclides a nuclide having an odd number of protons and neutrons the other four are H Li B and mTa br The relative abundance of N and N is practically constant in the atmosphere but can vary elsewhere due to natural isotopic fractionation from biological redox reactions and the evaporation of natural ammonia or nitric acid Biologically mediated reactions e g assimilation nitrification and denitrification strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil These reactions typically result in N enrichment of the substrate and depletion of the product br The heavy isotope N was first discovered by S M Naud in and soon after heavy isotopes of the neighbouring elements oxygen and carbon were discovered It presents one of the lowest thermal neutron capture cross sections of all isotopes It is frequently used in nuclear magnetic resonance NMR spectroscopy to determine the structures of nitrogen containing molecules due to its fractional nuclear spin of one half which offers advantages for NMR such as narrower line width N though also theoretically usable has an integer nuclear spin of one and thus has a quadrupole moment that leads to wider and less useful spectra N NMR nevertheless has complications not encountered in the more common H and C NMR spectroscopy The low natural abundance of N significantly reduces sensitivity a problem which is only exacerbated by its low gyromagnetic ratio only that of H As a result the signal to noise ratio for H is about times as much as that for N at the same magnetic field strength This may be somewhat alleviated by isotopic enrichment of N by chemical exchange or fractional distillation N enriched compounds have the advantage that under standard conditions they do not undergo chemical exchange of their nitrogen atoms with atmospheric nitrogen unlike compounds with labelled hydrogen carbon and oxygen isotopes that must be kept away from the atmosphere The N N ratio is commonly used in stable isotope analysis in the fields of geochemistry hydrology paleoclimatology and paleoceanography where it is called N br Of the thirteen other isotopes produced synthetically ranging from N to N N has a half life of ten minutes and the remaining isotopes have half lives less than eight seconds Given the half life difference N is the most important nitrogen radioisotope being relatively long lived enough to use in positron emission tomography PET although its half life is still short and thus it must be produced at the venue of the PET for example in a cyclotron via proton bombardment of O producing N and an alpha particle br The radioisotope N is the dominant radionuclide in the coolant of pressurised water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation It is produced from O in water via an n p reaction in which the O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton It has a short half life of about s but its decay back to O produces high energy gamma radiation to MeV Because of this access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation It is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary steam cycle and is the primary means of detection for such leaks br br br Allotropes br br Atomic nitrogen also known as active nitrogen is highly reactive being a triradical with three unpaired electrons Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides and even when two free nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N molecule they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen gas at mmHg which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates br Given the great reactivity of atomic nitrogen elemental nitrogen usually occurs as molecular N dinitrogen This molecule is a colourless odourless and tasteless diamagnetic gas at standard conditions it melts at C and boils at C Dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature but it will nevertheless react with lithium metal and some transition metal complexes This is due to its bonding which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an N N triple bond Triple bonds have short bond lengths in this case pm and high dissociation energies in this case kJ mol and are thus very strong explaining dinitrogen s low level of chemical reactivity br Other nitrogen oligomers and polymers may be possible If they could be synthesised they may have potential applications as materials with a very high energy density that could be used as powerful propellants or explosives Under extremely high pressures million atm and high temperatures K as produced in a diamond anvil cell nitrogen polymerises into the single bonded cubic gauche crystal structure This structure is similar to that of diamond and both have extremely strong covalent bonds resulting in its nickname nitrogen diamond br br At atmospheric pressure molecular nitrogen condenses liquefies at K C and freezes at K C into the beta hexagonal close packed crystal allotropic form Below K C nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form called the alpha phase Liquid nitrogen a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance but with of the density the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is g mL is a common cryogen Solid nitrogen has many crystalline modifications It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto and outer moons of the Solar System such as Triton Even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can sublime to form an atmosphere or condense back into nitrogen frost It is very weak and flows in the form of glaciers and on Triton geysers of nitrogen gas come from the polar ice cap region br br br Chemistry and compounds br br br Dinitrogen complexes br br The first example of a dinitrogen complex to be discovered was Ru NH N see figure at right and soon many other such complexes were discovered These complexes in which a nitrogen molecule donates at least one lone pair of electrons to a central metal cation illustrate how N might bind to the metal s in nitrogenase and the catalyst for the Haber process these processes involving dinitrogen activation are vitally important in biology and in the production of fertilisers br Dinitrogen is able to coordinate to metals in five different ways The more well characterised ways are the end on M N N and M N N M bis in which the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms are donated to the metal cation The less well characterised ways involve dinitrogen donating electron pairs from the triple bond either as a bridging ligand to two metal cations bis or to just one The fifth and unique method involves triple coordination as a bridging ligand donating all three electron pairs from the triple bond N A few complexes feature multiple N ligands and some feature N bonded in multiple ways Since N is isoelectronic with carbon monoxide CO and acetylene C H the bonding in dinitrogen complexes is closely allied to that in carbonyl compounds although N is a weaker donor and acceptor than CO Theoretical studies show that donation is a more important factor allowing the formation of the M N bond than back donation which mostly only weakens the N N bond and end on donation is more readily accomplished than side on donation br Today dinitrogen complexes are known for almost all the transition metals accounting for several hundred compounds They are normally prepared by three methods br br Replacing labile ligands such as H O H or CO directly by nitrogen these are often reversible reactions that proceed at mild conditions br Reducing metal complexes in the presence of a suitable co ligand in excess under nitrogen gas A common choice includes replacing chloride ligands with dimethylphenylphosphine PMe Ph to make up for the smaller number of nitrogen ligands attached to the original chlorine ligands br Converting a ligand with N N bonds such as hydrazine or azide directly into a dinitrogen ligand br Occasionally the N N bond may be formed directly within a metal complex for example by directly reacting coordinated ammonia NH with nitrous acid HNO but this is not generally applicable Most dinitrogen complexes have colours within the range white yellow orange red brown a few exceptions are known such as the blue Ti C H N br br br Nitrides azides and nitrido complexes br Nitrogen bonds to almost all the elements in the periodic table except the first two noble gases helium and neon and some of the very short lived elements after bismuth creating an immense variety of binary compounds with varying properties and applications Many binary compounds are known with the exception of the nitrogen hydrides oxides and fluorides these are typically called nitrides Many stoichiometric phases are usually present for most elements e g MnN Mn N Mn N Mn N Mn N and MnxN for x They may be classified as salt like mostly ionic covalent diamond like and metallic or interstitial although this classification has limitations generally stemming from the continuity of bonding types instead of the discrete and separate types that it implies They are normally prepared by directly reacting a metal with nitrogen or ammonia sometimes after heating or by thermal decomposition of metal amides br br Ca N Ca N br Mg NH Mg N H at C br Zn NH Zn N NH br Many variants on these processes are possible The most ionic of these nitrides are those of the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals Li N Na K Rb and Cs do not form stable nitrides for steric reasons and M N M Be Mg Ca Sr Ba These can formally be thought of as salts of the N anion although charge separation is not actually complete even for these highly electropositive elements However the alkali metal azides NaN and KN featuring the linear N anion are well known as are Sr N and Ba N Azides of the B subgroup metals those in groups through are much less ionic have more complicated structures and detonate readily when shocked br br Many covalent binary nitrides are known Examples include cyanogen CN triphosphorus pentanitride P N disulfur dinitride S N and tetrasulfur tetranitride S N The essentially covalent silicon nitride Si N and germanium nitride Ge N are also known silicon nitride in particular would make a promising ceramic if not for the difficulty of working with and sintering it In particular the group nitrides most of which are promising semiconductors are isoelectronic with graphite diamond and silicon carbide and have similar structures their bonding changes from covalent to partially ionic to metallic as the group is descended In particular since the B N unit is isoelectronic to C C and carbon is essentially intermediate in size between boron and nitrogen much of organic chemistry finds an echo in boron nitrogen chemistry such as in borazine inorganic benzene Nevertheless the analogy is not exact due to the ease of nucleophilic attack at boron due to its deficiency in electrons which is not possible in a wholly carbon containing ring br The largest category of nitrides are the interstitial nitrides of formulae MN M N and M N although variable composition is perfectly possible where the small nitrogen atoms are positioned in the gaps in a metallic cubic or hexagonal close packed lattice They are opaque very hard and chemically inert melting only at very high temperatures generally over C They have a metallic lustre and conduct electricity as do metals They hydrolyse only very slowly to give ammonia or nitrogen br The nitride anion N is the strongest donor known among ligands the second strongest is O Nitrido complexes are generally made by the thermal decomposition of azides or by deprotonating ammonia and they usually involve a terminal N group The linear azide anion N being isoelectronic with nitrous oxide carbon dioxide and cyanate forms many coordination complexes Further catenation is rare although N isoelectronic with carbonate and nitrate is known br br br Hydrides br br Industrially ammonia NH is the most important compound of nitrogen and is prepared in larger amounts than any other compound because it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilisers It is a colourless alkaline gas with a characteristic pungent smell The presence of hydrogen bonding has very significant effects on ammonia conferring on it its high melting C and boiling C points As a liquid it is a very good solvent with a high heat of vaporisation enabling it to be used in vacuum flasks that also has a low viscosity and electrical conductivity and high dielectric constant and is less dense than water However the hydrogen bonding in NH is weaker than that in H O due to the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen and the presence of only one lone pair in NH rather than two in H O It is a weak base in aqueous solution pKb its conjugate acid is ammonium NH It can also act as an extremely weak acid losing a proton to produce the amide anion NH It thus undergoes self dissociation similar to water to produce ammonium and amide Ammonia burns in air or oxygen though not readily to produce nitrogen gas it burns in fluorine with a greenish yellow flame to give nitrogen trifluoride Reactions with the other nonmetals are very complex and tend to lead to a mixture of products Ammonia reacts on heating with metals to give nitrides br Many other binary nitrogen hydrides are known but the most important are hydrazine N H and hydrogen azide HN Although it is not a nitrogen hydride hydroxylamine NH OH is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well Hydrazine is a fuming colourless liquid that smells similar to ammonia Its physical properties are very similar to those of water melting point C boiling point C density g cm Despite it being an endothermic compound it is kinetically stable It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel br Hydrazine is generally made by reaction of ammonia with alkaline sodium hypochlorite in the presence of gelatin or glue br br NH OCl NH Cl OH br NH Cl NH N H Cl slow br N H OH N H H O fast br The attacks by hydroxide and ammonia may be reversed thus passing through the intermediate NHCl instead The reason for adding gelatin is that it removes metal ions such as Cu that catalyses the destruction of hydrazine by reaction with monochloramine NH Cl to produce ammonium chloride and nitrogen br Hydrogen azide HN was first produced in by the oxidation of aqueous hydrazine by nitrous acid It is very explosive and even dilute solutions can be dangerous It has a disagreeable and irritating smell and is a potentially lethal but not cumulative poison It may be considered the conjugate acid of the azide anion and is similarly analogous to the hydrohalic acids br br br Halides and oxohalides br br All four simple nitrogen trihalides are known A few mixed halides and hydrohalides are known but are mostly unstable examples include NClF NCl F NBrF NF H NFH NCl H and NClH br Nitrogen trifluoride NF first prepared in is a colourless and odourless gas that is thermodynamically stable and most readily produced by the electrolysis of molten ammonium fluoride dissolved in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride Like carbon tetrafluoride it is not at all reactive and is stable in water or dilute aqueous acids or alkalis Only when heated does it act as a fluorinating agent and it reacts with copper arsenic antimony and bismuth on contact at high temperatures to give tetrafluorohydrazine N F The cations NF and N F are also known the latter from reacting tetrafluorohydrazine with strong fluoride acceptors such as arsenic pentafluoride as is ONF which has aroused interest due to the short N O distance implying partial double bonding and the highly polar and long N F bond Tetrafluorohydrazine unlike hydrazine itself can dissociate at room temperature and above to give the radical NF Fluorine azide FN is very explosive and thermally unstable Dinitrogen difluoride N F exists as thermally interconvertible cis and trans isomers and was first found as a product of the thermal decomposition of FN br Nitrogen trichloride NCl is a dense volatile and explosive liquid whose physical properties are similar to those of carbon tetrachloride although one difference is that NCl is easily hydrolysed by water while CCl is not It was first synthesised in by Pierre Louis Dulong who lost three fingers and an eye to its explosive tendencies As a dilute gas it is less dangerous and is thus used industrially to bleach and sterilise flour Nitrogen tribromide NBr first prepared in is a deep red temperature sensitive volatile solid that is explosive even at C Nitrogen triiodide NI is still more unstable and was only prepared in Its adduct with ammonia which was known earlier is very shock sensitive it can be set off by the touch of a feather shifting air currents or even alpha particles For this reason small amounts of nitrogen triiodide are sometimes synthesised as a demonstration to high school chemistry students or as an act of chemical magic Chlorine azide ClN and bromine azide BrN are extremely sensitive and explosive br Two series of nitrogen oxohalides are known the nitrosyl halides XNO and the nitryl halides XNO The first is very reactive gases that can be made by directly halogenating nitrous oxide Nitrosyl fluoride NOF is colourless and a vigorous fluorinating agent Nitrosyl chloride NOCl behaves in much the same way and has often been used as an ionising solvent Nitrosyl bromide NOBr is red The reactions of the nitryl halides are mostly similar nitryl fluoride FNO and nitryl chloride ClNO are likewise reactive gases and vigorous halogenating agents br br br Oxides br br Nitrogen forms nine molecular oxides some of which were the first gases to be identified N O nitrous oxide NO nitric oxide N O dinitrogen trioxide NO nitrogen dioxide N O dinitrogen tetroxide N O dinitrogen pentoxide N O nitrosylazide and N NO trinitramide All are thermally unstable towards decomposition to their elements One other possible oxide that has not yet been synthesised is oxatetrazole N O an aromatic ring br Nitrous oxide N O better known as laughing gas is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at C This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned whipped cream and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic Despite appearances it cannot be considered to be the anhydride of hyponitrous acid H N O because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water It is rather unreactive not reacting with the halogens the alkali metals or ozone at room temperature although reactivity increases upon heating and has the unsymmetrical structure N N O N N O N N O above C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N O bond br Nitric oxide NO is the simplest stable molecule with an odd number of electrons In mammals including humans it is an important cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that being thermodynamically unstable decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at C Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen but one extra electron is added to a antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately hence dimerisation to O N N O is unfavourable except below the boiling point where the cis isomer is more stable because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule granting it stability There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O N O N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes most of which are deeply coloured br Blue dinitrogen trioxide N O is only available as a solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give nitric oxide nitrogen dioxide NO and dinitrogen tetroxide N O The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid corrosive brown gas Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate Both react with water to form nitric acid Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late s This is because it is a hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature br The thermally unstable and very reactive dinitrogen pentoxide N O is the anhydride of nitric acid and can be made from it by dehydration with phosphorus pentoxide It is of interest for the preparation of explosives It is a deliquescent colourless crystalline solid that is sensitive to light In the solid state it is ionic with structure NO NO as a gas and in solution it is molecular O N O NO Hydration to nitric acid comes readily as does analogous reaction with hydrogen peroxide giving peroxonitric acid HOONO It is a violent oxidising agent Gaseous dinitrogen pentoxide decomposes as follows br br N O NO NO NO O NO br N O NO NO br br br Oxoacids oxoanions and oxoacid salts br Many nitrogen oxoacids are known though most of them are unstable as pure compounds and are known only as aqueous solutions or as salts Hyponitrous acid H N O is a weak diprotic acid with the structure HON NOH pKa pKa Acidic solutions are quite stable but above pH base catalysed decomposition occurs via HONNO to nitrous oxide and the hydroxide anion Hyponitrites involving the N O anion are stable to reducing agents and more commonly act as reducing agents themselves They are an intermediate step in the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite which occurs in the nitrogen cycle Hyponitrite can act as a bridging or chelating bidentate ligand br Nitrous acid HNO is not known as a pure compound but is a common component in gaseous equilibria and is an important aqueous reagent its aqueous solutions may be made from acidifying cool aqueous nitrite NO bent solutions although already at room temperature disproportionation to nitrate and nitric oxide is significant It is a weak acid with pKa at C They may be titrimetrically analysed by their oxidation to nitrate by permanganate They are readily reduced to nitrous oxide and nitric oxide by sulfur dioxide to hyponitrous acid with tin II and to ammonia with hydrogen sulfide Salts of hydrazinium N H react with nitrous acid to produce azides which further react to give nitrous oxide and nitrogen Sodium nitrite is mildly toxic in concentrations above mg kg but small amounts are often used to cure meat and as a preservative to avoid bacterial spoilage It is also used to synthesise hydroxylamine and to diazotise primary aromatic amines as follows br br ArNH HNO ArNN Cl H O br Nitrite is also a common ligand that can coordinate in five ways The most common are nitro bonded from the nitrogen and nitrito bonded from an oxygen Nitro nitrito isomerism is common where the nitrito form is usually less stable br br Nitric acid HNO is by far the most important and the most stable of the nitrogen oxoacids It is one of the three most used acids the other two being sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid and was first discovered by alchemists in the th century It is made by the catalytic oxidation of ammonia to nitric oxide which is oxidised to nitrogen dioxide and then dissolved in water to give concentrated nitric acid In the United States of America over seven million tonnes of nitric acid are produced every year most of which is used for nitrate production for fertilisers and explosives among other uses Anhydrous nitric acid may be made by distilling concentrated nitric acid with phosphorus pentoxide at low pressure in glass apparatus in the dark It can only be made in the solid state because upon melting it spontaneously decomposes to nitrogen dioxide and liquid nitric acid undergoes self ionisation to a larger extent than any other covalent liquid as follows br br HNO H NO NO H O NO NO br Two hydrates HNO H O and HNO H O are known that can be crystallised It is a strong acid and concentrated solutions are strong oxidising agents though gold platinum rhodium and iridium are immune to attack A mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and nitric acid called aqua regia is still stronger and successfully dissolves gold and platinum because free chlorine and nitrosyl chloride are formed and chloride anions can form strong complexes In concentrated sulfuric acid nitric acid is protonated to form nitronium which can act as an electrophile for aromatic nitration br br HNO H SO NO H O HSO br The thermal stabilities of nitrates involving the trigonal planar NO anion depends on the basicity of the metal and so do the products of decomposition thermolysis which can vary between the nitrite for example sodium the oxide potassium and lead or even the metal itself silver depending on their relative stabilities Nitrate is also a common ligand with many modes of coordination br Finally although orthonitric acid H NO which would be analogous to orthophosphoric acid does not exist the tetrahedral orthonitrate anion NO is known in its sodium and potassium salts br br br br br br br NaNO br br br br br br br br br br br br br Na br br br br br br br br O br br

limited chemistry the orthonitrate anion is interesting from a structural point of view due to its regular tetrahedral shape and the short N O bond lengths implying significant polar character to the bonding br br br Organic nitrogen compounds br Nitrogen is one of the most important elements in organic chemistry Many organic functional groups involve a carbon nitrogen bond such as amides RCONR amines R N imines RC NR R imides RCO NR azides RN azo compounds RN R cyanates ROCN isocyanates RNCO nitrates RONO nitriles RCN isonitriles RNC nitrites RONO nitro compounds RNO nitroso compounds RNO oximes RC NOH R and pyridine derivatives C N bonds are strongly polarised towards nitrogen In these compounds nitrogen is usually trivalent though it can be tetravalent in quaternary ammonium salts R N with a lone pair that can confer basicity on the compound by being coordinated to a proton This may be offset by other factors for example amides are not basic because the lone pair is delocalised into a double bond though they may act as bases at very low pH being protonated at the oxygen and pyrrole is not basic because the lone pair is delocalised as part of an aromatic ring The amount of nitrogen in a chemical substance can be determined by the Kjeldahl method In particular nitrogen is an essential component of nucleic acids amino acids and thus proteins and the energy carrying molecule adenosine triphosphate and is thus vital to all life on Earth br br br Occurrence br br Nitrogen is the most common pure element in the earth making up of the volume of the atmosphere by mass around million gigatonnes Despite this it is not very abundant in Earth s crust making up somewhere around parts per million of this on par with niobium gallium and lithium This represents to a million gigatonnes of nitrogen depending on the mass of the crust The only important nitrogen minerals are nitre potassium nitrate saltpetre and soda nitre sodium nitrate Chilean saltpetre However these have not been an important source of nitrates since the s when the industrial synthesis of ammonia and nitric acid became common br Nitrogen compounds constantly interchange between the atmosphere and living organisms Nitrogen must first be processed or fixed into a plant usable form usually ammonia Some nitrogen fixation is done by lightning strikes producing the nitrogen oxides but most is done by diazotrophic bacteria through enzymes known as nitrogenases although today industrial nitrogen fixation to ammonia is also significant When the ammonia is taken up by plants it is used to synthesise proteins These plants are then digested by animals who use the nitrogen compounds to synthesise their proteins and excrete nitrogen bearing waste Finally these organisms die and decompose undergoing bacterial and environmental oxidation and denitrification returning free dinitrogen to the atmosphere Industrial nitrogen fixation by the Haber process is mostly used as fertiliser although excess nitrogen bearing waste when leached leads to eutrophication of freshwater and the creation of marine dead zones as nitrogen driven bacterial growth depletes water oxygen to the point that all higher organisms die Furthermore nitrous oxide which is produced during denitrification attacks the atmospheric ozone layer br Many saltwater fish manufacture large amounts of trimethylamine oxide to protect them from the high osmotic effects of their environment conversion of this compound to dimethylamine is responsible for the early odour in unfresh saltwater fish In animals free radical nitric oxide derived from an amino acid serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation br Nitric oxide s rapid reaction with water in animals results in the production of its metabolite nitrite Animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins in general results in the excretion of urea while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in the excretion of urea and uric acid The characteristic odour of animal flesh decay is caused by the creation of long chain nitrogen containing amines such as putrescine and cadaverine which are breakdown products of the amino acids ornithine and lysine respectively in decaying proteins br br br Production br Nitrogen gas is an industrial gas produced by the fractional distillation of liquid air or by mechanical means using gaseous air pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption PSA are typically more cost and energy efficient than bulk delivered nitrogen Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN oxygen free nitrogen Commercial grade nitrogen already contains at most ppm oxygen and specially purified grades containing at most ppm oxygen and ppm argon are also available br In a chemical laboratory it is prepared by treating an aqueous solution of ammonium chloride with sodium nitrite br br NH Cl NaNO N NaCl H O br Small amounts of the impurities NO and HNO are also formed in this reaction The impurities can be removed by passing the gas through aqueous sulfuric acid containing potassium dichromate br It can also be obtained by the thermal decomposition of ammonium dichromate br br NH Cr O N H O Cr O NH O br Very pure nitrogen can be prepared by the thermal decomposition of barium azide or sodium azide br br NaN Na N br br br Applications br The applications of nitrogen compounds are naturally extremely widely varied due to the huge size of this class hence only applications of pure nitrogen itself will be considered here Two thirds of nitrogen produced by industry is sold as gas and the remaining one third as a liquid br br br Gas br The gas is mostly used as a low reactivity safe atmosphere wherever the oxygen in the air would pose a fire explosion or oxidising hazard Some examples include br br As a modified atmosphere pure or mixed with carbon dioxide to nitrogenate and preserve the freshness of packaged or bulk foods by delaying rancidity and other forms of oxidative damage Pure nitrogen as food additive is labeled in the European Union with the E number E br In incandescent light bulbs as an inexpensive alternative to argon br In fire suppression systems for Information technology IT equipment br In the manufacture of stainless steel br In the case hardening of steel by nitriding br In some aircraft fuel systems to reduce fire hazard see inerting system br To inflate race car and aircraft tires reducing the problems of inconsistent expansion and contraction caused by moisture and oxygen in natural air br Nitrogen is commonly used during sample preparation in chemical analysis It is used to concentrate and reduce the volume of liquid samples Directing a pressurised stream of nitrogen gas perpendicular to the surface of the liquid causes the solvent to evaporate while leaving the solute s and un evaporated solvent behind br Nitrogen can be used as a replacement or in combination with carbon dioxide to pressurise kegs of some beers particularly stouts and British ales due to the smaller bubbles it produces which makes the dispensed beer smoother and headier A pressure sensitive nitrogen capsule known commonly as a widget allows nitrogen charged beers to be packaged in cans and bottles Nitrogen tanks are also replacing carbon dioxide as the main power source for paintball guns Nitrogen must be kept at a higher pressure than CO making N tanks heavier and more expensive br br br Equipment br Some construction equipment uses pressurized nitrogen gas to help hydraulic system to provide extra power to devices such as hydraulic hammer Nitrogen gas formed from the decomposition of sodium azide is used for the inflation of airbags br br br Execution br br As nitrogen is an asphyxiant gas in itself some jurisdictions have considered asphyxiation by inhalation of pure nitrogen as a means of capital punishment as a substitute for lethal injection In January Kenneth Eugene Smith became the first person executed by nitrogen asphyxiation br br br Liquid br br Liquid nitrogen is a cryogenic liquid which looks like water When insulated in proper containers such as dewar flasks it can be transported and stored with a low rate of evaporative loss br br Like dry ice the main use of liquid nitrogen is for cooling to low temperatures It is used in the cryopreservation of biological materials such as blood and reproductive cells sperm and eggs It is used in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin by freezing them It is used in laboratory cold traps and in cryopumps to obtain lower pressures in vacuum pumped systems It is used to cool heat sensitive electronics such as infrared detectors and X ray detectors Other uses include freeze grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature shrink fitting and assembling engineering components and more generally to attain very low temperatures where necessary Because of its low cost liquid nitrogen is often used for cooling even when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary such as refrigeration of food freeze branding livestock freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath br br br Safety br br br Gas br Although nitrogen is non toxic when released into an enclosed space it can displace oxygen and therefore presents an asphyxiation hazard This may happen with few warning symptoms since the human carotid body is a relatively poor and slow low oxygen hypoxia sensing system An example occurred shortly before the launch of the first Space Shuttle mission on March when two technicians died from asphyxiation after they walked into a space located in the Space Shuttle s mobile launcher platform that was pressurised with pure nitrogen as a precaution against fire br When inhaled at high partial pressures more than about bar encountered at depths below about m in scuba diving nitrogen is an anesthetic agent causing nitrogen narcosis a temporary state of mental impairment similar to nitrous oxide intoxication br Nitrogen dissolves in the blood and body fats Rapid decompression as when divers ascend too quickly or astronauts decompress too quickly from cabin pressure to spacesuit pressure can lead to a potentially fatal condition called decompression sickness formerly known as caisson sickness or the bends when nitrogen bubbles form in the bloodstream nerves joints and other sensitive or vital areas Bubbles from other inert gases gases other than carbon dioxide and oxygen cause the same effects so replacement of nitrogen in breathing gases may prevent nitrogen narcosis but does not prevent decompression sickness br br br Liquid br As a cryogenic liquid liquid nitrogen can be dangerous by causing cold burns on contact although the Leidenfrost effect provides protection for very short exposure about one second Ingestion of liquid nitrogen can cause severe internal damage For example in a young woman in England had to have her stomach removed after ingesting a cocktail made with liquid nitrogen br Because the liquid to gas expansion ratio of nitrogen is at C a tremendous amount of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in an enclosed space In an incident on January at Texas A M University the pressure relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup the tank failed catastrophically The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it and blow the walls of the laboratory m off their foundations br Liquid nitrogen readily evaporates to form gaseous nitrogen and hence the precautions associated with gaseous nitrogen also apply to liquid nitrogen For example oxygen sensors are sometimes used as a safety precaution when working with liquid nitrogen to alert workers of gas spills into a confined space br Vessels containing liquid nitrogen can condense oxygen from air The liquid in such a vessel becomes increasingly enriched in oxygen boiling point C higher than that of nitrogen as the nitrogen evaporates and can cause violent oxidation of organic material br br br Oxygen deficiency monitors br Oxygen deficiency monitors are used to measure levels of oxygen in confined spaces and any place where nitrogen gas or liquid are stored or used In the event of a nitrogen leak and a decrease in oxygen to a pre set alarm level an oxygen deficiency monitor can be programmed to set off audible and visual alarms thereby providing notification of the possible impending danger Most commonly the oxygen range to alert personnel is when oxygen levels get below OSHA specifies that a hazardous atmosphere may include one where the oxygen concentration is below or above br Oxygen deficiency monitors can either be fixed mounted to the wall and hard wired into the building s power supply or simply plugged into a power outlet or a portable hand held or wearable monitor br br br See also br Reactive nitrogen species br
