title: Compression ratio
id: 6863
The compression ratio is the ratio between the volume of the cylinder and combustion chamber in an internal combustion engine at their maximum and minimum values br A fundamental specification for such engines it is measured two ways the static compression ratio calculated based on the volume of the cylinder when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke and the volume of the cylinder when the piston is at the top of its stroke br The dynamic compression ratio is a more advanced calculation which also takes into account gases entering and exiting the cylinder during the compression phase br br br Effect and typical ratios br A high compression ratio is desirable because it allows an engine to extract more mechanical energy from a given mass of air fuel mixture due to its higher thermal efficiency This occurs because internal combustion engines are heat engines and higher compression ratios permit the same combustion temperature to be reached with less fuel while giving a longer expansion cycle creating more mechanical power output and lowering the exhaust temperature br br br Petrol engines br In petrol gasoline engines used in passenger cars for the past years compression ratios have typically been between and Several production engines have used higher compression ratios including br br Cars built from which were designed for high octane leaded gasoline which allowed compression ratios up to br Some Mazda SkyActiv engines released since have compression ratios up to The SkyActiv engine achieves this compression ratio with ordinary unleaded gasoline RON in the United Kingdom through improved scavenging of exhaust gases which ensures cylinder temperature is as low as possible before the intake stroke in addition to direct injection br Toyota Dynamic Force engine has a compression ratio up to br The Ferrari Speciale also has a compression ratio of br When forced induction e g a turbocharger or supercharger is used the compression ratio is often lower than naturally aspirated engines This is due to the turbocharger or supercharger already having compressed the air before it enters the cylinders Engines using port fuel injection typically run lower boost pressures and or compression ratios than direct injected engines because port fuel injection causes the air fuel mixture to be heated together leading to detonation Conversely directly injected engines can run higher boost because heated air will not detonate without a fuel being present br Higher compression ratios can make gasoline petrol engines subject to engine knocking also known as detonation pre ignition or pinging if lower octane rated fuel is used This can reduce efficiency or damage the engine if knock sensors are not present to modify the ignition timing br br br Diesel engines br Diesel engines use higher compression ratios than petrol engines because the lack of a spark plug means that the compression ratio must increase the temperature of the air in the cylinder sufficiently to ignite the diesel using compression ignition Compression ratios are often between and for direct injection diesel engines and between and for indirect injection diesel engines br At the lower end of NOx emissions are reduced at a cost of more difficult cold start Mazda s Skyactiv D the first such commercial engine from used adaptive fuel injectors among other techniques to ease cold start br br br Other fuels br The compression ratio may be higher in engines running exclusively on liquefied petroleum gas LPG or propane autogas or compressed natural gas due to the higher octane rating of these fuels br Kerosene engines typically use a compression ratio of or lower The petrol paraffin engine version of the Ferguson TE tractor had a compression ratio of for operation on tractor vaporising oil with an octane rating between and br br br Motorsport engines br Motorsport engines often run on high octane petrol and can therefore use higher compression ratios For example motorcycle racing engines can use compression ratios as high as and it is common to find motorcycles with compression ratios above designed for or higher octane fuel br Ethanol and methanol can take significantly higher compression ratios than gasoline Racing engines burning methanol and ethanol fuel often have a compression ratio of to br br br Mathematical formula br In a piston engine the

usually measured directly This is often done by filling the cylinder with liquid and then measuring the volume of the used liquid br br br Variable compression ratio engines br br Most engines use a fixed compression ratio however a variable compression ratio engine is able to adjust the compression ratio while the engine is in operation The first production engine with a variable compression ratio was introduced in br Variable compression ratio is a technology to adjust the compression ratio of an internal combustion engine while the engine is in operation This is done to increase fuel efficiency while under varying loads Variable compression engines allow the volume above the piston at top dead centre to be changed br Higher loads require lower ratios to increase power while lower loads need higher ratios to increase efficiency i e to lower fuel consumption For automotive use this needs to be done as the engine is running in response to the load and driving demands br The Infiniti QX is the first commercially available car that uses a variable compression ratio engine br br br Dynamic compression ratio br br The static compression ratio discussed above calculated solely based on the cylinder and combustion chamber volumes does not take into account any gases entering or exiting the cylinder during the compression phase In most automotive engines the intake valve closure which seals the cylinder takes place during the compression phase i e after bottom dead centre BDC which can cause some of the gases to be pushed back out through the intake valve On the other hand intake port tuning and scavenging can cause a greater amount of gas to be trapped in the cylinder than the static volume would suggest The dynamic compression ratio accounts for these factors br The dynamic compression ratio is higher with more conservative intake camshaft timing i e soon after BDC and lower with more radical intake camshaft timing i e later after BDC Regardless the dynamic compression ratio is always lower than the static compression ratio br Absolute cylinder pressure is used to calculate the dynamic compression ratio using the following formula br br br br

br br displaystyle gamma br br is a polytropic value for the ratio of specific heats for the combustion gases at the temperatures present this compensates for the temperature rise caused by compression as well as heat lost to the cylinder br Under ideal adiabatic conditions the ratio of specific heats would be but a lower value generally between and is used since the amount of heat lost will vary among engines based on design size and materials used For example if the static compression ratio is and the dynamic compression ratio is a useful value for cylinder pressure would be atmospheric pressure or bar relative to atmospheric pressure br The two corrections for dynamic compression ratio affect cylinder pressure in opposite directions but not in equal strength An engine with high static compression ratio and late intake valve closure will have a dynamic compression ratio similar to an engine with lower compression but earlier intake valve closure br br br See also br
