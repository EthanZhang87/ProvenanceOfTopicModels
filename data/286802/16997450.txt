An exhaust gas temperature gauge EGT gauge or EGT sensor is a meter used to monitor the exhaust gas temperature of an internal combustion engine in conjunction with a thermocouple type pyrometer EGT gauges are found in certain cars and aeroplanes By monitoring EGT the driver or pilot can get an idea of the vehicle s air fuel ratio AFR br At a stoichiometric air fuel ratio the exhaust gas temperature is different from that in a lean or rich air fuel ratio At rich air fuel ratio the exhaust gas temperature either increases or decreases depending on the fuel High temperatures typically above F or C can be an indicator of dangerous conditions that can lead to catastrophic engine failure br br br Applications br Most light piston aircraft still have manual mixture controls and pilots use an EGT gauge to set the optimal fuel air mixture for their current density altitude and power The hottest cylinder head temperatures CHT and highest internal cylinder pressures occur around F C rich of peak EGT and risk predetonation making it essential to avoid that range and operate either lean of peak EGT or richer than F C rich of peak EGT Leaner mixtures result in significant fuel savings but may result in rough operation of some carbureted or poorly tuned fuel injected engines Jet aircraft used EGT gauges which were monitored by the flight engineer during engine startup and throughout the whole flight EGT gauges were then implemented into the interfaces of EICAS and ECAM in glass cockpits br EGT meters are used for tuning turbo equipped cars If the sensor is installed at the manifold collector before the turbo the turbine inlet temperature can be monitored If the sensor is installed after the turbo the exhaust temperature can be monitored Because EGT typically drops F C across the turbine installers try to put the thermocouple as close to the cylinder head as possible to give a true reading and a reading that will react faster to the engine s condition compared to an installation after the turbo br Air cooled engines like used in Volkswagen Porsche and other cars can be damaged by over heating An exhaust gas temperature gauge can be used to prevent damage br Air cooled motorcycle engines also can be damaged by over heating br br br Oxygen sensor br Using an EGT meter alone is considered an older technique for getting the most out of petrol and diesel engines as gauge type wideband digital oxygen sensors are similarly priced However some advanced racers will use EGT gauges in combination with a wideband oxygen sensor to lean the fuel ratio a bit to safely raise the temperature for more power br br br Advanced tuning br Though by tuning primarily by EGT and air fuel ratio values EGT is still to this day a used data output for engine tuning When fine tuning an engine if possible with the ECU manipulation with the cylinder s timing can be made By adjusting the timing the resultant cylinder temperature can be used to improve cylinder efficiency Though this is still widely done EGT values should be used as a safe guard sensor measure and as a tuning guide br br br br br br External links br Benefits of individual cylinder tuning at the Wayback Machine archived September
