E is an abbreviation typically referring to an ethanol fuel blend of ethanol fuel and gasoline or other hydrocarbon by volume br In the United States the exact ratio of fuel ethanol to hydrocarbon may vary according to ASTM that specifies the allowable ethanol content in E as ranging from to This is due to the lower heating value of neat ethanol making it difficult to start engines in relatively cold climates without pre heating air intake faster cranking or mixing varying fractions of gasoline according to climate Cold starting in cold climates is the primary reason ethanol fuel is blended with any gasoline fraction br In Brazil ethanol fuel is neat at the pumps hence flexible fuel vehicles FFV including trucks tractors motorbikes and mopeds run on E The fraction is commonly sold at pumps worldwide outside the US and when specifically supplied or sold as E is always ethanol at pumps or in barrel Having a guaranteed ethanol fraction obviates the need for a vehicle system to calculate best engine tune according to maximise performance and economy br In countries like Australia where E is always ethanol and pump fuel with varying fractions is called flex fuel performance motoring enthusiasts and motor racing clubs championships use E extensively without the need for any FFV certification Use of alcohol ethanol and methanol in motor racing history parallels the invention of the automobile favoured due to inherent combustion characteristics such as high thermal efficiency high octane rating raised torque and with some advanced engines better specific fuel consumption In the United States government subsidies of ethanol in general and E in particular have encouraged a growing infrastructure for the retail sale of E especially in corn growing states in the Midwest br br br Fuel economy br br br Specific fuel consumption br E promoters and the Society of Automotive Engineers contend that automotive manufacturers currently fail to equal the fuel consumption of gasoline because they fail to take advantages of characteristics which are superior in ethanol based fuel blends They claim that some ethanol engines have already produced more miles per gallon than identical gasoline engines br Ethanol advocates also state that it is a mistake to base ethanol engine design on gasoline engine design and that ethanol engines should be based on diesel engine design parameters instead Using this approach the EPA has produced an ethanol only engine which achieves much higher brake thermal efficiency levels than gasoline engines achieve Mileage is dependent upon the composition of the ethanol gasoline blend transmission state of engine tune primarily fuel air mixture spark timing and compression ratio In the United States to offset this difference in fuel consumption in vehicles not optimised for ethanol legislation has been passed to subsidize its cost br br br Energy value br In contrast ethanol critics contest the benefits of E by focusing on the fact that E has lower heating value compared to the higher heating value of gasoline However comparing energy expressed as a value of heat does not reflect the total work from an Otto Cycle Because energy content does not factor certain latent or specific heat values nor combustion pressure looking at heat alone in the combustion equation does not determine efficiency or work according to the laws of thermodynamics br br br Octane and performance br br br Use in flexible fuel vehicles br E ethanol is used in engines modified to accept higher concentrations of ethanol In the US such FFVs are designed to run on any mixture of gasoline or ethanol up to ethanol whereas in countries such as Brazil where the climate is typically warmer FFVs run on neat alcohol There are a few major differences between FFVs and non FFVs One is the elimination of bare magnesium aluminum and rubber parts in the fuel system Fuel injection control systems have a wider range of pulse widths to inject up to more fuel which in turn produces more power Stainless steel fuel lines sometimes lined with plastic and stainless steel fuel tanks in place of terne tinplate fuel tanks have been used In some cases FFVs use specific engine oil that neutralises acidity For vehicles with in tank mounted fuel pumps precautions to prevent arcing as well as flame arrestors positioned in the tank s fill pipe are sometimes used br br br Octane rating br As more effort is put into maximizing an engine to take advantage of E s higher octane rating engines achieve greater power advantages One car that has higher power on ethanol is the Koenigsegg CCXR which on ethanol is the fifth most powerful production car with more horsepower on E than on gasoline According to the manufacturer this is due to the cooling properties of ethanol E has an octane rating higher than that of regular gasoline s typical rating of or premium gasoline s This allows it to be used in higher compression engines which tend to produce more power per unit of displacement than their gasoline counterparts Examples of octane mis citation can be found at the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association titled E Facts which cites a range of and a document at the Texas State Energy Conservation Office titled Ethanol which cites a rating br Some vehicles can be converted to use E despite not being specifically built for it Because of the lower heating value E has a cooler intake charge which coupled with its high stability level from its high octane rating has also been used as a power adder in turbocharged performance vehicles These modifications have not only resulted in lower GHG emissions but typically resulted in power and torque increase at the wheels Where the engine was previously knock limited by gasoline power improvements are as high as br Because of its low price and high availability in certain areas people have started to turn to using it in place of high end racing fuels which typically cost over US gal br br br Emissions br There are four primary types of pollutants scientists study These emissions are hydrocarbons HC oxides of nitrogen NOx carbon monoxide CO and carbon dioxide CO Because E is predominantly ethanol the exhaust emissions are very different from those of regular gasoline Numerous studies have compared and contrasted the different emissions and the effects these emissions have on the environment but the tests have been inconclusive The tests have shown very little consistency if any at all because there are too many variables involved The make and model of the vehicle the way in which the ethanol was produced and the vehicle s overall fuel efficiency all play a large role in the overall outcome of each study To address the problem of inaccuracy engineers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory combined data from all applicable emissions studies and compiled them into one data set This compiled set of data showed that on average all emissions that are federally regulated showed a decrease or no statistically relevant difference between E and gasoline br EPA s stringent tier II vehicle emission standards require that FFVs achieve the same low emissions level regardless whether E or gasoline is used However E can further reduce emissions of certain pollutants as compared to conventional gasoline or lower volume ethanol blends For example E is less volatile than gasoline or low volume ethanol blends which results in fewer evaporative emissions Using E also reduces carbon monoxide emissions and provides significant reductions in emissions of many harmful toxics including benzene a known human carcinogen However E in certain engine operating conditions may increase emissions of acetaldehyde EPA is conducting additional analysis to expand our understanding of the emissions impacts of E br br br Controversy br br br Economics br A study by Purdue University found that the economic benefit of E is highly dependent on the price of crude oil br br br Food vs fuel br br E critics contend that production of ethanol from corn maize drives up world food prices causing corn to be unaffordable or even unavailable E advocates counter that concern by pointing out that over of all corn grown in the United States is never fed directly to people but is instead used as livestock feed Corn used to produce ethanol contains a high amount of starch and is not easily digestible by humans like sweet corn American farmers grow more corn than people purchase there is an annual surplus of corn in the U S br E advocates say that corn prices have increased due to manipulation of the commodities markets and because American corn companies sell more and more US grown corn to Mexico and China creating more competition for corn buyers and therefore driving up its price E critics contend that ethanol producers may not reduce carbon emissions due to the petroleum and natural gas used in raising corn and refining it E advocates reply by pointing to ethanol producers who do not do so but instead use E or biodiesel fuel to transport E and use biomass as a heat source for the distillation of ethanol instead of petro products like natural gas br Some say that cellulosic ethanol produced from waste materials or fast growing non food crops such as switchgrass is much more beneficial but not yet economically practical at large scale Others say that the world can easily replace all of its use of petroleum by simply making ethanol from the many crops that yield more ethanol per acre than corn yields with existing technology not future technology and that certain elements in the cellulosic ethanol field are more interested in patent rights than in producing the greatest amount of ethanol at the lowest price point br br br Availability and price br br E is increasingly common in the United States mainly in the Midwest where corn is a major crop and is the primary source material for ethanol fuel production As of July there were more than fuel stations that offered E fuel E as a fuel is widely used in Sweden however most of it is imported from Italy and Brazil E was formerly available from the Maxol chain in Ireland where it was made from whey a byproduct of cheese manufacturing The availability ended in due to a severe excise duty hike which rendered it economically unviable In Finland E is available from St chain locations and ABC chain locations The E sold by St is labeled as RE and as Eko E in ABC stations to indicate it is manufactured from Finnish bio waste br By way of international price comparison in the Cook Islands as with many of the Pacific Islands cost of producing ethanol from coconut biomass is a fraction of obtaining fossil fuels In France about of gas stations supply E or about stations and the number of flex fuel kits installed doubled in to kits from the previous year E was launched in the United Kingdom on March by the Morrisons supermarket chain The Morrisons branch in Norwich was the first forecourt to introduce E Take up however was very low and E is now only available at a small number of outlets br br br US price regulation br The American Jobs Creation Act of created the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit VEETC to subsidize production costs The Farm Bill reduced the VEETC s cent tax credit to cents Other measures taken by Congress to jump start ethanol production include the VEETC bill which provided for a Small Ethanol Producer Tax Credit which gave tax credits to small ethanol producers More recently the Tax Relief Act Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization Act and Job Creation Act of extended the tax cuts allowed by VEETC from the end of to the end of In the United States to realize equivalent fuel economy at the pump with an FFV the price of E must be much lower than gasoline E was at least less expensive in most areas as recently as In one US test a Chevy Tahoe FFV averaged MPG U S gallons for gasoline and MPG for E worse than gasoline However in Australia where Holden has sold more than FFVs since the difference in combined consumption on similar V variants in a family sedan is between and In the cost of fuel in the US averaged US while the cost for E averaged US or of the cost of gasoline In another test however a fleet of Ford Tauruses averaged only about fewer miles per gallon in ethanol based vehicles
