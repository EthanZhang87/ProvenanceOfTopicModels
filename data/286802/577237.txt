In an internal combustion engine forced induction is where turbocharging or supercharging is used to increase the density of the intake air Engines without forced induction are classified as naturally aspirated br br br Operating principle br br br Overview br Forced induction is often used to increase the power output of an engine This is achieved by compressing the intake air to increase the mass of the air fuel mixture present within the combustion chamber A naturally aspirated engine is limited to a maximum intake air pressure equal to its surrounding atmosphere however a forced induction engine produces boost whereby the air pressure is higher than the surrounding atmosphere Since the density of air increases with pressure this allows a greater mass of air to enter the combustion chamber br Theoretically the vapour power cycle analysis of the second law of thermodynamics would suggest that increasing the mean effective pressure within the combustion chamber would also increase the engine s thermal efficiency However considerations such as cooling the combustion chamber preventing engine knock and limiting NOx exhaust emissions can mean that forced induction engines are not always more fuel efficient particularly in the case of high performance engines br br br Diesel engines br Four stroke diesel engines are well suited to forced induction since the lack of fuel in the intake air means that higher compression ratios can be used without a risk of pre ignition Therefore the use of turbochargers on diesel engines is relatively commonplace br Two stroke diesel engines have a significantly different operating principle to two strokes petrol engines and require some form of forced induction generally a supercharger in order to function br br br High altitude uses br A reduced density of intake air is caused by the loss of atmospheric density seen with elevated altitudes Therefore an early use of forced induction was in aircraft engines At feet m the air is at half the pressure of sea level which means that an engine without forced induction would produce less than half the power at this altitude Forced induction is used to artificially increase the density of the intake air in order to reduce the loss of power at higher altitudes br Systems that use a turbocharger to maintain an engine s sea level power output are called turbo normalized systems Generally a turbo normalized system attempts to maintain a manifold pressure of inHg kPa br br br Types of compressors br br The most commonly used forced induction devices are turbochargers and superchargers A turbocharger drives its compressor using a turbine powered by the flow of exhaust gases whereas a supercharger is mechanically powered by the engine usually using a belt from the engine s crankshaft br br br Associated technologies br Intercooling is often used to reduce the temperature of the intake air after it is compressed Another less commonly used method is water injection or methanol injection br br br
