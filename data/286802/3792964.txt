A NOx adsorber or NOx trap also called Lean NOx trap abbr LNT is a device that is used to reduce oxides of nitrogen NO and NO emissions from a lean burn internal combustion engine by means of adsorption br br br Purpose and function of a NOx adsorber br A NOx adsorber is designed to reduce oxides of nitrogen emitted in the exhaust gas of a lean burn internal combustion engine Lean burn engines particularly diesels present a special challenge to emission control system designers because of the relatively high levels of O atmospheric oxygen in the exhaust gas The way catalytic converter that has been successfully used since the s on stoichiometric engines such as fueled by petrol LPG CNG or ethanol will not function at O levels in excess of and does not function well at levels above Because of the increasing need to limit NOx emissions from diesel engines technologies such as exhaust gas recirculation EGR and selective catalytic reduction SCR have been used however EGR is of limited effectiveness and SCR requires a continuous supply of reductant to the exhaust br The NOx adsorber was designed to avoid the problems that EGR and SCR experienced An adsorbant such as zeolite traps the NO and NO molecules acting as a molecular sponge Once the trap is full like a sponge full of water no more NOx can be absorbed Various schemes have been designed to purge or regenerate the trap Normally the engine is operated for a short time in rich mode and produces CO as reactant Another possible reactants used to this aim is diesel fuel Injection of diesel fuel before the adsorber can purge it the NOx is made to desorb and react with hydrocarbons under rich conditions to produce water and nitrogen Also hydrogen is a good reductant but is dangerous and difficult to store Some experimental systems have used fuel reformers for on board hydrogen generation br br br Market use br br A NOx trap is used on the Volkswagen Jetta TDI and the Volkswagen Tiguan concepts Both are projected to be introduced into the American market by They were to be marketed as part of the BlueTec program from Audi Daimler Chrysler and Volkswagen br In an ADAC study ordered by ICCT of Euro cars showed that few complied with on road emission limits and LNT cars had the highest emissions br br br Technical details br The NOx adsorber is based on a monolithic catalyst support that has been coated with a NOx adsorbing washcoat such as one containing zeolites Alkali alkaline oxide carbonate can also be used as the adsorbant br Traps are gradually poisoned by SOx which adsorbs more strongly than NOx It necessitates a periodic high temperature regeneration that tends to reduce the adsorber s operating life br br br
