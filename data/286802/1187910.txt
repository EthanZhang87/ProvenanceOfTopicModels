Norilsk Russian IPA n r il sk is a closed city in Krasnoyarsk Krai Russia located south of the western Taymyr Peninsula around km east of the Yenisey River and km north of Krasnoyarsk Norilsk is km north of the Arctic Circle and km from the North Pole It has a permanent population of and up to including temporary inhabitants It is the second largest city in the region after Krasnoyarsk Since Norilsk s population has grown steadily In for the first time migration to the city exceeded outflow In according to Krasnoyarskstat natural population growth amounted to people were born and died br It is the world s northernmost city with more than inhabitants and the second largest city after Murmansk inside the Arctic Circle Norilsk and Yakutsk are the only large cities in the continuous permafrost zone br Norilsk is located atop some of the largest nickel deposits on Earth Consequently mining and smelting ore are the major industries Norilsk is the center of a region where nickel copper cobalt platinum palladium and coal are mined The presence of mineral deposits in the Siberian Craton was known for two centuries before Norilsk was founded but mining began only in when subterranean portions of the Norilsk Talnakh intrusions were found beneath mountainous terrain br In two satellite cities Talnakh and Kayerkan became districts of the city of Norilsk and Oganer became a suburb of Norilsk s Central District The jurisdiction of Norilsk also extends to the settlement of Snezhnogorsk which originated in as a settlement to accommodate the builders of the Ust Khantai Hydroelectric Power Station br Access to Norilsk is restricted for foreign citizens who are required to obtain special permission to visit the city br br br Name br Norilsk owes its name to its geographical location The Norilsk river flows near the city which is located near the Norilsk mountains The travelers Khariton Laptev Alexander Fyodorovich Middendorf and Fedor Bogdanovich Schmidt mentioned the river Norilsk and the Norilsk mountains in their accounts br According to the Soviet Arctic explorer Nikolay Urvantsev the Norilsk river was probably given its former name Norilka in the th th centuries during the existence of the city Mangazeya when the Taymyr was settled by Russian fishing people It is likely that the name of the river comes from the word norilo a long thin pole that was used to stretch a string of trap nets from hole to hole under the ice br Some argue the name derives from the Yukagir word nerile meaning an earthen hill consisting of some crags cliffs the mountains around Norilsk do indeed resemble neriles Others suggest the name of the river Norilka and accordingly the city name come from the Evenk word narus or nioril in Yukaghir which mean swamps It may also have originated from the name of an Evenk tribe the Nyurilians or from the name of the nearby Lake Murilskoye br br br History br br People knew about the minerals in the Norilsk area as early as the Bronze Age A site with primitive equipment for smelting and casting as well as raw materials balls of native copper has been discovered near Lake Pyasino br In the th th centuries copper from the Norilsk deposits was used by the inhabitants of Mangazeya a city located beyond the Arctic Circle on the Taz River which was an important regional trading and craft center During the excavations of Mangazeya in professor Mikhail Ivanovich Belov discovered a vast foundry yard Platinoids were found in the remains of the copper wares unearthed there br Geologist and explorer Nikolay Urvantsev carried out further study of the Norilsk region during expeditions from to which confirmed the presence of rich deposits of coal and polymetallic ores in the western spurs of the Putorana Plateau br br In during one of Urvantsev s expeditions a log cabin was built at the northern foot of Mount Schmidt This hut is considered to be the first building in Norilsk The cabin was later moved and is now located near Norilsk Museum It has the status of a historical monument br Norilsk was founded at the end of the s but the official date of the city s foundation is traditionally held to be when the Norillag system of Gulag labour camp was established and prisoners began construction work on the Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Plant Over the next few years Norilsk grew into a settlement for the Norilsk mining and metallurgical complex and it was granted urban type settlement status in and city status in br br In the late s architects began to design a new city on the eastern shore of Lake Dolgoye and Norillag prisoners started building work in In the summer of inmates from one of the Norillag camps Gorlag went on strike sparking the Norilsk Uprising br In construction began on the Salekhard Igarka Railway a line intended to cross northern Siberia The railway was to have linked the Arctic coal mining city of Vorkuta in European Russia to the Yenisei River via Salekhard and the Ob River A spacious railway station was built in Norilsk in the expectation that the city would eventually have a train service to Moscow but construction of the Salekhard Igarka Railway was halted after Joseph Stalin died in br To support the new city the Norilsk railway to the port of Dudinka on the Yenisei River was built first as a narrow gauge line winter later as a mm ft in Russian standard gauge line completed in the early s br Norillag was officially closed on August by order No of the Ministry of Internal Affairs According to the Norillag archives prisoners died in Norilsk as a result of forced labor starvation and intense cold during the years the camp was operational Fatalities were especially high during World War II from to when food supplies were particularly scarce An unknown yet significant number of prisoners continued to work and die in the mines until around br br Several memorial structures have been erected in the city to commemorate Norilsk s Gulag past Russian author Boris Ivanov wrote about the most famous one br br In the center of Norilsk on Gvardeyskaya Square in an atmosphere of solemnity a foundation stone was even set promising the construction of a monument on this spot to those who created the basis of the plant and this miracle city This basalt block weighing poods pounds kg delivered from Mount Rudnaya On a plaque attached to it are the words An obelisk will be built here an eternal reminder of the feat of the Norilsk people who conquered the tundra created our city and the plant The foundation stone was laid recently by historical standards on June br On July a monument to the Metallurgists of Norilsk was unveiled at the site of the foundation stone The foundation stone itself is part of the sculptural composition br In the s the Norilsk Golgotha memorial complex was built on the slope of Mount Schmidtikh to house the mass graves of the prisoners who founded the city Poland and the ex Soviet Baltic states have erected monuments to their countrymen who died here Icon lamps also burn in an Orthodox chapel set on the mountainside br The discovery in of the Oktyabrskoye deposit of copper nickel ores located kilometers northeast of Norilsk was a milestone in the further development of the region The mining settlement of Talnakh was founded at the same time A new complex the Nadezhda Metallurgical Plant was built km west of Norilsk to process the raw materials from the new deposits Work began in and the complex was finished in br A number of Finnish companies assisted in the construction and automation of Norilsk s No copper and nickel smelters in the Nadezhda complex which led to substantial numbers of Finnish metallurgical and automation experts and their families coming to Norilsk from onward creating a Finnish expat community of some hundreds of people for a couple of years br br Today Talnakh is the area s major mining and ore enrichment site Enriched ore emulsion is pumped from here to Norilsk s metallurgy plants br Enriched nickel and copper are transported from Dudinka to Murmansk by sea and from there to the Monchegorsk enrichment and smelting plant on the Kola Peninsula while more precious content goes upriver to Krasnoyarsk This transportation takes place only during the summer The port of Dudinka is closed and dismantled during spring flooding in late May when waters can rise by up to meters ft a typical spring occurrence on all Siberian rivers caused by winter ice obstructing meltwater from upstream br Norilsk Talnakh continues to be a dangerous mine to work in According to the mining company there were accidents per workers in In Norilsk Nickel claimed that it had reduced its overall lost time injury frequency rate LTIFR by almost since br In June tons of diesel fuel spilled from the tank of an NTEK power plant polluting hundreds of square kilometers and causing serious damage to the local ecosystem br Norilsk remains a closed city and foreign citizens require special permission to visit the area br br br Administrative and municipal status br Within the Russian system of administrative divisions it is together with the urban type settlement of Snezhnogorsk Krasnoyarsk Territory incorporated as the district city of Norilsk an administrative unit with a status equal to that of the districts As a municipal division the district city of Norilsk is incorporated as the Norilsk Urban Okrug br Since the city of Norilsk has been divided into three geographically disparate administrative districts br br Central District including

years br br br Legislative Assembly of the Krasnoyarsk Territory br In September the composition of the Legislative Assembly of the Krasnoyarsk Territory was updated Sergey Sizonenko was elected deputy for Taymyr constituency No br br br Demographics br br br Population br The population of Norilsk as of is After the fall of the USSR the population dropped by but this was offset by the subsequent merger of the towns of Kayerkan and Talnakh into Norilsk maintaining a permanent population of Including temporary residents the population can reach up to br Life expectancy for local residents is about years less than average Russian life expectancy which as of was around years br br br Ethnic composition br br The city has an ethnically diverse population As of the predominant ethnic and cultural groups were Russians Azerbaijanis Ukrainians Tatars Bashkirs Nogais Lezgins Kazakhs Ossetians Chuvash and Kyrgyz The population of Norilsk consists almost entirely of people who moved to the city in the second half of the th century and their descendants but many of the descendants of prisoners who were amnestied in still live in the city There are very few representatives of

ahead of UTC UTC and hours ahead of Moscow Time MSK br br br Geography br br Norilsk sits between the West Siberian Plain and Central Siberian Plateau at the foot of the meter high ft Putorana Mountains It is one of the world s most northerly settlements and is both the second largest city built on permafrost after Yakutsk and the second largest city inside the Arctic Circle after Murmansk Norilsk has an extremely harsh subarctic climate according to the K ppen climate classification it is between subarctic Dfc to tundra ET It is one of the coldest cities in the world far colder than Murmansk which is located at almost the same latitude br As a result of Norilsk s geographical isolation on the Taimyr Peninsula the rest of Russia is usually referred to as the mainland and expressions like move to the mainland or on the mainland are common among locals br br br Climate br Despite being located inside the Arctic Circle Norilsk has a subarctic climate K ppen climate classification Dfc with very long extremely cold winters from early October to May and very short mild summers Norilsk experiences negative temperatures for about days a year and snow cover lasts from seven to nine months with more than days of snowstorms Strong winds are common The average temperature in January is about C F br The midnight sun is above the horizon from May to July and the time when the sun does not rise polar night lasts from approximately November to January br Summer is short mid July and cool with an average July high of C F though temperatures can sometimes rise above C F br Norilsk has an average annual air temperature of C F with an annual variation of absolute temperatures of C F The average annual relative humidity is about br Though Norilsk is located south of the arctic tree line much of the surrounding area is naturally treeless tundra and there are very few trees in the city itself br br br Norilsk Talnakh nickel deposits br br The nickel deposits of Norilsk Talnakh are the largest known nickel copper palladium deposits in the world The deposit was formed million years ago during the eruption of the Siberian Traps igneous province STIP The STIP erupted over one million cubic kilometers of lava a large portion of it through a series of flat lying lava conduits below Norilsk and the Talnakh Mountains br The current resource known for these mineralized intrusion exceeds billion tons br Norilsk is a center of non ferrous metallurgy and is home to mining giant Norilsk Nickel s mining operations The smelting of the nickel ore is directly responsible for severe pollution which generally takes the form of acid rain and smog By some estimates Norilsk s nickel mines produce one percent of global sulfur dioxide SO emissions br br br Ecology br Norilsk is a city with an extremely unfavorable ecological and environmental situation but recent initiatives have begun to tackle some of the region s most serious pollution issues br br br Pollution br Russia s Federal State Statistics Service lists Norilsk as the most polluted city in Russia In Norilsk produced million tons of carbon pollutants nearly six times more than the tons that was generated by Russia s second most polluted city Cherepovets Norilsk the report states decontaminates almost half of its emissions br In addition the Blacksmith Institute has included Norilsk in its list of the most polluted places on Earth The list cites air pollution by particulates including radioisotopes strontium and caesium the metals nickel copper cobalt and lead selenium and by gases such as nitrogen and carbon oxides sulfur dioxide phenols and hydrogen sulfide The Institute estimates that million tons of cadmium copper lead nickel arsenic selenium and zinc are released into the air every year br Nickel ore is smelted at the company s processing site at Norilsk This smelting is directly responsible for severe pollution which generally comes in the form of acid rain and smog By some estimates Norilsk s nickel mines produce percent of global sulfur dioxide emissions Heavy metal pollution near Norilsk is so severe that it has now become economically feasible to mine surface soil as the soil has acquired such high concentrations of platinum and palladium br According to an April BBC News report Norilsk Nickel accepted personal responsibility for what had happened to the forests around the city and insisted that the company was implementing measures to reduce pollution In company chairman Vladimir Potanin admitted that environmental issues were the company s biggest problem br In September images surfaced on social media of the nearby Daldykan River which had turned red Russia s Environment Ministry issued a statement claiming that preliminary evidence pointed towards Nornickel owned wastewater pipes from a nearby smelting plant as the source of the contamination The company referred to intense rainfall and insisted that the incident of sedimentary coloring presented no danger to people or wildlife The smelting plant the company said was in the process of being modernized Nonetheless accusations of illegal waste dumping continue to plague the company br br br Environmental initiatives br The closure of the nickel plant in June was an important step toward the improvement of the environmental situation in the city and made it possible to cut annual pollutant emissions from the plant by about tons br Norilsk Nickel has stated that the total emissions of its Russian operations were lower in than in primarily thanks to the shutdown of the smelter Following the completion of a large scale project to upgrade the Talnakh concentrator the enterprise s capacity has grown by more than from to million tons of ore per year In addition to achieving higher production rates the goal of the modernization was also to reduce the negative impact on the environment by increasing the recovery of sulfur from ore to tailings br In Norilsk Nickel announced that it had invested billion in a major development program aimed at reducing sulfur dioxide emissions in Norilsk by by using as a base year One of the bigger steps taken to combat pollution was the closure of Nornickel s old smelter in Norilsk the main source of SO emissions within the city boundaries since br In Norilsk Nickel announced the Sulfur Project which includes the modernization of the Copper Plant located within the city and the relocation of blister copper production to the Nadezhda plant outside the city Norilsk s Arena sports and entertainment complex has a showroom where you can see information about the Sulfur Program and Norilsk Nickel s other environmental projects br In the Clean Norilsk project was launched with the support of Federal Minister of Natural Resources and Ecology Alexander Kozlov The aim of the initiative is to demolish about abandoned buildings and structures and remove about million square meters of industrial waste The Clean Norilsk project was included in the nationwide environmental program Clean Arctic br br br May diesel spill br br On May a fuel reservoir owned by Nornickel subsidiary NTEK at CHPP ruptured during depressurization spilling approximately tons of diesel fuel and directly threatening the ecosystem of the Arctic Ocean It was one of the largest oil spills in Russian history As a result of the leak according to preliminary estimates tons soaked into the ground and tons leaked into the nearby Ambarnaya River and Daldykan River By June according to Rosprirodnadzor the maximum permissible concentration of harmful substances in the water of the Ambarnaya River exceeded the norm by tens of thousands of times Vladimir Putin the Russian president declared a state of emergency The fuel was a reserve used as a backup for the main gas supply to a power plant The storage tank was built on permafrost which according to a statement by the company could possibly have melted and become unstable due to climate change An area of square kilometers square miles was contaminated and it is proving difficult to clean up the area because there are no roads and the river is too shallow for boats and barges Oleg Mitvol former deputy head of Rosprirodnadzor estimated that the clean up would cost about billion rubles US billion and take years br Vice speaker of the Taymyr Duma Sergey Sizonenko noted that about of Taymyr s indigenous people live in the affected area br As a result of the proceedings Norilsk Nickel was obliged to pay a fine of billion rubles which went into the federal budget of the Russian Federation rather than the budget of the municipality On August the head of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Russian Federation Alexander Chupriyan announced that clean up work was complete br br br Water br At the beginning of water treatment facilities were operational in Norilsk The system is constantly being upgraded The modernization work is partly funded by Norilsk Nickel br br br Economy br br MMC Norilsk Nickel formerly the Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Combine a mining company is the principal employer in the Norilsk area Norilsk is a

transmission before that communication could only be carried out via satellite channels there were no cable lines connecting Norilsk with other cities br A characteristic feature of Norilsk s cable network is the presence of communication cables in sewage pipes on the surface on the mainland the cables are laid in a cable duct br Norilsk s troposcatter communication station was dismantled in the first half of the s br Since internet connection speeds have improved due to the installation of a km mi communications cable laid along the Yenisei River toward Krasnoyarsk br On June the city switched to digital television and most TV channels stopped broadcasting using an analogue signal br br br Fiber optic communication br Until Norilsk was the last major city in Russia without high speed internet access access to the network was provided by a satellite channel with a speed of only GB s The laying of a fiber optic line was complicated by the long distance km and severe weather conditions up to degrees in winter The country s big three telecom operators did not dare to undertake the project which was instead handled by the Norilsk Nickel subsidiary Unity Broadband internet started working in the city in September The launch was attended by Minister of Telecom and Mass Communications Nikolay Nikiforov and President of Norilsk Nickel Vladimir Potanin Connectivity is now

Nepokoichitsky who arrived from Leningrad in so the first blocks to be constructed in the city were built in the neoclassical style and resemble St Petersburg Nepokoichitsky s wife Lydia Minenko also made a notable contribution Local features such as Lake Dolgoye and reservoirs in the southwestern district were taken into account in the masterplan The layout of the city was based on a main avenue interrupted in places by squares br One of the main challenges was to minimize the impact of strong winds The first solutions were unsuccessful it was initially assumed that snow would be swept out along the city s streets which were specially laid out along the axes of the prevailing winds but the winds turned out to be too strong and there was too much snow After that the decision was taken to use compact perimeter blocks which determined the appearance of the city br In the s districts of standardized panel housing were built in the outskirts of Norilsk br The city is unusual in that its gas and water pipes which are typically laid underground elsewhere run overground This is due to the problems created by the seasonal melting and freezing of the top layer of permafrost br The city center is dominated by buildings in neoclassical style with outlying residential areas consisting of tower blocks br br br Effects of thawing permafrost br Rising Arctic temperatures are causing
