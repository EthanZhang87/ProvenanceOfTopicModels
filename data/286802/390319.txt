id: 390319
A fuel pump is a component used in many liquid fuelled engines such as petrol gasoline or diesel engines to transfer the fuel from the fuel tank to the device where it is mixed with the intake air such as the carburetor or fuel injector br Carbureted engines often use low pressure mechanical pumps that are mounted on the engine Fuel injected engines use either electric fuel pumps mounted inside the fuel tank for lower pressure manifold injection systems or high pressure mechanical pumps mounted on the engine for high pressure direct injection systems br Some engines do not use any fuel pump at all A low pressure fuel supply used by a carbureted engine can be achieved through a gravity feed system i e by simply mounting the tank higher than the carburetor This method is commonly used in carbureted motorcycles where the tank is usually directly above the engine br br br Low pressure mechanical pumps br On engines that use a carburetor e g in older cars lawnmowers and power tools a mechanical fuel pump is typically used in order to transfer fuel from the fuel tank into the carburetor These fuel pumps operate at a relatively low fuel pressure of psi bar br The two most widely used types of mechanical pumps are diaphragm pumps and plunger pumps br br br High pressure mechanical pumps br Pumps for modern direct injection engines operate at a much higher pressure up to psi bar and have configurations such as common rail radial piston common rail two piston radial inline port and helix and metering unit Injection pumps are fuel lubricated which prevents oil from contaminating the fuel br br br Port and Helix pumps br Port and Helix pumps are most commonly used in marine diesel engines because of their simplicity reliability and its ability to be scaled up in proportion to the engine size The pump is similar to that of a radial piston type pump but instead of a piston it has a machined plunger that has no seals When the plunger is at top dead center the injection to the cylinder is finished and it is returned on its downward stroke by a compression spring br Due to the fixed height of a cam lobe the amount of fuel being pumped to the injector is controlled by a rack and pinion device that rotates the plunger thus allowing variable amounts of fuel to the area above the plunger The fuel is then forced through a check valve and into the fuel injector nozzle br br br Plunger type pumps br Plunger type pumps are a type of positive displacement pump used by diesel engines These pumps contain a chamber whose volume is increased and or decreased by a moving plunger along with check valves at the inlet and discharge ports It is similar to that of a piston pump but the high pressure seal is stationary while the smooth cylindrical plunger slides through the seal br Plunger type pumps are often mounted on the side of the injection pump and driven by the camshaft These pumps usually run at a fuel pressure of psi bar br br br Electric pumps br In fuel injected petrol engines an electric fuel pump is typically located inside the fuel tank For older port injection and throttle body injection systems this in tank fuel pump transports the fuel from the fuel tank to the engine as well as pressurising the fuel to typically psi bar While for direct injection systems the in tank fuel pump transports the fuel to the engine where a separate fuel pump pressurises the fuel to a much higher pressure br Since the electric pump does not require mechanical power from the engine it is feasible to locate the pump anywhere between the engine and the fuel tank The reasons that the fuel pump is typically located in the fuel tank are br br By submerging the pump in fuel at the bottom of the tank the pump is cooled by the surrounding fuel br Liquid fuel by itself i e without oxygen present isn t flammable therefore surrounding the fuel pump by fuel reduces the risk of fire br In tank fuel pumps are often part of an assembly consisting of the fuel pump fuel strainer and fuel level sensor the latter used for the fuel gauge br br br Turbopumps br Rocket engines use a turbopump to supply the fuel and oxidizer into the combustion chamber br br br See also br List of auto parts br br br
