Nickel is a chemical element it has symbol Ni and atomic number It is a silvery white lustrous metal with a slight golden tinge Nickel is a hard and ductile transition metal Pure nickel is chemically reactive but large pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because a passivation layer of nickel oxide forms on the surface that prevents further corrosion Even so pure native nickel is found in Earth s crust only in tiny amounts usually in ultramafic rocks and in the interiors of larger nickel iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth s atmosphere br Meteoric nickel is found in combination with iron a reflection of the origin of those elements as major end products of supernova nucleosynthesis An iron nickel mixture is thought to compose Earth s outer and inner cores br Use of nickel as natural meteoric nickel iron alloy has been traced as far back as BCE Nickel was first isolated and classified as an element in by Axel Fredrik Cronstedt who initially mistook the ore for a copper mineral in the cobalt mines of Los H lsingland Sweden The element s name comes from a mischievous sprite of German miner mythology Nickel similar to Old Nick Nickel minerals can be green like copper ores and were known as kupfernickel Nickel s copper because they produced no copper br Although most nickel in the earth s crust exists as oxides economically more important nickel ores are sulfides especially pentlandite Major production sites include the Sudbury region Canada which is thought to be of meteoric origin New Caledonia in the Pacific Western Australia and Norilsk Russia br Nickel is one of four elements the others are iron cobalt and gadolinium that are ferromagnetic at about room temperature Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron based permanent magnets and rare earth magnets The metal is used chiefly in alloys and corrosion resistant plating br About of world production is used in stainless steel A further is used for nickel based and copper based alloys for plating for alloy steels in foundries and in other applications such as in rechargeable batteries including those in electric vehicles EVs Nickel is widely used in coins though nickel plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy As a compound nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses such as a catalyst for hydrogenation cathodes for rechargeable batteries pigments and metal surface treatments Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site br br br Properties br br br Atomic and physical properties br br Nickel is a silvery white metal with a slight golden tinge that takes a high polish It is one of only four elements that are ferromagnetic at or near room temperature the others are iron cobalt and gadolinium Its Curie temperature is C F meaning that bulk nickel is non magnetic above this temperature The unit cell of nickel is a face centered cube it has lattice parameter of nm giving an atomic radius of nm This crystal structure is stable to pressures of at least GPa Nickel is hard malleable and ductile and has a relatively high electrical and thermal conductivity for transition metals The high compressive strength of GPa predicted for ideal crystals is never obtained in the real bulk material due to formation and movement of dislocations However it has been reached in Ni nanoparticles br br br Electron configuration dispute br Nickel has two atomic electron configurations Ar d s and Ar d s which are very close in energy Ar denotes the complete argon core structure There is some disagreement on which configuration has the lower energy Chemistry textbooks quote nickel s electron configuration as Ar s d also written Ar d s This configuration agrees with the Madelung energy ordering rule which predicts that s is filled before d It is supported by the experimental fact that the lowest energy state of the nickel atom is a d s energy level specifically the d F s F J level br However each of these two configurations splits into several energy levels due to fine structure and the two sets of energy levels overlap The average energy of states with Ar d s is actually lower than the average energy of states with Ar d s Therefore the research literature on atomic calculations quotes the ground state configuration as Ar d s br br br Isotopes br br The isotopes of nickel range in atomic weight from u Ni to u Ni br Natural nickel is composed of five stable isotopes Ni Ni Ni Ni and Ni of which Ni is the most abundant natural abundance br Nickel has the highest binding energy per nucleon of any nuclide MeV nucleon Its binding energy is greater than both Fe and Fe more abundant nuclides often incorrectly cited as having the highest binding energy Though this would seem to predict nickel as the most abundant heavy element in the universe the high rate of photodisintegration of nickel in stellar interiors causes iron to be by far the most abundant br Nickel is the daughter product of the extinct radionuclide Fe half life million years Due to the long half life of Fe its persistence in materials in the Solar System may generate observable variations in the isotopic composition of Ni Therefore the abundance of Ni in extraterrestrial material may give insight into the origin of the Solar System and its early history br At least nickel radioisotopes have been characterized the most stable are Ni with half life years Ni years and Ni days All other radioisotopes have half lives less than hours and most these have half lives less than seconds This element also has one meta state br Radioactive nickel is produced by the silicon burning process and later set free in large amounts in type Ia supernovae The shape of the light curve of these supernovae at intermediate to late times corresponds to the decay via electron capture of Ni to cobalt and ultimately to iron Nickel is a long lived cosmogenic radionuclide half life years Ni has found many applications in isotope geology Ni has been used to date the terrestrial age of meteorites and to determine abundances of extraterrestrial dust in ice and sediment Nickel with a half life of milliseconds is believed an important isotope in supernova nucleosynthesis of elements heavier than iron Ni discovered in is the most proton rich heavy element isotope known With protons and neutrons Ni is doubly magic as is Ni with protons and neutrons Both are therefore unusually stable for nuclei with so large a proton neutron imbalance br Nickel is a contaminant found in the support structure of nuclear reactors It is produced through neutron capture by nickel Small amounts have also been found near nuclear weapon test sites in the South Pacific br br br Occurrence br br Nickel ores are classified as oxides or sulfides Oxides include laterite where the principal mineral mixtures are nickeliferous limonite Fe Ni O OH and garnierite a mixture of various hydrous nickel and nickel rich silicates Nickel sulfides commonly exist as solid solutions with iron in minerals such as pentlandite and pyrrhotite with the formula Fe xNixS and Fe xNixS respectively Other common Ni containing minerals are millerite and the arsenide niccolite br Identified land based resources throughout the world averaging nickel or greater comprise at least million tons of nickel about the double of known reserves About is in laterites and in sulfide deposits br On geophysical evidence most of the nickel on Earth is believed to be in Earth s outer and inner cores Kamacite and taenite are naturally occurring alloys of iron and nickel For kamacite the alloy is usually in the proportion of to though impurities such as cobalt or carbon may be present Taenite is to nickel Kamacite and taenite are also found in nickel iron meteorites br Nickel is commonly found in iron meteorites as the alloys kamacite and taenite Nickel in meteorites was first detected in by Joseph Louis Proust a French chemist who then worked in Spain Proust analyzed samples of the meteorite from Campo del Cielo Argentina which had been obtained in by Miguel Rub n de Celis discovering the presence in them of nickel about along with iron br br br Compounds br br The most common oxidation state of nickel is but compounds of Ni Ni and Ni are well known and the exotic oxidation states Ni and Ni have been characterized br br br Nickel br br Nickel tetracarbonyl Ni CO discovered by Ludwig Mond is a volatile highly toxic liquid at room temperature On heating the complex decomposes back to nickel and carbon monoxide br br Ni CO Ni CO br This behavior is exploited in the Mond process for purifying nickel as described above The related nickel complex bis cyclooctadiene nickel is a useful catalyst in organonickel chemistry because the cyclooctadiene or cod ligands are easily displaced br br br Nickel I br br Nickel I complexes are uncommon but one example is the tetrahedral complex NiBr PPh Many nickel I complexes have Ni Ni bonding such as the dark red diamagnetic K Ni CN prepared by reduction of K Ni CN with sodium amalgam This compound is oxidized in water liberating H br br It is thought that the nickel I oxidation state is important to nickel containing enzymes such as NiFe hydrogenase which catalyzes the reversible reduction of protons to H br br br Nickel II br br Nickel II forms compounds with all common anions including sulfide sulfate carbonate hydroxide carboxylates and halides Nickel II sulfate is produced in large amounts by dissolving nickel metal or oxides in sulfuric acid forming both a hexa and heptahydrate useful for electroplating nickel Common salts of nickel such as chloride nitrate and sulfate dissolve in water to give green solutions of the metal aquo complex Ni H O br The four halides form nickel compounds which are solids with molecules with octahedral Ni centres Nickel II chloride is most common and its behavior is illustrative of the other halides Nickel II chloride is made by dissolving nickel or its oxide in hydrochloric acid It is usually found as the green hexahydrate whose formula is usually written NiCl H O When dissolved in water this salt forms the metal aquo complex Ni H O Dehydration of NiCl H O gives yellow anhydrous NiCl br Some tetracoordinate nickel II complexes e g bis triphenylphosphine nickel chloride exist both in tetrahedral and square planar geometries The tetrahedral complexes are paramagnetic the square planar complexes are diamagnetic In having properties of magnetic equilibrium and formation of octahedral complexes they contrast with the divalent complexes of the heavier group metals palladium II and platinum II which form only square planar geometry br Nickelocene has an electron count of Many chemical reactions of nickelocene tend to yield electron products br br br Nickel III and IV br br Many Ni III compounds are known Ni III forms simple salts with fluoride or oxide ions Ni III can be stabilized by donor ligands such as thiols and organophosphines br Ni III occurs in nickel oxide hydroxide which is used as the cathode in many rechargeable batteries including nickel cadmium nickel iron nickel hydrogen and nickel metal hydride and used by certain manufacturers in Li ion batteries br Ni IV remains a rare oxidation state and very few compounds are known Ni IV occurs in the mixed oxide BaNiO br br br History br Unintentional use of nickel can be traced back as far as BCE Bronzes from what is now Syria have been found to contain as much as nickel Some ancient Chinese manuscripts suggest that white copper cupronickel known as baitong was used there in BCE This Paktong white copper was exported to Britain as early as the th century but the nickel content of this alloy was not discovered until Coins of nickel copper alloy were minted by Bactrian kings Agathocles Euthydemus II and Pantaleon in the nd century BCE possibly out of the Chinese cupronickel br br In medieval Germany a metallic yellow mineral was found in the Ore Mountains that resembled copper ore But when miners were unable to get any copper from it they blamed a mischievous sprite of German mythology Nickel similar to Old Nick for besetting the copper They called this ore Kupfernickel from German Kupfer copper This ore is now known as the mineral nickeline formerly niccolite a nickel arsenide In Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt tried to extract copper from kupfernickel at a cobalt mine in the village of Los Sweden and instead produced a white metal that he named nickel after the spirit that had given its name to the mineral In modern German Kupfernickel or Kupfer Nickel designates the alloy cupronickel br Originally the only source for nickel was the rare Kupfernickel Beginning in nickel was obtained as a byproduct of cobalt blue production The first large scale smelting of nickel began in Norway in from nickel rich pyrrhotite The introduction of nickel in steel production in increased the demand for nickel the nickel deposits of New Caledonia discovered in provided most of the world s supply between and The discovery of the large deposits in the Sudbury Basin in Canada in in Norilsk Talnakh in Russia in and in the Merensky Reef in South Africa in made large scale nickel production possible br br br Coinage br br Aside from the aforementioned Bactrian coins nickel was not a component of coins until the mid th century br br br Canada br nickel five cent coins were struck in Canada the world s largest nickel producer at the time during non war years from to the metal content made these coins magnetic During the war years most or all nickel was removed from Canadian and US coins to save it for making armor Canada used nickel from in its higher value coins until br br br Switzerland br Coins of nearly pure nickel were first used in in Switzerland br br br United Kingdom br Birmingham forged nickel coins in c for trading in Malaysia br br br United States br br In the United States the term nickel or nick originally applied to the copper nickel Flying Eagle cent which replaced copper with nickel then the Indian Head cent of the same alloy from to Still later in the term designated the three cent nickel with nickel increased to In the five cent shield nickel nickel copper appropriated the designation which has been used ever since for the subsequent cent pieces This alloy proportion is not ferromagnetic br The US nickel coin contains ounces g of nickel which at the April price was worth cents along with grams of copper worth about cents with a total metal value of more than cents Since the face value of a nickel is cents this made it an attractive target for melting by people wanting to sell the metals at a profit The United States Mint anticipating this practice implemented new interim rules on December subject to public comment for days which criminalized the melting and export of cents and nickels Violators can be punished with a fine of up to and or a maximum of five years in prison As of September the melt value of a US nickel copper and nickel included is of the face value br br br Current use br In the st century the high price of nickel has led to some replacement of the metal in coins around the world Coins still made with nickel alloys include one and two euro coins and U S coins and p p and UK coins From on the nickel alloy used for p and p UK coins was replaced with nickel plated steel This ignited a public controversy regarding the problems of people with nickel allergy br br br World production br br An estimated million tonnes t of nickel per year are mined worldwide Indonesia t the Philippines t Russia t New Caledonia France t Australia t and Canada t are the largest producers as of The largest nickel deposits in non Russian Europe are in Finland and Greece Identified land based sources averaging at least nickel contain at least million tonnes of nickel About is in laterites and is in sulfide deposits Also extensive nickel sources are found in the depths of the Pacific Ocean especially in an area called the Clarion Clipperton Zone in the form of polymetallic nodules peppering the seafloor at km below sea level These nodules are composed of numerous rare earth metals and are estimated to be nickel With advances in science and engineering regulation is currently being set in place by the International Seabed Authority to ensure that these nodules are collected in an environmentally conscientious manner while adhering to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals br The one place in the United States where nickel has been profitably mined is Riddle Oregon with several square miles of nickel bearing garnierite surface deposits The mine closed in The Eagle mine project is a new nickel mine in Michigan s Upper Peninsula Construction was completed in and operations began in the third quarter of In the first full year of operation the Eagle Mine produced t br br br Production br br Nickel is obtained through extractive metallurgy it is extracted from ore by conventional roasting and reduction processes that yield metal of greater than purity In many stainless steel applications pure nickel can be used without further purification depending on impurities br Traditionally most sulfide ores are processed using pyrometallurgical techniques to produce a matte for further refining Hydrometallurgical techniques are also used Most sulfide deposits have traditionally been processed by concentration through a froth flotation process followed by pyrometallurgical extraction The nickel matte is further processed with the Sherritt Gordon process First copper is removed by adding hydrogen sulfide leaving a concentrate of cobalt and nickel Then solvent extraction is used to separate the cobalt and nickel with the final nickel content greater than br A second common refining process is leaching the metal matte into a nickel salt solution followed by electrowinning the nickel from solution by plating it onto a cathode as electrolytic nickel br br br Mond process br br The purest metal is obtained from nickel oxide by the Mond process which gives a purity of over The process was patented by Ludwig Mond and has been in industrial use since before the beginning of the th century In this process nickel is treated with carbon monoxide in the presence of a sulfur catalyst at around C to form nickel carbonyl In a similar reaction with iron iron pentacarbonyl can form though this reaction is slow If necessary the nickel may be separated by distillation Dicobalt octacarbonyl is also formed in nickel distillation as a by product but it decomposes to tetracobalt dodecacarbonyl at the reaction temperature to give a non volatile solid br Nickel is obtained from nickel carbonyl by one of two processes It may be passed through a large chamber at high temperatures in which tens of thousands of nickel spheres pellets are constantly stirred The carbonyl decomposes and deposits pure nickel onto the spheres In the alternate process nickel carbonyl is decomposed in a smaller chamber at C to create a fine nickel powder The byproduct carbon monoxide is recirculated and reused The highly pure nickel product is known as carbonyl nickel br br br Market value br The market price of nickel surged throughout and the early months of as of April the metal was trading at US tonne or oz The price later fell dramatically as of September the metal was trading at tonne or oz During the Russian invasion of Ukraine worries about sanctions on Russian nickel exports triggered a short squeeze causing the price of nickel to quadruple in just two days reaching US per tonne The London Metal Exchange cancelled contracts worth billion and suspended nickel trading for over a week Analyst Andy Home argued that such price shocks are exacerbated by the purity requirements imposed by metal markets only Grade I pure metal can be used as a commodity on the exchanges but most of the world s supply is either in ferro nickel alloys or lower grade purities br br br Applications br br Global use of nickel is currently in stainless steel in nonferrous alloys electroplating alloy steel foundries and other including batteries br Nickel is used in many recognizable industrial and consumer products including stainless steel alnico magnets coinage rechargeable batteries e g nickel iron electric guitar strings microphone capsules plating on plumbing fixtures and special alloys such as permalloy elinvar and invar It is used for plating and as a green tint in glass Nickel is preeminently an alloy metal and its chief use is in nickel steels and nickel cast irons in which it typically increases the tensile strength toughness and elastic limit It is widely used in many other alloys including nickel brasses and bronzes and alloys with copper chromium aluminium lead cobalt silver and gold Inconel Incoloy Monel Nimonic br br Because nickel is resistant to corrosion it was occasionally used as a substitute for decorative silver Nickel was also occasionally used in some countries after as a cheap coinage metal see above but in the later years of the th century it was replaced by cheaper stainless steel i e iron alloys except in the United States and Canada br Nickel is an excellent alloying agent for certain precious metals and is used in the fire assay as a collector of platinum group elements PGE As such nickel can fully collect all six PGEs from ores and can partially collect gold High throughput nickel mines may also do PGE recovery mainly platinum and palladium examples are Norilsk Russia and the Sudbury Basin Canada br Nickel foam or nickel mesh is used in gas diffusion electrodes for alkaline fuel cells br Nickel and its alloys are often used as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions Raney nickel a finely divided nickel aluminium alloy is one common form though related catalysts are also used including Raney type catalysts br Nickel is naturally magnetostrictive in the presence of a magnetic field the material undergoes a small change in length The magnetostriction of nickel is on the order of ppm and is negative indicating that it contracts br Nickel is used as a binder in the cemented tungsten carbide or hardmetal industry and used in proportions of to by weight Nickel makes the tungsten carbide magnetic and adds corrosion resistance to the cemented parts though the hardness is less than those with cobalt binder br Ni with a half life of years is useful in krytron devices as a beta particle high speed electron emitter to make ionization by the keep alive electrode more reliable It is being investigated as a power source for betavoltaic batteries br Around of all nickel production is used for engineering for building and construction for tubular products for metal goods for transport for electronic goods and for other uses br Raney nickel is widely used for hydrogenation of unsaturated oils to make margarine and substandard margarine and leftover oil may contain nickel as a contaminant Forte et al found that type diabetic patients have ng mL of Ni in the blood relative to ng mL in control subjects br Nickel titanium is an alloy of roughly equal atomic percentages of its constituent metals which exhibits two closely related and unique properties the shape memory effect and superelasticity br br br Biological role br It was not recognized until the s but nickel is known to play an important role in the biology of some plants bacteria archaea and fungi Nickel enzymes such as urease are considered virulence factors in some organisms Urease catalyzes hydrolysis of urea to form ammonia and carbamate NiFe hydrogenases can catalyze oxidation of H to form protons and electrons and also the reverse reaction the reduction of protons to form hydrogen gas A nickel tetrapyrrole coenzyme cofactor F is present in methyl coenzyme M reductase which can catalyze the formation of methane or the reverse reaction in methanogenic archaea in oxidation state One of the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase enzymes consists of an Fe Ni S cluster Other nickel bearing enzymes include a rare bacterial class of superoxide dismutase and glyoxalase I enzymes in bacteria and several eukaryotic trypanosomal parasites in other organisms including yeast and mammals this enzyme contains divalent Zn br Dietary nickel may affect human health through infections by nickel dependent bacteria but nickel may also be an essential nutrient for bacteria living in the large intestine in effect functioning as a prebiotic The US Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential nutrient for humans so neither a Recommended Dietary Allowance RDA nor an Adequate Intake have been established The tolerable upper intake level of dietary nickel is mg day as soluble nickel salts Estimated dietary intake is to g day less than is absorbed What is absorbed is excreted in urine Relatively large amounts of nickel comparable to the estimated average ingestion above leach into food cooked in stainless steel For example the amount of nickel leached after cooking cycles into one serving of tomato sauce averages g br Nickel released from Siberian Traps volcanic eruptions is suspected of helping the growth of Methanosarcina a genus of euryarchaeote archaea that produced methane in the Permian Triassic extinction event the biggest known mass extinction br br br Toxicity br br The major source of nickel exposure is oral consumption as nickel is essential to plants Typical background concentrations of nickel do not exceed ng m in air mg kg in soil mg kg in vegetation g L in freshwater and g L in seawater Environmental concentrations may be increased by human pollution For example nickel plated faucets may contaminate water and soil mining and smelting may dump nickel into wastewater nickel steel alloy cookware and nickel pigmented dishes may release nickel into food Air may be polluted by nickel ore refining and fossil fuel combustion Humans may absorb nickel directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry shampoos detergents and coins A less common form of chronic exposure is through hemodialysis as traces of nickel ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin br The average daily exposure is not a threat to human health Most nickel absorbed by humans is removed by the kidneys and passed out of the body through urine or is eliminated through the gastrointestinal tract without being absorbed Nickel is not a cumulative poison but larger doses or chronic inhalation exposure may be toxic even carcinogenic and constitute an occupational hazard br Nickel compounds are classified as human carcinogens based on increased respiratory cancer risks observed in epidemiological studies of sulfidic ore refinery workers This is supported by the positive results of the NTP bioassays with Ni sub sulfide and Ni oxide in rats and mice The human and animal data consistently indicate a lack of carcinogenicity via the oral route of exposure and limit the carcinogenicity of nickel compounds to respiratory tumours after inhalation Nickel metal is classified as a suspect carcinogen there is consistency between the absence of increased respiratory cancer risks in workers predominantly exposed to metallic nickel and the lack of respiratory tumours in a rat lifetime inhalation carcinogenicity study with nickel metal powder In the rodent inhalation studies with various nickel compounds and nickel metal increased lung inflammations with and without bronchial lymph node hyperplasia or fibrosis were observed In rat studies oral ingestion of water soluble nickel salts can trigger perinatal mortality in pregnant animals Whether these effects are relevant to humans is unclear as epidemiological studies of highly exposed female workers have not shown adverse developmental toxicity effects br People can be exposed to nickel in the workplace by inhalation ingestion and contact with skin or eye The Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for the workplace at mg m per hour workday excluding nickel carbonyl The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH sets the recommended exposure limit REL at mg m per hour workday At mg m nickel is immediately dangerous to life and health Nickel carbonyl Ni CO is an extremely toxic gas The toxicity of metal carbonyls is a function of both the toxicity of the metal and the off gassing of carbon monoxide from the carbonyl functional groups nickel carbonyl is also explosive in air br Sensitized persons may show a skin contact allergy to nickel known as a contact dermatitis Highly sensitized persons may also react to foods with high nickel content Patients with pompholyx may also be sensitive to nickel Nickel is the top confirmed contact allergen worldwide partly due to its use in jewelry for pierced ears Nickel allergies affecting pierced ears are often marked by itchy red skin Many earrings are now made without nickel or with low release nickel to address this problem The amount allowed in products that contact human skin is now regulated by the European Union In researchers found that the nickel released by and euro coins far exceeded those standards This is believed to be due to a galvanic reaction Nickel was voted Allergen of the Year in by the American Contact Dermatitis Society In August the American Academy of Dermatology adopted a position statement on the safety of nickel Estimates suggest that contact dermatitis which includes nickel sensitization accounts for approximately billion and affects nearly million people br Reports show that both the nickel induced activation of hypoxia inducible factor HIF and the up regulation of hypoxia inducible genes are caused by depletion of intracellular ascorbate The addition of ascorbate to the culture medium increased the intracellular ascorbate level and reversed both the metal induced stabilization of HIF and HIF dependent gene expression br br br Nickel in popular culture br In the second Oz book The Marvelous Land of Oz by L Frank Baum published by Reilly Britton the Tin Woodman states that he has had his tin body nickel plated He is thereafter very careful not to allow his nickel plating to get scratched nicked or marred
