Cerium IV oxide also known as ceric oxide ceric dioxide ceria cerium oxide or cerium dioxide is an oxide of the rare earth metal cerium It is a pale yellow white powder with the chemical formula CeO It is an important commercial product and an intermediate in the purification of the element from the ores The distinctive property of this material is its reversible conversion to a non stoichiometric oxide br br br Production br Cerium occurs naturally as oxides always as a mixture with other rare earth elements Its principal ores bastnaesite and monazite After extraction of the metal ions into aqueous base Ce is separated from that mixture by addition of an oxidant followed by adjustment of the pH This step exploits the low solubility of CeO and the fact that other rare earth elements resist oxidation br Cerium IV oxide is formed by the calcination of cerium oxalate or cerium hydroxide br Cerium also forms cerium III oxide Ce O which is unstable and will oxidize to cerium IV oxide br br br Structure and defect behavior br Cerium oxide adopts the fluorite structure space group Fm m containing coordinate Ce and coordinate O At high temperatures it releases oxygen to give a non stoichiometric anion deficient form that retains the fluorite lattice This material has the formula CeO x where x The value of x depends on both the temperature surface termination and the oxygen partial pressure The equation br br br br br br br x br br br br x br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Pa br br br br P br br br br O br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br

shown to predict the equilibrium non stoichiometry x over a wide range of oxygen partial pressures Pa and temperatures C br The non stoichiometric form has a blue to black color and exhibits both ionic and electronic conduction with ionic being the most significant at temperatures C br The number of oxygen vacancies is frequently measured by using X ray photoelectron spectroscopy to compare the ratio of Ce to Ce br br br Defect chemistry br In the most stable fluorite phase of ceria it exhibits several defects depending on partial pressure of oxygen or stress state of the material br The primary defects of concern are oxygen vacancies and small polarons electrons localized on cerium cations Increasing the concentration of oxygen defects increases the diffusion rate of oxide anions in the lattice as reflected in an increase in ionic conductivity These factors give ceria favorable performance in applications as a solid electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells Undoped and doped ceria also exhibit high electronic conductivity at low partial pressures of oxygen due to reduction of the cerium ion leading to the formation of small polarons Since the oxygen atoms in a ceria crystal occur in planes diffusion of these anions is facile The diffusion rate increases as the defect concentration increases br The presence of oxygen vacancies at terminating ceria planes governs the energetics of ceria interactions with adsorbate molecules and its wettability Controlling such surface interactions is key to harnessing ceria in catalytic applications br br br Natural occurrence br Cerium IV oxide occurs naturally as the mineral cerianite Ce It is a rare example of tetravalent cerium mineral the other examples being stetindite Ce and dyrnaesite La The Ce suffix is known as Levinson modifier and is used to show which element dominates in a particular site in the structure It is often found in names of minerals bearing rare earth elements REEs Occurrence of cerianite Ce is related to some examples of cerium anomaly where Ce which is oxidized easily is separated from other REEs that remain trivalent and thus fit to structures of other minerals than cerianite Ce br br br Applications br Cerium has two main applications which are listed below br The principal industrial application of ceria is for polishing especially chemical mechanical planarization CMP For this purpose it has displaced many other oxides that were previously used such as iron oxide and zirconia For hobbyists it is also known as opticians rouge br In its other main application CeO is used to decolorize glass It functions by converting green tinted ferrous impurities to nearly colorless ferric oxides br br br Other niche and emerging applications br br br Catalysis br CeO has attracted much attention in the area of heterogeneous catalysis It catalyses the water gas shift reaction It oxidizes carbon monoxide Its reduced derivative Ce O reduces water with release of hydrogen br The interconvertibility of CeOx materials is the basis of the use of ceria for an oxidation catalyst One small but illustrative use is its use in the walls of self cleaning ovens as a hydrocarbon oxidation catalyst during the high temperature cleaning process Another small scale but famous example is its role in oxidation of natural gas in gas mantles br br Building on its distinct surface interactions ceria finds further use as a sensor in catalytic converters in automotive applications controlling the air exhaust ratio to reduce NOx and carbon monoxide emissions br br br Energy fuels br Due to the significant ionic and electronic conduction of cerium oxide it is well suited to be used as a mixed conductor As such cerium oxide is a material of interest for solid oxide fuel cells SOFCs in comparison to zirconium oxide br Thermochemically the cerium IV oxide cerium III oxide cycle or CeO Ce O cycle is a two step water splitting process that has been used for hydrogen production Because it leverages the oxygen vacancies between systems this allows ceria in water to form hydroxyl OH groups The hydroxyl groups can then be released as oxygen oxidizes thus providing a source of clean energy br br br Optics br Cerium oxide is highly valued in the optics industry for its exceptional polishing capabilities It effectively removes minor scratches and imperfections from glass surfaces through both mechanical abrasion and chemical interaction producing a smooth high gloss finish Cerium oxide can also enhance the durability of optical surfaces by forming a protective layer that increases resistance to scratches and environmental wear br Cerium oxide has also found use in infrared filters and as a replacement for thorium dioxide in incandescent mantles br br br Welding br Cerium oxide is used as an addition to tungsten electrodes for Gas Tungsten Arc Welding It provides advantages over pure Tungsten electrodes such as reducing electrode consumption rate and easier arc starting stability Ceria electrodes were first introduced in the US market in and are useful in AC DC Electrode Positive and DC Electrode Negative br br br Safety aspects br Cerium oxide nanoparticles nanoceria have been investigated for their antibacterial and antioxidant activity br Nanoceria is a prospective replacement of zinc oxide and titanium dioxide in sunscreens as it has lower photocatalytic activity br br br See also br Cerium br Cerium anomaly br Zircon br br br br br br External links br br Webelements at University of Sheffield br Synthesis and properties of ceria
