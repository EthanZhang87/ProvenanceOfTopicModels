Ammonia is an inorganic chemical compound of nitrogen and hydrogen with the formula NH A stable binary hydride and the simplest pnictogen hydride ammonia is a colourless gas with a distinctive pungent smell Biologically it is a common nitrogenous waste and it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to fertilisers Around of ammonia produced industrially is used to make fertilisers in various forms and composition such as urea and diammonium phosphate Ammonia in pure form is also applied directly into the soil br Ammonia either directly or indirectly is also a building block for the synthesis of many chemicals br Ammonia occurs in nature and has been detected in the interstellar medium In many countries it is classified as an extremely hazardous substance br Ammonia is produced biologically in a process called nitrogen fixation but even more is generated industrially by the Haber process The process helped revolutionize agriculture by providing cheap fertilizers The global industrial production of ammonia in was million tonnes Industrial ammonia is transported in tank cars or cylinders br NH boils at C F at a pressure of one atmosphere but the liquid can often be handled in the laboratory without external cooling Household ammonia or ammonium hydroxide is a solution of NH in water br br br Etymology br Pliny in Book XXXI of his Natural History refers to a salt named hammoniacum so called because of the proximity of its source to the Temple of Jupiter Amun Greek Ammon in the Roman province of Cyrenaica However the description Pliny gives of the salt does not conform to the properties of ammonium chloride According to Herbert Hoover s commentary in his English translation of Georgius Agricola s De re metallica it is likely to have been common sea salt In any case that salt ultimately gave ammonia and ammonium compounds their name br br br Natural occurrence abiological br Traces of ammonia ammonium are found in rainwater Ammonium chloride sal ammoniac and ammonium sulfate are found in volcanic districts Crystals of ammonium bicarbonate have been found in Patagonia guano br Ammonia is found throughout the Solar System on Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune and Pluto among other places on smaller icy bodies such as Pluto ammonia can act as a geologically important antifreeze as a mixture of water and ammonia can have a melting point as low as C F K if the ammonia concentration is high enough and thus allow such bodies to retain internal oceans and active geology at a far lower temperature than would be possible with water alone Substances containing ammonia or those that are similar to it are called ammoniacal br br br Properties br br Ammonia is a colourless gas with a characteristically pungent smell It is lighter than air its density being times that of air It is easily liquefied due to the strong hydrogen bonding between molecules Gaseous ammonia turns to a colourless liquid which boils at C F and freezes to colourless crystals at C F Little data is available at very high temperatures and pressures but the liquid vapor critical point occurs at K and MPa br br br Solid br The crystal symmetry is cubic Pearson symbol cP space group P No lattice constant nm br br br Liquid br Liquid ammonia possesses strong ionising powers reflecting its high of at C F Liquid ammonia has a very high standard enthalpy change of vapourization kJ mol for comparison water s is kJ mol methane kJ mol and phosphine kJ mol and can be transported in pressurized or refrigerated vessels however at standard temperature and pressure liquid anhydrous ammonia will vaporize br br br Solvent properties br Ammonia readily dissolves in water In an aqueous solution it can be expelled by boiling The aqueous solution of ammonia is basic and may be described as aqueous ammonia or ammonium hydroxide The maximum concentration of ammonia in water a saturated solution has a specific gravity of and is often known as ammonia br br Liquid ammonia is a widely studied nonaqueous ionising solvent Its most conspicuous property is its ability to dissolve alkali metals to form highly coloured electrically conductive solutions containing solvated electrons Apart from these remarkable solutions much of the chemistry in liquid ammonia can be classified by analogy with related reactions in aqueous solutions Comparison of the physical properties of NH with those of water shows NH has the lower melting point boiling point density viscosity dielectric constant and electrical conductivity These differences are attributed at least in part to the weaker hydrogen bonding in NH The ionic self dissociation constant of liquid NH at C is about br br Liquid ammonia is an ionising solvent although less so than water and dissolves a range of ionic compounds including many nitrates nitrites cyanides thiocyanates metal cyclopentadienyl complexes and metal bis trimethylsilyl amides Most ammonium salts are soluble and act as acids in liquid ammonia solutions The solubility of halide salts increases from fluoride to iodide A saturated solution of ammonium nitrate Divers solution named after Edward Divers contains mol solute per mole of ammonia and has a vapour pressure of less than bar even at C F However few oxyanion salts with other cations dissolve br Liquid ammonia will dissolve all of the alkali metals and other electropositive metals such as Ca Sr Ba Eu and Yb also Mg using an electrolytic process At low concentrations mol L deep blue solutions are formed these contain metal cations and solvated electrons free electrons that are surrounded by a cage of ammonia molecules br These solutions are strong reducing agents At higher concentrations the solutions are metallic in appearance and in electrical conductivity At low temperatures the two types of solution can coexist as immiscible phases br br br Redox properties of liquid ammonia br br The range of thermodynamic stability of liquid ammonia solutions is very narrow as the potential for oxidation to dinitrogen E N NH e NH is only V In practice both oxidation to dinitrogen and reduction to dihydrogen are slow This is particularly true of reducing solutions the solutions of the alkali metals mentioned above are stable for several days slowly decomposing to the metal amide and dihydrogen Most studies involving liquid ammonia solutions are done in reducing conditions although oxidation of liquid ammonia is usually slow there is still a risk of explosion particularly if transition metal ions are present as possible catalysts br br br Structure br br The ammonia molecule has a trigonal pyramidal shape as predicted by the valence shell electron pair repulsion theory VSEPR theory with an experimentally determined bond angle of The central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom This gives a total of eight electrons or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally Three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs which leaves one lone pair of electrons The lone pair repels more strongly than bond pairs therefore the bond angle is not as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement but This shape gives the molecule a dipole moment and makes it polar The molecule s polarity and especially its ability to form hydrogen bonds makes ammonia highly miscible with water The lone pair makes ammonia a base a proton acceptor Ammonia is moderately basic a M aqueous solution has a pH of and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral pH of the ammonia molecules are protonated Temperature and salinity also affect the proportion of ammonium NH The latter has the shape of a regular tetrahedron and is isoelectronic with methane br The ammonia molecule readily undergoes nitrogen inversion at room temperature a useful analogy is an umbrella turning itself inside out in a strong wind The energy barrier to this inversion is kJ mol and the resonance frequency is GHz corresponding to microwave radiation of a wavelength of cm The absorption at this frequency was the first microwave spectrum to be observed and was used in the first maser br br br Amphotericity br One of the most characteristic properties of ammonia is its basicity Ammonia is considered to be a weak base It combines with acids to form ammonium salts thus with hydrochloric acid it forms ammonium chloride sal ammoniac with nitric acid ammonium nitrate etc Perfectly dry ammonia gas will not combine with perfectly dry hydrogen chloride gas moisture is necessary to bring about the reaction br As a demonstration experiment under air with ambient moisture opened bottles of concentrated ammonia and hydrochloric acid solutions produce a cloud of ammonium chloride which seems to appear out of nothing as the salt aerosol forms where the two diffusing clouds of reagents meet between the two bottles br br NH HCl NH Cl br The salts produced by the action of ammonia on acids are known as the ammonium salts and all contain the ammonium ion NH br Although ammonia is well known as a weak base it can also act as an extremely weak acid It is a protic substance and is capable of formation of amides which contain the NH ion For example lithium dissolves in liquid ammonia to give a blue solution solvated electron of lithium amide br br Li NH LiNH H br br br Self dissociation br Like water liquid ammonia undergoes molecular autoionisation to form its acid and base conjugates br br NH NH NH br Ammonia often functions as a weak base so it has some buffering ability Shifts in pH will cause more or fewer ammonium cations NH and amide anions NH to be present in solution At standard pressure and temperature br br K NH NH br br br Combustion br br Ammonia does not burn readily or sustain combustion except under narrow fuel to air mixtures of air by volume When mixed with oxygen it burns with a pale yellowish green flame Ignition occurs when chlorine is passed into ammonia forming nitrogen and hydrogen chloride if chlorine is present in excess then the highly explosive nitrogen trichloride NCl is also formed br The combustion of ammonia to form nitrogen and water is exothermic br br NH O N H O g H r kJ or kJ mol if expressed per mol of NH br The standard enthalpy change of combustion H c expressed per mole of ammonia and with condensation of the water formed is kJ mol Dinitrogen is the thermodynamic product of combustion all nitrogen oxides are unstable with respect to N and O which is the principle behind the catalytic converter Nitrogen oxides can be formed as kinetic products in the presence of appropriate catalysts a reaction of great industrial importance in the production of nitric acid br br NH O NO H O br A subsequent reaction leads to NO br br NO O NO br The combustion of ammonia in air is very difficult in the absence of a catalyst such as platinum gauze or warm chromium III oxide due to the relatively low heat of combustion a lower laminar burning velocity high auto ignition temperature high heat of vapourization and a narrow flammability range However recent studies have shown that efficient and stable combustion of ammonia can be achieved using swirl combustors thereby rekindling research interest in ammonia as a fuel for thermal power production The flammable range of ammonia in dry air is and in relative humidity air is For studying the kinetics of ammonia combustion knowledge of a detailed reliable reaction mechanism is required but this has been challenging to obtain br br br Precursor to organonitrogen compounds br Ammonia is a direct or indirect precursor to most manufactured nitrogen containing compounds It is the precursor to nitric acid which is the source for most N substituted aromatic compounds br Amines can be formed by the reaction of ammonia with alkyl halides or more commonly with alcohols br br CH OH NH CH NH H O br Its ring opening reaction with ethylene oxide give ethanolamine diethanolamine and triethanolamine br Amides can be prepared by the reaction of ammonia with carboxylic acid and their derivatives For example ammonia reacts with formic acid HCOOH to yield formamide HCONH when heated Acyl chlorides are the most reactive but the ammonia must be present in at least a twofold excess to neutralise the hydrogen chloride formed Esters and anhydrides also react with ammonia to form amides Ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be dehydrated to amides by heating to C as long as no thermally sensitive groups are present br br Amino acids using Strecker amino acid synthesis br Acrylonitrile in the Sohio process br Other organonitrogen compounds include alprazolam ethanolamine ethyl carbamate and hexamethylenetetramine br br br Precursor to inorganic nitrogenous compounds br Nitric acid is generated via the Ostwald process by oxidation of ammonia with air over a platinum catalyst at C F atm Nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide are intermediate in this conversion br br NH O HNO H O br Nitric acid is used for the production of fertilisers explosives and many organonitrogen compounds br The hydrogen in ammonia is susceptible to replacement by a myriad substituents br Ammonia gas reacts with metallic sodium to give sodamide NaNH br With chlorine monochloramine is formed br Pentavalent ammonia is known as amine nitrogen pentahydride decomposes spontaneously into trivalent ammonia amine and hydrogen gas at normal conditions This substance was once investigated as a possible solid rocket fuel in br Ammonia is also used to make the following compounds br br Hydrazine in the Olin Raschig process and the peroxide process br Hydrogen cyanide in the BMA process and the Andrussow process br Hydroxylamine and ammonium carbonate in the Raschig process br Urea in the Bosch Meiser urea process and in W hler synthesis br ammonium perchlorate ammonium nitrate and ammonium bicarbonate br br Ammonia is a ligand forming metal ammine complexes For historical reasons ammonia is named ammine in the nomenclature of coordination compounds One notable ammine complex is cisplatin Pt NH Cl a widely used anticancer drug Ammine complexes of chromium III formed the basis of Alfred Werner s revolutionary theory on the structure of coordination compounds Werner noted only two isomers fac and mer of the complex CrCl NH could be formed and concluded the ligands must be arranged around the metal ion at the vertices of an octahedron br Ammonia forms adducts with a variety of Lewis acids such as I phenol and Al CH Ammonia is a hard base HSAB theory and its E C parameters are EB and CB Its relative donor strength toward a series of acids versus other Lewis bases can be illustrated by C B plots br br br Detection and determination br br br Ammonia in solution br br Ammonia and ammonium salts can be readily detected in very minute traces by the addition of Nessler s solution which gives a distinct yellow colouration in the presence of the slightest trace of ammonia or ammonium salts The amount of ammonia in ammonium salts can be estimated quantitatively by distillation of the salts with sodium NaOH or potassium hydroxide KOH the ammonia evolved being absorbed in a known volume of standard sulfuric acid and the excess of acid then determined volumetrically or the ammonia may be absorbed in hydrochloric acid and the ammonium chloride so formed precipitated as ammonium hexachloroplatinate NH PtCl br br br Gaseous ammonia br Sulfur sticks are burnt to detect small leaks in industrial ammonia refrigeration systems Larger quantities can be detected by warming the salts with a caustic alkali or with quicklime when the characteristic smell of ammonia will be at once apparent Ammonia is an irritant and irritation increases with concentration the permissible exposure limit is ppm and lethal above ppm by volume Higher concentrations are hardly detected by conventional detectors the type of detector is chosen according to the sensitivity required e g semiconductor catalytic electrochemical Holographic sensors have been proposed for detecting concentrations up to in volume br In a laboratorial setting gaseous ammonia can be detected by using concentrated hydrochloric acid or gaseous hydrogen chloride A dense white fume which is ammonium chloride vapor arises from the reaction between ammonia and HCl g br br br Ammoniacal nitrogen NH N br Ammoniacal nitrogen NH N is a measure commonly used for testing the quantity of ammonium ions derived naturally from ammonia and returned to ammonia via organic processes in water or waste liquids It is a measure used mainly for quantifying values in waste treatment and water purification systems as well as a measure of the health of natural and man made water reserves It is measured in units of mg L milligram per litre br br br History br br The ancient Greek historian Herodotus mentioned that there were outcrops of salt in an area of Libya that was inhabited by a people called the Ammonians now the Siwa oasis in northwestern Egypt where salt lakes still exist The Greek geographer Strabo also mentioned the salt from this region However the ancient authors Dioscorides Apicius Arrian Synesius and A tius of Amida described this salt as forming clear crystals that could be used for cooking and that were essentially rock salt Hammoniacus sal appears in the writings of Pliny although it is not known whether the term is equivalent to the more modern sal ammoniac ammonium chloride br The fermentation of urine by bacteria produces a solution of ammonia hence fermented urine was used in Classical Antiquity to wash cloth and clothing to remove hair from hides in preparation for tanning to serve as a mordant in dying cloth and to remove rust from iron It was also used by ancient dentists to wash teeth br In the form of sal ammoniac nushadir ammonia was important to the Muslim alchemists It was mentioned in the Book of Stones likely written in the th century and attributed to J bir ibn Hayy n It was also important to the European alchemists of the th century being mentioned by Albertus Magnus It was also used by dyers in the Middle Ages in the form of fermented urine to alter the colour of vegetable dyes In the th century Basilius Valentinus showed that ammonia could be obtained by the action of alkalis on sal ammoniac At a later period when sal ammoniac was obtained by distilling the hooves and horns of oxen and neutralizing the resulting carbonate with hydrochloric acid the name spirit of hartshorn was applied to ammonia br Gaseous ammonia was first isolated by Joseph Black in by reacting sal ammoniac ammonium chloride with calcined magnesia magnesium oxide It was isolated again by Peter Woulfe in by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in and by Joseph Priestley in and was termed by him alkaline air Eleven years later in Claude Louis Berthollet ascertained its composition br The production of ammonia from nitrogen in the air and hydrogen was invented by Fritz Haber and Robert LeRossignol The patent was sent in USPTO Nr and awarded in Later Carl Bosch developed the industrial method for ammonia production Haber Bosch process It was first used on an industrial scale in Germany during World War I following the allied blockade that cut off the supply of nitrates from Chile The ammonia was used to produce explosives to sustain war efforts The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Fritz Haber for the synthesis of ammonia from its elements br Before the availability of natural gas hydrogen as a precursor to ammonia production was produced via the electrolysis of water or using the chloralkali process br With the advent of the steel industry in the th century ammonia became a byproduct of the production of coking coal br br br Applications br br br Fertiliser br In the US as of approximately of ammonia was used as fertilisers either as its salts solutions or anhydrously When applied to soil it helps provide increased yields of crops such as maize and wheat of agricultural nitrogen applied in the US is in the form of anhydrous ammonia and worldwide million tonnes are applied each year br Solutions of ammonia ranging from to are used in the fermentation industry as a source of nitrogen for microorganisms and to adjust pH during fermentation br br br Refrigeration R br Because of ammonia s vapourization properties it is a useful refrigerant It was commonly used before the popularisation of chlorofluorocarbons Freons Anhydrous ammonia is widely used in industrial refrigeration applications and hockey rinks because of its high energy efficiency and low cost It suffers from the disadvantage of toxicity and requiring corrosion resistant components which restricts its domestic and small scale use Along with its use in modern vapour compression refrigeration it is used in a mixture along with hydrogen and water in absorption refrigerators The Kalina cycle which is of growing importance to geothermal power plants depends on the wide boiling range of the ammonia water mixture br Ammonia coolant is also used in the radiators aboard the International Space Station in loops that are used to regulate the internal temperature and enable temperature dependent experiments The ammonia is under sufficient pressure to remain liquid throughout the process Single phase ammonia cooling systems also serve the power electronics in each pair of solar arrays br The potential importance of ammonia as a refrigerant has increased with the discovery that vented CFCs and HFCs are potent and stable greenhouse gases br br br Antimicrobial agent for food products br As early as in it was known that ammonia was strongly antiseptic it requires grams per litre to preserve beef tea broth In one study anhydrous ammonia destroyed of zoonotic bacteria in three types of animal feed but not silage Anhydrous ammonia is currently used commercially to reduce or eliminate microbial contamination of beef br Lean finely textured beef popularly known as pink slime in the beef industry is made from fatty beef trimmings c fat by removing the fat using heat and centrifugation then treating it with ammonia to kill E coli The process was deemed effective and safe by the US Department of Agriculture based on a study that found that the treatment reduces E coli to undetectable levels There have been safety concerns about the process as well as consumer complaints about the taste and smell of ammonia treated beef br br br Fuel br br Ammonia has been used as fuel and is a proposed alternative to fossil fuels and hydrogen Being liquid at ambient temperature under its own vapour pressure and having high volumetric and gravimetric energy density ammonia is considered a suitable carrier for hydrogen and may be cheaper than direct transport of liquid hydrogen br Compared to hydrogen ammonia is easier to store Compared to hydrogen as a fuel ammonia is much more energy efficient and could be produced stored and delivered at a much lower cost than hydrogen which must be kept compressed or as a cryogenic liquid The raw energy density of liquid ammonia is MJ L which is about a third that of diesel br Ammonia can be converted back to hydrogen to be used to power hydrogen fuel cells or it may be used directly within high temperature solid oxide direct ammonia fuel cells to provide efficient power sources that do not emit greenhouse gases Ammonia to hydrogen conversion can be achieved through the sodium amide process or the catalytic decomposition of ammonia using solid catalysts br br Ammonia engines or ammonia motors using ammonia as a working fluid have been proposed and occasionally used The principle is similar to that used in a fireless locomotive but with ammonia as the working fluid instead of steam or compressed air Ammonia engines were used experimentally in the th century by Goldsworthy Gurney in the UK and the St Charles Avenue Streetcar line in New Orleans in the s and s and during World War II ammonia was used to power buses in Belgium br Ammonia is sometimes proposed as a practical alternative to fossil fuel for internal combustion engines However ammonia cannot be easily used in existing Otto cycle engines because of its very narrow flammability range Despite this several tests have been run Its high octane rating of and low flame temperature allows the use of high compression ratios without a penalty of high NOx production Since ammonia contains no carbon its combustion cannot produce carbon dioxide carbon monoxide hydrocarbons or soot br Ammonia production currently creates of global CO emissions Green ammonia is ammonia produced by using green hydrogen hydrogen produced by electrolysis whereas blue ammonia is ammonia produced using blue hydrogen hydrogen produced by steam methane reforming where the carbon dioxide has been captured and stored br Rocket engines have also been fueled by ammonia The Reaction Motors XLR rocket engine that powered the X hypersonic research aircraft used liquid ammonia Although not as powerful as other fuels it left no soot in the reusable rocket engine and its density approximately matches the density of the oxidiser liquid oxygen which simplified the aircraft s design br In Saudi Arabia shipped metric tons of liquid blue ammonia to Japan for use as a fuel It was produced as a by product by petrochemical industries and can be burned without giving off greenhouse gases Its energy density by volume is nearly double that of liquid hydrogen If the process of creating it can be scaled up via purely renewable resources producing green ammonia it could make a major difference in avoiding climate change The company ACWA Power and the city of Neom have announced the construction of a green hydrogen and ammonia plant in br Green ammonia is considered as a potential fuel for future container ships In the companies DSME and MAN Energy Solutions announced the construction of an ammonia based ship DSME plans to commercialize it by The use of ammonia as a potential alternative fuel for aircraft jet engines is also being explored br Japan intends to implement a plan to develop ammonia co firing technology that can increase the use of ammonia in power generation as part of efforts to assist domestic and other Asian utilities to accelerate their transition to carbon neutrality br In October the first International Conference on Fuel Ammonia ICFA was held br In June IHI Corporation succeeded in reducing greenhouse gases by over during combustion of liquid ammonia in a kilowatt class gas turbine achieving truly CO free power generation br In July Quad nations of Japan the U S Australia and India agreed to promote technological development for clean burning hydrogen and ammonia as fuels at the security grouping s first energy meeting As of however significant amounts of NOx are produced Nitrous oxide may also be a problem br At high temperature and in the presence of a suitable catalyst ammonia decomposes into its constituent elements Decomposition of ammonia is a slightly endothermic process requiring kJ mol kcal mol of ammonia and yields hydrogen and nitrogen gas br br br Other br br br Remediation of gaseous emissions br Ammonia is used to scrub SO from the burning of fossil fuels and the resulting product is converted to ammonium sulfate for use as fertiliser Ammonia neutralises the nitrogen oxide NOx pollutants emitted by diesel engines This technology called SCR selective catalytic reduction relies on a vanadia based catalyst br Ammonia may be used to mitigate gaseous spills of phosgene br br br Stimulant br br Ammonia as the vapour released by smelling salts has found significant use as a respiratory stimulant Ammonia is commonly used in the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine through a Birch reduction The Birch method of making methamphetamine is dangerous because the alkali metal and liquid ammonia are both extremely reactive and the temperature of liquid ammonia makes it susceptible to explosive boiling when reactants are added br br br Textile br Liquid ammonia is used for treatment of cotton materials giving properties like mercerisation using alkalis In particular it is used for prewashing of wool br br br Lifting gas br At standard temperature and pressure ammonia is less dense than atmosphere and has approximately of the lifting power of hydrogen or helium Ammonia has sometimes been used to fill balloons as a lifting gas Because of its relatively high boiling point compared to helium and hydrogen ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquefied aboard an airship to reduce lift and add ballast and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast br br br Fuming br br Ammonia has been used to darken quartersawn white oak in Arts Crafts and Mission style furniture Ammonia fumes react with the natural tannins in the wood and cause it to change colour br br br Safety br br The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has set a minute exposure limit for gaseous ammonia of ppm by volume in the environmental air and an hour exposure limit of ppm by volume The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH recently reduced the IDLH Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health the level to which a healthy worker can be exposed for minutes without suffering irreversible health effects from to based on recent more conservative interpretations of original research in Other organisations have varying exposure levels US Navy Standards U S Bureau of Ships maximum allowable concentrations MACs for continuous exposure days is ppm for exposure of hour is ppm br Ammonia vapour has a sharp irritating pungent odor that acts as a warning of potentially dangerous exposure The average odor threshold is ppm well below any danger or damage Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death Ammonia is regulated in the US as a non flammable gas but it meets the definition of a material that is toxic by inhalation and requires a hazardous safety permit when transported in quantities greater than US gallons L imp gal br Liquid ammonia is dangerous because it is hygroscopic and because it can cause caustic burns See Gas carrier Health effects of specific cargoes carried on gas carriers for more information br br br Toxicity br The toxicity of ammonia solutions does not usually cause problems for humans and other mammals as a specific mechanism exists to prevent its build up in the bloodstream Ammonia is converted to carbamoyl phosphate by the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and then enters the urea cycle to be either incorporated into amino acids or excreted in the urine Fish and amphibians lack this mechanism as they can usually eliminate ammonia from their bodies by direct excretion Ammonia even at dilute concentrations is highly toxic to aquatic animals and for this reason it is classified as dangerous for the environment Atmospheric ammonia plays a key role in the formation of fine particulate matter br Ammonia is a constituent of tobacco smoke br br br Coking wastewater br Ammonia is present in coking wastewater streams as a liquid by product of the production of coke from coal In some cases the ammonia is discharged to the marine environment where it acts as a pollutant The Whyalla Steelworks in South Australia is one example of a coke producing facility that discharges ammonia into marine waters br br br Aquaculture br Ammonia toxicity is believed to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism Tolerance varies among fish species At lower concentrations around mg L un ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases Exposed to excess ammonia fish may suffer loss of equilibrium hyper excitability increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate At concentrations exceeding mg L ammonia causes gill and tissue damage extreme lethargy convulsions coma and death Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from to mg L br During winter when reduced feeds are administered to aquaculture stock ammonia levels can be higher Lower ambient temperatures reduce the rate of algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present Within an aquaculture environment especially at large scale there is no fast acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish and in open water systems the surrounding environment br br br Storage information br Similar to propane anhydrous ammonia boils below room temperature when at atmospheric pressure A storage vessel capable of psi MPa is suitable to contain the liquid Ammonia is used in numerous different industrial applications requiring carbon or stainless steel storage vessels Ammonia with at least by weight water content is not corrosive to carbon steel NH carbon steel construction storage tanks with by weight or more of water could last more than years in service Experts warn that ammonium compounds not be allowed to come in contact with bases unless in an intended and contained reaction as dangerous quantities of ammonia gas could be released br br br Laboratory br br The hazards of ammonia solutions depend on the concentration dilute ammonia solutions are usually by weight mol L concentrated solutions are usually prepared at by weight A by weight solution has a density of g cm and a solution that has a lower density will be more concentrated The European Union classification of ammonia solutions is given in the table br br The ammonia vapour from concentrated ammonia solutions is severely irritating to the eyes and the respiratory tract and experts warn that these solutions only be handled in a fume hood Saturated see Properties solutions can develop a significant pressure inside a closed bottle in warm weather and experts also warn that the bottle be opened with care This is not usually a problem for solutions br Experts warn that ammonia solutions not be mixed with halogens as toxic and or explosive products are formed Experts also warn that prolonged contact of ammonia solutions with silver mercury or iodide salts can also lead to explosive products such mixtures are often formed in qualitative inorganic analysis and that it needs to be lightly acidified but not concentrated w v before disposal once the test is completed br br br Laboratory use of anhydrous ammonia gas or liquid br Anhydrous ammonia is classified as toxic T and dangerous for the environment N The gas is flammable autoignition temperature C and can form explosive mixtures with air The permissible exposure limit PEL in the United States is ppm mg m while the IDLH concentration is estimated at ppm Repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to the smell of the gas normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than ppm but desensitised individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of ppm Anhydrous ammonia corrodes copper and zinc containing alloys which makes brass fittings not appropriate for handling the gas Liquid ammonia can also attack rubber and certain plastics br Ammonia reacts violently with the halogens Nitrogen triiodide a primary high explosive is formed when ammonia comes in contact with iodine Ammonia causes the explosive polymerisation of ethylene oxide It also forms explosive fulminating compounds with compounds of gold silver mercury germanium or tellurium and with stibine Violent reactions have also been reported with acetaldehyde hypochlorite solutions potassium ferricyanide and peroxides br br br Production br br Ammonia has one of the highest rates of production of any inorganic chemical Production is sometimes expressed in terms of fixed nitrogen Global production was estimated as being million tonnes in tons of fixed nitrogen China accounted for of that followed by Russia at the United States at and India at br Before the start of World War I most ammonia was obtained by the dry distillation of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste products including camel dung where it was distilled by the reduction of nitrous acid and nitrites with hydrogen in addition it was produced by the distillation of coal and also by the decomposition of ammonium salts by alkaline hydroxides such as quicklime br br NH Cl CaO CaCl Ca OH NH g br For small scale laboratory synthesis one can heat urea and calcium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide br br NH CO Ca OH CaCO NH br br br Haber Bosch br br br Electrochemical br Ammonia can be synthesized electrochemically The only required inputs are sources of nitrogen potentially atmospheric and hydrogen water allowing generation at the point of use The availability of renewable energy creates the possibility of zero emission production br Green Ammonia is a name for ammonia produced from hydrogen that is in turn produced from carbon free sources such as electrolysis of water Ammonia from this source can be used as a liquid fuel with zero contribution to global climate change br Another electrochemical synthesis mode involves the reductive formation of lithium nitride which can be protonated to ammonia given a proton source which can be hydrogen In the early years of the development of this process ethanol has been used as such a source The first use of this chemistry was reported in where lithium solutions in ethanol were used to produce ammonia at pressures of up to bar In Tsuneto et al used lithium electrodeposition in tetrahydrofuran to synthesize ammonia at more moderate pressures with reasonable Faradaic efficiency Other studies have since used the ethanol tetrahydrofuran system for electrochemical ammonia synthesis In Lazouski et al proposed a mechanism to explain observed ammonia formation kinetics br In Lazouski et al developed a solvent agnostic gas diffusion electrode to improve nitrogen transport to the reactive lithium The study observed NH production rates of up to nmol s cm and Faradaic efficiencies of up to at ambient temperature and bar pressure br In Suryanto et al replaced ethanol with a tetraalkyl phosphonium salt This cation can stably undergo deprotonation reprotonation cycles while it enhances the medium s ionic conductivity The study observed NH production rates of nmol s cm at faradaic efficiency experiments under bar hydrogen and bar nitrogen partial pressure at ambient temperature br In Fu et al reported the production of ammonia via the lithium mediated process in a continuous flow electrolyzer also demonstrating the hydrogen gas as proton source The study synthesized ammonia at Faradaic efficiency at a current density of mA cm at bar and room temperature br br br Biochemistry and medicine br br Ammonia is essential for life For example it is required for the formation of amino acids and nucleic acids fundamental building blocks of life Ammonia is however quite toxic Nature thus uses carriers for ammonia Within a cell glutamate serves this role In the bloodstream glutamine is a source of ammonia br Ethanolamine required for cell membranes is the substrate for ethanolamine ammonia lyase which produces ammonia br br H NCH CH OH NH CH CHO br Ammonia is both a metabolic waste and a metabolic input throughout the biosphere It is an important source of nitrogen for living systems Although atmospheric nitrogen abounds more than few living creatures are capable of using atmospheric nitrogen in its diatomic form N gas Therefore nitrogen fixation is required for the synthesis of amino acids which are the building blocks of protein Some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter Others such as nitrogen fixing legumes benefit from symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria that create ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen br In humans inhaling ammonia in high concentrations can be fatal Exposure to ammonia can cause headaches edema impaired memory seizures and coma as it is neurotoxic in nature br br br Biosynthesis br In certain organisms ammonia is produced from atmospheric nitrogen by enzymes called nitrogenases The overall process is called nitrogen fixation Intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation The scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme which consists of an Fe MoS ensemble br Ammonia is also a metabolic product of amino acid deamination catalyzed by enzymes such as glutamate dehydrogenase Ammonia excretion is common in aquatic animals In humans it is quickly converted to urea by liver which is much less toxic particularly less basic This urea is a major component of the dry weight of urine Most reptiles birds insects and snails excrete uric acid solely as nitrogenous waste br br br Physiology br Ammonia plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal physiology It is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations The liver converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the urea cycle Liver dysfunction such as that seen in cirrhosis may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood hyperammonemia Likewise defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle such as ornithine transcarbamylase lead to hyperammonemia Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and coma of hepatic encephalopathy as well as the neurological disease common in people with urea cycle defects and organic acidurias br Ammonia is important for normal animal acid base balance After formation of ammonium from glutamine ketoglutarate may be degraded to produce two bicarbonate ions which are then available as buffers for dietary acids Ammonium is excreted in the urine resulting in net acid loss Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules combine with a hydrogen ion and thus allow for further acid excretion br br br Excretion br br Ammonium ions are a toxic waste product of metabolism in animals In fish and aquatic invertebrates it is excreted directly into the water In mammals sharks and amphibians it is converted in the urea cycle to urea which is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently In birds reptiles and terrestrial snails metabolic ammonium is converted into uric acid which is solid and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss br br br Extraterrestrial occurrence br br Ammonia has been detected in the atmospheres of the giant planets Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune along with other gases such as methane hydrogen and helium The interior of Saturn may include frozen ammonia crystals It is found on Deimos and Phobos the two moons of Mars br br br Interstellar space br Ammonia was first detected in interstellar space in based on microwave emissions from the direction of the galactic core This was the first polyatomic molecule to be so detected br The sensitivity of the molecule to a broad range of excitations and the ease with which it can be observed in a number of regions has made ammonia one of the most important molecules for studies of molecular clouds The relative intensity of the ammonia lines can be used to measure the temperature of the emitting medium br The following isotopic species of ammonia have been detected NH NH NH D NHD and ND The detection of triply deuterated ammonia was considered a surprise as deuterium is relatively scarce It is thought that the low temperature conditions allow this molecule to survive and accumulate br Since its interstellar discovery NH has proved to be an invaluable spectroscopic tool in the study of the interstellar medium With a large number of transitions sensitive to a wide range of excitation conditions NH has been widely astronomically detected its detection has been reported in hundreds of journal articles Listed below is a sample of journal articles that highlights the range of detectors that have been used to identify ammonia br The study of interstellar ammonia has been important to a number of areas of research in the last few decades Some of these are delineated below and primarily involve using ammonia as an interstellar thermometer br br br Interstellar formation mechanisms br The interstellar abundance for ammonia has been measured for a variety of environments The NH H ratio has been estimated to range from in small dark clouds up to in the dense core of the Orion molecular cloud complex Although a total of total production routes have been proposed the

extensive tables of the chemistry among C N and O compounds A review of interstellar ammonia cites the following reactions as the principal dissociation mechanisms br br with rate constants of and respectively The above equations run at a rate of and respectively These calculations assumed the given rate constants and abundances of NH H H H HCO H and total densities of n typical of cold dense molecular clouds Clearly between these two primary reactions equation is the dominant destruction reaction with a rate times faster than equation This is due to the relatively high abundance of H br br br Single antenna detections br Radio observations of NH from the Effelsberg m Radio Telescope reveal that the ammonia line is separated into two components a background ridge and an unresolved core The background corresponds well with the locations previously detected CO The m Chilbolton telescope in England detected radio signatures of ammonia in H II regions HNH O masers H H objects and other objects associated with star formation A comparison of emission line widths indicates that turbulent or systematic velocities do not increase in the central cores of molecular clouds br Microwave radiation from ammonia was observed in several galactic objects including W OH Orion A W W and five sources in the galactic centre The high detection rate indicates that this is a common molecule in the interstellar medium and that high density regions are common in the galaxy br br br Interferometric studies br VLA observations of NH in seven regions with high velocity gaseous outflows revealed condensations of less than pc in L S and Cepheus A Three individual condensations were detected in Cepheus A one of them with a highly elongated shape They may play an important role in creating the bipolar outflow in the region br Extragalactic ammonia was imaged using the VLA in IC The hot gas has temperatures above K which was inferred from ammonia line ratios and appears to be closely associated with the innermost portions of the nuclear bar seen in CO NH was also monitored by VLA toward a sample of four galactic ultracompact HII regions G G G and G Based upon temperature and density diagnostics it is concluded that in general such clumps are probably the sites of massive star formation in an early evolutionary phase prior to the development of an ultracompact HII region br br br Infrared detections br Absorption at micrometres due to solid ammonia was recorded from interstellar grains in the Becklin Neugebauer Object and probably in NGC IR as well This detection helped explain the physical shape of previously poorly understood and related ice absorption lines br A spectrum of the disk of Jupiter was obtained from the Kuiper Airborne Observatory covering the to cm spectral range Analysis of the spectrum provides information on global mean properties of ammonia gas and an ammonia ice haze br A total of dark cloud positions were surveyed for evidence of dense cores by using the J K rotating inversion line of NH In general the cores are not spherically shaped with aspect ratios ranging from to It is also found that cores with stars have broader lines than cores without stars br Ammonia has been detected in the Draco Nebula and in one or possibly two molecular clouds which are associated with the high latitude galactic infrared cirrus The finding is significant because they may represent the birthplaces for the Population I metallicity B type stars in the galactic halo that could have been borne in the galactic disk br br br Observations of nearby dark clouds br By balancing and stimulated emission with spontaneous emission it is possible to construct a relation between excitation temperature and density Moreover since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a level system at low temperatures this calculation is fairly simple This premise can be applied to dark clouds regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation Detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow lines indicative not only of low temperatures but also of a low level of inner cloud turbulence Line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous CO observations The ammonia observations were consistent with CO measurements of rotation temperatures of K With this densities can be determined and have been calculated to range between and cm in dark clouds Mapping of NH gives typical clouds sizes of pc and masses near solar mass These cold dense cores are the sites of future star formation br br br UC HII regions br Ultra compact HII regions are among the best tracers of high mass star formation The dense material surrounding UCHII regions is likely primarily molecular Since a complete study of massive star formation necessarily involves the cloud from which the star formed ammonia is an invaluable tool in understanding this surrounding molecular material Since this molecular material can be spatially resolved it is possible to constrain the heating ionising sources temperatures masses and sizes of the regions Doppler shifted velocity components allow for the separation of distinct regions of molecular gas that can trace outflows and hot cores originating from forming stars br br br Extragalactic detection br Ammonia has been detected in external galaxies and by simultaneously measuring several lines it is possible to directly measure the gas temperature in these galaxies Line ratios imply that gas temperatures are warm K originating from dense clouds with sizes of tens of parsecs This picture is consistent with the picture within our Milky Way galaxy hot dense molecular cores form around newly forming stars embedded in larger clouds of molecular material on the scale of several hundred parsecs giant molecular clouds GMCs br br br See also br Ammonia data page Chemical data page
