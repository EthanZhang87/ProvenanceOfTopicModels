id: 2780146
The European emission standards are vehicle emission standards for pollution from the use of new land surface vehicles sold in the European Union and European Economic Area member states and the United Kingdom and ships in EU waters The standards are defined in a series of European Union directives staging the progressive introduction of increasingly stringent standards br In December Euro was provisionally agreed to include non exhaust emissions such as particulates from tyres and brakes Until fossil fuelled vehicles are allowed to have dirtier brakes than electric vehicles br br br Background br br In the European Union emissions of nitrogen oxides NOx total hydrocarbon THC non methane hydrocarbons NMHC carbon monoxide CO and particulate matter PM are regulated for most vehicle types including cars trucks lorries locomotives tractors and similar machinery barges but excluding seagoing ships and aeroplanes For each vehicle type different standards apply Compliance is determined by running the engine at a standardised test cycle Non compliant vehicles cannot be sold in the EU but new standards do not apply to vehicles already on the roads No use of specific technologies is mandated to meet the standards though available technology is considered when setting the standards New models introduced must meet current or planned standards but minor lifecycle model revisions may continue to be offered with pre compliant engines br Along with Emissions standards the European Union has also mandated a number of computer on board diagnostics for the purposes of increasing safety for drivers These standards are used in relation to the emissions standards br During the early s Australia began harmonising Australian Design Rule certification for new motor vehicle emissions with Euro categories Euro III was introduced on January and is progressively being introduced to align with European introduction dates br As of March Euro is awaiting formal approval by EU countries br br br Toxic emission stages and legal framework br br The stages are typically referred to as Euro Euro Euro Euro Euro and Euro for Light Duty Vehicle standards br The legal framework consists in a series of directives each amendments to the Directive EEC The following is a summary list of the standards when they come into force what they apply to and which EU directives provide the definition of the standard br br Euro br For passenger cars EEC br Also for passenger cars and light lorries EEC br Euro for passenger cars EC EC br For motorcycle EC row A EC br Euro for any vehicle EC br For motorcycle EC row B EC br Euro for any vehicle EC EC br Euro for light passenger and commercial vehicles EC br Euro for light passenger and commercial vehicles EC and EU br Euro to br These limits supersede the original directive on emission limits EEC br The classifications for vehicle category are defined by br br Commission Directive EC of December adapting to technical progress Council Directive EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type approval of motor vehicles and their trailers br Directive EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of March relating to the type approval of two or three wheeled motor vehicles and repealing Council Directive EEC br br br Emission standards for passenger cars br Emission standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles are summarized in the following tables Since the Euro stage EU regulations introduce different emission limits for diesel and petrol vehicles Diesels have more stringent CO standards but are allowed higher NOx emissions Petrol powered vehicles are exempted from particulate matter PM standards through to the Euro stage but vehicles with direct injection engines are subject to a limit of g km for Euro and Euro A particulate number standard P or PN has been introduced in with Euro b for diesel engines and in with Euro for petrol engines br From a technical perspective European emissions standards do not reflect everyday usage of the vehicle as manufacturers are allowed to lighten the vehicle by removing the back seats improve aerodynamics by taping over grilles and door handles or reduce the load on the generator by switching off the headlights the passenger compartment fan or simply disconnecting the alternator which charges the battery br br br Emission standards for motor cycles two and three wheelers L category vehicles br The Euro emissions regulations for two and three wheelers motorcycles were first introduced in some seven years after the cars were first regulated In further difference to passenger cars where three way catalytic converters were de facto required from Euro I it was first with the introduction of the Euro III emissions standard in that motorcycles were de facto required to use three way catalytic converters With the introduction of Euro V standard two stroke engine motorcycles are challenged by the strict HC and PM emissions limits It is expected that technologies such as direct injection combined with petrol particulate filters could be needed for these motorcycle engine types to meet the Euro V demands br br br Emission standards for light commercial vehicles br br br Emission standards for trucks and buses br br The emission standards for trucks lorries and buses are defined by engine energy output in g kWh this is unlike the emission standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles which are defined by vehicle driving distance in g km a general comparison to passenger cars is therefore not possible as the kWh km factor depends among others on the specific vehicle br The official category name is heavy duty diesel engines which generally includes lorries and buses br The following table contains a summary of the emission standards and their implementation dates Dates in the tables refer to new type approvals the dates for all new registrations are in most cases one year later br br br Emission standards for large goods vehicles br br br Emission standards for non road mobile machinery br The term non road mobile machinery NRMM is a term used in the European emission standards to control emissions of engines that are not used primarily on public roadways This definition includes off road vehicles as well as railway vehicles br European standards for non road diesel engines harmonise with the US EPA standards and comprise gradually stringent tiers known as Stage I V standards The Stage I II was part of the directive Directive EC It was implemented in two stages with Stage I implemented in and Stage II implemented between and In the European Parliament adopted Stage III IV standards The Stage III standards were further divided into Stage III A and III B and were phased in between and Stage IV standards are enforced from Stage V standards are phased in from with full enforcement from br As of January EU Member States have to ensure that ships in the Baltic the North Sea and the English Channel are using fuels with a sulphur content of no more than Higher sulphur contents are still possible but only if the appropriate exhaust cleaning systems are in place br br br Emission test cycle br br Just as important as the regulations are the tests needed to ensure adherence to regulations These are laid out in standardised emission test cycles used to measure emissions performance against the regulatory thresholds applicable to the tested vehicle br br br Light duty vehicles br Since the Euro regulations in performance has been measured using the New European Driving Cycle test NEDC also known as MVEG B with a cold start procedure that eliminates the use of a second engine warm up period found in the ECE EUDC test cycle also known as MVEG A br br br Heavy duty vehicles br The two groups of emissions standards for heavy duty vehicles each have different appropriate test requirements Steady state testing is used for diesel engines only while transient testing applies to both diesel and petrol engines br br br Cycle beating controversy br br For the emission standards to deliver actual emission reductions it is crucial to use a test cycle that reflects real world driving conditions It was discovered that vehicle manufacturers would optimise emissions performance only for the test cycle whilst emissions from typical driving conditions proved to be much higher than when tested Some manufacturers were also found to use so called defeat devices where the engine control system would recognise that the vehicle was being tested and would automatically switch to a mode optimised for emissions performance The use of a defeat device is expressly forbidden in EU law br An independent study in used portable emissions measurement systems to measure NOx emissions during real world driving from fifteen Euro compliant diesel passenger cars The results showed that NOx emissions were on average about seven times higher than the Euro limit However some of the vehicles did show reduced emissions suggesting that real world NOx emission control is possible In one particular instance research in diesel car emissions by two German technology institutes found that zero real NOx reductions in public health risk had been achieved despite years of stricter standards report br In the Volkswagen emissions scandal involved revelations that Volkswagen AG had deliberately falsified emission reports by programming engine management unit firmware to detect test conditions and change emissions controls when under test The cars thus passed the test but in real world conditions emitted up to forty times more NOx emissions than allowed by law An independent report in September warned that this extended to every major car manufacturer with BMW and Opel named alongside Volkswagen and its sister company Audi as the worst culprits and that approximately of diesel cars breach emissions regulations Overlooking the direct responsibility of the companies involved the authors blamed the violations on a number of factors including unrealistic test conditions a lack of transparency and a number of loopholes in testing protocols br br In the European Union introduced testing in real world conditions called Real Driving Emissions RDE using portable emissions measurement systems in addition to laboratory tests The actual limits will use CF conformity factor the difference between the laboratory test and real world conditions in and CF in for NOx conformity factor for particles number P being left for further study Environment organisations criticized the decision as insufficient while ACEA mentions it will be extremely difficult for automobile manufacturers to reach such a limit in such short period of time In an ADAC study ordered by ICCT of Euro cars showed that few complied with on road emission limits and LNT NOx adsorber cars with about half the market had the highest emissions At the end of this study ICCT was expecting a conformity factor br NEDC Euro b not to exceed limit of mg km NOx will then continue to apply for the WLTC Euro c tests performed on a dynomometer while WLTC RDE will be performed in the middle of the traffic with a PEMS attached at the rear of the car RDE testing is then far more difficult than the dynomometer tests RDE not to exceed limits have then been updated to take into account different test conditions such as PEMS weight kg in various ICCT testing driving in the middle of the traffic road gradient etc br ADAC also performed NOx emission tests with a cycle representative of the real driving environment in the laboratory Among the cars tested br br cars emit less than mg km i e do not emit more NOx on this more demanding cycle than on the NEDC cycle br additional cars fall below the conformity factor In total of cars have then a good chance to be compatible with WLTC RDE br cars fall above the conformity factor and have then to be improved to satisfy the WLTC RDE test br Since ADAC performs regular pollutant emission tests on a specific cycle in the laboratory duly representing a real driving environment and gives a global notation independent from the type of engine used petrol diesel natural gas LPG hybrid etc To get the maximum note on this cycle the car shall emit less than the minimum limit applicable to either petrol or diesel car that is to say mg HC mg CO mg NOx mg PM and PN Unlike ambient discourse dirty diesel versus clean petrol cars the results are much more nuanced and subtle Some Euro diesel cars perform as well as the best hybrid petrol cars some other recent Euro petrol indirect injection cars perform as the worst Euro diesel cars finally some petrol hybrid cars are at the same level as the best Euro diesel cars br Tests commissioned by Which from the beginning of found that out of diesel car models exceed the Euro limit for NOx although they conform to official standards br br br Health impacts br After the postponement in publishing the Euro proposal details by the European Commission some civil society groups such as the European Respiratory Society and the European Public Health Alliance said in mid Every month that the implementation of Euro is delayed due to the late publication of the proposal million more polluting cars will be placed on the EU s road and stay there for decades to come br br br CO emissions br br Within the European Union transport is the biggest emitter of CO with road transport contributing about br br br Obligatory labelling br The purpose of Directive EC of the European Parliament and the Council of December relating to the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars is to ensure that information relating to the fuel economy and CO emissions of new passenger cars offered for sale or lease in the Community is made available to consumers in order to enable consumers to make an informed choice br In the United Kingdom the initial approach was deemed ineffective The way the information was presented was too complicated for consumers to understand As a result car manufacturers in the United Kingdom voluntarily agreed to put a more consumer friendly colour coded label displaying CO emissions on all new cars beginning in September with a letter from A CO g km to F CO g km The goal of the new green label is to give consumers clear information about the environmental performance of different vehicles br Other EU member countries are also in the process of introducing consumer friendly labels br br br Obligatory vehicle CO emission limits br European Union Directive No set a mandatory average fleet CO emissions target for new cars after a voluntary commitment made in and by the auto industry had failed to reduce emissions by The regulation applies to new passenger cars registered in the European Union and EEA member states for the first time A carmaker who fails to comply has to pay an excess emissions premium for each vehicle registered according with the amount of g km of exceeded br br The regulation set a target of g km for the fleet average for new passenger cars A similar set of regulations for light commercial vehicles was set in with an emissions target of g km for Both targets were met several years in advance A second set of regulations passed in set a target of average CO emissions of new cars to fall to g km by and for light commercial vehicles to g km by br In April Regulation EU was adopted which introduced CO emission performance standards for new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles for and The new Regulation went into force on January and has replaced and repealed Regulation EC and EU No The Regulation set new emission targets relative to a baseline with a reduction of the average CO emissions from new cars by in and by in For light commercial vehicles the new targets are a reduction for and a reduction for br Specific emissions targets for passenger cars br To account for different sizes of passenger cars the specific emissions target for each passenger car is calculated by adjusting the general emissions target by a value proportional to the deviation of the car s mass from the average This means that the emissions targets for heavier cars are higher than those for lighter cars In Regulations EC and EU this relationship between the specific emissions target E and the general emissions target E is expressed as E E a M M with the mass of the specific vehicle denoted by M and the average vehicle mass denoted by M approx kg The Regulations determine the factor a as for and as from onward br Pooling br Two or more car manufacturers may form a pool which allows them to meet fleet targets as a group instead of having to meet them individually The first pool was agreed among Tesla and Fiat Chrysler in reportedly costing Fiat Chrysler hundreds of millions of Euros br ZLEV Credit System br The Regulation also introduced an incentive mechanism or credit system from onwards for zero and low emission vehicles ZLEVs A ZLEV is defined as a passenger car or a commercial van with CO emissions between and g km The regulation set ZLEV sales targets of for and for and manufacturers have some flexibility in how they achieve those targets Carmakers that outperform the ZLEV sales targets will be rewarded with higher CO emission targets but the target relaxation is capped at a maximum to safeguard the integrity of the regulation br br br Electrification br br Many EU member states have responded to this problem by exploring the possibility of including electric vehicle related infrastructure into their existing road traffic system with some even having begun implementation The UK has begun its plugged in places scheme which sees funding go to several areas across the UK to create a network of charging points for electric vehicles br br br Around the world br Since January all new heavy vehicles in Brazil must comply with Proconve P similar to Euro br Since September all
