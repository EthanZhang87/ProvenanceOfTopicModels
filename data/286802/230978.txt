title: Cylinder head
id: 230978
In a piston engine the cylinder head aka head sits above the cylinders forming the roof of the combustion chamber In sidevalve engines the head is a simple plate of metal containing the spark plugs and possibly heat dissaption fins In more modern overhead valve and overhead camshaft engines the head is a more complicated metal block that also contains the inlet and exhaust passages and often coolant passages Valvetrain components and fuel injectors br br br Number of cylinder heads br A piston engine typically has one cylinder head per bank of cylinders br Most modern engines with a straight inline layout today use a single cylinder head that serves all the cylinders br Engines with a V layout or flat layout typically use two cylinder heads one for each cylinder bank however a small number of narrow angle V engines such as the Volkswagen VR and VR engines use a single cylinder head spanning the two banks br Most radial engines have one head for each cylinder although this is usually of the monobloc form wherein the head is made as an integral part of the cylinder This is also common for motorcycles and such head cylinder components are referred to as barrels br Some engines particularly medium and large capacity diesel engines built for industrial marine power generation and heavy traction purposes large trucks locomotives heavy equipment etc have individual cylinder heads for each cylinder This reduces repair costs as a single failed head on a single cylinder can be changed instead of a larger much more expensive unit fitting all the cylinders Such a design also allows engine manufacturers to easily produce a family of engines of different layouts and or cylinder numbers without requiring new cylinder head designs br br br Design br br br Engine valvetrain configurations br br br Sidevalve engines br In a flathead sidevalve engine all of the valvetrain components are contained within the block therefore the head is usually a simple plate of metal bolted to the top of the engine block Sidevalve engines were once universal but are now largely obsolete in automobiles found almost exclusively in small engines such as lawnmowers weed trimmers and chainsaws br br br Intake over exhaust IOE engines br Intake Over Exhaust IOE engines combined elements of the sidevalve and overhead valve designs Used extensively in American motorcycles in the early s the IOE engine remained in production in limited numbers until the s IOE engines are more efficient than sidevalve engines but also more complex larger and more expensive to manufacture br br br Overhead engines OHV OHC br In an overhead valve OHV or overhead camshaft OHC engine the cylinder head contains several airflow passages called ports intake ports deliver the fuel air intake charge from the intake manifold to the combustion chamber and exhaust ports route combustion waste gases out the combustion chamber to the exhaust manifold Valves open and close the ports with the intakes offset fore and aft from the exhausts The head also contains the spark plugs and on water cooled engines the coolant passages br br br Overhead valve OHV engines br A single camshaft located in the engine block uses pushrods and rocker arms to actuate all the valves br OHV engines are typically more compact than equivalent OHC engines and fewer parts mean cheaper production but they have largely been replaced by OHC designs except in some American V engines br br br Overhead camshaft OHC engines br An overhead camshaft OHC engine locates the camshaft s in the cylinder head above the combustion chamber Eliminating pushrods lessens valvetrain inertia and provides space for optimized port designs both providing increased power potential br In a single overhead camshaft SOHC engine the camshaft may be seated centrally between valve rows or directly above a single row of valves replacing rocker arm actuation with tappets SOHC engines were widely from the s to s eliminating pushrods but still utilizing rocker arms br Double overhead camshaft DOHC engines seat a camshaft directly above each row of offset valves intakes inboard exhausts outboard DOHC designs allow optimal crossflow positioning of valves to provide higher RPM operation They are typically larger in size especially width than equivalent OHV or SOHC engines Even though more components raise production costs DOHC engines seen widespread use in automobile engines since the s br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br See also br br Crossflow cylinder head br Reverse flow cylinder head br Head gasket br Junk head br Monobloc head br Flathead engine br T head engine br br br
