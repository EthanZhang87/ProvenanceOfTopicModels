title: Engine block
id: 1414527
In an internal combustion engine the engine block is the structure that contains the cylinders and other components The engine block in an early automotive engine consisted of just the cylinder block to which a separate crankcase was attached Modern engine blocks typically have the crankcase integrated with the cylinder block as a single component Engine blocks often also include elements such as coolant passages and oil galleries br The term cylinder block is often used interchangeably with engine block However technically the block of a modern engine i e multiple cylinders integrated with another component would be classified as a monobloc br br br Construction br The main structure of an engine typically consists of the cylinders coolant passages oil galleries crankcase and cylinder head s The first production engines of the s to s usually used separate components for each element which were bolted together during engine assembly Modern engines however often combine many elements into a single component to reduce production costs br The evolution from separate components to monobloc engine blocks has gradually progressed since the early th century The integration of elements has relied on the development of foundry and machining techniques For example a practical low cost V engine was not feasible until Ford developed the methods used to build its flathead V engine Other manufacturers then applied those techniques to their engines br br br Cylinder block br br A cylinder block is a structure that contains the cylinder plus any cylinder sleeves and coolant passages In the earliest decades of internal combustion engine development cylinders were usually cast individually so cylinder blocks were usually produced separately for each cylinder Following that engines began to combine two or three cylinders into a single cylinder block with an engine combining several of these cylinder blocks br In early engines with multiple cylinder banks such as V V or flat engines each bank was typically made of one or multiple separate cylinder blocks Since the s mass production methods have developed to allow both banks of cylinders to be integrated into the same cylinder block br br br Cylinder liners br Wet liner cylinder blocks use cylinder walls that are entirely removable and fit into the block using special gaskets They are called wet liners because their outer sides come in direct contact with the engine s coolant In other words the liner is the entire cylinder wall rather than merely a sleeve br The advantages of wet liners are a lower mass reduced space requirements and coolant being heated faster from a cold start reducing start up fuel consumption and heating the car cabin sooner br Dry liner cylinder blocks use either the block s material or a discrete liner inserted into the block to form the backbone of the cylinder wall Additional sleeves are inserted within which remain dry outside surrounded by the block s material br For either wet or dry liner designs the liners or sleeves can be replaced potentially allowing an engine overhaul or rebuild without replacing the block itself However there are more practical repair options br br br Coolant and oil passages br br br Crankcase br br The crankcase is the structure that houses the crankshaft As with cylinder blocks this is primarily an integrated component in modern engines br br br Materials br Engine blocks are typically cast from either cast iron or an aluminium alloy Aluminium blocks are much lighter and transfer heat more effectively to coolant but iron blocks retain some advantages such as durability and reduced thermal expansion br Weight reductions through material selection Presently most of the engine blocks in mass production are gray castings Reducing weight has resulted in using aluminum silicon alloys more frequently for the engine block in small displacement engines Engine blocks of comparable design but using Al Si alloys are not lighter than cast iron engine blocks in the same ratio as that for the specific weights of the materials br In engine blocks made of gray cast iron weight can be reduced by optimizing the structure and thin wall casting With this casting technique a wall thickness of as little as about mm is generally possible In comparison the walls of cast iron engine blocks are usually from to mm thick br Using vermicular graphite cast iron GGV a casting material with great strength enables weight reductions by about compared to conventional casting materials such as GG Weight reduction to this extent requires engineering for the engine block taking into account the particular needs of the material br br br Monoblocs br br An engine where all the cylinders share a common block is called a monobloc engine Most modern engines use a monobloc design and few have a separate block for each cylinder This has led to the term engine block which usually implies a monobloc design with monobloc rarely used br In the early years of the internal combustion engine casting technology couldn t produce large castings with complex internal cores for water jackets etc Most early engines particularly those with more than four cylinders had their cylinders cast as pairs or triplets of cylinders then bolted to a separate crankcase br As casting techniques improved an entire cylinder block of or cylinders could be produced in one piece This monobloc construction was more straightforward and more cost effective to produce All the cylinders and crankcase could be made in a single component for straight engine cylinder layouts One of the early engines produced using this method is the cylinder engine in the Ford Model T introduced in The technique spread to straight six engines and was commonly used by the mid s br Up until the s most V engines retained a separate block casting for each cylinder bank with both bolted onto a common crankcase itself a separate casting For economy some engines were designed to use identical castings for each bank left and right A rare exception was the Lancia narrow angle V of which used a single block casting combining both banks The Ford flathead V introduced in represented a significant development in the production of affordable V engines It was the first V engine with a single engine block casting putting a V into an affordable car for the first time br The communal water jacket of monobloc designs permitted closer spacing between cylinders The monobloc design approach also improved engines torsional rigidity as cylinder numbers engine lengths and power ratings increased br br br Integrated cylinder block and crankcase br Most engine blocks today except some unusual V or radial engines and large marine engines use a monobloc design with one block for all cylinders plus an integrated crankcase In such cases the skirts of the cylinder banks form a crankcase area of sorts which is still often called a crankcase despite no longer being a discrete part br Using steel cylinder liners and bearing shells minimizes the effect of the relative softness of aluminium Some engine designs use plasma transferred wire arc thermal spraying instead of cylinder sleeves to further reduce weight These types of engines can also be made of compacted graphite iron such as in some diesel engines br br br Integrated cylinder block and head br br Some modern consumer grade small engines use a monobloc design where the cylinder head block and half of the crankcase share the same casting Apart from cost one reason for this is to produce an overall lower engine height The primary disadvantage can be that repairs become more time consuming and impractical br An example of engines with integrated cylinder heads are the Honda GC series and GXV series engines which are sometimes called Uniblock by Honda br br br Integrated crankcase and transmission br Several cars with transverse engines have used an engine block consisting of an integrated transmission and crankcase Cars that have used this arrangement include the Lamborghini Miura and cars using the BMC A series and E series engines This design often results in the engine and transmission sharing the same oil br Motorcycles such as the Honda CB use a similar layout with the cylinder block and crankcase integrated with part of the transmission br Many farm tractor designs integrate the cylinder block crankcase transmission and rear axle into a single unit An early example is the Fordson tractor br br br See also br Core plug br Cylinder head br Head gasket br List of
