The manifold absolute pressure sensor MAP sensor is one of the sensors used in an internal combustion engine s electronic control system br Engines that use a MAP sensor are typically fuel injected The manifold absolute pressure sensor provides instantaneous manifold pressure information to the engine s electronic control unit ECU The data is used to calculate air density and determine the engine s air mass flow rate which in turn determines the required fuel metering for optimum combustion see stoichiometry and influence the advance or retard of ignition timing A fuel injected engine may alternatively use a mass airflow sensor MAF sensor to detect the intake airflow A typical naturally aspirated engine configuration employs one or the other whereas forced induction engines typically use both a MAF sensor on the Cold Air Intake leading to the turbo and a MAP sensor on the intake tract post turbo before the throttle body on the intake manifold br MAP sensor data can be converted to air mass data by using a second variable coming from an IAT Sensor intake air temperature sensor This is called the speed density method Engine speed RPM is also used to determine where on a look up table to determine fuelling hence speed density engine speed air density The MAP sensor can also be used in OBD II on board diagnostics applications to test the EGR exhaust gas recirculation valve for functionality an application typical in OBD II equipped General Motors engines br br br Example br The following example assumes the same engine speed and air temperature in a naturally aspirated engine br br Condition br An engine operating at wide open throttle WOT on top of a very high mountain has a manifold pressure of about kPa essentially equal to the barometer at that high altitude br Condition br The same engine at sea level will achieve that same kPa psi inHG of manifold pressure at less than before reaching WOT due to the higher barometric pressure br The engine requires the same mass of fuel in both conditions because the mass of air entering the cylinders is the same br If the throttle is opened all the way in condition the manifold absolute pressure will increase from kPa to nearly kPa psi inHG about equal to the local barometer which in condition is sea level The higher absolute pressure in the intake manifold increases the air s density and in turn more fuel can be burned resulting in higher output br Another example is varying rpm and engine loads br Where an engine may have kPa of manifold pressure at rpm in an unloaded condition introducing load with a further throttle opening will change the final manifold pressure to kPa engine will still be at rpm but its loading will require a different spark and fueling delivery br br br Vacuum comparison br Engine vacuum is the difference between the pressures in the intake manifold and ambient atmospheric pressure Engine vacuum is a gauge pressure since gauges by nature measure a pressure difference not an absolute pressure The engine fundamentally responds to air mass not vacuum and absolute pressure is necessary to calculate mass The mass of air entering the engine is directly proportional to the air density which is proportional to the absolute pressure and inversely proportional to the absolute temperature br Note Carburetors are largely dependent on air volume flow and vacuum and neither directly infers mass Consequently carburetors are precise but not accurate fuel metering devices Carburetors were replaced by more accurate fuel metering methods such as fuel injection in combination with an air mass flow sensor MAF br br br EGR testing br With OBD II standards vehicle manufacturers were required to test the exhaust gas recirculation EGR valve for functionality during driving Some manufacturers use the MAP sensor to accomplish this In these vehicles they have a MAF sensor for their primary load sensor The MAP sensor is then used for rationality checks and to test the EGR valve The way they do this is during a deceleration of the vehicle when there is low absolute pressure in the intake manifold i e a high vacuum present in the intake manifold relative to the outside air the powertrain control module PCM will open the EGR valve and then monitor the MAP sensor s values If the EGR is functioning properly the manifold absolute pressure will increase as exhaust gases enter br br br Common confusion with boost sensors and gauges br MAP sensors measure absolute pressure Boost sensors or gauges measure the amount of pressure above a set absolute pressure That set absolute pressure is usually kPa This is commonly referred to as gauge pressure Boost pressure is relative to absolute pressure as one increases or decreases so does the other It is a one to one relationship with an offset of kPa for boost pressure Thus a MAP sensor will always read kPa more than a boost sensor measuring the same conditions A MAP sensor will never display a negative reading because it is measuring absolute pressure where zero is the total absence of pressure Vacuum is measured as a negative pressure relative to normal atmospheric pressure Vacuum Boost sensors can display negative readings indicating vacuum or suction a condition of lower pressure than the surrounding atmosphere In forced induction engines supercharged or turbocharged a negative boost reading indicates that the engine is drawing air faster than it is being supplied creating suction The suction is caused by throttling in spark ignition engines and is not present in diesel engines This is often called vacuum pressure when referring to internal combustion engines br In short in a standard atmosphere most boost sensors will read one atmosphere less than a MAP sensor reads At sea level one can convert boost to MAP by adding approximately kPa One can convert from MAP to boost by subtracting kPa br br br See also br List of auto parts br br br External links
