Kanthal is the trademark for a family of iron chromium aluminium FeCrAl alloys used in a wide range of resistance and high temperature applications Kanthal FeCrAl alloys consist of mainly iron chromium and aluminium The first Kanthal FeCrAl alloy was developed by Hans von Kantzow in Hallstahammar Sweden The alloys are known for their ability to withstand high temperatures and having intermediate electric resistance As such it is frequently used in heating elements The trademark Kanthal is owned by Alleima AB br br br Characteristics br For heating resistance wire must be stable in air when hot Kanthal FeCrAl alloy forms a protective layer of aluminium oxide alumina Aluminium oxide has high thermal conductivity but is an electrical insulator so special techniques may be required to make good electrical connections br Ordinary Kanthal FeCrAl alloy has a melting point of C F Special grades can be used as high as C F br Depending on specific composition the resistivity is about m and temperature coefficient is ppm K K br br br Uses br Kanthal is used in heating elements due to its flexibility durability and tensile strength Its uses are widespread for example in toasters home and industrial heaters kilns and diffusion heaters used in the making of crystalline silicon br Unlike alternative types of metal such as Nichrome Kanthal is durable enough to withstand the temperatures needed but flexible and cheap enough to be practical br br br See also br Nichrome br br br br br br External links br The brand website for Kanthal products br Resistance wire technical information tables
