title: Gasoline
id: 23639
Gasoline or petrol is a petrochemical product characterized as a transparent yellowish and flammable liquid normally used as a fuel for spark ignited internal combustion engines When formulated as a fuel for engines gasoline is chemically composed of organic compounds derived from the fractional distillation of petroleum and later chemically enhanced with gasoline additives It is a high volume profitable product produced in crude oil refineries br The fuel characteristics of a particular gasoline blend which will resist igniting too early and cause engine knocking and reduce efficiency in reciprocating engines are measured as the octane rating of the fuel blend the gasoline blend with the most stable octane rating then is produced in several fuel grades for different types of motor Tetraethyl lead and other lead compounds were once widely used as additives to increase the octane rating but are not used in modern automotive gasoline due to the extreme health hazard except in aviation off road motor vehicles and racing car motors The additive continued to be used in low income countries for decades after others had phased it out leading the UN Environment Programme UNEP to launch a campaign to eliminate its use This campaign finally led to Algeria being the last country to stop its use in br Gasoline can be released into the Earth s environment as an uncombusted liquid fuel as a flammable liquid or as a vapor by way of leakages occurring during its production handling transport and delivery Gasoline contains known carcinogens Gasoline is often used as a recreational inhalant and can be harmful or fatal when used in such a manner When burned one liter U S gal of gasoline emits about kilograms lb of CO a greenhouse gas contributing to human caused climate change Oil products including gasoline were responsible for about of CO emissions worldwide in br On average U S petroleum refineries produce about to gallons of gasoline to gallons of distillate fuel diesel fuel and to gallons of jet fuel from each gallon liters barrel of crude oil The product ratio depends upon the processing in an oil refinery and the crude oil assay see Etymology br br br Etymology br br The American English word gasoline denotes fuel for automobiles which common usage shortened to the terms gas motor gas and mogas and thus differentiated that fuel from avgas aviation gasoline which is fuel for aeroplanes English dictionaries including the Oxford English Dictionary show that the term gasoline originates from gas plus the chemical suffixes ole and ine However a blog post at the defunct website Oxford Dictionaries proposes a separate theory that the word originated from the trademark term Cazeline a stylized spelling from Cassell the surname of British businessman John Cassell who supposedly first marketed the substance br In place of the word gasoline most Commonwealth countries except Canada use the term petrol and North Americans more often use gas in common parlance hence the prevalence of the usage gas bar or gas station in Canada and the United States br Coined from Medieval Latin the word petroleum L petra rock oleum oil initially denoted types of mineral oil derived from rocks and stones In Britain Petrol was a refined mineral oil product marketed as a solvent from the s by the British wholesaler Carless Refining and Marketing Ltd When Petrol found a later use as a motor fuel Frederick Simms an associate of Gottlieb Daimler suggested to John Leonard owner of Carless that they trademark the word and uppercase spelling Petrol The trademark application was refused because petrol had already become an established general term for motor fuel Due to the firm s age Carless retained the legal rights to the term and to the uppercase spelling of Petrol as the name of a petrochemical product br British refiners originally used motor spirit as a generic name for the automotive fuel and aviation spirit for aviation gasoline When Carless was denied a trademark on petrol in the s its competitors switched to the more popular name petrol However motor spirit had already made its way into laws and regulations so the term remains in use as a formal name for petrol The term is used most widely in Nigeria where the largest petroleum companies call their product premium motor spirit Although petrol has made inroads into Nigerian English premium motor spirit remains the formal name that is used in scientific publications government reports and newspapers br Some other languages use variants of gasoline Gasolina is used in Spanish and Portuguese and gasorin is used in Japanese In other languages the name of the product is derived from the hydrocarbon compound benzene or more precisely from the class of products called petroleum benzine such as benzin in German or benzina in Italian but in Argentina Uruguay and Paraguay the colloquial name nafta is derived from that of the chemical naphtha br Some languages like French and Italian use the respective words for gasoline to instead indicate diesel fuel br br br History br The first internal combustion engines suitable for use in transportation applications so called Otto engines were developed in Germany during the last quarter of the th century The fuel for these early engines was a relatively volatile hydrocarbon obtained from coal gas With a boiling point near C F n octane boils at C F it was well suited for early carburetors evaporators The development of a spray nozzle carburetor enabled the use of less volatile fuels Further improvements in engine efficiency were attempted at higher compression ratios but early attempts were blocked by the premature explosion of fuel known as knocking br In the Shukhov cracking process became the world s first commercial method to break down heavier hydrocarbons in crude oil to increase the percentage of lighter products compared to simple distillation br br br to br The evolution of gasoline followed the evolution of oil as the dominant source of energy in the industrializing world Before World War One Britain was the world s greatest industrial power and depended on its navy to protect the shipping of raw materials from its colonies Germany was also industrializing and like Britain lacked many natural resources which had to be shipped to the home country By the s Germany began to pursue a policy of global prominence and began building a navy to compete with Britain s Coal was the fuel that powered their navies Though both Britain and Germany had natural coal reserves new developments in oil as a fuel for ships changed the situation Coal powered ships were a tactical weakness because the process of loading coal was extremely slow and dirty and left the ship completely vulnerable to attack and unreliable supplies of coal at international ports made long distance voyages impractical The advantages of petroleum oil soon found the navies of the world converting to oil but Britain and Germany had very few domestic oil reserves Britain eventually solved its naval oil dependence by securing oil from Royal Dutch Shell and the Anglo Persian Oil Company and this determined from where and of what quality its gasoline would come br During the early period of gasoline engine development aircraft were forced to use motor vehicle gasoline since aviation gasoline did not yet exist These early fuels were termed straight run gasolines and were byproducts from the distillation of a single crude oil to produce kerosene which was the principal product sought for burning in kerosene lamps Gasoline production would not surpass kerosene production until The earliest straight run gasolines were the result of distilling eastern crude oils and there was no mixing of distillates from different crudes The composition of these early fuels was unknown and the quality varied greatly as crude oils from different oil fields emerged in different mixtures of hydrocarbons in different ratios The engine effects produced by abnormal combustion engine knocking and pre ignition due to inferior fuels had not yet been identified and as a result there was no rating of gasoline in terms of its resistance to abnormal combustion The general specification by which early gasolines were measured was that of specific gravity via the Baum scale and later the volatility tendency to vaporize specified in terms of boiling points which became the primary focuses for gasoline producers These early eastern crude oil gasolines had relatively high Baum test results to degrees Baum and were called Pennsylvania high test or simply high test gasolines These were often used in aircraft engines br By increased automobile production and the resultant increase in gasoline consumption produced a greater demand for gasoline Also the growing electrification of lighting produced a drop in kerosene demand creating a supply problem It appeared that the burgeoning oil industry would be trapped into over producing kerosene and under producing gasoline since simple distillation could not alter the ratio of the two products from any given crude The solution appeared in when the development of the Burton process allowed thermal cracking of crude oils which increased the percent yield of gasoline from the heavier hydrocarbons This was combined with the expansion of foreign markets for the export of surplus kerosene which domestic markets no longer needed These new thermally cracked gasolines were believed to have no harmful effects and would be added to straight run gasolines There also was the practice of mixing heavy and light distillates to achieve the desired Baum reading and collectively these were called blended gasolines br Gradually volatility gained favor over the Baum test though both continued to be used in combination to specify a gasoline As late as June Standard Oil the largest refiner of crude oil in the United States at the time stated that the most important property of a gasoline was its volatility It is estimated that the rating equivalent of these straight run gasolines varied from to octane and that the high test sometimes referred to as fighting grade probably averaged to octane br br br World War I br Prior to the United States entry into World War I the European Allies used fuels derived from crude oils from Borneo Java and Sumatra which gave satisfactory performance in their military aircraft When the U S entered the war in April the U S became the principal supplier of aviation gasoline to the Allies and a decrease in engine performance was noted Soon it was realized that motor vehicle fuels were unsatisfactory for aviation and after the loss of several combat aircraft attention turned to the quality of the gasolines being used Later flight tests conducted in showed that an octane reduction of points from down to octane decreased engine performance by percent and increased take off distance by percent If abnormal combustion were to occur the engine could lose enough power to make getting airborne impossible and a take off roll became a threat to the pilot and aircraft br On August the U S Bureau of Mines arranged to study fuels for aircraft in cooperation with the Aviation Section of the U S Army Signal Corps and a general survey concluded that no reliable data existed for the proper fuels for aircraft As a result flight tests began at Langley McCook and Wright fields to determine how different gasolines performed under different conditions These tests showed that in certain aircraft motor vehicle gasolines performed as well as high test but in other types resulted in hot running engines It was also found that gasolines from aromatic and naphthenic base crude oils from California South Texas and Venezuela resulted in smooth running engines These tests resulted in the first government specifications for motor gasolines aviation gasolines used the same specifications as motor gasolines in late br br br U S br Engine designers knew that according to the Otto cycle power and efficiency increased with compression ratio but experience with early gasolines during World War I showed that higher compression ratios increased the risk of abnormal combustion producing lower power lower efficiency hot running engines and potentially severe engine damage To compensate for these poor fuels early engines used low compression ratios which required relatively large heavy engines with limited power and efficiency The Wright brothers first gasoline engine used a compression ratio as low as to developed only kilowatts hp from cubic centimeters cu in and weighed kilograms lb This was a major concern for aircraft designers and the needs of the aviation industry provoked the search for fuels that could be used in higher compression engines br Between and the amount of thermally cracked gasoline utilized almost doubled Also the use of natural gasoline increased greatly During this period many U S states established specifications for motor gasoline but none of these agreed and they were unsatisfactory from one standpoint or another Larger oil refiners began to specify unsaturated material percentage thermally cracked products caused gumming in both use and storage while unsaturated hydrocarbons are more reactive and tend to combine with impurities leading to gumming In the U S government published the first specifications for aviation gasolines two grades were designated as fighting and domestic and were governed by boiling points color sulfur content and a gum formation test along with one motor grade for automobiles The gum test essentially eliminated thermally cracked gasoline from aviation usage and thus aviation gasolines reverted to fractionating straight run naphthas or blending straight run and highly treated thermally cracked naphthas This situation persisted until br The automobile industry reacted to the increase in thermally cracked gasoline with alarm Thermal cracking produced large amounts of both mono and diolefins unsaturated hydrocarbons which increased the risk of gumming Also the volatility was decreasing to the point that fuel did not vaporize and was sticking to spark plugs and fouling them creating hard starting and rough running in winter and sticking to cylinder walls bypassing the pistons and rings and going into the crankcase oil One journal stated on a multi cylinder engine in a high priced car we are diluting the oil in the crankcase as much as percent in a mile km run as the analysis of the oil in the oil pan shows br Being very unhappy with the consequent reduction in overall gasoline quality automobile manufacturers suggested imposing a quality standard on the oil suppliers The oil industry in turn accused the automakers of not doing enough to improve vehicle economy and the dispute became known within the two industries as the fuel problem Animosity grew between the industries each accusing the other of not doing anything to resolve matters and their relationship deteriorated The situation was only resolved when the American Petroleum Institute API initiated a conference to address the fuel problem and a cooperative fuel research CFR committee was established in to oversee joint investigative programs and solutions Apart from representatives of the two industries the Society of Automotive Engineers SAE also played an instrumental role with the U S Bureau of Standards being chosen as an impartial research organization to carry out many of the studies Initially all the programs were related to volatility and fuel consumption ease of starting crankcase oil dilution and acceleration br br br Leaded gasoline controversy br With the increased use of thermally cracked gasolines came an increased concern regarding its effects on abnormal combustion and this led to research for antiknock additives In the late s researchers such as A H Gibson Harry Ricardo Thomas Midgley Jr and Thomas Boyd began to investigate abnormal combustion Beginning in Charles F Kettering of General Motors began investigating additives based on two paths the high percentage solution where large quantities of ethanol were added and the low percentage solution where only g L or oz U S gal were needed The low percentage solution ultimately led to the discovery of tetraethyllead TEL in December a product of the research of Midgley and Boyd and the defining component of leaded gasoline This innovation started a cycle of improvements in fuel efficiency that coincided with the large scale development of oil refining to provide more products in the boiling range of gasoline Ethanol could not be patented but TEL could so Kettering secured a patent for TEL and began promoting it instead of other options br The dangers of compounds containing lead were well established by then and Kettering was directly warned by Robert Wilson of MIT Reid Hunt of Harvard Yandell Henderson of Yale and Erik Krause of the University of Potsdam in Germany about its use Krause had worked on tetraethyllead for many years and called it a creeping and malicious poison that had killed a member of his dissertation committee On October newspaper articles around the nation told of the workers at the Standard Oil refinery near Elizabeth New Jersey who were producing TEL and were suffering from lead poisoning By October the death toll had reached five In November the New Jersey Labor Commission closed the Bayway refinery and a grand jury investigation was started which had resulted in no charges by February Leaded gasoline sales were banned in New York City Philadelphia and New Jersey General Motors DuPont and Standard Oil who were partners in Ethyl Corporation the company created to produce TEL began to argue that there were no alternatives to leaded gasoline that would maintain fuel efficiency and still prevent engine knocking After several industry funded flawed studies reported that TEL treated gasoline was not a public health issue the controversy subsided br br br U S br In the five years prior to a great amount of experimentation was conducted on different testing methods for determining fuel resistance to abnormal combustion It appeared engine knocking was dependent on a wide variety of parameters including compression ignition timing cylinder temperature air cooled or water cooled engines chamber shapes intake temperatures lean or rich mixtures and others This led to a confusing variety of test engines that gave conflicting results and no standard rating scale existed By it was recognized by most aviation gasoline manufacturers and users that some kind of antiknock rating must be included in government specifications In the octane rating scale was adopted and in the first octane specification for aviation fuels was established In the same year the U S Army Air Force specified fuels rated at octane for its aircraft as a result of studies it had conducted br During this period research showed that hydrocarbon structure was extremely important to the antiknocking properties of fuel Straight chain paraffins in the boiling range of gasoline had low antiknock qualities while ring shaped molecules such as aromatic hydrocarbons for example benzene had higher resistance to knocking This development led to the search for processes that would produce more of these compounds from crude oils than achieved under straight distillation or thermal cracking Research by the major refiners led to the development of processes involving isomerization of cheap and abundant butane to isobutane and alkylation to join isobutane and butylenes to form isomers of octane such as isooctane which became an important component in aviation fuel blending To further complicate the situation as engine performance increased the altitude that aircraft could reach also increased which resulted in concerns about the fuel freezing The average temperature decrease is F C per meter ft increase in altitude and at meters ft the temperature can approach C F Additives like benzene with a freezing point of C F would freeze in the gasoline and plug fuel lines Substituted aromatics such as toluene xylene and cumene combined with limited benzene solved the problem br By there were seven different aviation grades based on octane rating two Army grades four Navy grades and three commercial grades including the introduction of octane aviation gasoline By the Army established octane as the standard fuel for combat aircraft and to add to the confusion the government now recognized different grades in addition to others in foreign countries With some companies required to stock grades of aviation fuel none of which could be interchanged the effect on the refiners was negative The refining industry could not concentrate on large capacity conversion processes for so many different grades and a solution had to be found By principally through the efforts of the Cooperative Fuel Research Committee the number of grades for aviation fuels was reduced to three and octane br The development of octane aviation gasoline on an economic scale was due in part to Jimmy Doolittle who had become Aviation Manager of Shell Oil Company He convinced Shell to invest in refining capacity to produce octane on a scale that nobody needed since no aircraft existed that required a fuel that nobody made Some fellow employees would call his effort Doolittle s million dollar blunder but time would prove Doolittle correct Before this the Army had considered octane tests using pure octane but at per liter U S gal the price prevented this from happening In Stanavo Specification Board Inc was organized by the Standard Oil companies of California Indiana and New Jersey to improve aviation fuels and oils and by had placed their first octane fuel on the market Stanavo Ethyl Gasoline It was used by the Army engine manufacturers and airlines for testing and for air racing and record flights By tests at Wright Field using the new cheaper alternatives to pure octane proved the value of octane fuel and both Shell and Standard Oil would win the contract to supply test quantities for the Army By the price was down to per liter U S gal only more than octane fuel By the end of WWII the price would be down to per liter U S gal br In Eugene Houdry developed the Houdry process of catalytic cracking which produced a high octane base stock of gasoline which was superior to the thermally cracked product since it did not contain the high concentration of olefins In there were only Houdry units in operation in the U S by this had increased to either of the Houdry process or of the Thermofor Catalytic or Fluid Catalyst type br The search for fuels with octane ratings above led to the extension of the scale by comparing power output A fuel designated grade would produce percent as much power in an engine as it would running on pure iso octane During WWII fuels above octane were given two ratings a rich and a lean mixture and these would be called performance numbers PN octane aviation gasoline would be referred to as grade br br br World War II br br br Germany br Oil and its byproducts especially high octane aviation gasoline would prove to be a driving concern for how Germany conducted the war As a result of the lessons of World War I Germany had stockpiled oil and gasoline for its blitzkrieg offensive and had annexed Austria adding barrels m cu ft per day of oil production but this was not sufficient to sustain the planned conquest of Europe Because captured supplies and oil fields would be necessary to fuel the campaign the German high command created a special squad of oilfield experts drawn from the ranks of domestic oil industries They were sent in to put out oilfield fires and get production going again as soon as possible But capturing oilfields remained an obstacle throughout the war During the Invasion of Poland German estimates of gasoline consumption turned out to be vastly too low Heinz Guderian and his Panzer divisions consumed nearly liters per kilometer U S gal mi of gasoline on the drive to Vienna When they were engaged in combat across open country gasoline consumption almost doubled On the second day of battle a unit of the XIX Corps was forced to halt when it ran out of gasoline One of the major objectives of the Polish invasion was their oil fields but the Soviets invaded and captured percent of the Polish production before the Germans could reach it Through the German Soviet Commercial Agreement Stalin agreed in vague terms to supply Germany with additional oil equal to that produced by now Soviet occupied Polish oilfields at Drohobych and Boryslav in exchange for hard coal and steel tubing br Even after the Nazis conquered the vast territories of Europe this did not help the gasoline shortage This area had never been self sufficient in oil before the war In the area that would become Nazi occupied produced barrels m cu ft per day In total production under German control amounted to only barrels m cu ft By early and the depletion of German gasoline reserves Adolf Hitler saw the invasion of Russia to seize the Polish oil fields and the Russian oil in the Caucasus as the solution to the German gasoline shortage As early as July following the June start of Operation Barbarossa certain Luftwaffe squadrons were forced to curtail ground support missions due to shortages of aviation gasoline On October the German quartermaster general estimated that army vehicles were barrels m cu ft short of gasoline requirements br Virtually all of Germany s aviation gasoline came from synthetic oil plants that hydrogenated coals and coal tars These processes had been developed during the s as an effort to achieve fuel independence There were two grades of aviation gasoline produced in volume in Germany the B or blue grade and the C or green grade which accounted for about two thirds of all production B was equivalent to octane and the C was roughly equal to the U S octane though lean mixture was rated around octane and was poorer than the U S version Maximum output achieved in reached barrels m cu ft a day before the Allies decided to target the synthetic fuel plants Through captured enemy aircraft and analysis of the gasoline found in them both the Allies and the Axis powers were aware of the quality of the aviation gasoline being produced and this prompted an octane race to achieve the advantage in aircraft performance Later in the war the C grade was improved to where it was equivalent to the U S grade rich mixture rating br br br Japan br Japan like Germany had almost no domestic oil supply and by the late s produced only seven percent of its own oil while importing the rest percent from the U S As Japanese aggression grew in China USS Panay incident and news reached the American public of Japanese bombing of civilian centers especially the bombing of Chungking public opinion began to support a U S embargo A Gallup poll in June found that percent of the American public supported an embargo on war materials to Japan This increased tensions between the U S and Japan and it led to the U S placing restrictions on exports In July the U S issued a proclamation that banned the export of octane or higher aviation gasoline to Japan This ban did not hinder the Japanese as their aircraft could operate with fuels below octane and if needed they could add TEL to increase the octane As it turned out Japan bought percent more sub octane aviation gasoline in the five months after the July ban on higher octane sales The possibility of a complete ban of gasoline from America created friction in the Japanese government as to what action to take to secure more supplies from the Dutch East Indies and demanded greater oil exports from the exiled Dutch government after the Battle of the Netherlands This action prompted the U S to move its Pacific fleet from Southern California to Pearl Harbor to help stiffen British resolve to stay in Indochina With the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in September came great concerns about the possible Japanese invasion of the Dutch Indies to secure their oil After the U S banned all exports of steel and iron scrap the next day Japan signed the Tripartite Pact and this led Washington to fear that a complete U S oil embargo would prompt the Japanese to invade the Dutch East Indies On June Harold Ickes who was appointed Petroleum Coordinator for National Defense stopped a shipment of oil from Philadelphia to Japan in light of the oil shortage on the East coast due to increased exports to Allies He also telegrammed all oil suppliers on the East coast not to ship any oil to Japan without his permission President Roosevelt countermanded Ickes s orders telling Ickes that the I simply have not got enough Navy to go around and every little episode in the Pacific means fewer ships in the Atlantic On July the U S froze all Japanese financial assets and licenses would be required for each use of the frozen funds including oil purchases that could produce aviation gasoline On July Japan invaded southern Indochina br The debate inside the Japanese government as to its oil and gasoline situation was leading to invasion of the Dutch East Indies but this would mean war with the U S whose Pacific fleet was a threat to their flank This situation led to the decision to attack the U S fleet at Pearl Harbor before proceeding with the Dutch East Indies invasion On December Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and the next day the Netherlands declared war on Japan which initiated the Dutch East Indies campaign But the Japanese missed a golden opportunity at Pearl Harbor All of the oil for the fleet was in surface tanks at the time of Pearl Harbor Admiral Chester Nimitz who became Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet was later to say We had about million barrels m cu ft of oil out there and all of it was vulnerable to caliber bullets Had the Japanese destroyed the oil he added it would have prolonged the war another two years br br br U S br Early in William Boyd president of the American Petroleum Institute and chairman of the Petroleum Industry War Council said The Allies may have floated to victory on a wave of oil in World War I but in this infinitely greater World War II we are flying to victory on the wings of petroleum In December the U S had oil wells producing billion barrels m cu ft barrels of oil a year and octane aviation gasoline capacity was at barrels m cu ft a day By the U S was producing over billion barrels m cu ft a year percent of world production and the petroleum industry had built new plants for the production of octane aviation gasoline and capacity was over barrels m cu ft a day an increase of more than ten fold It was estimated that the U S was producing enough octane aviation gasoline to permit the dropping of metric tons short tons long tons of bombs on the enemy every day of the year The record of gasoline consumption by the Army prior to June was uncoordinated as each supply service of the Army purchased its own petroleum products and no centralized system of control nor records existed On June the Army created the Fuels and Lubricants Division of the Quartermaster Corps and from their records they tabulated that the Army excluding fuels and lubricants for aircraft purchased over billion liters U S gal of gasoline for delivery to overseas theaters between June through August That figure does not include gasoline used by the Army inside the U S Motor fuel production had declined from million barrels m cu ft in down to million barrels m cu ft in World War II marked the first time in U S history that gasoline was rationed and the government imposed price controls to prevent inflation Gasoline consumption per automobile declined from liters U S gal per year in down to liters U S gal in with the goal of preserving rubber for tires since the Japanese had cut the U S off from over percent of its rubber supply which had come from the Dutch East Indies and the U S synthetic rubber industry was in its infancy Average gasoline prices went from a record low of per liter U S gal with taxes in to per liter U S gal with taxes in br Even with the world s largest aviation gasoline production the U S military still found that more was needed Throughout the duration of the war aviation gasoline supply was always behind requirements and this impacted training and operations The reason for this shortage developed before the war even began The free market did not support the expense of producing octane aviation fuel in large volume especially during the Great Depression Iso octane in the early development stage cost per liter U S gal and even by it was still per liter U S gal compared to for motor gasoline when the Army decided to experiment with octane for its combat aircraft Though only three percent of U S combat aircraft in could take full advantage of the higher octane due to low compression ratios the Army saw that the need for increasing performance warranted the expense and purchased gallons By the Army established octane as the standard fuel for combat aircraft and by production was only barrels m cu ft a day In effect the U S military was the only market for octane aviation gasoline and as war broke out in Europe this created a supply problem that persisted throughout the duration br With the war in Europe a reality in all predictions of octane consumption were outrunning all possible production Neither the Army nor the Navy could contract more than six months in advance for fuel and they could not supply the funds for plant expansion Without a long term guaranteed market the petroleum industry would not risk its capital to expand production for a product that only the government would buy The solution to the expansion of storage transportation finances and production was the creation of the Defense Supplies Corporation on September The Defense Supplies Corporation would buy transport and store all aviation gasoline for the Army and Navy at cost plus a carrying fee br When the Allied breakout after D Day found their armies stretching their supply lines to a dangerous point the makeshift solution was the Red Ball Express But even this soon was inadequate The trucks in the convoys had to drive longer distances as the armies advanced and they were consuming a greater percentage of the same gasoline they were trying to deliver In General George Patton s Third Army finally stalled just short of the German border after running out of gasoline The general was so upset at the arrival of a truckload of rations instead of gasoline he was reported to have shouted Hell they send us food when they know we can fight without food but not without oil The solution had to wait for the repairing of the railroad lines and bridges so that the more efficient trains could replace the gasoline consuming truck convoys br br br U S present br The development of jet engines burning kerosene based fuels during WWII for aircraft produced a superior performing propulsion system than internal combustion engines could offer and the U S military forces gradually replaced their piston combat aircraft with jet powered planes This development would essentially remove the military need for ever increasing octane fuels and eliminated government support for the refining industry to pursue the research and production of such exotic and expensive fuels Commercial aviation was slower to adapt to jet propulsion and until when the Boeing first entered commercial service piston powered airliners still relied on aviation gasoline But commercial aviation had greater economic concerns than the maximum performance that the military could afford As octane numbers increased so did the cost of gasoline but the incremental increase in efficiency becomes less as compression ratio goes up This reality set a practical limit to how high compression ratios could increase relative to how expensive the gasoline would become Last produced in the Pratt Whitney R Wasp Major was using Aviation gasoline and producing kilowatts per cubic centimeter hp cu in at compression ratio turbo supercharging would increase this and kilograms lb of engine weight to produce kilowatts hp This compares to the Wright Brothers engine needing almost kilograms lb of engine weight to produce kilowatts hp br The U S automobile industry after WWII could not take advantage of the high octane fuels then available Automobile compression ratios increased from an average of to in to just to in The average octane number of regular grade motor gasoline increased from to during the same time Military aircraft were using expensive turbo supercharged engines that cost at least times as much per horsepower as automobile engines and had to be overhauled every to hours The automobile market could not support such expensive engines It would not be until that the first U S automobile manufacturer could mass produce an engine that would produce one horsepower per cubic inch the Chevrolet hp cubic inch V engine option in the Corvette At this was an expensive option that few consumers could afford and would only appeal to the performance oriented consumer market willing to pay for the premium fuel required This engine had an advertised compression ratio of to and the AMA Specifications stated that the octane requirement was RON At kilograms lb with aluminum intake it took kilograms lb of engine weight to make kilowatts hp br In the s oil refineries started to focus on high octane fuels and then detergents were added to gasoline to clean the jets in carburetors The s witnessed greater attention to the environmental consequences of burning gasoline These considerations led to the phasing out of TEL and its replacement by other antiknock compounds Subsequently low sulfur gasoline was introduced in part to preserve the catalysts in modern exhaust systems br br br Chemical analysis and production br br Commercial gas is a mixture of a large number of different hydro carbons Chemical Gasoline is produced to meet a number of engine performance specifications and many different compositions are possible Hence the exact chemical composition of gasoline is undefined The performance specification also varies with season requiring less volatile blends during summer in order to minimize evaporative losses At the refinery the composition varies according to the crude oils from which it is produced the type of processing units present at the refinery how those units are operated and which hydrocarbon streams blendstocks the refinery opts to use when blending the final product br Gasoline is produced in oil refineries Roughly liters U S gal of gasoline is derived from a liter U S gal barrel of crude oil Material separated from crude oil via distillation called virgin or straight run gasoline does not meet specifications for modern engines particularly the octane rating see below but can be pooled to the gasoline blend br The bulk of a typical gasoline consists of a homogeneous mixture of small relatively lightweight hydrocarbons with between and carbon atoms per molecule commonly referred to as C C It is a mixture of paraffins alkanes olefins alkenes and napthenes cycloalkanes The use of the term paraffin in place of the standard chemical nomenclature alkane is particular to the oil industry The actual ratio of molecules in any gasoline depends upon br br the oil refinery that makes the gasoline as not all refineries have the same set of processing units br the crude oil feed used by the refinery br the grade of gasoline in particular the octane rating br The various refinery streams blended to make gasoline have different characteristics Some important streams include the following br br Straight run gasoline sometimes referred to as naphtha is distilled directly from crude oil Once the leading source of fuel its low octane rating required lead additives It is low in aromatics depending on the grade of the crude oil stream and contains some cycloalkanes naphthenes and no olefins alkenes Between and percent of this stream is pooled into the finished gasoline because the quantity of this fraction in the crude is less than fuel demand and the fraction s Research Octane Number RON is too low The chemical properties namely RON and Reid vapor pressure RVP of the straight run gasoline can be improved through reforming and isomerization However before feeding those units the naphtha needs to be split into light and heavy naphtha Straight run gasoline can also be used as a feedstock for steam crackers to produce olefins br Reformate produced in a catalytic reformer has a high octane rating with high aromatic content and relatively low olefin content Most of the benzene toluene and xylene the so called BTX hydrocarbons are more valuable as chemical feedstocks and are thus removed to some extent br Catalytic cracked gasoline or catalytic cracked naphtha produced with a catalytic cracker has a moderate octane rating high olefin content and moderate aromatic content br Hydrocrackate heavy mid and light produced with a hydrocracker has a medium to low octane rating and moderate aromatic levels br Alkylate is produced in an alkylation unit using isobutane and olefins as feedstocks Finished alkylate contains no aromatics or olefins and has a high MON Motor Octane Number br Isomerate is obtained by isomerizing low octane straight run gasoline into iso paraffins non chain alkanes such as isooctane Isomerate has a medium RON and MON but no aromatics or olefins br Butane is usually blended in the gasoline pool although the quantity of this stream is limited by the RVP specification br The terms above are the jargon used in the oil industry and the terminology varies br Currently many countries set limits on gasoline aromatics in general benzene in particular and olefin alkene content Such regulations have led to an increasing preference for alkane isomers such as isomerate or alkylate as their octane rating is higher than n alkanes In the European Union the benzene limit is set at one percent by volume for all grades of automotive gasoline This is usually achieved by avoiding feeding C in particular cyclohexane to the reformer unit where it would be converted to benzene Therefore only desulfurized heavy virgin naphtha HVN is fed to the reformer unit br Gasoline can also contain other organic compounds such as organic ethers deliberately added plus small levels of contaminants in particular organosulfur compounds which are usually removed at the refinery br br br Physical properties br br br Density br The specific gravity of gasoline ranges from to with higher densities having a greater volume fraction of aromatics Finished marketable gasoline is traded in Europe with a standard reference of kilograms per liter lb U S gal lb imp gal its price is escalated or de escalated according to its actual density Because of its low density gasoline floats on water and therefore water cannot generally be used to extinguish a gasoline fire unless applied in a fine mist br br br Stability br br Quality gasoline should be stable for six months if stored properly but can degrade over time Gasoline stored for a year will most likely be able to be burned in an internal combustion engine without too much trouble However the effects of long term storage will become more noticeable with each passing month until a time comes when the gasoline should be diluted with ever increasing amounts of freshly made fuel so that the older gasoline may be used up If left undiluted improper operation will occur and this may include engine damage from misfiring or the lack of proper action of the fuel within a fuel injection system and from an onboard computer attempting to compensate if applicable to the vehicle Gasoline should ideally be stored in an airtight container to prevent oxidation or water vapor mixing in with the gas that can withstand the vapor pressure of the gasoline without venting to prevent the loss of the more volatile fractions at a stable cool temperature to reduce the excess pressure from liquid expansion and to reduce the rate of any decomposition reactions When gasoline is not stored correctly gums and solids may result which can corrode system components and accumulate on wet surfaces resulting in a condition called stale fuel Gasoline containing ethanol is especially subject to absorbing atmospheric moisture then forming gums solids or two phases a hydrocarbon phase floating on top of a water alcohol phase br The presence of these degradation products in the fuel tank or fuel lines plus a carburetor or fuel injection components makes it harder to start the engine or causes reduced engine performance On resumption of regular engine use the buildup may or may not be eventually cleaned out by the flow of fresh gasoline The addition of a fuel stabilizer to gasoline can extend the life of fuel that is not or cannot be stored properly though removal of all fuel from a fuel system is the only real solution to the problem of long term storage of an engine or a machine or vehicle Typical fuel stabilizers are proprietary mixtures containing mineral spirits isopropyl alcohol trimethylbenzene or other additives Fuel stabilizers are commonly used for small engines such as lawnmower and tractor engines especially when their use is sporadic or seasonal little to no use for one or more seasons of the year Users have been advised to keep gasoline containers more than half full and properly capped to reduce air exposure to avoid storage at high temperatures to run an engine for ten minutes to circulate the stabilizer through all components prior to storage and to run the engine at intervals to purge stale fuel from the carburetor br Gasoline stability requirements are set by the standard ASTM D This standard describes the various characteristics and requirements of automotive fuels for use over a wide range of operating conditions in ground vehicles equipped with spark ignition engines br br br Combustion energy content br A gasoline fueled internal combustion engine obtains energy from the combustion of gasoline s various hydrocarbons with oxygen from the ambient air yielding carbon dioxide and water as exhaust The combustion of octane a representative species performs the chemical reaction br br C H O CO H O br By weight combustion of gasoline releases about megajoules per kilogram kWh kg MJ lb or by volume megajoules per liter kWh L MJ U S gal BTU U S gal quoting the lower heating value Gasoline blends differ and therefore actual energy content varies according to the season and producer by up to percent more or less than the average On average about liters U S gal of gasoline are available from a barrel of crude oil about percent by volume varying with the quality of the crude and the grade of the gasoline The remainder is products ranging from tar to naphtha br A high octane rated fuel such as liquefied petroleum gas LPG has an overall lower power output at the typical compression ratio of an engine design optimized for gasoline fuel An engine tuned for LPG fuel via higher compression ratios typically improves the power output This is because higher octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking resulting in a higher cylinder temperature which improves efficiency Also increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher expansion ratio on the power stroke which is by far the greater effect The higher expansion ratio extracts more work from the high pressure gas created by the combustion process An Atkinson cycle engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high expansion ratio without the disadvantages chiefly detonation of a high compression ratio A high expansion ratio is also one of the two key reasons for the efficiency of diesel engines along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake airflow br The lower energy content of LPG by liquid volume in comparison to gasoline is due mainly to its lower density This lower density is a property of the lower molecular weight of propane LPG s chief component compared to gasoline s blend of various hydrocarbon compounds with heavier molecular weights than propane Conversely LPG s energy content by weight is higher than gasoline s due to a higher hydrogen to carbon ratio br Molecular weights of the species in the representative octane combustion are and for C H O CO and H O respectively therefore one kilogram lb of fuel reacts with kilograms lb of oxygen to produce kilograms lb of carbon dioxide and kilograms lb of water br br br Octane rating br br Spark ignition engines are designed to burn gasoline in a controlled process called deflagration However the unburned mixture may autoignite by pressure and heat alone rather than igniting from the spark plug at exactly the right time causing a rapid pressure rise that can damage the engine This is often referred to as engine knocking or end gas knock Knocking can be reduced by increasing the gasoline s resistance to autoignition which is expressed by its octane rating br Octane rating is measured relative to a mixture of trimethylpentane an isomer of octane and n heptane There are different conventions for expressing octane ratings so the same physical fuel may have several different octane ratings based on the measure used One of the best known is the research octane number RON br The octane rating of typical commercially available gasoline varies by country In Finland Sweden and Norway RON is the standard for regular unleaded gasoline and RON is also available as a more expensive option br In the United Kingdom over percent of gasoline sold has RON and is marketed as Unleaded or Premium Unleaded Super Unleaded with RON and branded high performance fuels e g Shell V Power BP Ultimate with RON make up the balance Gasoline with RON may rarely be available for racing purposes br In the U S octane ratings in unleaded fuels vary between and AKI RON for regular AKI RON for mid grade equivalent to European regular up to AKI RON for premium European premium br br As South Africa s largest city Johannesburg is located on the Highveld at meters ft above sea level the Automobile Association of South Africa recommends octane gasoline at low altitude and octane for use in Johannesburg because The higher the altitude the lower the air pressure and the lower the need for a high octane fuel as there is no real performance gain br Octane rating became important as the military sought higher output for aircraft engines in the late s and the s A higher octane rating allows a higher compression ratio or supercharger boost and thus higher temperatures and pressures which translate to higher power output Some scientists even predicted that a nation with a good supply of high octane gasoline would have the advantage in air power In the Rolls Royce Merlin aero engine produced kilowatts hp using RON fuel from a modest liters cu in displacement By the time of Operation Overlord both the RAF and USAAF were conducting some operations in Europe using RON fuel avgas obtained by adding percent aniline to octane avgas By this time the Rolls Royce Merlin was developing kilowatts hp using this fuel br br br Additives br br br Antiknock additives br br br Tetraethyl lead br br Gasoline when used in high compression internal combustion engines tends to auto ignite or detonate causing damaging engine knocking also called pinging or pinking To address this problem tetraethyl lead TEL was widely adopted as an additive for gasoline in the s With a growing awareness of the seriousness of the extent of environmental and health damage caused by lead compounds however and the incompatibility of lead with catalytic converters governments began to mandate reductions in gasoline lead br In the U S the Environmental Protection Agency issued regulations to reduce the lead content of leaded gasoline over a series of annual phases scheduled to begin in but delayed by court appeals until By leaded fuel accounted for only percent of total gasoline sales and under metric tons short tons long tons of lead per year From January the U S Clean Air Act banned the sale of leaded fuel for use in on road vehicles in the U S The use of TEL also necessitated other additives such as dibromoethane br European countries began replacing lead containing additives by the end of the s and by the end of the s leaded gasoline was banned within the entire European Union The UAE started to switch to unleaded in the early s br Reduction in the average lead content of human blood may be a major cause for falling violent crime rates around the world including South Africa A study found a correlation between leaded gasoline usage and violent crime see Lead crime hypothesis Other studies found no correlation br In August the UN Environment Programme announced that leaded petrol had been eradicated worldwide with Algeria being the last country to deplete its reserves UN Secretary General Ant nio Guterres called the eradication of leaded petrol an international success story He also added Ending the use of leaded petrol will prevent more than one million premature deaths each year from heart disease strokes and cancer and it will protect children whose IQs are damaged by exposure to lead Greenpeace called the announcement the end of one toxic era However leaded gasoline continues to be used in aeronautic auto racing and off road applications The use of leaded additives is still permitted worldwide for the formulation of some grades of aviation gasoline such as LL because the required octane rating is difficult to reach without the use of leaded additives br Different additives have replaced lead compounds The most popular additives include aromatic hydrocarbons ethers MTBE and ETBE and alcohols most commonly ethanol br br br Lead Replacement Petrol br Lead replacement petrol LRP was developed for vehicles designed to run on leaded fuels and incompatible with unleaded fuels Rather than tetraethyllead it contains other metals such as potassium compounds or methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl MMT these are purported to buffer soft exhaust valves and seats so that they do not suffer recession due to the use of unleaded fuel br LRP was marketed during and after the phaseout of leaded motor fuels in the United Kingdom Australia South Africa and some other countries Consumer confusion led to a widespread mistaken preference for LRP rather than unleaded and LRP was phased out to years after the introduction of unleaded br Leaded gasoline was withdrawn from sale in Britain after December seven years after EEC regulations signaled the end of production for cars using leaded gasoline in member states At this stage a large percentage of cars from the s and early s which ran on leaded gasoline were still in use along with cars that could run on unleaded fuel However the declining number of such cars on British roads saw many gasoline stations withdrawing LRP from sale by br br br MMT br Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl MMT is used in Canada and the U S to boost octane rating Its use in the U S has been restricted by regulations although it is currently allowed Its use in the European Union is restricted by Article a of the Fuel Quality Directive following its testing under the Protocol for the evaluation of effects of metallic fuel additives on the emissions performance of vehicles br br br Fuel stabilizers antioxidants and metal deactivators br br Gummy sticky resin deposits result from oxidative degradation of gasoline during long term storage These harmful deposits arise from the oxidation of alkenes and other minor components in gasoline see drying oils Improvements in refinery techniques have generally reduced the susceptibility of gasolines to these problems Previously catalytically or thermally cracked gasolines were most susceptible to oxidation The formation of gums is accelerated by copper salts which can be neutralized by additives called metal deactivators br This degradation can be prevented through the addition of ppm of antioxidants such as phenylenediamines and other amines Hydrocarbons with a bromine number of or above can be protected with the combination of unhindered or partially hindered phenols and oil soluble strong amine bases such as hindered phenols Stale gasoline can be detected by a colorimetric enzymatic test for organic peroxides produced by oxidation of the gasoline br Gasolines are also treated with metal deactivators which are compounds that sequester deactivate metal salts that otherwise accelerate the formation of gummy residues The metal impurities might arise from the engine itself or as contaminants in the fuel br br br Detergents br Gasoline as delivered at the pump also contains additives to reduce internal engine carbon buildups improve combustion and allow easier starting in cold climates High levels of detergent can be found in Top Tier Detergent Gasolines The specification for Top Tier Detergent Gasolines was developed by four automakers GM Honda Toyota and BMW According to the bulletin the minimal U S EPA requirement is not sufficient to keep engines clean Typical detergents include alkylamines and alkyl phosphates at a level of ppm br br br Ethanol br br br European Union br In the EU percent ethanol can be added within the common gasoline spec EN Discussions are ongoing to allow percent blending of ethanol available in Finnish French and German gasoline stations In Finland most gasoline stations sell E which is percent ethanol and E which is percent ethanol Most gasoline sold in Sweden has percent ethanol added Three different ethanol blends are sold in the Netherlands E E and hE The last of these differs from standard ethanol gasoline blends in that it consists of percent hydrous ethanol i e the ethanol water azeotrope instead of the anhydrous ethanol traditionally used for blending with gasoline br br br Brazil br The Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum Natural Gas and Biofuels ANP requires gasoline for automobile use to have percent of ethanol added to its composition Pure hydrated ethanol is also available as a fuel br br br Australia br Legislation requires retailers to label fuels containing ethanol on the dispenser and limits ethanol use to percent of gasoline in Australia Such gasoline is commonly called E by major brands and it is cheaper than regular unleaded gasoline br br br U S br The federal Renewable Fuel Standard RFS effectively requires refiners and blenders to blend renewable biofuels mostly ethanol with gasoline sufficient to meet a growing annual target of total gallons blended Although the mandate does not require a specific percentage of ethanol annual increases in the target combined with declining gasoline consumption have caused the typical ethanol content in gasoline to approach percent Most fuel pumps display a sticker that states that the fuel may contain up to percent ethanol an intentional disparity that reflects the varying actual percentage Until late fuel retailers were only authorized to sell fuel containing up to percent ethanol E and most vehicle warranties except for flexible fuel vehicles authorize fuels that contain no more than percent ethanol In parts of the U S ethanol is sometimes added to gasoline without an indication that it is a component br br br India br In October the Government of India decided to make five percent ethanol blending with gasoline mandatory Currently percent ethanol blended product E is being sold in various parts of the country Ethanol has been found in at least one study to damage catalytic converters br br br Dyes br br Though gasoline is a naturally colorless liquid many gasolines are dyed in various colors to indicate their composition and acceptable uses In Australia the lowest grade of gasoline RON was dyed a light shade of red orange but is now the same color as the medium grade RON and high octane RON which are dyed yellow In the U S aviation gasoline avgas is dyed to identify its octane rating and to distinguish it from kerosene based jet fuel which is left colorless In Canada the gasoline for marine and farm use is dyed red and is not subject to fuel excise tax in most provinces br br br Oxygenate blending br Oxygenate blending adds oxygen bearing compounds such as MTBE ETBE TAME TAEE ethanol and biobutanol The presence of these oxygenates reduces the amount of carbon monoxide and unburned fuel in the exhaust In many areas throughout the U S oxygenate blending is mandated by EPA regulations to reduce smog and other airborne pollutants For example in Southern California fuel must contain two percent oxygen by weight resulting in a mixture of percent ethanol in gasoline The resulting fuel is often known as reformulated gasoline RFG or oxygenated gasoline or in the case of California California reformulated gasoline CARBOB The federal requirement that RFG contain oxygen was dropped on May because the industry had developed VOC controlled RFG that did not need additional oxygen br MTBE was phased out in the U S due to groundwater contamination and the resulting regulations and lawsuits Ethanol and to a lesser extent ethanol derived ETBE are common substitutes A common ethanol gasoline mix of percent ethanol mixed with gasoline is called gasohol or E and an ethanol gasoline mix of percent ethanol mixed with gasoline is called E The most extensive use of ethanol takes place in Brazil where the ethanol is derived from sugarcane In over billion liters U S gal of ethanol was produced in the U S for fuel use mostly from corn and sold as E E is slowly becoming available in much of the U S though many of the relatively few stations vending E are not open to the general public br The use of bioethanol and bio methanol either directly or indirectly by conversion of ethanol to bio ETBE or methanol to bio MTBE is encouraged by the European Union Directive on the Promotion of the use of biofuels and other renewable fuels for transport Since producing bioethanol from fermented sugars and starches involves distillation though ordinary people in much of Europe cannot legally ferment and distill their own bioethanol at present unlike in the U S where getting a BATF distillation permit has been easy since the oil crisis br br br Safety br br br Toxicity br The safety data sheet for a Texan unleaded gasoline shows at least hazardous chemicals occurring in various amounts including benzene up to five percent by volume toluene up to percent by volume naphthalene up to one percent by volume trimethylbenzene up to seven percent by volume methyl tert butyl ether MTBE up to percent by volume in some states and about others Hydrocarbons in gasoline generally exhibit low acute toxicities with LD of mg kg for simple aromatic compounds Benzene and many antiknocking additives are carcinogenic br People can be exposed to gasoline in the workplace by swallowing it breathing in vapors skin contact and eye contact Gasoline is toxic The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has also designated gasoline as a carcinogen Physical contact ingestion or inhalation can cause health problems Since ingesting large amounts of gasoline can cause permanent damage to major organs a call to a local poison control center or emergency room visit is indicated br Contrary to common misconception swallowing gasoline does not generally require special emergency treatment and inducing vomiting does not help and can make it worse According to poison specialist Brad Dahl even two mouthfuls wouldn t be that dangerous as long as it goes down to your stomach and stays there or keeps going The U S CDC s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry says not to induce vomiting lavage or administer activated charcoal br br br Inhalation for intoxication br Inhaled huffed gasoline vapor is a common intoxicant Users concentrate and inhale gasoline vapor in a manner not intended by the manufacturer to produce euphoria and intoxication Gasoline inhalation has become epidemic in some poorer communities and indigenous groups in Australia Canada New Zealand and some Pacific Islands The practice is thought to cause severe organ damage along with other effects such as intellectual disability and various cancers br In Canada Native children in the isolated Northern Labrador community of Davis Inlet were the focus of national concern in when many were found to be sniffing gasoline The Canadian and provincial Newfoundland and Labrador governments intervened on several occasions sending many children away for treatment Despite being moved to the new community of Natuashish in serious inhalant abuse problems have continued Similar problems were reported in Sheshatshiu in and also in Pikangikum First Nation In the issue once again made the news media in Canada br br Australia has long faced a petrol gasoline sniffing problem in isolated and impoverished aboriginal communities Although some sources argue that sniffing was introduced by U S servicemen stationed in the nation s Top End during World War II or through experimentation by s era Cobourg Peninsula sawmill workers other sources claim that inhalant abuse such as glue inhalation emerged in Australia in the late s Chronic heavy petrol sniffing appears to occur among remote impoverished indigenous communities where the ready accessibility of petrol has helped to make it a common substance for abuse br In Australia petrol sniffing now occurs widely throughout remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory Western Australia northern parts of South Australia and Queensland The number of people sniffing petrol goes up and down over time as young people experiment or sniff occasionally Boss or chronic sniffers may move in and out of communities they are often responsible for encouraging young people to take it up In the Government of Australia and BP Australia began the usage of Opal fuel in remote areas prone to petrol sniffing Opal is a non sniffable fuel which is much less likely to cause a high and has made a difference in some indigenous communities br br br Flammability br br Gasoline is extremely flammable due to its low flash point of C F Like other hydrocarbons gasoline burns in a limited range of its vapor phase and coupled with its volatility this makes leaks highly dangerous when sources of ignition are present Gasoline has a lower explosive limit of percent by volume and an upper explosive limit of percent If the concentration is below percent the air gasoline mixture is too lean and does not ignite If the concentration is above percent the mixture is too rich and also does not ignite However gasoline vapor rapidly mixes and spreads with air making unconstrained gasoline quickly flammable br br br Gasoline exhaust br The exhaust gas generated by burning gasoline is harmful to both the environment and to human health After CO is inhaled into the human body it readily combines with hemoglobin in the blood and its affinity is times that of oxygen Therefore the hemoglobin in the lungs combines with CO instead of oxygen causing the human body to be hypoxic causing headaches dizziness vomiting and other poisoning symptoms In severe cases it may lead to death Hydrocarbons only affect the human body when their concentration is quite high and their toxicity level depends on the chemical composition The hydrocarbons produced by incomplete combustion include alkanes aromatics and aldehydes Among them a concentration of methane and ethane over g m oz cu ft will cause loss of consciousness or suffocation a concentration of pentane and hexane over g m oz cu ft will have an anesthetic effect and aromatic hydrocarbons will have more serious effects on health blood toxicity neurotoxicity and cancer If the concentration of benzene exceeds ppm it can cause leukemia and xylene can cause headache dizziness nausea and vomiting Human exposure to large amounts of aldehydes can cause eye irritation nausea and dizziness In addition to carcinogenic effects long term exposure can cause damage to the skin liver kidneys and cataracts After NOx enters the alveoli it has a severe stimulating effect on the lung tissue It can irritate the conjunctiva of the eyes cause tearing and cause pink eyes It also has a stimulating effect on the nose pharynx throat and other organs It can cause acute wheezing breathing difficulties red eyes sore throat and dizziness causing poisoning br br br Environmental impact br In recent years with the rapid development of the motor vehicle economy the production and use of motor vehicles have increased dramatically and the pollution by motor vehicle exhaust to the environment has become more and more serious The air pollution in many large cities has changed from coal burning pollution to motor vehicle pollution In the U S transportation is the largest source of carbon emissions accounting for percent of the total carbon footprint of the U S Combustion of gasoline produces kilograms per liter lb U S gal of carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas br Unburnt gasoline and evaporation from the tank when in the atmosphere react in sunlight to produce photochemical smog Vapor pressure initially rises with some addition of ethanol to gasoline but the increase is greatest at percent by volume At higher concentrations of ethanol above percent the vapor pressure of the blend starts to decrease At a percent ethanol by volume the rise in vapor pressure may potentially increase the problem of photochemical smog This rise in vapor pressure could be mitigated by increasing or decreasing the percentage of ethanol in the gasoline mixture The chief risks of such leaks come not from vehicles but gasoline delivery truck accidents and leaks from storage tanks Because of this risk most underground storage tanks now have extensive measures in place to detect and prevent any such leaks such as monitoring systems Veeder Root Franklin Fueling br Production of gasoline consumes liters per kilometer U S gal mi of water by driven distance br Gasoline use causes a variety of deleterious effects to the human population and to the climate generally The harms imposed include a higher rate of premature death and ailments such as asthma caused by air pollution higher healthcare costs for the public generally decreased crop yields missed work and school days due to illness increased flooding and other extreme weather events linked to global climate change and other social costs The costs imposed on society and the planet are estimated to be per gallon of gasoline in addition to the price paid at the pump by the user The damage to the health and climate caused by a gasoline powered vehicle greatly exceeds that caused by electric vehicles br br br Carbon dioxide br About kilograms per liter lb U S gal of carbon dioxide CO are produced from burning gasoline that does not contain ethanol Most of the retail gasoline now sold in the U S contains about percent fuel ethanol or E by volume Burning E produces about kilograms per liter lb U S gal of CO that is emitted from the fossil fuel content If the CO emissions from ethanol combustion are considered then about kilograms per liter lb U S gal of CO are produced when E is combusted br Worldwide liters of gasoline are burnt for every km driven by cars and vans br Also the International Energy Agency said in that To ensure fuel economy and CO emissions standards are effective governments must continue regulatory efforts to monitor and reduce the gap between real world fuel economy and rated performance br br br Contamination of soil and water br Gasoline enters the environment through the soil groundwater surface water and air Therefore humans may be exposed to gasoline through methods such as breathing eating and skin contact For example using gasoline filled equipment such as lawnmowers drinking gasoline contaminated water close to gasoline spills or leaks to the soil working at a gasoline station inhaling gasoline volatile gas when refueling at a gasoline station is the easiest way to be exposed to gasoline br br br Use and pricing br The International Energy Agency said in that road fuels should be taxed at a rate that reflects their impact on people s health and the climate br br br Europe br Countries in Europe impose substantially higher taxes on fuels such as gasoline when compared to the U S The price of gasoline in Europe is typically higher than that in the U S due to this difference br br br U S br br From to the price of gasoline fluctuated between and per liter and U S gal After the price increased until the average gasoline price reached a high of per liter U S gal in mid but receded to approximately per liter U S gal by September The U S experienced an upswing in gasoline prices through and by March the national average was per liter U S gal California prices are higher because the California government mandates unique California gasoline formulas and taxes br In the U S most consumer goods bear pre tax prices but gasoline prices are posted with taxes included Taxes are added by federal state and local governments As of the federal tax was per liter U S gal for gasoline and per liter U S gal for diesel excluding red diesel br About nine percent of all gasoline sold in the U S in May was premium grade according to the Energy Information Administration Consumer Reports magazine says If your owner s manual says to use regular fuel do so there s no advantage to a higher grade The Associated Press said premium gas which has a higher octane rating and costs more per gallon than regular unleaded should be used only if the manufacturer says it is required Cars with turbocharged engines and high compression ratios often specify premium gasoline because higher octane fuels reduce the incidence of knock or fuel pre detonation The price of gasoline varies considerably between the summer and winter months br There is a considerable difference between summer oil and winter oil in gasoline vapor pressure Reid Vapor Pressure RVP which is a measure of how easily the fuel evaporates at a given temperature The higher the gasoline volatility the higher the RVP the easier it is to evaporate The conversion between the two fuels occurs twice a year once in autumn winter mix and the other in spring summer mix The winter blended fuel has a higher RVP because the fuel must be able to evaporate at a low temperature for the engine to run normally If the RVP is too low on a cold day the vehicle will be difficult to start however the summer blended gasoline has a lower RVP It prevents excessive evaporation when the outdoor temperature rises reduces ozone emissions and reduces smog levels At the same time vapor lock is less likely to occur in hot weather br br br Gasoline
