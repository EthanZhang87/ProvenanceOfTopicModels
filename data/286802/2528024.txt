An engine control unit ECU also called an engine control module ECM is a device which controls multiple systems of an internal combustion engine in a single unit Systems commonly controlled by an ECU include the fuel injection and ignition systems br The earliest ECUs used by aircraft engines in the late s were mechanical hydraulic units however most st century ECUs function by digital electronics br br br Functions br The main functions of the ECU are typically br br Fuel injection system br Ignition system br Idle speed control typically either via an idle air control valve or the electronic throttle system br Variable valve timing and or variable valve lift systems br The sensors used by the ECU include br br br Secondary br Other functions include br br Launch control br Fuel pressure regulator br Rev limiter br Wastegate control and anti lag br Theft prevention by blocking ignition in response to input from an immobiliser br In a camless piston engine an experimental design not currently used in any production vehicles the ECU has continuous control of when each of the intake and exhaust valves are opened and by how much br br br Early systems br One of the earliest attempts to use such a unitized and automated device to manage multiple engine control functions simultaneously was the created by BMW in Kommandoger t system used by the BMW cylinder radial engine which powered the Focke Wulf Fw V fighter aircraft This device replaced the controls used to initiate hard acceleration with one control however the system could cause surging and stalling problems br br br Usage in motor vehicles br In the early s the Japanese electronics industry began producing integrated circuits and microcontrollers used for controlling engines The Ford EEC Electronic Engine Control system which utilized the Toshiba TLCS microprocessor went into mass production in br The first Bosch engine management system was the Motronic which was introduced in the BMW Series E This system was based on the existing Bosch Jetronic fuel injection system to which control of the ignition system was added br In a Delco Electronics ECU was used by several Chevrolet and Buick engines to control their fuel system a closed loop carburetor and ignition system By Delco Electronics was the leading producer of engine management systems producing over ECUs per day br br br Usage in aircraft engines br Such systems are used for many internal combustion engines in other applications In aeronautical applications the systems are known as FADECs Full Authority Digital Engine Controls This kind of electronic control is less common in piston engined light fixed wing aircraft and helicopters than in automobiles This is due to the common configuration of a carbureted engine with a magneto ignition system that does not require electrical power generated by an alternator to run which is considered a safety advantage br br br See also br Air fuel ratio meter br Check engine light br List of auto parts br On board diagnostics OBD br Powertrain control module PCM br br br
