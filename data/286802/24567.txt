A pollutant or novel entity is a substance or energy introduced into the environment that has undesired effects or adversely affects the usefulness of a resource These can be both naturally forming i e minerals or extracted compounds like oil or anthropogenic in origin i e manufactured materials or byproducts Pollutants result in environmental pollution or become public health concerns when they reach a concentration high enough to have significant negative impacts br A pollutant may cause long or short term damage by changing the growth rate of plant or animal species or by interfering with resources used by humans human health or wellbeing or property values Some pollutants are biodegradable and therefore will not persist in the environment in the long term However the degradation products of some pollutants are themselves polluting such as the products DDE and DDD produced from the degradation of DDT br Pollution has widespread negative impacts on the environment When analyzed from a planetary boundaries perspective human society has released novel entities that well exceed safe levels br br br Different types of pollutants in the environment br Pollutants can be categorized in a variety of different ways For example it is sometimes useful to distinguish between stock pollutants and fund pollutants Another way is to group them together according to more specific properties such as organic particulate pharmaceutical et cetera The environment has some capacity to absorb many discharges without measurable harm and this is called assimilative capacity or absorptive capacity a pollutant actually causes pollution when the assimilative capacity is exceeded br br br Stock pollutants br Pollutants towards which the environment has low absorptive capacity are called stock pollutants Examples include persistent organic pollutants like PCBs non biodegradable plastics and heavy metals Stock pollutants accumulate in the environment over time The damage they cause increases as more pollutant is emitted and persists as the pollutant accumulates Stock pollutants can create a burden for the future generations bypassing on the damage that persists well after the benefits received from incurring that damage have been forgotten Scientists have officially deemed that the planetary boundaries safe chemical pollutant levels novel entities have been surpassed br br br Fund pollutants br In contrast to stock pollutants for which the environment has low absorptive capacity fund pollutants are those for which the environment has a moderate absorptive capacity Fund pollutants do not cause damage to the environment unless the emission rate exceeds the receiving environment s absorptive capacity e g carbon dioxide which is absorbed by plants and oceans Fund pollutants are not destroyed but rather converted into less harmful substances or diluted dispersed to non harmful concentrations br br br Specific groups of pollutants br Many pollutants are within the following notable groups br br Environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants EPPP br Greenhouse gases GHGs br Particulate matter PM br Persistent organic pollutants POPs br Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs br Volatile organic compounds VOCs br br br Light pollutant br Light pollution is the impact that anthropogenic light has on the visibility of the night sky It also encompasses ecological light pollution which describes the effect of artificial light on individual organisms and on the structure of ecosystems as a whole br br br Zones of influence br Pollutants can also be defined by their zones of influence both horizontally and vertically br br br Horizontal zone br The horizontal zone refers to the area that is damaged by a pollutant Local pollutants cause damage near the emission source Regional pollutants cause damage further from the emission source br br br Vertical zone br The vertical zone refers to whether the damage is ground level or atmospheric Surface pollutants cause damage by accumulating near the Earth s surface Global pollutants cause damage by concentrating on the atmosphere br br br Measuring concentration br br br Regulation br br br International br Pollutants can cross international borders and therefore international regulations are needed for their control The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants which entered into force in is an international legally binding agreement for the control of persistent organic pollutants Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers PRTR are systems to collect and disseminate information on environmental releases and transfers of toxic chemicals from industrial and other facilities br br br European Union br The European Pollutant Emission Register is a type of PRTR providing access to information on the annual emissions of industrial facilities in the Member States of the European Union as well as Norway br br br United States br Clean Air Act standards Under the Clean Air Act the National Ambient Air Quality Standards NAAQS are developed by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA for six common air pollutants also called criteria pollutants particulates smog and ground level ozone carbon monoxide sulfur oxides nitrogen oxides and lead The National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants are additional emission standards that are set by EPA for toxic air pollutants br Clean Water Act standards Under the Clean Water Act EPA promulgated national standards for municipal sewage treatment plants also called publicly owned treatment works in the Secondary Treatment Regulation National standards for industrial dischargers are called Effluent guidelines for existing sources and New Source Performance Standards and currently cover over industrial categories In addition the Act requires states to publish water quality standards for individual water bodies to provide additional protection where the national standards are insufficient br RCRA standards The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA regulates the management transport and disposal of municipal solid waste hazardous waste and underground storage tanks br br br See also br br Conventional pollutant U S Clean Water Act br List of environmental issues br Pollutant Standards Index br Pollution br br br
