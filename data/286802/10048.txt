Ethanol also called ethyl alcohol grain alcohol drinking alcohol or simply alcohol is an organic compound with the chemical formula CH CH OH It is an alcohol with its formula also written as C H OH C H O or EtOH where Et stands for ethyl Ethanol is a volatile flammable colorless liquid with a characteristic wine like odor and pungent taste As a psychoactive depressant it is the active ingredient in alcoholic drinks and the second most consumed drug globally behind caffeine br Ethanol is naturally produced by the fermentation process of sugars by yeasts or via petrochemical processes such as ethylene hydration Historically it was used as a general anesthetic and has modern medical applications as an antiseptic disinfectant solvent for some medications and antidote for methanol poisoning and ethylene glycol poisoning It is used as a chemical solvent and in the synthesis of organic compounds and as a fuel source Ethanol also can be dehydrated to make ethylene an important chemical feedstock As of world production of ethanol was US gallons gigalitres coming mostly from the U S and Brazil br br br Etymology br Ethanol is the systematic name defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry for a compound consisting of an alkyl group with two carbon atoms prefix eth having a single bond between them infix an and an attached OH functional group suffix ol br The eth prefix and the qualifier ethyl in ethyl alcohol originally came from the name ethyl assigned in to the group C H by Justus Liebig He coined the word from the German name Aether of the compound C H O C H commonly called ether in English more specifically called diethyl ether According to the Oxford English Dictionary Ethyl is a contraction of the Ancient Greek aith r upper air and the Greek word h l wood raw material hence matter substance br The name ethanol was coined as a result of a resolution on naming alcohols and phenols that was adopted at the International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature that was held in April in Geneva Switzerland br The term alcohol now refers to a wider class of substances in chemistry nomenclature but in common parlance it remains the name of ethanol It is a medieval loan from Arabic al ku l a powdered ore of antimony used since antiquity as a cosmetic and retained that meaning in Middle Latin The use of alcohol for ethanol in full alcohol of wine is modern and was first recorded in Before the late th century the term alcohol generally referred to any sublimated substance br br br Uses br br br Medical br br br Anesthetic br Ethanol is the oldest known sedative used as an oral general anesthetic during surgery in ancient Mesopotamia and in medieval times Mild intoxication starts at a blood alcohol concentration of and induces anesthetic coma at However this use carried the high risk of deadly alcohol intoxication and pulmonary aspiration on vomit which led to use of alternatives in antiquity such as opium and cannabis and later diethyl ether starting in the s br br br Antiseptic br Ethanol is used in medical wipes and most commonly in antibacterial hand sanitizer gels as an antiseptic for its bactericidal and anti fungal effects Ethanol kills microorganisms by dissolving their membrane lipid bilayer and denaturing their proteins and is effective against most bacteria fungi and viruses However it is ineffective against bacterial spores but that can be alleviated by using hydrogen peroxide br A solution of ethanol is more effective than pure ethanol because ethanol relies on water molecules for optimal antimicrobial activity Absolute ethanol may inactivate microbes without destroying them because the alcohol is unable to fully permeate the microbe s membrane Ethanol can also be used as a disinfectant and antiseptic because it causes cell dehydration by disrupting the osmotic balance across the cell membrane so water leaves the cell leading to cell death br br br Antidote br Ethanol may be administered as an antidote to ethylene glycol poisoning and methanol poisoning Ethanol serves this process by acting as a competitive inhibitor against methanol and ethylene glycol for alcohol dehydrogenase Though it has more side effects ethanol is less expensive and more readily available than fomepizole which is also used as an antidote for methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning br br br Medicinal solvent br Ethanol often in high concentrations is used to dissolve many water insoluble medications and related compounds Liquid preparations of pain medications cough and cold medicines and mouth washes for example may contain up to ethanol and may need to be avoided in individuals with adverse reactions to ethanol such as alcohol induced respiratory reactions Ethanol is present mainly as an antimicrobial preservative in over liquid preparations of medicine including acetaminophen iron supplements ranitidine furosemide mannitol phenobarbital trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole and over the counter cough medicine br Some medicinal solutions of ethanol are also known as tinctures br br br Pharmacology br In mammals ethanol is primarily metabolized in the liver and stomach by alcohol dehydrogenase ADH enzymes These enzymes catalyze the oxidation of ethanol into acetaldehyde ethanal br br CH CH OH NAD CH CHO NADH H br When present in significant concentrations this metabolism of ethanol is additionally aided by the cytochrome P enzyme CYP E in humans while trace amounts are also metabolized by catalase br The resulting intermediate acetaldehyde is a known carcinogen and poses significantly greater toxicity in humans than ethanol itself Many of the symptoms typically associated with alcohol intoxication as well as many of the health hazards typically associated with the long term consumption of ethanol can be attributed to acetaldehyde toxicity in humans br The subsequent oxidation of acetaldehyde into acetate is performed by aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH enzymes A mutation in the ALDH gene that encodes for an inactive or dysfunctional form of this enzyme affects roughly of east Asian populations contributing to the characteristic alcohol flush reaction that can cause temporary reddening of the skin as well as a number of related and often unpleasant symptoms of acetaldehyde toxicity This mutation is typically accompanied by another mutation in the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme ADH B in roughly of east Asians which improves the catalytic efficiency of converting ethanol into acetaldehyde br br br Recreational br br As a central nervous system depressant ethanol is one of the most commonly consumed psychoactive drugs br Despite alcohol s psychoactive addictive and carcinogenic properties it is readily available and legal for sale in most countries There are laws regulating the sale exportation importation taxation manufacturing consumption and possession of alcoholic beverages The most common regulation is prohibition for minors br br br Fuel br br br Engine fuel br br The largest single use of ethanol is as an engine fuel and fuel additive Brazil in particular relies heavily upon the use of ethanol as an engine fuel due in part to its role as one of the world s leading producers of ethanol Gasoline sold in Brazil contains at least anhydrous ethanol Hydrous ethanol about ethanol and water can be used as fuel in more than of new gasoline fueled cars sold in the country br The US and many other countries primarily use E ethanol sometimes known as gasohol and E ethanol ethanol gasoline mixtures Over time it is believed that a material portion of the billion US gallon m per year market for gasoline will begin to be replaced with fuel ethanol br br Australian law limits the use of pure ethanol from sugarcane waste to in automobiles Older cars and vintage cars designed to use a slower burning fuel should have the engine valves upgraded or replaced br According to an industry advocacy group ethanol as a fuel reduces harmful tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide particulate matter oxides of nitrogen and other ozone forming pollutants Argonne National Laboratory analyzed greenhouse gas emissions of many different engine and fuel combinations and found that biodiesel petrodiesel blend B showed a reduction of conventional E ethanol blend a reduction of and cellulosic ethanol compared with pure gasoline Ethanol has a much greater research octane number RON than gasoline meaning it is less prone to pre ignition allowing for better ignition advance which means more torque and efficiency in addition to the lower carbon emissions br Ethanol combustion in an internal combustion engine yields many of the products of incomplete combustion produced by gasoline and significantly larger amounts of formaldehyde and related species such as acetaldehyde This leads to a significantly larger photochemical reactivity and more ground level ozone This data has been assembled into The Clean Fuels Report comparison of fuel emissions and show that ethanol exhaust generates times as much ozone as gasoline exhaust When this is added into the custom Localized Pollution Index of The Clean Fuels Report the local pollution of ethanol pollution that contributes to smog is rated where gasoline is and higher numbers signify greater pollution The California Air Resources Board formalized this issue in by recognizing control standards for formaldehydes as an emissions control group much like the conventional NOx and reactive organic gases ROGs br More than of Brazilian cars are able to use ethanol as fuel which includes ethanol only engines and flex fuel engines Flex fuel engines in Brazil are able to work with all ethanol all gasoline or any mixture of both In the United States flex fuel vehicles can run on to ethanol gasoline since higher ethanol blends are not yet allowed or efficient Brazil supports this fleet of ethanol burning automobiles with large national infrastructure that produces ethanol from domestically grown sugarcane br Ethanol s high miscibility with water makes it unsuitable for shipping through modern pipelines like liquid hydrocarbons Mechanics have seen increased cases of damage to small engines in particular the carburetor and attribute the damage to the increased water retention by ethanol in fuel br br br Rocket fuel br Ethanol was commonly used as fuel in early bipropellant rocket liquid propelled vehicles in conjunction with an oxidizer such as liquid oxygen The German A ballistic rocket of World War II better known by its propaganda name V which is credited as having begun the space age used ethanol as the main constituent of B Stoff Under such nomenclature the ethanol was mixed with water to reduce the combustion chamber temperature The V s design team helped develop U S rockets following World War II including the ethanol fueled Redstone rocket which launched the first U S satellite Alcohols fell into general disuse as more energy dense rocket fuels were developed although ethanol is currently used in lightweight rocket powered racing aircraft br br br Fuel cells br Commercial fuel cells operate on reformed natural gas hydrogen or methanol Ethanol is an attractive alternative due to its wide availability low cost high purity and low toxicity There is a wide range of fuel cell concepts that have entered trials including direct ethanol fuel cells auto thermal reforming systems and thermally integrated systems The majority of work is being conducted at a research level although there are a number of organizations at the beginning of the commercialization of ethanol fuel cells br br br Household heating and cooking br Ethanol fireplaces can be used for home heating or for decoration Ethanol can also be used as stove fuel for cooking br br br Feedstock br br Ethanol is an important industrial ingredient It has widespread use as a precursor for other organic compounds such as ethyl halides ethyl esters diethyl ether acetic acid and ethyl amines br br br Solvent br Ethanol is considered a universal solvent as its molecular structure allows for the dissolving of both polar hydrophilic and nonpolar hydrophobic compounds As ethanol also has a low boiling point it is easy to remove from a solution that has been used to dissolve other compounds making it a popular extracting agent for botanical oils Cannabis oil extraction methods often use ethanol as an extraction solvent and also as a post processing solvent to remove oils waxes and chlorophyll from solution in a process known as winterization br Ethanol is found in paints tinctures markers and personal care products such as mouthwashes perfumes and deodorants Polysaccharides precipitate from aqueous solution in the presence of alcohol and ethanol precipitation is used for this reason in the purification of DNA and RNA br br br Low temperature liquid br Because of its low freezing point of C F and low toxicity ethanol is sometimes used in laboratories with dry ice or other coolants as a cooling bath to keep vessels at temperatures below the freezing point of water For the same reason it is also used as the active fluid in alcohol thermometers br br br Chemistry br br br Chemical formula br Ethanol is a carbon alcohol Its molecular formula is CH CH OH The structure of the molecule of ethanol is CH CH OH an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl group which indicates that the carbon of a methyl group CH is attached to the carbon of a methylene group CH which is attached to the oxygen of a hydroxyl group OH It is a constitutional isomer of dimethyl ether Ethanol is sometimes abbreviated as EtOH using the common organic chemistry notation of representing the ethyl group C H with Et br br br Physical properties br br Ethanol is a volatile colorless liquid that has a slight odor It burns with a smokeless blue flame that is not always visible in normal light The physical properties of ethanol stem primarily from the presence of its hydroxyl group and the shortness of its carbon chain Ethanol s hydroxyl group is able to participate in hydrogen bonding rendering it more viscous and less volatile than less polar organic compounds of similar molecular weight such as propane br Ethanol s adiabatic flame temperature for combustion in air is C or F br Ethanol is slightly more refractive than water having a refractive index of at nm and C or F The triple point for ethanol is K br br br Solvent properties br Ethanol is a versatile solvent miscible with water and with many organic solvents including acetic acid acetone benzene carbon tetrachloride chloroform diethyl ether ethylene glycol glycerol nitromethane pyridine and toluene Its main use as a solvent is in making tincture of iodine cough syrups etc It is also miscible with light aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane and hexane and with aliphatic chlorides such as trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene br Ethanol s miscibility with water contrasts with the immiscibility of longer chain alcohols five or more carbon atoms whose water miscibility decreases sharply as the number of carbons increases The miscibility of ethanol with alkanes is limited to alkanes up to undecane mixtures with dodecane and higher alkanes show a miscibility gap below a certain temperature about C for dodecane The miscibility gap tends to get wider with higher alkanes and the temperature for complete miscibility increases br Ethanol water mixtures have less volume than the sum of their individual components at the given fractions Mixing equal volumes of ethanol and water results in only volumes of mixture Mixing ethanol and water is exothermic with up to J mol being released at K br Mixtures of ethanol and water form an azeotrope at about mole ethanol and mole water or a mixture of ethanol by mass or about alcohol by volume at normal pressure which boils at K C This azeotropic composition is strongly temperature and pressure dependent and vanishes at temperatures below K br br Hydrogen bonding causes pure ethanol to be hygroscopic to the extent that it readily absorbs water from the air The polar nature of the hydroxyl group causes ethanol to dissolve many ionic compounds notably sodium and potassium hydroxides magnesium chloride calcium chloride ammonium chloride ammonium bromide and sodium bromide Sodium and potassium chlorides are slightly soluble in ethanol Because the ethanol molecule also has a nonpolar end it will also dissolve nonpolar substances including most essential oils and numerous flavoring coloring and medicinal agents br The addition of even a few percent of ethanol to water sharply reduces the surface tension of water This property partially explains the tears of wine phenomenon When wine is swirled in a glass ethanol evaporates quickly from the thin film of wine on the wall of the glass As the wine s ethanol content decreases its surface tension increases and the thin film beads up and runs down the glass in channels rather than as a smooth sheet br br br Flammability br An ethanol water solution will catch fire if heated above a temperature called its flash point and an ignition source is then applied to it For alcohol by mass about by volume this will occur at about C F The flash point of pure ethanol is C F but may be influenced very slightly by atmospheric composition such as pressure and humidity Ethanol mixtures can ignite below average room temperature Ethanol is considered a flammable liquid Class Hazardous Material in concentrations above by mass by volume proof br br Dishes using burning alcohol for culinary effects are called flamb br br br Natural occurrence br Ethanol is a byproduct of the metabolic process of yeast As such ethanol will be present in any yeast habitat Ethanol can commonly be found in overripe fruit Ethanol produced by symbiotic yeast can be found in bertam palm blossoms Although some animal species such as the pentailed treeshrew exhibit ethanol seeking behaviors most show no interest or avoidance of food sources containing ethanol Ethanol is also produced during the germination of many plants as a result of natural anaerobiosis br Ethanol has been detected in outer space forming an icy coating around dust grains in interstellar clouds br Minute quantity amounts average ppb of endogenous ethanol and acetaldehyde were found in the exhaled breath of healthy volunteers Auto brewery syndrome also known as gut fermentation syndrome is a rare medical condition in which intoxicating quantities of ethanol are produced through endogenous fermentation within the digestive system br br br Production br br Ethanol is produced both as a petrochemical through the hydration of ethylene and via biological processes by fermenting sugars with yeast Which process is more economical depends on prevailing prices of petroleum and grain feed stocks br br br Sources br World production of ethanol in was gigalitres US gal with of the world supply coming from Brazil and the U S Brazilian ethanol is produced from sugarcane which has relatively high yields more fuel than the fossil fuels used to produce it compared to some other energy crops Sugarcane not only has a greater concentration of sucrose than corn by about but is also much easier to extract The bagasse generated by the process is not discarded but burned by power plants to produce electricity Bagasse burning accounts for around of the electricity produced in Brazil br In the s most industrial ethanol in the U S was made as a petrochemical but in the s the U S introduced subsidies for corn based ethanol According to the Renewable Fuels Association as of October grain ethanol bio refineries in the U S have the capacity to produce US gal m of ethanol per year An additional construction projects underway in the U S can add billion US gallons m of new capacity in the next months br In India ethanol is made from sugarcane Sweet sorghum is another potential source of ethanol and is suitable for growing in dryland conditions The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi Arid Tropics is investigating the possibility of growing sorghum as a source of fuel food and animal feed in arid parts of Asia and Africa Sweet sorghum has one third the water requirement of sugarcane over the same time period It also requires about less water than corn The world s first sweet sorghum ethanol distillery began commercial production in in Andhra Pradesh India br br br Hydration br Ethanol can be produced from petrochemical feed stocks primarily by the acid catalyzed hydration of ethylene It is often referred to as synthetic ethanol br br C H H O C H OH br The catalyst is most commonly phosphoric acid adsorbed onto a porous support such as silica gel or diatomaceous earth This catalyst was first used for large scale ethanol production by the Shell Oil Company in The reaction is carried out in the presence of high pressure steam at C F where a ethylene to steam ratio is maintained This process was used on an industrial scale by Union Carbide Corporation and others It is no longer practiced in the US as fermentation ethanol produced from corn is more economical br In an older process first practiced on the industrial scale in by Union Carbide but now almost entirely obsolete ethylene was hydrated indirectly by reacting it with concentrated sulfuric acid to produce ethyl sulfate which was hydrolyzed to yield ethanol and regenerate the sulfuric acid br br C H H SO C H HSO br C H HSO H O H SO C H OH br br br From carbon dioxide br Ethanol has been produced in the laboratory by converting carbon dioxide via biological and electrochemical reactions br br br Fermentation br br Ethanol in alcoholic beverages and fuel is produced by fermentation Certain species of yeast e g Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolize sugar namely polysaccharides producing ethanol and carbon dioxide The chemical equations below summarize the conversion br br Fermentation is the process of culturing yeast under favorable thermal conditions to produce alcohol This process is carried out at around C F Toxicity of ethanol to yeast limits the ethanol concentration obtainable by brewing higher concentrations therefore are obtained by fortification or distillation The most ethanol tolerant yeast strains can survive up to approximately ethanol by volume br To produce ethanol from starchy materials such as cereals the starch must first be converted into sugars In brewing beer this has traditionally been accomplished by allowing the grain to germinate or malt which produces the enzyme amylase When the malted grain is mashed the amylase converts the remaining starches into sugars br br br Cellulose br br Sugars for ethanol fermentation can be obtained from cellulose Deployment of this technology could turn a number of cellulose containing agricultural by products such as corncobs straw and sawdust into renewable energy resources Other agricultural residues such as sugarcane bagasse and energy crops such as switchgrass may also be fermentable sugar sources br br br Testing br br Breweries and biofuel plants employ two methods for measuring ethanol concentration Infrared ethanol sensors measure the vibrational frequency of dissolved ethanol using the C H band at cm This method uses a relatively inexpensive solid state sensor that compares the C H band with a reference band to calculate the ethanol content The calculation makes use of the Beer Lambert law Alternatively by measuring the density of the starting material and the density of the product using a hydrometer the change in specific gravity during fermentation indicates the alcohol content This inexpensive and indirect method has a long history in the beer brewing industry br br br Purification br br br Distillation br Ethylene hydration or brewing produces an ethanol water mixture For most industrial and fuel uses the ethanol must be purified Fractional distillation at atmospheric pressure can concentrate ethanol to by weight mole This mixture is an azeotrope with a boiling point of C F and cannot be further purified by distillation Addition of an entraining agent such as benzene cyclohexane or heptane allows a new ternary azeotrope comprising the ethanol water and the entraining agent to be formed This lower boiling ternary azeotrope is removed preferentially leading to water free ethanol br br br Molecular sieves and desiccants br Apart from distillation ethanol may be dried by addition of a desiccant such as molecular sieves cellulose or cornmeal The desiccants can be dried and reused Molecular sieves can be used to selectively absorb the water from the ethanol solution Molecular sieves of pore size ngstrom a type of zeolite effectively sequester water molecules while excluding ethanol molecules Heating the wet sieves drives out the water allowing regeneration of their desiccant capability br br br Membranes and reverse osmosis br Membranes can also be used to separate ethanol and water Membrane based separations are not subject to the limitations of the water ethanol azeotrope because the separations are not based on vapor liquid equilibria Membranes are often used in the so called hybrid membrane distillation process This process uses a pre concentration distillation column as the first separating step The further separation is then accomplished with a membrane operated either in vapor permeation or pervaporation mode Vapor permeation uses a vapor membrane feed and pervaporation uses a liquid membrane feed br br br Other techniques br A variety of other techniques have been discussed including the following br br Salting using potassium carbonate to exploit its insolubility will cause a phase separation with ethanol and water This offers a very small potassium carbonate impurity to the alcohol that can be removed by distillation This method is very useful in purification of ethanol by distillation as ethanol forms an azeotrope with water br Direct electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to ethanol under ambient conditions using copper nanoparticles on a carbon nanospike film as the catalyst br Extraction of ethanol from grain mash by supercritical carbon dioxide br Pervaporation br Fractional freezing is also used to concentrate fermented alcoholic solutions such as traditionally made Applejack beverage br Pressure swing adsorption br br br Grades of ethanol br br br Denatured alcohol br br Pure ethanol and alcoholic beverages are heavily taxed as psychoactive drugs but ethanol has many uses that do not involve its consumption To relieve the tax burden on these uses most jurisdictions waive the tax when an agent has been added to the ethanol to render it unfit to drink These include bittering agents such as denatonium benzoate and toxins such as methanol naphtha and pyridine Products of this kind are called denatured alcohol br br br Absolute alcohol br Absolute or anhydrous alcohol refers to ethanol with a low water content There are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from to a few parts per million ppm If azeotropic distillation is used to remove water it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent e g benzene Absolute alcohol is not intended for human consumption Absolute ethanol is used as a solvent for laboratory and industrial applications where water will react with other chemicals and as fuel alcohol Spectroscopic ethanol is an absolute ethanol with a low absorbance in ultraviolet and visible light fit for use as a solvent in ultraviolet visible spectroscopy br Pure ethanol is classed as proof in the US equivalent to degrees proof in the UK system br br br Rectified spirits br Rectified spirit an azeotropic composition of ethanol containing water is used instead of anhydrous ethanol for various purposes Spirits of wine are about ethanol proof The impurities are different from those in proof laboratory ethanol br br br Reactions br br Ethanol is classified as a primary alcohol meaning that the carbon that its hydroxyl group attaches to has at least two hydrogen atoms attached to it as well Many ethanol reactions occur at its hydroxyl group br br br Ester formation br In the presence of acid catalysts ethanol reacts with carboxylic acids to produce ethyl esters and water br br RCOOH HOCH CH RCOOCH CH H O br This reaction which is conducted on large scale industrially requires the removal of the water from the reaction mixture as it is formed Esters react in the presence of an acid or base to give back the alcohol and a salt This reaction is known as saponification because it is used in the preparation of soap Ethanol can also form esters with inorganic acids Diethyl sulfate and triethyl phosphate are prepared by treating ethanol with sulfur trioxide and phosphorus pentoxide respectively Diethyl sulfate is a useful ethylating agent in organic synthesis Ethyl nitrite prepared from the reaction of ethanol with sodium nitrite and sulfuric acid was formerly used as a diuretic br br br Dehydration br In the presence of acid catalysts alcohols can be converted to alkenes such as ethanol to ethylene Typically solid acids such as alumina are used br br CH CH OH H C CH H O br Since water is removed from the same molecule the reaction is known as intramolecular dehydration Intramolecular dehydration of an alcohol requires a high temperature and the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid br Ethylene produced from sugar derived ethanol primarily in Brazil competes with ethylene produced from petrochemical feedstocks such as naphtha and ethane br At a lower temperature than that of intramolecular dehydration intermolecular alcohol dehydration may occur producing a symmetrical ether This is a condensation reaction In the following example diethyl ether is produced from ethanol br br CH CH OH CH CH OCH CH H O br br br Combustion br Complete combustion of ethanol forms carbon dioxide and water br br C H OH l O g CO g H O l cH kJ mol kJ g kcal mol kcal g br C H OH l O g CO g H O g cH kJ mol kJ g kcal mol kcal g br Specific heat kJ kg K br br br Acid base chemistry br Ethanol is a neutral molecule and the pH of a solution of ethanol in water is nearly Ethanol can be quantitatively converted to its conjugate base the ethoxide ion CH CH O by reaction with an alkali metal such as sodium br br CH CH OH Na CH CH ONa H br or a very strong base such as sodium hydride br br CH CH OH NaH CH CH ONa H br The acidities of water and ethanol are nearly the same as indicated by their pKa of and respectively Thus sodium ethoxide and sodium hydroxide exist in an equilibrium that is closely balanced br br CH CH OH NaOH CH CH ONa H O br br br Halogenation br Ethanol is not used industrially as a precursor to ethyl halides but the reactions are illustrative Ethanol reacts with hydrogen halides to produce ethyl halides such as ethyl chloride and ethyl bromide via an SN reaction br br CH CH OH HCl CH CH Cl H O br HCl requires a catalyst such as zinc chloride br HBr requires refluxing with a sulfuric acid catalyst Ethyl halides can in principle also be produced by treating ethanol with more specialized halogenating agents such as thionyl chloride or phosphorus tribromide br br CH CH OH SOCl CH CH Cl SO HCl br Upon treatment with halogens in the presence of base ethanol gives the corresponding haloform CHX where X Cl Br I This conversion is called the haloform reaction br An intermediate in the reaction with chlorine is the aldehyde called chloral which forms chloral hydrate upon reaction with water br br Cl CH CH OH CCl CHO HCl br CCl CHO H O CCl C OH H br br br Oxidation br Ethanol can be oxidized to acetaldehyde and further oxidized to acetic acid depending on the reagents and conditions This oxidation is of no importance industrially but in the human body these oxidation reactions are catalyzed by the enzyme liver alcohol dehydrogenase The oxidation product of ethanol acetic acid is a nutrient for humans being a precursor to acetyl CoA where the acetyl group can be spent as energy or used for biosynthesis br br br Metabolism br Ethanol is similar to macronutrients such as proteins fats and carbohydrates in that it provides calories When consumed and metabolized it contributes kilocalories per gram via ethanol metabolism br br br Safety br br Ethanol is very flammable and should not be used around an open flame br Pure ethanol will irritate the skin and eyes Nausea vomiting and intoxication are symptoms of ingestion Long term use by ingestion can result in serious liver damage Atmospheric concentrations above one part per thousand are above the European Union occupational exposure limits br br br History br br The fermentation of sugar into ethanol is one of the earliest biotechnologies employed by humans Ethanol has historically been identified variously as spirit of wine or ardent spirits and as aqua vitae or aqua vita The intoxicating effects of its consumption have been known since ancient times Ethanol has been used by humans since prehistory as the intoxicating ingredient of alcoholic beverages Dried residue on year old pottery found in China suggests that Neolithic people consumed alcoholic beverages br The inflammable nature of the exhalations of wine was already known to ancient natural philosophers such as Aristotle BCE Theophrastus c BCE and Pliny the Elder CE However this did not immediately lead to the isolation of ethanol even despite the development of more advanced distillation techniques in second and third century Roman Egypt An important recognition first found in one of the writings attributed to J bir ibn ayy n ninth century CE was that by adding salt to boiling wine which increases the wine s relative volatility the flammability of the resulting vapors may be enhanced The distillation of wine is attested in Arabic works attributed to al Kind c CE and to al F r b c and in the th book of al Zahr w s Latin Abulcasis Kit b al Ta r f later translated into Latin as Liber servatoris In the twelfth century recipes for the production of aqua ardens burning water i e ethanol by distilling wine with salt started to appear in a number of Latin works and by the end of the thirteenth century it had become a widely known substance among Western European chemists br The works of Taddeo Alderotti describe a method for concentrating ethanol involving repeated fractional distillation through a water cooled still by which an ethanol purity of could be obtained The medicinal properties of ethanol were studied by Arnald of Villanova CE and John of Rupescissa c the latter of whom regarded it as a life preserving substance able to prevent all diseases the aqua vitae or water of life also called by John the quintessence of wine br In China archaeological evidence indicates that the true distillation of alcohol began during the Jin or Southern Song dynasties A still has been found at an archaeological site in Qinglong Hebei dating to the th century In India the true distillation of alcohol was introduced from the Middle East and was in wide use in the Delhi Sultanate by the th century br In German Russian chemist Johann Tobias Lowitz obtained pure ethanol by mixing partially purified ethanol the alcohol water azeotrope with an excess of anhydrous alkali and then distilling the mixture over low heat French chemist Antoine Lavoisier described ethanol as a compound of carbon hydrogen and oxygen and in Nicolas Th odore de Saussure determined ethanol s chemical formula Fifty years later Archibald Scott Couper published the structural formula of ethanol It was one of the first structural formulas determined br Ethanol was first prepared synthetically in by Michael Faraday He found that sulfuric acid could absorb large volumes of coal gas He gave the resulting solution to Henry Hennell a British chemist who found in that it contained sulphovinic acid ethyl hydrogen sulfate In Hennell and the French chemist Georges Simon Serullas independently discovered that sulphovinic acid could be decomposed into ethanol Thus in Faraday had unwittingly discovered that ethanol could be produced from ethylene a component of coal gas by acid catalyzed hydration a process similar to current industrial ethanol synthesis br Ethanol was used as lamp fuel in the U S as early as but a tax levied on industrial alcohol during the Civil War made this use uneconomical The tax was repealed in Use as an automotive fuel dates back to with the Ford Model T able to run on petrol gasoline or ethanol It fuels some spirit lamps br Ethanol intended for industrial use is often produced from ethylene Ethanol has widespread use as a solvent of substances intended for human contact or consumption including scents flavorings colorings and medicines In chemistry it is both a solvent and a feedstock for the synthesis of other products It has a long history as a fuel for heat and light and more recently as a fuel for internal combustion engines br br
