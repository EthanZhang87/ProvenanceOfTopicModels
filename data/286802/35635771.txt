title: Catalytic heater
id: 35635771
A catalytic heater is a flameless heater which relies on catalyzed chemical reactions to break down molecules and produce calefaction heat When the catalyst fuel e g natural gas and oxygen combine together they react at a low enough temperature that a flame is not produced This process keeps repeating itself until either oxygen or the fuel source is taken out of the equation br br br Types br There are three main types of larger catalytic heaters br br Heated Enclosure Packages br Instrument Gas and Pilot Preheating Regulators br Space Heating br Heated enclosure packages are used to protect pipes from rain and ice build up by keeping the pipes heated The catalytic heater is contained within the package which is usually made out of stainless steel Instrument gas and pilot preheating regulators are only used for freeze protection and to heat up the gas before it reaches the pilot It can also be used to heat a stream of gas that s used for measurement or instrumentation Space heating is a good substitution when heat is required but traditional means such as electricity or safety concerns over explosive gas can t be used Catalytic space heaters generate infrared heat to raise the temperature in a given area br In addition to the larger catalytic heaters there are also small hand warmer or pocket heaters that use a catalyst combustion unit Current units use a glass fiber substrate coated with platinum Cheaper units may use other catalysts that don t work as well Some older units used asbestos substrates These hand warmers are for people who work or pursue leisure activities outdoors in very low temperatures especially those that require manual dexterity that is not possible while wearing thick gloves or mittens They date from the foundation of the Japanese Hakkunin company by Niichi Matoba who founded to produce a hand warmer Hakkin Kairo based on his Japanese patent of John W Smith President of Aladdin Laboratories Inc of Minneapolis was awarded a US patent for a product called the Jon e pronounced Johnny catalytic hand warmer on December Production peaked in the fifties and sixties at warmers a day Aladdin went out of business in the s In the Zippo lighter company introduced an all metal catalytic hand warmer along with other outdoor products There are other catalytic hand warmer brands like the South Korean S Boston the UK Whitby Warmer and also Chinese unbranded versions of designs based on the Hakkin Peacock or the Jon e which date back to the manufacturing heyday of Hong Kong in the s and s br br br Chemistry br The following substances are able to help oxidize a fuel for a catalytic heater at a useful rate br br Platinum can be used with natural gas propane and butane It generates a surface temperature of C lower than the C ignition point Pt heaters are the most common type br Palladium can be used with hydrogen gas Pd coated carbon is in used an prototype heater built by the Sandia National Laboratory br br br Functions br br Catalytic heaters serve many functions especially in the oil and gas industries They are useful where heat production is necessary at a controlled rate Typically used in Thermoelectric Generators TEG s or thermopiles off of raw well gas or H S to create enough electricity to operate the remote well site at great distances from their parent processing plants They can also be used in gas meters regulators and control valves gas wellhead heaters pipeline heaters space heaters separators and compressor stations Some other examples would include soldering irons hand warmers and space heating appliances Catalytic heaters have high efficiency allowing smaller heaters to be used therefore lowering initial costs and fuel consumption These heaters typically use propane LP or butane fuel whereas many older types use either liquid fuel or alcohol Handheld catalytic hand warmers have traditionally only used naphtha type liquid fuel br br br Safety br Catalytic heaters can have several potential safety issues if incorrectly installed or placed in poorly ventilated areas including fuel leakage and carbon monoxide poisoning from insufficient exhaust extraction or improperly tuned reaction The American Gas Association standards specify that the concentration in free air of carbon monoxide from a gas heater should not exceed parts per million ppm Conversely since catalytic heaters are flameless there is a reduced fire risk br br br See also br Chemical heating pad br br br External links br br br
