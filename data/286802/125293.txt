Copper is a chemical element it has symbol Cu from Latin cuprum and atomic number It is a soft malleable and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a pinkish orange color Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity as a building material and as a constituent of various metal alloys such as sterling silver used in jewelry cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement br Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable metallic form native metals This led to very early human use in several regions from c BC Thousands of years later it was the first metal to be smelted from sulfide ores c BC the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold c BC and the first metal to be purposely alloyed with another metal tin to create bronze c BC br In the Roman era copper was mined principally on Cyprus the origin of the name of the metal from aes cyprium metal of Cyprus later corrupted to cuprum Latin Coper Old English and copper were derived from this the later spelling first used around br Commonly encountered compounds are copper II salts which often impart blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite malachite and turquoise and have been used widely and historically as pigments br Copper used in buildings usually for roofing oxidizes to form a green patina of compounds called verdigris Copper is sometimes used in decorative art both in its elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments Copper compounds are used as bacteriostatic agents fungicides and wood preservatives br Copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace dietary mineral because it is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex cytochrome c oxidase In molluscs and crustaceans copper is a constituent of the blood pigment hemocyanin replaced by the iron complexed hemoglobin in fish and other vertebrates In humans copper is found mainly in the liver muscle and bone The adult body contains between and mg of copper per kilogram of body weight br br br Characteristics br br br Physical br br Copper silver and gold are in group of the periodic table these three metals have one s orbital electron on top of a filled d electron shell and are characterized by high ductility and electrical and thermal conductivity The filled d shells in these elements contribute little to interatomic interactions which are dominated by the s electrons through metallic bonds Unlike metals with incomplete d shells metallic bonds in copper are lacking a covalent character and are relatively weak This observation explains the low hardness and high ductility of single crystals of copper At the macroscopic scale introduction of extended defects to the crystal lattice such as grain boundaries hinders flow of the material under applied stress thereby increasing its hardness For this reason copper is usually supplied in a fine grained polycrystalline form which has greater strength than monocrystalline forms br The softness of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity S m and high thermal conductivity second highest second only to silver among pure metals at room temperature This is because the resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice which are relatively weak in a soft metal The maximum possible current density of copper in open air is approximately A m above which it begins to heat excessively br Copper is one of a few metallic elements with a natural color other than gray or silver Pure copper is orange red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air This is due to the low plasma frequency of the metal which lies in the red part of the visible spectrum causing it to absorb the higher frequency green and blue colors br As with other metals if copper is put in contact with another metal in the presence of an electrolyte galvanic corrosion will occur br br br Chemical br br Copper does not react with water but it does slowly react with atmospheric oxygen to form a layer of brown black copper oxide which unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air protects the underlying metal from further corrosion passivation A green layer of verdigris copper carbonate can often be seen on old copper structures such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides br br br Isotopes br br There are isotopes of copper Cu and Cu are stable with Cu comprising approximately of naturally occurring copper both have a spin of The other isotopes are radioactive with the most stable being Cu with a half life of hours Seven metastable isomers have been characterized mCu is the longest lived with a half life of minutes Isotopes with a mass number above decay by whereas those with a mass number below decay by Cu which has a half life of hours decays both ways br Cu and Cu have significant applications Cu is used in CuCu PTSM as a radioactive tracer for positron emission tomography br br br Occurrence br br Copper is produced in massive stars and is present in the Earth s crust in a proportion of about parts per million ppm In nature copper occurs in a variety of minerals including native copper copper sulfides such as chalcopyrite bornite digenite covellite and chalcocite copper sulfosalts such as tetrahedite tennantite and enargite copper carbonates such as azurite and malachite and as copper I or copper II oxides such as cuprite and tenorite respectively The largest mass of elemental copper discovered weighed tonnes and was found in on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan US Native copper is a polycrystal with the largest single crystal ever described measuring cm Copper is the th most abundant element in Earth s crust representing ppm compared with ppm for zinc and ppm for lead br Typical background concentrations of copper do not exceed ng m in the atmosphere mg kg in soil mg kg in vegetation g L in freshwater and g L in seawater br br br Production br br Most copper is mined or extracted as copper sulfides from large open pit mines in porphyry copper deposits that contain to copper Sites include Chuquicamata in Chile Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah United States and El Chino Mine in New Mexico United States According to the British Geological Survey in Chile was the top producer of copper with at least one third of the world share followed by the United States Indonesia and Peru Copper can also be recovered through the in situ leach process Several sites in the state of Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method The amount of copper in use is increasing and the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage An alternative source of copper for collection currently being researched are polymetallic nodules which are located at the depths of the Pacific Ocean approximately meters below sea level These nodules contain other valuable metals such as cobalt and nickel br br br Reserves and prices br Copper has been in use for at least years but more than of all copper ever mined and smelted has been extracted since As with many natural resources the total amount of copper on Earth is vast with around tons in the top kilometer of Earth s crust which is about million years worth at the current rate of extraction However only a tiny fraction of these reserves is economically viable with present day prices and technologies Estimates of copper reserves available for mining vary from to years depending on core assumptions such as the growth rate Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern world br br The price of copper is volatile After a peak in the price unexpectedly fell br br br Methods br br The great majority of copper ores are sulfides Common ores are the sulfides chalcopyrite CuFeS bornite Cu FeS and to a lesser extent covellite CuS and chalcocite Cu S These ores occur at the level of Cu Concentration of the ore is required which begins with comminution followed by froth flotation The remaining concentrate is the smelted which can be described with two simplified equations br br Cu S O Cu O SO br Cuprous oxide reacts with cuprous sulfide to convert to blister copper upon heating br br Cu O Cu S Cu SO br This roasting gives matte copper roughly Cu by weight which is purified by electrolysis Depending on the ore sometimes other metals are obtained during the electrolysis including platinum and gold br Aside from sulfides another family of ores are oxides Approximately of the world s copper supply derives from these oxides The beneficiation process for oxides involves extraction with sulfuric acid solutions followed by electrolysis In parallel with the above method for concentrated sulfide and oxide ores copper is recovered from mine tailings and heaps A variety of methods are used including leaching with sulfuric acid ammonia ferric chloride Biological methods are also used br A significant source of copper is from recycling Recycling is facilitated because copper is usually deployed in its metallic state In a typical automobile contained kg of copper Recycling usually begins with some melting process using a blast furnace br A potential source of copper is polymetallic nodules which have an estimated concentration br br br Recycling br Like aluminium copper is recyclable without any loss of quality both from raw state and from manufactured products In volume copper is the third most recycled metal after iron and aluminium An estimated of all copper ever mined is still in use today According to the International Resource Panel s Metal Stocks in Society report the global per capita stock of copper in use in society is kg Much of this is in more developed countries kg per capita rather than less developed countries kg per capita br The process of recycling copper is roughly the same as is used to extract copper but requires fewer steps High purity scrap copper is melted in a furnace and then reduced and cast into billets and ingots lower purity scrap is refined by electroplating in a bath of sulfuric acid br br br Environmental impacts br The environmental cost of copper mining was estimated at kg CO eq per kg of copper in Codelco a major producer in Chile reported that in the company emitted t CO eq per ton kg CO eq per kg of fine copper Greenhouse gas emissions primarily arise from electricity consumed by the company especially when sourced from fossil fuels and from engines required for copper extraction and refinement Companies that mine land often mismanage waste rendering the area sterile for life Additionally nearby rivers and forests are also negatively impacted The Philippines is an example of a region where land is overexploited by mining companies br Copper mining waste in Valea esei Romania has significantly altered nearby water properties The water in the affected areas is highly acidic with a pH range of and shows elevated electrical conductivity levels between and mS cm These changes in water chemistry make the environment inhospitable for fish essentially rendering the water uninhabitable for aquatic life br br br Alloys br br Numerous copper alloys have been formulated many with important uses Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc Bronze usually refers to copper tin alloys but can refer to any alloy of copper such as aluminium bronze Copper is one of the most important constituents of silver and karat gold solders used in the jewelry industry modifying the color hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys Some lead free solders consist of tin alloyed with a small proportion of copper and other metals br The alloy of copper and nickel called cupronickel is used in low denomination coins often for the outer cladding The US five cent coin currently called a nickel consists of copper and nickel in homogeneous composition Prior to the introduction of cupronickel which was widely adopted by countries in the latter half of the th century alloys of copper and silver were also used with the United States using an alloy of silver and copper until when circulating silver was removed from all coins with the exception of the half dollar these were debased to an alloy of silver and copper between and The alloy of copper and nickel remarkable for its resistance to corrosion is used for various objects exposed to seawater though it is vulnerable to the sulfides sometimes found in polluted harbors and estuaries Alloys of copper with aluminium about have a golden color and are used in decorations Shakud is a Japanese decorative alloy of copper containing a low percentage of gold typically that can be patinated to a dark blue or black color br br br Compounds br br Copper forms a rich variety of compounds usually with oxidation states and which are often called cuprous and cupric respectively Copper compounds promote or catalyse numerous chemical and biological processes br br br Binary compounds br As with other elements the simplest compounds of copper are binary compounds i e those containing only two elements the principal examples being oxides sulfides and halides Both cuprous and cupric oxides are known Among the numerous copper sulfides important examples include copper I sulfide Cu S and copper monosulfide CuS br Cuprous halides with fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine are known as are cupric halides with fluorine chlorine and bromine Attempts to prepare copper II iodide yield only copper I iodide and iodine br br Cu I CuI I br br br Coordination chemistry br br Copper forms coordination complexes with ligands In aqueous solution copper II exists as Cu H O This complex exhibits the fastest water exchange rate speed of water ligands attaching and detaching for any transition metal aquo complex Adding aqueous sodium hydroxide causes the precipitation of light blue solid copper II hydroxide A simplified equation is br Cu OH Cu OH br Aqueous ammonia results in the same precipitate Upon adding excess ammonia the precipitate dissolves forming tetraamminecopper II br br Cu H O OH NH Cu H O NH H O OH br Many other oxyanions form complexes these include copper II acetate copper II nitrate and copper II carbonate Copper II sulfate forms a blue crystalline pentahydrate the most familiar copper compound in the laboratory It is used in a fungicide called the Bordeaux mixture br br Polyols compounds containing more than one alcohol functional group generally interact with cupric salts For example copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars Specifically using Benedict s reagent and Fehling s solution the presence of the sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu II to reddish copper I oxide Schweizer s reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose Amino acids such as cystine form very stable chelate complexes with copper II including in the form of metal organic biohybrids MOBs Many wet chemical tests for copper ions exist one involving potassium ferricyanide which gives a red brown precipitate with copper II salts br br br Organocopper chemistry br br Compounds that contain a carbon copper bond are known as organocopper compounds They are very reactive towards oxygen to form copper I oxide and have many uses in chemistry They are synthesized by treating copper I compounds with Grignard reagents terminal alkynes or organolithium reagents in particular the last reaction described produces a Gilman reagent These can undergo substitution with alkyl halides to form coupling products as such they are important in the field of organic synthesis Copper I acetylide is highly shock sensitive but is an intermediate in reactions such as the Cadiot Chodkiewicz coupling and the Sonogashira coupling Conjugate addition to enones and carbocupration of alkynes can also be achieved with organocopper compounds Copper I forms a variety of weak complexes with alkenes and carbon monoxide especially in the presence of amine ligands br br br Copper III and copper IV br Copper III is most often found in oxides A simple example is potassium cuprate KCuO a blue black solid The most extensively studied copper III compounds are the cuprate superconductors Yttrium barium copper oxide YBa Cu O consists of both Cu II and Cu III centres Like oxide fluoride is a highly basic anion and is known to stabilize metal ions in high oxidation states Both copper III and even copper IV fluorides are known K CuF and Cs CuF respectively br Some copper proteins form oxo complexes which in extensively studied synthetic analog systems feature copper III With tetrapeptides purple colored copper III complexes are stabilized by the deprotonated amide ligands br Complexes of copper III are also found as intermediates in reactions of organocopper compounds for example in the Kharasch Sosnovsky reaction br br br History br A timeline of copper illustrates how this metal has advanced human civilization for the past years br br br Prehistoric br br br Copper Age br br Copper occurs naturally as native metallic copper and was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record The history of copper use dates to BC in the Middle East a copper pendant was found in northern Iraq that dates to BC Evidence suggests that gold and meteoric iron but not smelted iron were the only metals used by humans before copper The history of copper metallurgy is thought to follow this sequence first cold working of native copper then annealing smelting and finally lost wax casting In southeastern Anatolia all four of these techniques appear more or less simultaneously at the beginning of the Neolithic c BC br Copper smelting was independently invented in different places The earliest evidence of lost wax casting copper comes from an amulet found in Mehrgarh Pakistan and is dated to BC Investment casting was invented in BC in Southeast Asia Smelting was probably discovered in China before BC in Central America around AD and in West Africa about the th or th century AD Carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire UK at to BC br tzi the Iceman a male dated from to BC was found with an axe with a copper head pure high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest an involvement in copper smelting Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals in particular copper smelting likely led to the discovery of iron smelting br br Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between and BC A copper spearpoint found in Wisconsin has been dated to BC Copper usage by the indigenous peoples of the Old Copper Complex from the Great Lakes region of North America has been radiometrically dated to as far back as BC Indigenous peoples of North America around the Great Lakes may have also been mining copper during this time making it one of the oldest known examples of copper extraction in the world There is evidence from prehistoric lead pollution from lakes in Michigan that people in the region began mining copper c BC Evidence suggests that utilitarian copper objects fell increasingly out of use in the Old Copper Complex of North America during the Bronze Age and a shift towards an increased production of ornamental copper objects occurred br br br Bronze Age br br Natural bronze a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon arsenic and rarely tin came into general use in the Balkans around BC Alloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about years after the discovery of copper smelting and about years after natural bronze had come into general use Bronze artifacts from the Vin a culture date to BC Sumerian and Egyptian artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to BC Egyptian Blue or cuprorivaite calcium copper silicate is a synthetic pigment that contains copper and started being used in ancient Egypt around BC The manufacturing process of Egyptian blue was known to the Romans but by the fourth century AD the pigment fell out of use and the secret to its manufacturing process became lost The Romans said the blue pigment was made from copper silica lime and natron and was known to them as caeruleum br The Bronze Age began in Southeastern Europe around BC in Northwestern Europe about BC It ended with the beginning of the Iron Age BC in the Near East and BC in Northern Europe The transition between the Neolithic period and the Bronze Age was formerly termed the Chalcolithic period copper stone when copper tools were used with stone tools The term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the world the Chalcolithic and Neolithic are coterminous at both ends Brass an alloy of copper and zinc is of much more recent origin It was known to the Greeks but became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman Empire br br br Ancient and post classical br br In Greece copper was known by the name chalkos It was an important resource for the Romans Greeks and other ancient peoples In Roman times it was known as aes Cyprium aes being the generic Latin term for copper alloys and Cyprium from Cyprus where much copper was mined The phrase was simplified to cuprum hence the English copper Aphrodite Venus in Rome represented copper in mythology and alchemy because of its lustrous beauty and its ancient use in producing mirrors Cyprus the source of copper was sacred to the goddess The seven heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven metals known in antiquity and Venus was assigned to copper both because of the connection to the goddess and because Venus was the brightest heavenly body after the Sun and Moon and so corresponded to the most lustrous and desirable metal after gold and silver br Copper was first mined in ancient Britain as early as BC Mining at the largest of these mines the Great Orme continued into the late Bronze Age Mining seems to have been largely restricted to supergene ores which were easier to smelt The rich copper deposits of Cornwall seem to have been largely untouched in spite of extensive tin mining in the region for reasons likely social and political rather than technological br In North America native copper is known to have been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between and AD Copper annealing was being performed in the North American city of Cahokia around AD There are several exquisite copper plates known as the Mississippian copper plates that have been found in North America in the area around Cahokia dating from this time period AD The copper plates were thought to have been manufactured at Cahokia before ending up elsewhere in the Midwest and southeastern United States like the Wulfing cache and Etowah plates br br In South America a copper mask dated to BC found in the Argentinian Andes is the oldest known copper artifact discovered in the Andes Peru has been considered the origin for early copper metallurgy in pre Columbian America but the copper mask from Argentina suggests that the Caj n del Maipo of the southern Andes was another important center for early copper workings in South America Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America particularly in Peru around AD Copper burial ornamentals from the th century have been uncovered but the metal s commercial production did not start until the early th century br The cultural role of copper has been important particularly in currency Romans in the th through rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money At first the copper itself was valued but gradually the shape and look of the copper became more important Julius Caesar had his own coins made from brass while Octavianus Augustus Caesar s coins were made from Cu Pb Sn alloys With an estimated annual output of around t Roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the Industrial Revolution the provinces most intensely mined were those of Hispania Cyprus and in Central Europe br The gates of the Temple of Jerusalem used Corinthian bronze treated with depletion gilding The process was most prevalent in Alexandria where alchemy is thought to have begun In ancient India copper was used in the holistic medical science Ayurveda for surgical instruments and other medical equipment Ancient Egyptians BC used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking water and later to treat headaches burns and itching br br br Modern br br The Great Copper Mountain was a mine in Falun Sweden that operated from the th century to It satisfied two thirds of Europe s copper consumption in the th century and helped fund many of Sweden s wars during that time It was referred to as the nation s treasury Sweden had a copper backed currency br br Copper is used in roofing currency and for photographic technology known as the daguerreotype Copper was used in Renaissance sculpture and was used to construct the Statue of Liberty copper continues to be used in construction of various types Copper plating and copper sheathing were widely used to protect the under water hulls of ships a technique pioneered by the British Admiralty in the th century The Norddeutsche Affinerie in Hamburg was the first modern electroplating plant starting its production in The German scientist Gottfried Osann invented powder metallurgy in while determining the metal s atomic mass around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element e g tin to copper would affect bell tones br During the rise in demand for copper for the Age of Electricity from the s until the Great Depression of the s the United States produced one third to half the world s newly mined copper Major districts included the Keweenaw district of northern Michigan primarily native copper deposits which was eclipsed by the vast sulphide deposits of Butte Montana in the late s which itself was eclipsed by porphyry deposits of the Southwest United States especially at Bingham Canyon Utah and Morenci Arizona Introduction of open pit steam shovel mining and innovations in smelting refining flotation concentration and other processing steps led to mass production Early in the twentieth century Arizona ranked first followed by Montana then Utah and Michigan br Flash smelting was developed by Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at Harjavalta in the energy efficient process accounts for of the world s primary copper production br The Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries formed in by Chile Peru Zaire and Zambia operated in the copper market as OPEC does in oil though it never achieved the same influence particularly because the second largest producer the United States was never a member it was dissolved in br br br Applications br br The major applications of copper are electrical wire roofing and plumbing and industrial machinery Copper is used mostly as a pure metal but when greater hardness is required it is put into such alloys as brass and bronze of total use For more than two centuries copper paint has been used on boat hulls to control the growth of plants and shellfish A small part of the copper supply is used for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture Machining of copper is possible although alloys are preferred for good machinability in creating intricate parts br br br Wire and cable br br Despite competition from other materials copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred Copper wire is used in power generation power transmission power distribution telecommunications electronics circuitry and countless types of electrical equipment Electrical wiring is the most important market for the copper industry This includes structural power wiring power distribution cable appliance wire communications cable automotive wire and cable and magnet wire Roughly half of all copper mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties such as its high electrical conductivity tensile strength ductility creep deformation resistance corrosion resistance low thermal expansion high thermal conductivity ease of soldering malleability and ease of installation br For a short period from the late s to the late s copper wiring was replaced by aluminium wiring in many housing construction projects in America The new wiring was implicated in a number of house fires and the industry returned to copper br br br Electronics and related devices br br Integrated circuits and printed circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity heat sinks and heat exchangers use copper because of its superior heat dissipation properties Electromagnets vacuum tubes cathode ray tubes and magnetrons in microwave ovens use copper as do waveguides for microwave radiation br br br Electric motors br Copper s superior conductivity enhances the efficiency of electrical motors This is important because motors and motor driven systems account for of all global electricity consumption and of all electricity used by industry Increasing the mass and cross section of copper in a coil increases the efficiency of the motor Copper motor rotors a new technology designed for motor applications where energy savings are prime design objectives are enabling general purpose induction motors to meet and exceed National Electrical Manufacturers Association NEMA premium efficiency standards br br br Renewable energy production br br br Architecture br br Copper has been used since ancient times as a durable corrosion resistant and weatherproof architectural material Roofs flashings rain gutters downspouts domes spires vaults and doors have been made from copper for hundreds or thousands of years Copper s architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding building expansion joints radio frequency shielding and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails bathroom fixtures and counter tops Some of copper s other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement light weight lightning protection and recyclability br The metal s distinctive natural green patina has long been coveted by architects and designers The final patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering It can be a mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts depending upon environmental conditions such as sulfur containing acid rain Architectural copper and its alloys can also be finished to take on a particular look feel or color Finishes include mechanical surface treatments chemical coloring and coatings br Copper has excellent brazing and soldering properties and can be welded the best results are obtained with gas metal arc welding br br br Antibiofouling br br Copper is biostatic meaning bacteria and many other forms of life will not grow on it For this reason it has long been used to line parts of ships to protect against barnacles and mussels It was originally used pure but has since been superseded by Muntz metal and copper based paint Similarly as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture copper alloys have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and corrosion resistant properties in marine environments br br br Antimicrobial br br Copper alloy touch surfaces have natural properties that destroy a wide range of microorganisms e g E coli O H methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA Staphylococcus Clostridium difficile influenza A virus adenovirus SARS CoV and fungi Indians have been using copper vessels since ancient times for storing water even before modern science realized its antimicrobial properties Some copper alloys were proven to kill more than of disease causing bacteria within just two hours when cleaned regularly The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA has approved the registrations of these copper alloys as antimicrobial materials with public health benefits that approval allows manufacturers to make legal claims to the public health benefits of products made of registered alloys In addition the EPA has approved a long list of antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys such as bedrails handrails over bed tables sinks faucets door knobs toilet hardware computer keyboards health club equipment and shopping cart handles Copper doorknobs are used by hospitals to reduce the transfer of disease and Legionnaires disease is suppressed by copper tubing in plumbing systems Antimicrobial copper alloy products are now being installed in healthcare facilities in the U K Ireland Japan Korea France Denmark and Brazil as well as being called for in the US and in the subway transit system in Santiago Chile where copper zinc alloy handrails were installed in some stations between and br Textile fibers can be blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics br br br Copper demand br Total world production in is expected to be almost million metric tons Copper demand is increasing due to the ongoing energy transition to electricity China accounts for over half the demand br For some purposes other metals can substitute aluminium wire was substituted in many applications but improper design resulted in fire hazards The safety issues have since been solved by use of larger sizes of aluminium wire AWG and up and properly designed aluminium wiring is still being installed in place of copper For example the Airbus A uses aluminum wire in place of copper wire for electrical power transmission br br br Speculative investing br Copper may be used as a speculative investment due to the predicted increase in use from worldwide infrastructure growth and the important role it has in producing wind turbines solar panels and other renewable energy sources Another reason predicted demand increases is the fact that electric cars contain an average of times as much copper as conventional cars although the effect of electric cars on copper demand is debated Some people invest in copper through copper mining stocks ETFs and futures Others store physical copper in the form of copper bars or rounds although these tend to carry a higher premium in comparison to precious metals Those who want to avoid the premiums of copper bullion alternatively store old copper wire copper tubing or American pennies made before br br br Folk medicine br Copper is commonly used in jewelry and according to some folklore copper bracelets relieve arthritis symptoms In one trial for osteoarthritis and one trial for rheumatoid arthritis no differences were found between copper bracelet and control non copper bracelet No evidence shows that copper can be absorbed through the skin If it were it might lead to copper poisoning br br br Degradation br Chromobacterium violaceum and Pseudomonas fluorescens can both mobilize solid copper as a cyanide compound The ericoid mycorrhizal fungi associated with Calluna Erica and Vaccinium can grow in metalliferous soils containing copper The ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus protects young pine trees from copper toxicity A sample of the fungus Aspergillus niger was found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of such metals as gold silver copper iron and zinc The fungus also plays a role in the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides br br br Biological role br br br Biochemistry br Copper proteins have diverse roles in biological electron transport and oxygen transportation processes that exploit the easy interconversion of Cu I and Cu II Copper is essential in the aerobic respiration of all eukaryotes In mitochondria it is found in cytochrome c oxidase which is the last protein in oxidative phosphorylation Cytochrome c oxidase is the protein that binds the O between a copper and an iron the protein transfers electrons to the O molecule to reduce it to two molecules of water Copper is also found in many superoxide dismutases proteins that catalyze the decomposition of superoxides by converting it by disproportionation to oxygen and hydrogen peroxide br br Cu SOD O Cu SOD O reduction of copper oxidation of superoxide br Cu SOD O H Cu SOD H O oxidation of copper reduction of superoxide br The protein hemocyanin is the oxygen carrier in most mollusks and some arthropods such as the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus Because hemocyanin is blue these organisms have blue blood rather than the red blood of iron based hemoglobin Structurally related to hemocyanin are the laccases and tyrosinases Instead of reversibly binding oxygen these proteins hydroxylate substrates illustrated by their role in the formation of lacquers The biological role for copper commenced with the appearance of oxygen in Earth s atmosphere Several copper proteins such as the blue copper proteins do not interact directly with substrates hence they are not enzymes These proteins relay electrons by the process called electron transfer br br A unique tetranuclear copper center has been found in nitrous oxide reductase br Chemical compounds which were developed for treatment of Wilson s disease have been investigated for use in cancer therapy br br br Nutrition br Copper is an essential trace element in plants and animals but not all microorganisms The human body contains copper at a level of about to mg per kg of body mass br br br Absorption br Copper is absorbed in the gut then transported to the liver bound to albumin After processing in the liver copper is distributed to other tissues in a second phase which involves the protein ceruloplasmin carrying the majority of copper in blood Ceruloplasmin also carries the copper that is excreted in milk and is particularly well absorbed as a copper source Copper in the body normally undergoes enterohepatic circulation about mg a day vs about mg per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body and the body is able to excrete some excess copper if needed via bile which carries some copper out of the liver that is not then reabsorbed by the intestine br br br Dietary recommendations br The U S Institute of Medicine IOM updated the estimated average requirements EARs and recommended dietary allowances RDAs for copper in If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs an estimate designated Adequate Intake AI is used instead The AIs for copper are g of copper for month old males and females and g of copper for month old males and females For both sexes the RDAs for copper are g of copper for years old g of copper for years old g of copper for years old g of copper for years old and g of copper for ages years and older For pregnancy g For lactation g As for safety the IOM also sets tolerable upper intake levels ULs for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient In the case of copper the UL is set at mg day Collectively the EARs RDAs AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes br The European Food Safety Authority EFSA refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values with Population Reference Intake PRI instead of RDA and Average Requirement instead of EAR AI and UL defined the same as in United States For women and men ages and older the AIs are set at and mg day respectively AIs for pregnancy and lactation is mg day For children ages years the AIs increase with age from to mg day These AIs are higher than the U S RDAs The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at mg day which is half the U S value br For U S food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value DV For copper labeling purposes of the Daily Value was mg but as of May it was revised to mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake br br br Deficiency br Because of its role in facilitating iron uptake copper deficiency can produce anemia like symptoms neutropenia bone abnormalities hypopigmentation impaired growth increased incidence of infections osteoporosis hyperthyroidism and abnormalities in glucose and cholesterol metabolism Conversely Wilson s disease causes an accumulation of copper in body tissues br Severe deficiency can be found by testing for low plasma or serum copper levels low ceruloplasmin and low red blood cell superoxide dismutase levels these are not sensitive to marginal copper status The cytochrome c oxidase activity of leucocytes and platelets has been stated as another factor in deficiency but the results have not been confirmed by replication br br br Toxicity br br Gram quantities of various copper salts have been taken in suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans possibly due to redox cycling and the generation of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA Corresponding amounts of copper salts mg kg are toxic in animals A minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits has been reported to be at least ppm in the diet However higher concentrations of copper ppm ppm or ppm in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed conversion efficiency growth rates and carcass dressing percentages br Chronic copper toxicity does not normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion Autosomal recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems leading to Wilson s disease with copper accumulation and cirrhosis of the liver in persons who have inherited two defective genes br Elevated copper levels have also been linked to worsening symptoms of Alzheimer s disease br br br Human exposure br In the US the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has designated a permissible exposure limit PEL for copper dust and fumes in the workplace as a time weighted average TWA of mg m The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has set a recommended exposure limit REL of mg m time weighted average The IDLH immediately dangerous to life and health value is mg m br Copper is a constituent of tobacco smoke The tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy metals such as copper from the surrounding soil into its leaves These are readily absorbed into the user s body following smoke inhalation The health implications are not clear br br br See also br Copper in renewable energy br
