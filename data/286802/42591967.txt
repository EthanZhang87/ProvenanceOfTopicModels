title: Monolith (catalyst support)
id: 42591967
Monolithic catalyst supports are extruded structures that are the core of many catalytic converters most diesel particulate filters and some catalytic reactors Most catalytic converters are used for vehicle emissions control Stationary catalytic converters can reduce air pollution from fossil fuel power stations br br br Properties br br Monoliths for automotive catalytic converters are made of a ceramic that contains a large proportion of synthetic cordierite MgO Al O SiO which has a low coefficient of thermal expansion br Each monolith contains thousands of parallel channels or holes which are defined by many thin walls in a honeycomb structure The channels can be square hexagonal round or other shapes The hole density may be from to per cm and the separating walls can be to mm The many small holes have a much larger surface area than one large hole High surface area facilitates catalytic reaction or filtration The open spaces in the cross sectional area are to of the frontal area so resistance to the flow of gases through the holes is low which minimizes energy consumed forcing gases through the structure br The monolith is a substrate that supports a catalyst After the monolith is complete a washcoat is applied that deposits oxides and catalyst s most commonly platinum palladium and or rhodium on the walls of the holes br Alternative structures include corrugated metal and a packed bed of coated pellets or other shapes br br br Uses br Diesel particulate filters DPF br Catalytic incineration br Catalyst support for chemical processes br Vehicle emissions control br br br
