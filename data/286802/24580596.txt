Cerium is a chemical element it has symbol Ce and atomic number Cerium is a soft ductile and silvery white metal that tarnishes when exposed to air Cerium is the second element in the lanthanide series and while it often shows the oxidation state of characteristic of the series it also has a stable state that does not oxidize water It is considered one of the rare earth elements Cerium has no known biological role in humans but is not particularly toxic except with intense or continued exposure br Despite always occurring in combination with the other rare earth elements in minerals such as those of the monazite and bastn site groups cerium is easy to extract from its ores as it can be distinguished among the lanthanides by its unique ability to be oxidized to the state in aqueous solution It is the most common of the lanthanides followed by neodymium lanthanum and praseodymium Its estimated abundance in the Earth s crust is ppm br Cerium was the first of the lanthanides to be discovered in Bastn s Sweden It was discovered by J ns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger in and independently by Martin Heinrich Klaproth in Germany in the same year In Carl Gustaf Mosander became the first to isolate the metal Today cerium and its compounds have a variety of uses for example cerium IV oxide is used to polish glass and is an important part of catalytic converters Cerium metal is used in ferrocerium lighters for its pyrophoric properties Cerium doped YAG phosphor is used in conjunction with blue light emitting diodes to produce white light in most commercial white LED light sources br br br Characteristics br br br Physical br Cerium is the second element of the lanthanide series In the periodic table it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right and above the actinide thorium It is a ductile metal with a hardness similar to that of silver Its electrons are arranged in the configuration Xe f d s of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons The f d and s energy levels are very close to each other and the transfer of one electron to the d shell is due to strong interelectronic repulsion in the compact f shell This effect is overwhelmed when the atom is positively ionised thus Ce on its own has instead the regular configuration Xe f although in some solid solutions it may be Xe f d Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons as afterwards the remaining f electrons are too strongly bound cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f shell in Ce and the fact that it comes very early in the lanthanide series where the nuclear charge is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth valence electron by chemical means br Cerium has a variable electronic structure The energy of the f electron is nearly the same as that of the outer d and s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels This gives rise to dual valence states For example a volume change of about occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures It appears that the valence changes from about to when it is cooled or compressed br br br Chemical properties of the element br Like the other lanthanides cerium metal is a good reducing agent having standard reduction potential of E V for the Ce Ce couple It tarnishes in air forming a passivating oxide layer like iron rust A centimeter sized sample of cerium metal corrodes completely in about a year More dramatically metallic cerium can be highly pyrophoric br br Ce O CeO br Being highly electropositive cerium reacts with water The reaction is slow with cold water but speeds up with increasing temperature producing cerium III hydroxide and hydrogen gas br br Ce H O Ce OH H br br br Allotropes br br Four allotropic forms of cerium are known to exist at standard pressure and are given the common labels of to br br The high temperature form cerium has a bcc body centered cubic crystal structure and exists above C br The stable form below C to approximately room temperature is cerium with an fcc face centered cubic crystal structure br The DHCP double hexagonal close packed form cerium is the equilibrium structure approximately from room temperature to C br The fcc form cerium is stable below about C it has a density of g cm br Other solid phases occurring only at high pressures are shown on the phase diagram br Both and forms are quite stable at room temperature although the equilibrium transformation temperature is estimated at C br At lower temperatures the behavior of cerium is complicated by the slow rates of transformation Transformation temperatures are subject to substantial hysteresis and values quoted here are approximate Upon cooling below C cerium starts to change to cerium but the transformation involves a volume increase and as more forms the internal stresses build up and suppress further transformation Cooling below approximately C will start formation of cerium but this is only from remaining cerium cerium does not significantly transform to cerium except in the presence of stress or deformation At atmospheric pressure liquid cerium is more dense than its solid form at the melting br point br br br Isotopes br br Naturally occurring cerium is made up of four isotopes Ce Ce Ce and Ce All four are observationally stable though the light isotopes Ce and Ce are theoretically expected to undergo double electron capture to isotopes of barium and the heaviest isotope Ce is expected to undergo double beta decay to Nd or alpha decay to Ba Thus Ce is the only theoretically stable isotope None of these decay modes have yet been observed though the double beta decay of Ce Ce and Ce have been experimentally searched for The current experimental limits for their half lives are br br Ce y br Ce y br Ce y br All other cerium isotopes are synthetic and radioactive The most stable of them are Ce with a half life of days Ce with a half life of days and Ce with a half life of days All other radioactive cerium isotopes have half lives under four days and most of them have half lives under ten minutes The isotopes between Ce and Ce inclusive occur as fission products of uranium The primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than Ce is inverse beta decay or electron capture to isotopes of lanthanum while that of the heavier isotopes is beta decay to isotopes of praseodymium Some isotopes of neodymium can alpha decay or are predicted to decay to isotopes of cerium br The rarity of the proton rich Ce and Ce is explained by the fact that they cannot be made in the most common processes of stellar nucleosynthesis for elements beyond iron the s process slow neutron capture and the r process rapid neutron capture This is so because they are bypassed by the reaction flow of the s process and the r process nuclides are blocked from decaying to them by more neutron rich stable nuclides Such nuclei are called p nuclei and their origin is not yet well understood some speculated mechanisms for their formation include proton capture as well as photodisintegration Ce is the most common isotope of cerium as it can be produced in both the s and r processes while Ce can only be produced in the r process Another reason for the abundance of Ce is that it is a magic nucleus having a closed neutron shell it has neutrons and hence it has a very low cross section towards further neutron capture Although its proton number of is not magic it is granted additional stability as its eight additional protons past the magic number enter and complete the g proton orbital The abundances of the cerium isotopes may differ very slightly in natural sources because Ce and Ce are the daughters of the long lived primordial radionuclides La and Nd respectively br br br Compounds br Cerium exists in two main oxidation states Ce III and Ce IV This pair of adjacent oxidation states dominates several aspects of the chemistry of this element Cerium IV aqueous solutions may be prepared by reacting cerium III solutions with the strong oxidizing agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate The value of E Ce Ce varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions although V is representative Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the oxidation state br br br Halides br Cerium forms all four trihalides CeX X F Cl Br I usually by reaction of the oxides with the hydrogen halides The anhydrous halides are pale colored paramagnetic hygroscopic solids Upon hydration the trihalides convert to complexes containing aquo complexes Ce H O Unlike most lanthanides Ce forms a tetrafluoride a white solid It also forms a bronze colored diiodide which has metallic properties Aside from the binary halide phases a number of anionic halide complexes are known The fluoride gives the Ce IV derivatives CeF and CeF The chloride gives the orange CeCl br br br Oxides and chalcogenides br Cerium IV oxide ceria has the fluorite structure similarly to the dioxides of praseodymium and terbium Ceria is a nonstoichiometric compound meaning that the real formula is CeO x where x is about Thus the material is not perfectly described as Ce IV Ceria reduces to cerium III oxide with hydrogen gas Many nonstoichiometric chalcogenides are also known along with the trivalent Ce Z Z S Se Te The monochalcogenides CeZ conduct electricity and would better be formulated as Ce Z e While CeZ are known they are polychalcogenides with cerium III cerium IV derivatives of S Se and Te are unknown br br br Cerium IV complexes br br The compound ceric ammonium nitrate CAN NH Ce NO is the most common cerium compound encountered in the laboratory The six nitrate ligands bind as bidentate ligands The complex Ce NO is coordinate a high coordination number which emphasizes the large size of the Ce ion CAN is a popular oxidant in organic synthesis both as a stoichiometric reagent and as a catalyst It is inexpensive and easily handled It operates by one electron redox Cerium nitrates also form and complexes with crown the ratio referring to that between the nitrate and the crown ether Classically CAN is a primary standard for quantitative analysis Cerium IV salts especially cerium IV sulfate are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations br br Due to ligand to metal charge transfer aqueous cerium IV ions are orange yellow Aqueous cerium IV is metastable in water and is a strong oxidizing agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas In the Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction cerium oscillates between the and oxidation states to catalyze the reaction br br br Organocerium compounds br Organocerium chemistry is similar to that of the other lanthanides often involving complexes of cyclopentadienyl and cyclooctatetraenyl ligands Cerocene Ce C H adopts the uranocene molecular structure The f electron in cerocene Ce C H is poised ambiguously between being localized and delocalized and this compound is considered intermediate valent br Alkyl alkynyl and alkenyl organocerium derivatives are prepared from the transmetallation of the respective organolithium or Grignard reagents and are more nucleophilic but less basic than their precursors br br br History br br Cerium was discovered in Bastn s in Sweden by J ns Jakob Berzelius and Wilhelm Hisinger and independently in Germany by Martin Heinrich Klaproth both in Cerium was named by Berzelius after the asteroid Ceres discovered two years earlier The asteroid is itself named after the Roman goddess Ceres goddess of agriculture grain crops fertility and motherly relationships br Cerium was originally isolated in the form of its oxide which was named ceria a term that is still used The metal itself was too electropositive to be isolated by then current smelting technology a characteristic of rare earth metals in general After the development of electrochemistry by Humphry Davy five years later the earths soon yielded the metals they contained Ceria as isolated in contained all of the lanthanides present in the cerite ore from Bastn s Sweden and thus only contained about of what is now known to be pure ceria It was not until Carl Gustaf Mosander succeeded in removing lanthana and didymia in the late s that ceria was obtained pure Wilhelm Hisinger was a wealthy mine owner and amateur scientist and sponsor of Berzelius He owned and controlled the mine at Bastn s and had been trying for years to find out the composition of the abundant heavy gangue rock the Tungsten of Bastn s which despite its name contained no tungsten now known as cerite that he had in his mine Mosander and his family lived for many years in the same house as Berzelius and Mosander was undoubtedly persuaded by Berzelius to investigate ceria further br The element played a role in the Manhattan Project where cerium compounds were investigated in the Berkeley site as materials for crucibles for uranium and plutonium casting For this reason new methods for the preparation and casting of cerium were developed within the scope of the Ames daughter project now the Ames Laboratory Production of extremely pure cerium in Ames commenced in mid and continued until August br br br Occurrence and production br Cerium is the most abundant of all the lanthanides making up ppm of the Earth s crust this value is just behind that of copper ppm and cerium is even more abundant than common metals such as lead ppm and tin ppm Thus despite its position as one of the so called rare earth metals cerium is actually not rare at all Cerium content in the soil varies between and ppm with an average of ppm seawater contains parts per trillion of cerium Cerium occurs in various minerals but the most important commercial sources are the minerals of the monazite and bastn site groups where it makes up about half of the lanthanide content Monazite Ce is the most common representative of the monazites with Ce being the Levinson suffix informing on the dominance of the particular REE element representative Also the cerium dominant bastn site Ce is the most important of the bastn sites Cerium is the easiest lanthanide to extract from its minerals because it is the only one that can reach a stable oxidation state in aqueous solution Because of the decreased solubility of cerium in the oxidation state cerium is sometimes depleted from rocks relative to the other rare earth elements and is incorporated into zircon since Ce and Zr have the same charge and similar ionic radii In extreme cases cerium IV can form its own minerals separated from the other rare earth elements such as cerianite Ce Ce Th O br br Bastn site LnIIICO F is usually lacking in thorium and the heavy lanthanides beyond samarium and europium and hence the extraction of cerium from it is quite direct First the bastn site is purified using dilute hydrochloric acid to remove calcium carbonate impurities The ore is then roasted in the air to oxidize it to the lanthanide oxides while most of the lanthanides will be oxidized to the sesquioxides Ln O cerium will be oxidized to the dioxide CeO This is insoluble in water and can be leached out with M hydrochloric acid leaving the other lanthanides behind br The procedure for monazite Ln Th PO which usually contains all the rare earths as well as thorium is more involved Monazite because of its magnetic properties can be separated by repeated electromagnetic separation After separation it is treated with hot concentrated sulfuric acid to produce water soluble sulfates of rare earths The acidic filtrates are partially neutralized with sodium hydroxide to pH Thorium precipitates out of solution as hydroxide and is removed After that the solution is treated with ammonium oxalate to convert rare earths to their insoluble oxalates The oxalates are converted to oxides by annealing The oxides are dissolved in nitric acid but cerium oxide is insoluble in HNO and hence precipitates out Care must be taken when handling some of the residues as they contain Ra the daughter of Th which is a strong gamma emitter br br br Applications br br Cerium has two main applications both of which use CeO The industrial application of ceria is for polishing especially chemical mechanical planarization CMP In its other main application CeO is used to decolorize glass It functions by converting green tinted ferrous impurities to nearly colorless ferric oxides Ceria has also been used as a substitute for its radioactive congener thoria for example in the manufacture of electrodes used in gas tungsten arc welding where ceria as an alloying element improves arc stability and ease of starting while decreasing burn off br br br Gas mantles and pyrophoric alloys br The first use of cerium was in gas mantles invented by Austrian chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach In he had previously experimented with mixtures of magnesium lanthanum and yttrium oxides but these gave green tinted light and were unsuccessful Six years later he discovered that pure thorium oxide produced a much better though blue light and that mixing it with cerium dioxide resulted in a bright white light Cerium dioxide also acts as a catalyst for the combustion of thorium oxide br This resulted in commercial success for von Welsbach and his invention and created great demand for thorium Its production resulted in a large amount of lanthanides being simultaneously extracted as by products Applications were soon found for them especially in the pyrophoric alloy known as mischmetal composed of cerium lanthanum and the remainder being the other lanthanides that is used widely for lighter flints Usually iron is added to form the alloy ferrocerium also invented by von Welsbach Due to the chemical similarities of the lanthanides chemical separation is not usually required for their applications such as the addition of mischmetal to steel as an inclusion modifier to improve mechanical properties or as catalysts for the cracking of petroleum This property of cerium saved the life of writer Primo Levi at the Auschwitz concentration camp when he found a supply of ferrocerium alloy and bartered it for food br br br Pigments and phosphors br The photostability of pigments can be enhanced by the addition of cerium as it provides pigments with lightfastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight An example of a cerium compound used on its own as an inorganic pigment is the vivid red cerium III sulfide cerium sulfide red which stays chemically inert up to very high temperatures The pigment is a safer alternative to lightfast but toxic cadmium selenide based pigments The addition of cerium oxide to older cathode ray tube television glass plates was beneficial as it suppresses the darkening effect from the creation of F center defects due to the continuous electron bombardment during operation Cerium is also an essential component as a dopant for phosphors used in CRT TV screens fluorescent lamps and later white light emitting diodes The most commonly used example is cerium III doped yttrium aluminium garnet Ce YAG which emits green to yellow green light nm and also behaves as a scintillator br br br Other uses br Cerium salts such as the sulfides Ce S and Ce S were considered during the Manhattan Project as advanced refractory materials for the construction of crucibles which could withstand the high temperatures and strongly reducing conditions when casting plutonium metal Despite desirable properties these sulfides were never widely adopted due to practical issues with their synthesis Cerium is used as alloying element in aluminium to create castable eutectic aluminium alloys with wt Ce to which other elements such as Mg Ni Fe and Mn can be added These Al Ce alloys have excellent high temperature strength and are suitable for automotive applications e g in cylinder heads Other alloys of cerium include Pu Ce and Pu Ce Co plutonium alloys which have been used as nuclear fuel br Other automotive applications for the lower sesquioxide are as a catalytic converter for the oxidation of CO and NOx emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles br br br Biological role and precautions br br The early lanthanides have been found to be essential to some methanotrophic bacteria living in volcanic mudpots such as Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum lanthanum cerium praseodymium and neodymium are about equally effective Cerium is otherwise not known to have biological role in any other organisms but is not very toxic either it does not accumulate in the food chain to any appreciable extent Because it often occurs together with calcium in phosphate minerals and bones are primarily calcium phosphate cerium can accumulate in bones in small amounts that are not considered dangerous br Cerium nitrate is an effective topical antimicrobial treatment for third degree burns although large doses can lead to cerium poisoning and methemoglobinemia The early lanthanides act as essential cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV for which lanthanum cerium praseodymium and neodymium alone are about equally effective br Like all rare earth metals cerium is of low to moderate toxicity A strong reducing agent it ignites spontaneously in air at to C Fumes from cerium fires are toxic Water should not be used to stop cerium fires as cerium reacts with water to produce hydrogen gas Workers exposed to cerium have experienced itching sensitivity to heat and skin lesions Cerium is not toxic when eaten but animals injected with large doses of cerium have died due to cardiovascular collapse Cerium is more dangerous to aquatic organisms because it damages cell membranes this is an important risk because it is not very soluble in water thus causing contamination of the environment br br br br br br Bibliography br Greenwood Norman N Earnshaw Alan Chemistry of the Elements nd ed Butterworth Heinemann ISBN
