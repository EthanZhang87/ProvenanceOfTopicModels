id: 238528
Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula NO One of several nitrogen oxides nitrogen dioxide is a reddish brown gas It is a paramagnetic bent molecule with C v point group symmetry Industrially NO is an intermediate in the synthesis of nitric acid millions of tons of which are produced each year primarily for the production of fertilizers br Nitrogen dioxide is poisonous and can be fatal if inhaled in large quantities Cooking with a gas stove produces nitrogen dioxide which causes poorer indoor air quality Combustion of gas can lead to increased concentrations of nitrogen dioxide throughout the home environment which is linked to respiratory issues and diseases The LC median lethal dose for humans has been estimated to be ppm for a hour exposure It is also included in the NOx family of atmospheric pollutants br br br Properties br Nitrogen dioxide is a reddish brown gas with a pungent acrid odor above C F K and becomes a yellowish brown liquid below C F K It forms an equilibrium with its dimer dinitrogen tetroxide N O and converts almost entirely to N O below C F K br The bond length between the nitrogen atom and the oxygen atom is pm This bond length is consistent with a bond order between one and two br Unlike ozone O the ground electronic state of nitrogen dioxide is a doublet state since nitrogen has one unpaired electron which decreases the alpha effect compared with nitrite and creates a weak bonding interaction with the oxygen lone pairs The lone electron in NO also means that this compound is a free radical so the formula for nitrogen dioxide is often written as NO br The reddish brown color is a consequence of preferential absorption of light in the blue region of the spectrum nm although the absorption extends throughout the visible at shorter wavelengths and into the infrared at longer wavelengths Absorption of light at wavelengths shorter than about nm results in photolysis to form NO O atomic oxygen in the atmosphere the addition of the oxygen atom so formed to O results in ozone br br br Preparation br br Industrially nitrogen dioxide is produced and transported as its cryogenic liquid dimer dinitrogen tetroxide It is produced industrially by the oxidation of ammonia the Ostwald Process This reaction is the first step in the production of nitric acid br br NH O NO H O br It can also be produced by the oxidation of nitrosyl chloride br br NOCl O NO Cl br Instead most laboratory syntheses stabilize and then heat the nitric acid to accelerate the decomposition For example the thermal decomposition of some metal nitrates generates NO br br Pb NO PbO NO O br Alternatively dehydration of nitric acid produces nitronium nitrate br br HNO N O H O br HNO P O N O H PO br which subsequently undergoes thermal decomposition br br N O NO O br NO is generated by the reduction of concentrated nitric acid with a metal such as copper br br HNO Cu Cu NO NO H O br br br Selected reactions br Nitric acid decomposes slowly to nitrogen dioxide by the overall reaction br br HNO NO H O O br The nitrogen dioxide so formed confers the characteristic yellow color often exhibited by this acid However the reaction is too slow to be a practical source of NO br br br Thermal properties br At low temperatures NO reversibly converts to the colourless gas dinitrogen tetroxide N O br br NO N O br The exothermic equilibrium has enthalpy change H kJ mol br At C F K NO decomposes with release of oxygen via an endothermic process H kJ mol br br NO NO O br br br As an oxidizer br As suggested by the weakness of the N O bond NO is a good oxidizer Consequently it will combust sometimes explosively in the presence of hydrocarbons br br br Hydrolysis br NO reacts with water to give nitric acid and nitrous acid br br NO H O HNO HNO br This reaction is one of the steps in the Ostwald process for the industrial production of nitric acid from ammonia This reaction is negligibly slow at low concentrations of NO characteristic of the ambient atmosphere although it does proceed upon NO uptake to surfaces Such surface reaction is thought to produce gaseous HNO often written as HONO in outdoor and indoor environments br br br Conversion to nitrates br NO is used to generate anhydrous metal nitrates from the oxides br br MO NO M NO NO br Alkyl and metal iodides give the corresponding nitrates br br TiI NO Ti NO NO I br br br With organic compounds br The reactiivity of nitrogen dioxide toward organic compounds has long been known For example it reacts with amides to give N nitroso derivatives It is used for nitrations under anhydrous conditions br br br Uses br NO is used as an intermediate in the manufacturing of nitric acid as a nitrating agent in the manufacturing of chemical explosives as a polymerization inhibitor for acrylates as a flour bleaching agent and as a room temperature sterilization agent It is also used as an oxidizer in rocket fuel for example in red fuming nitric acid it was used in the Titan rockets to launch Project Gemini in the maneuvering thrusters of the Space Shuttle and in uncrewed space probes sent to various planets br br br Environmental presence br br Nitrogen dioxide typically arises via the oxidation of nitric oxide by oxygen in air e g as result of corona discharge br br NO O NO br NO is introduced into the environment by natural causes including entry from the stratosphere bacterial respiration volcanos and lightning These sources make NO a trace gas in the atmosphere of Earth where it plays a role in absorbing sunlight and regulating the chemistry of the troposphere especially in determining ozone concentrations br br br Anthropogenic sources br br Nitrogen dioxide also forms in most combustion processes At elevated temperatures nitrogen combines with oxygen to form nitrogen dioxide br br N O NO br For the general public the most prominent sources of NO are internal combustion engines as combustion temperatures are high enough to thermally combine some of the nitrogen and oxygen in the air to form NO br br Outdoors NO can be a result of traffic from motor vehicles Indoors exposure arises from cigarette smoke and butane and kerosene heaters and stoves Indoor exposure levels of NO are on average at least three times higher in homes with gas stoves compared to electric stove Workers in industries where NO is used are also exposed and are at risk for occupational lung diseases and NIOSH has set exposure limits and safety standards Workers in high voltage areas especially those with spark or plasma creation are at risk Agricultural workers can be exposed to NO arising from grain decomposing in silos chronic exposure can lead to lung damage in a condition called silo filler s disease br br br Toxicity br br NO diffuses into the epithelial lining fluid ELF of the respiratory epithelium and dissolves There it chemically reacts with antioxidant and lipid molecules in the ELF The health effects of NO are caused by the reaction products or their metabolites which are reactive nitrogen species and reactive oxygen species that can drive bronchoconstriction inflammation reduced immune response and may have effects on the heart br br br Acute exposure br Acute harm due to NO exposure is rare ppm can cause mild irritation of the nose and throat ppm can cause edema leading to bronchitis or pneumonia and levels above ppm can cause death due to asphyxiation from fluid in the lungs There are often no symptoms at the time of exposure other than transient cough fatigue or nausea but over hours inflammation in the lungs causes edema br For skin or eye exposure the affected area is flushed with saline For inhalation oxygen is administered bronchodilators may be administered and if there are signs of methemoglobinemia a condition that arises when nitrogen based compounds affect the hemoglobin in red blood cells methylene blue may be administered br It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section of the U S Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act U S C and it is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce store or use it in significant quantities br br br Long term br br Exposure to low levels of NO over time can cause changes in lung function Cooking with a gas stove is associated with poorer indoor air quality Combustion of gas can lead to increased concentrations of nitrogen dioxide throughout the home environment which is linked to respiratory issues and diseases Children exposed to NO are more likely to be admitted to hospital with asthma br br br Environmental effects br Interaction of NO and other NOx with water oxygen and other chemicals in the atmosphere can form acid rain which harms sensitive ecosystems such as lakes and forests Elevated levels of NO can also harm vegetation decreasing growth and reduce crop yields br br br See also br
