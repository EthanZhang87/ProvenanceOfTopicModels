title: Firing order
id: 1424999
The firing order of an internal combustion engine is the sequence of ignition for the cylinders br In a spark ignition e g gasoline petrol engine the firing order corresponds to the order in which the spark plugs are operated In a diesel engine the firing order corresponds to the order in which fuel is injected into each cylinder Four stroke engines must also time the valve openings relative to the firing order as the valves do not open and close on every stroke br Firing order affects the vibration sound and evenness of power output from the engine and heavily influences crankshaft design br br br Cylinder numbering br br br Numbering systems for car engines br The numbering system for cylinders is generally based on the cylinder numbers increasing from the front to the rear of an engine See engine orientation below However there are differences between manufacturers in how this is applied some commonly used systems are as listed below br br br Straight engine br In a straight engine the cylinders are numbered from front cylinder to rear br br br V engine br br In a V engine the frontmost cylinder is usually however there are two common approaches br br Numbering the cylinders in each bank sequentially e g along the left bank and along the right bank This approach is typically used by V engines from Audi Ford and Porsche br Numbering the cylinders based on their position along the crankshaft e g along the right bank and along the left bank This approach is typically used by V engines from General Motors and Chrysler br The selection of whether the cylinder is on the left bank or right bank usually depends on which bank is closer to the front of the crankshaft However the Ford Flathead V and Pontiac V engine actually have the cylinder behind the cylinder from the opposite bank This was done so that all Ford engines would have cylinder on the right bank and all Pontiac engines would have cylinder on the left bank to simplify the process of identifying the cylinders br br br Radial engine br In a radial engine the cylinders are numbered around the circle in clockwise direction with the cylinder at the top br br br Engine orientation within cars br The simplest situation is a longitudinal engine located at the front of the car which means the engine s orientation is the same as the car s This illustrates that the rear of the engine is the end that connects to the transmission while the front end often has the drive belt for accessories such as the alternator and water pump The left bank of the engine is on the left side of the car when looking from behind the car and vice versa for the right bank of the engine br For a transverse engine located at the front of the car whether the front of the engine is at the left hand or right hand side of the car is best determined based on the side of the car where the transmission is located which corresponds to the rear of the engine Most transverse engine front wheel drive models have the front of the engine at the right hand side of the car except for many Honda cars As a consequence the left bank of a transversely V engine is usually closest to the front of the car br For cars where the engine is installed backwards i e the transmission is closer to the front of the car than the engine or under the engine cylinder is located towards the firewall the rear of the car This is the case for the Citro n Traction Avant Saab Saab and many rear engine cars br br br Numbering systems for ship engines br Contrary to most car engines a ship s engines are often numbered starting from the end of the engine with the power output Large diesel truck and locomotive engines particularly of European manufacture may also be numbered this way br Cylinders on V engines often include a letter representing the cylinder bank For example a V engine could have cylinders A A A B B B with cylinders A and B located at the power output end of the engine br br br Common firing orders br br Common firing orders are listed below For V engines and flat engines the numbering system is L for the front cylinder of the left bank R for the front cylinder of the right bank etc br br In two cylinder engines the cylinders can either fire simultaneously such as in a flat twin engine or one after the other such as in a straight twin engine where either an even fire or an odd fire configuration is possible for a four stroke engine br In straight three engines there is no effective difference between the possible firing orders of and br Straight four engines typically use a firing order of however some British engines used a firing order of br Flat four engines typically use a firing order of R R L L br Straight five engines typically use a firing order of in order to minimise the primary vibration from the rocking couple br Straight six engines typically use a firing order of which results in perfect primary and secondary balance However a firing order of is common on medium speed marine engines br V engines with an angle of degrees between the cylinder banks have used a firing orders of R L R L L R or R L R L R L Several V engines with an angle of degrees have used a firing order of R L R L R L br Flat six engines have used firing orders of R L R L R L or R L R L R L br V engines use various different firing orders even using different firing orders between engines from the same manufacturer br V engines used firing orders of either R L R L R L R L R L or R L R L R L R L R L br V engines use various different firing orders br In a radial engine there are always an odd number of cylinders in each bank as this allows for a constant alternate cylinder firing order for example with a single bank of cylinders the order would be Moreover unless there is an odd number of cylinders the ring cam around the nose of the engine would be unable to provide the inlet valve open exhaust valve open sequence required by the four stroke cycle br br br Firing interval br To minimise vibrations most engines use an evenly spaced firing interval This means that the timing of the power stroke is evenly spaced between cylinders For a four stroke engine this requires a firing interval of divided by the number of cylinders for example a six cylinder engine would have a firing interval of On the other hand a six cylinder engine with an uneven firing interval could have intervals of and br Engines with an even firing interval will sound smoother have less vibration and provide more even pressure pulses in the exhaust gas to the turbocharger Engines with an uneven firing interval usually have a burble or a throaty growling engine sound and more vibrations br The main application of uneven firing intervals is motorcycle engines such as big bang firing order engines Examples of odd firing engines are most four stroke V twin engines Buick V engine present Yamaha VMAX present Honda VFR Dodge Viper V present Audi Lamborghini V v FSI Aston Martin V and the Yamaha R inline four engine with a crossplane crankshaft br br br See also br Engine configuration br Four stroke engine br Two stroke engine br Wasted spark system br br br
