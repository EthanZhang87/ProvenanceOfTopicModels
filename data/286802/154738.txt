Hydrogen sulfide is a chemical compound with the formula H S It is a colorless chalcogen hydride gas and is poisonous corrosive and flammable with trace amounts in ambient atmosphere having a characteristic foul odor of rotten eggs Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele is credited with having discovered the chemical composition of purified hydrogen sulfide in br Hydrogen sulfide is toxic to humans and most other animals by inhibiting cellular respiration in a manner similar to hydrogen cyanide When it is inhaled or its salts are ingested in high amounts damage to organs occurs rapidly with symptoms ranging from breathing difficulties to convulsions and death Despite this the human body produces small amounts of this sulfide and its mineral salts and uses it as a signalling molecule br Hydrogen sulfide is often produced from the microbial breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen such as in swamps and sewers this process is commonly known as anaerobic digestion which is done by sulfate reducing microorganisms It also occurs in volcanic gases natural gas deposits and sometimes in well drawn water br br br Properties br Hydrogen sulfide is slightly denser than air A mixture of H S and air can be explosive br br br Oxidation br In general hydrogen sulfide acts as a reducing agent as indicated by its ability to reduce sulfur dioxide in the Claus process Hydrogen sulfide burns in oxygen with a blue flame to form sulfur dioxide SO and water br br H S O SO H O br If an excess of oxygen is present sulfur trioxide SO is formed which quickly hydrates to sulfuric acid br br H S O H SO br br br Acid base properties br It is slightly soluble in water and acts as a weak acid pKa in mol litre solutions at C giving the hydrosulfide ion HS Hydrogen sulfide and its solutions are colorless When exposed to air it slowly oxidizes to form elemental sulfur which is not soluble in water The sulfide anion S is not formed in aqueous solution br br br Extreme temperatures and pressures br At pressures above GPa gigapascal hydrogen sulfide becomes a metallic conductor of electricity When cooled below a critical temperature this high pressure phase exhibits superconductivity The critical temperature increases with pressure ranging from K at GPa to K at GPa If hydrogen sulfide is pressurized at higher temperatures then cooled the critical temperature reaches K C the highest accepted superconducting critical temperature as of By substituting a small part of sulfur with phosphorus and using even higher pressures it has been predicted that it may be possible to raise the critical temperature to above C K and achieve room temperature superconductivity br Hydrogen sulfide decomposes without a presence of a catalyst under atmospheric pressure around C into hydrogen and sulfur br br br Tarnishing br Hydrogen sulfide reacts with metal ions to form metal sulfides which are insoluble often dark colored solids Lead II acetate paper is used to detect hydrogen sulfide because it readily converts to lead II sulfide which is black Treating metal sulfides with strong acid or electrolysis often liberates hydrogen sulfide Hydrogen sulfide is also responsible for tarnishing on various metals including copper and silver the chemical responsible for black toning found on silver coins is silver sulfide Ag S which is produced when the silver on the surface of the coin reacts with atmospheric hydrogen sulfide Coins that have been subject to toning by hydrogen sulfide and other sulfur containing compounds may have the toning add to the numismatic value of a coin based on aesthetics as the toning may produce thin film interference resulting in the coin taking on an attractive coloration Coins can also be intentionally treated with hydrogen sulfide to induce toning though artificial toning can be distinguished from natural toning and is generally criticised among collectors br br br Production br Hydrogen sulfide is most commonly obtained by its separation from sour gas which is natural gas with a high content of H S It can also be produced by treating hydrogen with molten elemental sulfur at about C Hydrocarbons can serve as a source of hydrogen in this process br br S H H S br The very favorable thermodynamics for the hydrogenation of sulfur implies that the dehydrogenation or cracking of hydrogen sulfide would require very high temperatures br A standard lab preparation is to treat ferrous sulfide with a strong acid in a Kipp generator br br FeS HCl FeCl H S br For use in qualitative inorganic analysis thioacetamide is used to generate H S br br CH C S NH H O CH C O NH H S br Many metal and nonmetal sulfides e g aluminium sulfide phosphorus pentasulfide silicon disulfide liberate hydrogen sulfide upon exposure to water br br H O Al S H S Al OH br This gas is also produced by heating sulfur with solid organic compounds and by reducing sulfurated organic compounds with hydrogen br It can also be produced by mixing ammonium thiocyanate to concentrated sulphuric acid and adding water to it br br br Biosynthesis br Hydrogen sulfide can be generated in cells via enzymatic or non enzymatic pathways Three enzymes catalyze formation of H S cystathionine lyase CSE cystathionine synthetase CBS and mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase MST CBS and CSE are the main proponents of H S biogenesis which follows the trans sulfuration pathway These enzymes have been identified in a breadth of biological cells and tissues and their activity is induced by a number of disease states These enzymes are characterized by the transfer of a sulfur atom from methionine to serine to form a cysteine molecule MST also contributes to hydrogen sulfide production by way of the cysteine catabolic pathway Dietary amino acids such as methionine and cysteine serve as the primary substrates for the transulfuration pathways and in the production of hydrogen sulfide Hydrogen sulfide can also be derived from proteins such as ferredoxins and Rieske proteins br Sulfate reducing resp sulfur reducing bacteria generate usable energy under low oxygen conditions by using sulfates resp elemental sulfur to oxidize organic compounds or hydrogen this produces hydrogen sulfide as a waste product br Water heaters can aid the conversion of sulfate in water to hydrogen sulfide gas This is due to providing a warm environment sustainable for sulfur bacteria and maintaining the reaction which interacts between sulfate in the water and the water heater anode which is usually made from magnesium metal br br br Signalling role br H S in the body acts as a gaseous signaling molecule with implications for health and in diseases br Hydrogen sulfide is involved in vasodilation in animals as well as in increasing seed germination and stress responses in plants Hydrogen sulfide signaling is moderated by reactive oxygen species ROS and reactive nitrogen species RNS H S has been shown to interact with NO resulting in several different cellular effects as well as the formation of another signal called nitrosothiol Hydrogen sulfide is also known to increase the levels of glutathione which acts to reduce or disrupt ROS levels in cells br The field of H S biology has advanced from environmental toxicology to investigate the roles of endogenously produced H S in physiological conditions and in various pathophysiological states H S has been implicated in cancer and Down syndrome and vascular disease br It inhibits Complex IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chain which effectively reduces ATP generation and biochemical activity within cells br br br Uses br br br Production of sulfur br Hydrogen sulfide is mainly consumed as a precursor to elemental sulfur This conversion called the Claus process involves partial oxidation to sulfur dioxide The latter reacts with hydrogen sulfide to give elemental sulfur The conversion is catalyzed by alumina br br H S SO S H O br br br Production of thioorganic compounds br Many fundamental organosulfur compounds are produced using hydrogen sulfide These include methanethiol ethanethiol and thioglycolic acid Hydrosulfides can be used in the production of thiophenol br br br Production of metal sulfides br Upon combining with alkali metal bases hydrogen sulfide converts to alkali hydrosulfides such as sodium hydrosulfide and sodium sulfide br br H S NaOH NaSH H O br NaSH NaOH Na S H O br Sodium sulfides are used in the paper making industry Specifically salts of SH break bonds between lignin and cellulose components of pulp in the Kraft process br As indicated above many metal ions react with hydrogen sulfide to give the corresponding metal sulfides Oxidic ores are sometimes treated with hydrogen sulfide to give the corresponding metal sulfides which are more readily purified byy flotation Metal parts are sometimes passivated with hydrogen sulfide Catalysts used in hydrodesulfurization are routinely activated with hydrogen sulfide br Hydrogen sulfide was a reagent in the qualitative inorganic analysis of metal ions In these analyses heavy metal and nonmetal ions e g Pb II Cu II Hg II As III are precipitated from solution upon exposure to H S The components of the resulting solid are then identified by their reactivity br br br Miscellaneous applications br Hydrogen sulfide is used to separate deuterium oxide or heavy water from normal water via the Girdler sulfide process br A suspended animation like state has been induced in rodents with the use of hydrogen sulfide resulting in hypothermia with a concomitant reduction in metabolic rate Oxygen demand was also reduced thereby protecting against hypoxia In addition hydrogen sulfide has been shown to reduce inflammation in various situations br br br Occurrence br br Volcanoes and some hot springs as well as cold springs emit some H S Hydrogen sulfide can be present naturally in well water often as a result of the action of sulfate reducing bacteria Hydrogen sulfide is produced by the human body in small quantities through bacterial breakdown of proteins containing sulfur in the intestinal tract therefore it contributes to the characteristic odor of flatulence It is also produced in the mouth halitosis br A portion of global H S emissions are due to human activity By far the largest industrial source of H S is petroleum refineries The hydrodesulfurization process liberates sulfur from petroleum by the action of hydrogen The resulting H S is converted to elemental sulfur by partial combustion via the Claus process which is a major source of elemental sulfur Other anthropogenic sources of hydrogen sulfide include coke ovens paper mills using the Kraft process tanneries and sewerage H S arises from virtually anywhere where elemental sulfur comes in contact with organic material especially at high temperatures Depending on environmental conditions it is responsible for deterioration of material through the action of some sulfur oxidizing microorganisms It is called biogenic sulfide corrosion br In it was reported that increased concentrations of H S were observed in the Bakken formation crude possibly due to oil field practices and presented challenges such as health and environmental risks corrosion of wellbore added expense with regard to materials handling and pipeline equipment and additional refinement requirements br Besides living near gas and oil drilling operations ordinary citizens can be exposed to hydrogen sulfide by being near waste water treatment facilities landfills and farms with manure storage Exposure occurs through breathing contaminated air or drinking contaminated water br In municipal waste landfill sites the burial of organic material rapidly leads to the production of anaerobic digestion within the waste mass and with the humid atmosphere and relatively high temperature that accompanies biodegradation biogas is produced as soon as the air within the waste mass has been reduced If there is a source of sulfate bearing material such as plasterboard or natural gypsum calcium sulfate dihydrate under anaerobic conditions sulfate reducing bacteria converts this to hydrogen sulfide These bacteria cannot survive in air but the moist warm anaerobic conditions of buried waste that contains a high source of carbon in inert landfills paper and glue used in the fabrication of products such as plasterboard can provide a rich source of carbon is an excellent environment for the formation of hydrogen sulfide br In industrial anaerobic digestion processes such as waste water treatment or the digestion of organic waste from agriculture hydrogen sulfide can be formed from the reduction of sulfate and the degradation of amino acids and proteins within organic compounds Sulfates are relatively non inhibitory to methane forming bacteria but can be reduced to H S by sulfate reducing bacteria of which there are several genera br br br Removal from water br A number of processes have been designed to remove hydrogen sulfide from drinking water br br Continuous chlorination br For levels up to mg L chlorine is used in the purification process as an oxidizing chemical to react with hydrogen sulfide This reaction yields insoluble solid sulfur Usually the chlorine used is in the form of sodium hypochlorite br Aeration br For concentrations of hydrogen sulfide less than mg L aeration is an ideal treatment process Oxygen is added to water and a reaction between oxygen and hydrogen sulfide react to produce odorless sulfate br Nitrate addition br Calcium nitrate can be used to prevent hydrogen sulfide formation in wastewater streams br br br Removal from fuel gases br Hydrogen sulfide is commonly found in raw natural gas and biogas It is typically removed by amine gas treating technologies In such processes the hydrogen sulfide is first converted to an ammonium salt whereas the natural gas is unaffected br br RNH H S RNH SH br The bisulfide anion is subsequently regenerated by heating of the amine sulfide solution Hydrogen sulfide generated in this process is typically converted to elemental sulfur using the Claus Process br br br Safety br The underground mine gas term for foul smelling hydrogen sulfide rich gas mixtures is stinkdamp Hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic and flammable gas flammable range It can poison several systems in the body although the nervous system is most affected The toxicity of H S is comparable with that of carbon monoxide It binds with iron in the mitochondrial cytochrome enzymes thus preventing cellular respiration Its toxic properties were described in detail in by Justus von Liebig br Even before hydrogen sulfide was discovered Italian physician Bernardino Ramazzini hypothesized in his book De Morbis Artificum Diatriba that occupational diseases of sewer workers and blackening of coins in their clothes may be caused by an unknown invisible volatile acid moreover in late th century toxic gas emanation from Paris sewers became a problem for the citizens and authorities br Although very pungent at first it smells like rotten eggs it quickly deadens the sense of smell creating temporary anosmia so victims may be unaware of its presence until it is too late Safe handling procedures are provided by its safety data sheet SDS br br br Low level exposure br Since hydrogen sulfide occurs naturally in the body the environment and the gut enzymes exist to metabolize it At some threshold level believed to average around ppm the oxidative enzymes become overwhelmed Many personal safety gas detectors such as those used by utility sewage and petrochemical workers are set to alarm at as low as to ppm and to go into high alarm at ppm Metabolism causes oxidation to sulfate which is harmless Hence low levels of hydrogen sulfide may be tolerated indefinitely br Exposure to lower concentrations can result in eye irritation a sore throat and cough nausea shortness of breath and fluid in the lungs These effects are believed to be due to hydrogen sulfide combining with alkali present in moist surface tissues to form sodium sulfide a caustic These symptoms usually subside in a few weeks br Long term low level exposure may result in fatigue loss of appetite headaches irritability poor memory and dizziness Chronic exposure to low level H S around ppm has been implicated in increased miscarriage and reproductive health issues among Russian and Finnish wood pulp workers but the reports have not as of been replicated br br br High level exposure br Short term high level exposure can induce immediate collapse with loss of breathing and a high probability of death If death does not occur high exposure to hydrogen sulfide can lead to cortical pseudolaminar necrosis degeneration of the basal ganglia and cerebral edema Although respiratory paralysis may be immediate it can also be delayed up to hours Diagnostic of extreme poisoning by H S is the discolouration of copper coins in the pockets of the victim br Inhalation of H S resulted in about workplace deaths per year in the U S data second only to carbon monoxide deaths per year for workplace chemical inhalation deaths br br br Exposure thresholds br Exposure limits stipulated by the United States government br ppm REL Ceiling NIOSH recommended permissible exposure ceiling the recommended level that must not be exceeded except once for min in an hour shift if no other measurable exposure occurs br ppm PEL Ceiling OSHA permissible exposure ceiling the level that must not be exceeded except once for min in an hour shift if no other measurable exposure occurs br ppm PEL Peak OSHA peak permissible exposure the level that must never be exceeded br ppm IDLH NIOSH immediately dangerous to life and health the level that interferes with the ability to escape br ppm or ppb is the odor threshold the point at which of a human panel can detect the presence of an odor without being able to identify it br ppm is the borderline concentration for eye irritation br ppm leads to eye damage br At ppm the olfactory nerve is paralyzed after a few inhalations and the sense of smell disappears often together with awareness of danger br ppm leads to pulmonary edema with the possibility of death br ppm causes strong stimulation of the central nervous system and rapid breathing leading to loss of breathing br ppm is the lethal concentration for of humans for minutes exposure LC br Concentrations over ppm cause immediate collapse with loss of breathing even after inhalation of a single breath br br br Treatment br Treatment involves immediate inhalation of amyl nitrite injections of sodium nitrite or administration of dimethylaminophenol in combination with inhalation of pure oxygen administration of bronchodilators to overcome eventual bronchospasm and in some cases hyperbaric oxygen therapy HBOT HBOT has clinical and anecdotal support br br br Incidents br Hydrogen sulfide was used by the British Army as a chemical weapon during World War I It was not considered to be an ideal war gas partially due to its flammability and because the distinctive smell could be detected from even a small leak alerting the enemy to the presence of the gas It was nevertheless used on two occasions in when other gases were in short supply br On September a leak in the propeller room of a Royal Caribbean Cruise Liner docked in Los Angeles resulted in the deaths of crewmen due to a sewage line leak As a result all such compartments are now required to have a ventilation system br A dump of toxic waste containing hydrogen sulfide is believed to have caused deaths and thousands of illnesses in Abidjan on the West African coast in the C te d Ivoire toxic waste dump br In September three workers were killed and two suffered serious injury including long term brain damage at a mushroom growing company in Langley British Columbia A valve to a pipe that carried chicken manure straw and gypsum to the compost fuel for the mushroom growing operation became clogged and as workers unclogged the valve in a confined space without proper ventilation the hydrogen sulfide that had built up due to anaerobic decomposition of the material was released poisoning the workers in the surrounding area An investigator said there could have been more fatalities if the pipe had been fully cleared and or if the wind had changed directions br In levels of hydrogen sulfide as high as ppm were detected at a recently built mall in Thailand called Siam Square One at the Siam Square area Shop tenants at the mall reported health complications such as sinus inflammation breathing difficulties and eye irritation After investigation it was determined that the large amount of gas originated from imperfect treatment and disposal of waste water in the building br In hydrogen sulfide gas killed workers at the Promenade shopping center in North Scottsdale Arizona USA after climbing into ft deep chamber without wearing personal protective gear Arriving crews recorded high levels of hydrogen cyanide and hydrogen sulfide coming out of the sewer br In November a substantial amount of hydrogen sulfide gas shrouded the central eastern and southeastern parts of Moscow Residents living in the area were urged to stay indoors by the emergencies ministry Although the exact source of the gas was not known blame had been placed on a Moscow oil refinery br In June a mother and her daughter were found dead in their still running Porsche Cayenne SUV against a guardrail on Florida s Turnpike initially thought to be victims of carbon monoxide poisoning Their deaths remained unexplained as the medical examiner waited for results of toxicology tests on the victims until urine tests revealed that hydrogen sulfide was the cause of death A report from the Orange Osceola Medical Examiner s Office indicated that toxic fumes came from the Porsche s starter battery located under the front passenger seat br In January three utility workers in Key Largo Florida died one by one within seconds of descending into a narrow space beneath a manhole cover to check a section of paved street In an attempt to save the men a firefighter who entered the hole without his air tank because he could not fit through the hole with it collapsed within seconds and had to be rescued by a colleague The firefighter was airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital and later recovered A Monroe County Sheriff officer initially determined that the space contained hydrogen sulfide and methane gas produced by decomposing vegetation br On May two workers were killed another seriously injured and others hospitalized by hydrogen sulfide inhalation at a Norske Skog paper mill in Albury New South Wales An investigation by SafeWork NSW found that the gas was released from a tank used to hold process water The workers were exposed at the end of a day maintenance period Hydrogen sulfide had built up in an upstream tank which had been left stagnant and untreated with biocide during the maintenance period These conditions allowed sulfate reducing bacteria to grow in the upstream tank as the water contained small quantities of wood pulp and fiber The high rate of pumping from this tank into the tank involved in the incident caused hydrogen sulfide gas to escape from various openings around its top when pumping was resumed at the end of the maintenance period The area above it was sufficiently enclosed for the gas to pool there despite not being identified as a confined space by Norske Skog One of the workers who was killed was exposed while investigating an apparent fluid leak in the tank while the other who was killed and the worker who was badly injured were attempting to rescue the first after he collapsed on top of it In a resulting criminal case Norske Skog was accused of failing to ensure the health and safety of its workforce at the plant to a reasonably practicable extent It pleaded guilty and was fined AU and ordered to fund the production of an anonymized educational video about the incident br In October an Odessa Texas employee of Aghorn Operating Inc and his wife were killed due to a water pump failure Produced water with a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide was released by the pump The worker died while responding to an automated phone call he had received alerting him to a mechanical failure in the pump while his wife died after driving to the facility to check on him A CSB investigation cited lax safety practices at the facility such as an informal lockout tagout procedure and a nonfunctioning hydrogen sulfide alert system br br br Suicides br The gas produced by mixing certain household ingredients was used in a suicide wave in in Japan The wave prompted staff at Tokyo s suicide prevention center to set up a special hotline during Golden Week as they received an increase in calls from people wanting to kill themselves during the annual May holiday br As of this phenomenon has occurred in a number of US cities prompting warnings to those arriving at the site of the suicide These first responders such as emergency services workers or family members are at risk of death or injury from inhaling the gas or by fire Local governments have also initiated campaigns to prevent such suicides br In H S ingestion was used as a suicide method by Japanese pro wrestler Hana Kimura br br br Hydrogen sulfide in the natural environment br br br Microbial The sulfur cycle br br Hydrogen sulfide is a central participant in the sulfur cycle the biogeochemical cycle of sulfur on Earth br In the absence of oxygen sulfur reducing and sulfate reducing bacteria derive energy from oxidizing hydrogen or organic molecules by reducing elemental sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide Other bacteria liberate hydrogen sulfide from sulfur containing amino acids this gives rise to the odor of rotten eggs and contributes to the odor of flatulence br As organic matter decays under low oxygen or hypoxic conditions such as in swamps eutrophic lakes or dead zones of oceans sulfate reducing bacteria will use the sulfates present in the water to oxidize the organic matter producing hydrogen sulfide as waste Some of the hydrogen sulfide will react with metal ions in the water to produce metal sulfides which are not water soluble These metal sulfides such as ferrous sulfide FeS are often black or brown leading to the dark color of sludge br Several groups of bacteria can use hydrogen sulfide as fuel oxidizing it to elemental sulfur or to sulfate by using dissolved oxygen metal oxides e g iron oxyhydroxides and manganese oxides or nitrate as electron acceptors br The purple sulfur bacteria and the green sulfur bacteria use hydrogen sulfide as an electron donor in photosynthesis thereby producing elemental sulfur This mode of photosynthesis is older than the mode of cyanobacteria algae and plants which uses water as electron donor and liberates oxygen br The biochemistry of hydrogen sulfide is a key part of the chemistry of the iron sulfur world In this model of the origin of life on Earth geologically produced hydrogen sulfide is postulated as an electron donor driving the reduction of carbon dioxide br br br Animals br Hydrogen sulfide is lethal to most animals but a few highly specialized species extremophiles do thrive in habitats that are rich in this compound br In the deep sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps with high levels of hydrogen sulfide are home to a number of extremely specialized lifeforms ranging from bacteria to fish Because of the absence of sunlight at these depths these ecosystems rely on chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis br Freshwater springs rich in hydrogen sulfide are mainly home to invertebrates but also include a small number of fish Cyprinodon bobmilleri a pupfish from Mexico Limia sulphurophila a poeciliid from the Dominican Republic Gambusia eurystoma a poeciliid from Mexico and a few Poecilia poeciliids from Mexico Invertebrates and microorganisms in some cave systems such as Movile Cave are adapted to high levels of hydrogen sulfide br br br Interstellar and planetary occurrence br Hydrogen sulfide has often been detected in the interstellar medium It also occurs in the clouds of planets in our solar system br br br Mass extinctions br br Hydrogen sulfide has been implicated in several mass extinctions that have occurred in the Earth s past In particular a buildup of hydrogen sulfide in the atmosphere may have caused or at least contributed to the Permian Triassic extinction event million years ago br Organic residues from these extinction boundaries indicate that the oceans were anoxic oxygen depleted and had species of shallow plankton that metabolized H S The formation of H S may have been initiated by massive volcanic eruptions which emitted carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere which warmed the oceans lowering their capacity to absorb oxygen that would otherwise oxidize H S The increased levels of hydrogen sulfide could have killed oxygen generating plants as well as depleted the ozone layer causing further stress Small H S blooms have been detected in modern times in the Dead Sea and in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Namibia br br br See also br Hydrogen chalcogenide any binary compound of hydrogen with chalcogens including hydrogen polychalcogenidesPages displaying wikidata
