Carbon monoxide chemical formula CO is a poisonous flammable gas that is colorless odorless tasteless and slightly less dense than air Carbon monoxide consists of one carbon atom and one oxygen atom connected by a triple bond It is the simplest carbon oxide In coordination complexes the carbon monoxide ligand is called carbonyl It is a key ingredient in many processes in industrial chemistry br The most common source of carbon monoxide is the partial combustion of carbon containing compounds Numerous environmental and biological sources generate carbon monoxide In industry carbon monoxide is important in the production of many compounds including drugs fragrances and fuels Upon emission into the atmosphere carbon monoxide affects several processes that contribute to climate change br Indoors CO is one of the most acutely toxic contaminants affecting indoor air quality CO may be emitted from tobacco smoke and generated from malfunctioning fuel burning stoves wood kerosene natural gas propane and fuel burning heating systems wood oil natural gas and from blocked flues connected to these appliances Carbon monoxide poisoning is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries br Carbon monoxide has important biological roles across phylogenetic kingdoms It is produced by many organisms including humans In mammalian physiology carbon monoxide is a classical example of hormesis where low concentrations serve as an endogenous neurotransmitter gasotransmitter and high concentrations are toxic resulting in carbon monoxide poisoning It is isoelectronic with both cyanide anion CN and molecular nitrogen N br br br Physical and chemical properties br Carbon monoxide is the simplest oxocarbon and is isoelectronic with other triply bonded diatomic species possessing valence electrons including the cyanide anion the nitrosonium cation boron monofluoride and molecular nitrogen It has a molar mass of which according to the ideal gas law makes it slightly less dense than air whose average molar mass is br The carbon and oxygen are connected by a triple bond that consists of a net two pi bonds and one sigma bond The bond length between the carbon atom and the oxygen atom is pm This bond length is consistent with a triple bond as in molecular nitrogen N which has a similar bond length pm and nearly the same molecular mass Carbon oxygen double bonds are significantly longer pm in formaldehyde for example The boiling point K and melting point K are very similar to those of N K and K respectively The bond dissociation energy of kJ mol is stronger than that of N kJ mol and represents the strongest chemical bond known br The ground electronic state of carbon monoxide is a singlet state since there are no unpaired electrons br br br Bonding and dipole moment br Carbon and oxygen together have a total of electrons in the valence shell Following the octet rule for both carbon and oxygen the two atoms form a triple bond with six shared electrons in three bonding molecular orbitals rather than the usual double bond found in organic carbonyl compounds Since four of the shared electrons come from the oxygen atom and only two from carbon one bonding orbital is occupied by two electrons from oxygen forming a dative or dipolar bond This causes a C O polarization of the molecule with a small negative charge on carbon and a small positive charge on oxygen The other two bonding orbitals are each occupied by one electron from carbon and one from oxygen forming polar covalent bonds with a reverse C O polarization since oxygen is more electronegative than carbon In the free carbon monoxide molecule a net negative charge remains at the carbon end and the molecule has a small dipole moment of D br The molecule is therefore asymmetric oxygen has more electron density than carbon and is also slightly positively charged compared to carbon being negative By contrast the isoelectronic dinitrogen molecule has no dipole moment br br Carbon monoxide has a computed fractional bond order of indicating that the third bond is important but constitutes somewhat less than a full bond Thus in valence bond terms C O is the most important structure while C O is non octet but has a neutral formal charge on each atom and represents the second most important resonance contributor Because of the lone pair and divalence of carbon in this resonance structure carbon monoxide is often considered to be an extraordinarily stabilized carbene Isocyanides are compounds in which the O is replaced by an NR R alkyl or aryl group and have a similar bonding scheme br If carbon monoxide acts as a ligand the polarity of the dipole may reverse with a net negative charge on the oxygen end depending on the structure of the coordination complex br See also the section Coordination chemistry below br br br Bond polarity and oxidation state br Theoretical and experimental studies show that despite the greater electronegativity of oxygen the dipole moment points from the more negative carbon end to the more positive oxygen end The three bonds are in fact polar covalent bonds that are strongly polarized The calculated polarization toward the oxygen atom is for the bond and for both bonds br The oxidation state of carbon in carbon monoxide is in each of these structures It is calculated by counting all the bonding electrons as belonging to the more electronegative oxygen Only the two non bonding electrons on carbon are assigned to carbon In this count carbon then has only two valence electrons in the molecule compared to four in the free atom br br br Occurrence br br Carbon monoxide occurs in various natural and artificial environments Photochemical degradation of plant matter for example generates an estimated million tons year Typical concentrations in parts per million are as follows br br br Atmospheric presence br br Carbon monoxide CO is present in small amounts about ppb in the Earth s atmosphere Most of the rest comes from chemical reactions with organic compounds emitted by human activities and natural origins due to photochemical reactions in the troposphere that generate about kilograms per year Other natural sources of CO include volcanoes forest and bushfires and other miscellaneous forms of combustion such as fossil fuels Small amounts are also emitted from the ocean and from geological activity because carbon monoxide occurs dissolved in molten volcanic rock at high pressures in the Earth s mantle Because natural sources of carbon monoxide vary from year to year it is difficult to accurately measure natural emissions of the gas br Carbon monoxide has an indirect effect on radiative forcing by elevating concentrations of direct greenhouse gases including methane and tropospheric ozone CO can react chemically with other atmospheric constituents primarily the hydroxyl radical OH that would otherwise destroy methane Through natural processes in the atmosphere it is oxidized to carbon dioxide and ozone Carbon monoxide is short lived in the atmosphere with an average lifetime of about one to two months and spatially variable in concentration br Due to its long lifetime in the mid troposphere carbon monoxide is also used as a tracer for pollutant plumes br br br Astronomy br Beyond Earth carbon monoxide is the second most common diatomic molecule in the interstellar medium after molecular hydrogen Because of its asymmetry this polar molecule produces far brighter spectral lines than the hydrogen molecule making CO much easier to detect Interstellar CO was first detected with radio telescopes in It is now the most commonly used tracer of molecular gas in general in the interstellar medium of galaxies as molecular hydrogen can only be detected using ultraviolet light which requires space telescopes Carbon monoxide observations provide much of the information about the molecular clouds in which most stars form br Beta Pictoris the second brightest star in the constellation Pictor shows an excess of infrared emission compared to normal stars of its type which is caused by large quantities of dust and gas including carbon monoxide near the star br In the atmosphere of Venus carbon monoxide occurs as a result of the photodissociation of carbon dioxide by electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths shorter than nm It has also been identified spectroscopically on the surface of Neptune s moon Triton br Solid carbon monoxide is a component of comets The volatile or ice component of Halley s Comet is about CO At room temperature and at atmospheric pressure carbon monoxide is actually only metastable see Boudouard reaction and the same is true at low temperatures where CO and CO are solid but nevertheless it can exist for billions of years in comets There is very little CO in the atmosphere of Pluto which seems to have been formed from comets This may be because there is or was liquid water inside Pluto br Carbon monoxide can react with water to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen br br CO H O H CO br This is called the water gas shift reaction when occurring in the gas phase but it can also take place very slowly in an aqueous solution br If the hydrogen partial pressure is high enough for instance in an underground sea formic acid will be formed br br CO H O HCOOH br These reactions can take place in a few million years even at temperatures such as found on Pluto br br br Pollution and health effects br br br Urban pollution br Carbon monoxide is a temporary atmospheric pollutant in some urban areas chiefly from the exhaust of internal combustion engines including vehicles portable and back up generators lawnmowers power washers etc but also from incomplete combustion of various other fuels including wood coal charcoal oil paraffin propane natural gas and trash br Large CO pollution events can be observed from space over cities br br br Role in ground level ozone formation br br Carbon monoxide is along with aldehydes part of the series of cycles of chemical reactions that form photochemical smog It reacts with hydroxyl radical OH to produce a radical intermediate HOCO which transfers rapidly its radical hydrogen to O to form peroxy radical HO and carbon dioxide CO Peroxy radical subsequently reacts with nitrogen oxide NO to form nitrogen dioxide NO and hydroxyl radical NO gives O P via photolysis thereby forming O following reaction with O br Since hydroxyl radical is formed during the formation of NO the balance of the sequence of chemical reactions starting with carbon monoxide and leading to the formation of ozone is br br CO O h CO O br where h refers to the photon of light absorbed by the NO molecule in the sequence br Although the creation of NO is the critical step leading to low level ozone formation it also increases this ozone in another somewhat mutually exclusive way by reducing the quantity of NO that is available to react with ozone br br br Indoor air pollution br br Carbon monoxide is one of the most acutely toxic indoor air contaminants Carbon monoxide may be emitted from tobacco smoke and generated from malfunctioning fuel burning stoves wood kerosene natural gas propane and fuel burning heating systems wood oil natural gas and from blocked flues connected to these appliances In developed countries the main sources of indoor CO emission come from cooking and heating devices that burn fossil fuels and are faulty incorrectly installed or poorly maintained Appliance malfunction may be due to faulty installation or lack of maintenance and proper use In low and middle income countries the most common sources of CO in homes are burning biomass fuels and cigarette smoke br br br Mining br Miners refer to carbon monoxide as whitedamp or the silent killer It can be found in confined areas of poor ventilation in both surface mines and underground mines The most common sources of carbon monoxide in mining operations are the internal combustion engine and explosives however in coal mines carbon monoxide can also be found due to the low temperature oxidation of coal The idiom Canary in the coal mine pertained to an early warning of a carbon monoxide presence br br br Health effects br br Carbon monoxide poisoning is the most common type of fatal air poisoning in many countries Acute exposure can also lead to long term neurological effects such as cognitive and behavioural changes Severe CO poisoning may lead to unconsciousness coma and death Chronic exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide may lead to lethargy headaches nausea flu like symptoms and neuropsychological and cardiovascular issues br br br Chemistry br Carbon monoxide has a wide range of functions across all disciplines of chemistry The four premier categories of reactivity involve metal carbonyl catalysis radical chemistry cation and anion chemistries br br br Coordination chemistry br br Most metals form coordination complexes containing covalently attached carbon monoxide Only metals in lower oxidation states will complex with carbon monoxide ligands This is because there must be sufficient electron density to facilitate back donation from the metal dxz orbital to the molecular orbital from CO The lone pair on the carbon atom in CO also donates electron density to the dx y on the metal to form a sigma bond This electron donation is also exhibited with the cis effect or the labilization of CO ligands in the cis position Nickel carbonyl for example forms by the direct combination of carbon monoxide and nickel metal br br Ni CO Ni CO bar C br For this reason nickel in any tubing or part must not come into prolonged contact with carbon monoxide Nickel carbonyl decomposes readily back to Ni and CO upon contact with hot surfaces and this method is used for the industrial purification of nickel in the Mond process br In nickel carbonyl and other carbonyls the electron pair on the carbon interacts with the metal the carbon monoxide donates the electron pair to the metal In these situations carbon monoxide is called the carbonyl ligand One of the most important metal carbonyls is iron pentacarbonyl Fe CO br br Many metal CO complexes are prepared by decarbonylation of organic solvents not from CO For instance iridium trichloride and triphenylphosphine react in boiling methoxyethanol or DMF to afford IrCl CO PPh br Metal carbonyls in coordination chemistry are usually studied using infrared spectroscopy br br br Organic and main group chemistry br br In the presence of strong acids and water carbon monoxide reacts with alkenes to form carboxylic acids in a process known as the Koch Haaf reaction In the Gattermann Koch reaction arenes are converted to benzaldehyde derivatives in the presence of CO AlCl and HCl Organolithium compounds e g butyl lithium react with carbon monoxide but these reactions have little scientific use br Although CO reacts with carbocations and carbanions it is relatively nonreactive toward organic compounds without the intervention of metal catalysts br With main group reagents CO undergoes several noteworthy reactions Chlorination of CO is the industrial route to the important compound phosgene With borane CO forms the adduct H BCO which is isoelectronic with the acetylium cation H CCO CO reacts with sodium to give products resulting from C C coupling such as sodium acetylenediolate Na C O It reacts with molten potassium to give a mixture of an organometallic compound potassium acetylenediolate K C O potassium benzenehexolate K C O and potassium rhodizonate K C O br The compounds cyclohexanehexone or triquinoyl C O and cyclopentanepentone or leuconic acid C O which so far have been obtained only in trace amounts can be regarded as polymers of carbon monoxide At pressures exceeding GPa carbon monoxide converts to polycarbonyl a solid polymer that is metastable at atmospheric pressure but is explosive br br br Laboratory preparation br Carbon monoxide is conveniently produced in the laboratory by the dehydration of formic acid or oxalic acid for example with concentrated sulfuric acid Another method is heating an intimate mixture of powdered zinc metal and calcium carbonate which releases CO and leaves behind zinc oxide and calcium oxide br br Zn CaCO ZnO CaO CO br Silver nitrate and iodoform also afford carbon monoxide br br CHI AgNO H O HNO CO AgI br Finally metal oxalate salts release CO upon heating leaving a carbonate as byproduct br br Na C O Na CO CO br br br Production br Thermal combustion is the most common source for carbon monoxide Carbon monoxide is produced from the partial oxidation of carbon containing compounds it forms when there is not enough oxygen to produce carbon dioxide CO such as when operating a stove or an internal combustion engine in an enclosed space br A large quantity of CO byproduct is formed during the oxidative processes for the production of chemicals For this reason the process off gases have to be purified br Many methods have been developed for carbon monoxide production br br br Industrial production br A major industrial source of CO is producer gas a mixture containing mostly carbon monoxide and nitrogen formed by combustion of carbon in air at high temperature when there is an excess of carbon In an oven air is passed through a bed of coke The initially produced CO equilibrates with the remaining hot carbon to give CO The reaction of CO with carbon to give CO is described as the Boudouard reaction Above C CO is the predominant product br br CO g C s CO g Hr kJ mol br Another source is water gas a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced via the endothermic reaction of steam and carbon br br H O g C s H g CO g Hr kJ mol br Other similar synthesis gases can be obtained from natural gas and other fuels br Carbon monoxide can also be produced by high temperature electrolysis of carbon dioxide with solid oxide electrolyzer cells One method developed at DTU Energy uses a cerium oxide catalyst and does not have any issues of fouling of the catalyst br br CO CO O br Carbon monoxide is also a byproduct of the reduction of metal oxide ores with carbon shown in a simplified form as follows br br MO C M CO br Carbon monoxide is also produced by the direct oxidation of carbon in a limited supply of oxygen or air br br C O CO br Since CO is a gas the reduction process can be driven by heating exploiting the positive favorable entropy of reaction The Ellingham diagram shows that CO formation is favored over CO in high temperatures br br br Use br br br Chemical industry br Carbon monoxide is an industrial gas that has many applications in bulk chemicals manufacturing Large quantities of aldehydes are produced by the hydroformylation reaction of alkenes carbon monoxide and H Hydroformylation is coupled to the Shell higher olefin process to give precursors to detergents br Phosgene useful for preparing isocyanates polycarbonates and polyurethanes is produced by passing purified carbon monoxide and chlorine gas through a bed of porous activated carbon which serves as a catalyst World production of this compound was estimated to be million tonnes in br br CO Cl COCl br Methanol is produced by the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide In a related reaction the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide is coupled to C C bond formation as in the Fischer Tropsch process where carbon monoxide is hydrogenated to liquid hydrocarbon fuels This technology allows coal or biomass to be converted to diesel br In the Cativa process carbon monoxide and methanol react in the presence of a homogeneous iridium catalyst and hydroiodic acid to give acetic acid This process is responsible for most of the industrial production of acetic acid br br br Metallurgy br br Carbon monoxide is a strong reductive agent and has been used in pyrometallurgy to reduce metals from ores since ancient times Carbon monoxide strips oxygen off metal oxides reducing them to pure metal in high temperatures forming carbon dioxide in the process Carbon monoxide is not usually supplied as is in the gaseous phase in the reactor but rather it is formed in high temperature in presence of oxygen carrying ore or a carboniferous agent such as coke and high temperature The blast furnace process is a typical example of a process of reduction of metal from ore with carbon monoxide br Likewise blast furnace gas collected at the top of blast furnace still contains some to of carbon monoxide and is used as fuel on Cowper stoves and on Siemens Martin furnaces on open hearth steelmaking br br br Lasers br Carbon monoxide has also been used as a lasing medium in high powered infrared lasers br br br Proposed use as a rocket fuel br Carbon monoxide has been proposed for use as a fuel on Mars by NASA researcher Geoffrey Landis Carbon monoxide oxygen engines have been suggested for early surface transportation use as both carbon monoxide and oxygen can be straightforwardly produced from the carbon dioxide atmosphere of Mars by zirconia electrolysis without using any Martian water resources to obtain hydrogen which would be needed to make methane or any hydrogen based fuel br Landis also proposed manufacturing the fuel from the similar carbon dioxide atmosphere of Venus for a sample return mission in combination with solar powered UAVs and rocket balloon ascent br br br Biological and physiological properties br br br Physiology br br Carbon monoxide is a bioactive molecule which acts as a gaseous signaling molecule It is naturally produced by many enzymatic and non enzymatic pathways the best understood of which is the catabolic action of heme oxygenase on the heme derived from hemoproteins such as hemoglobin Following the first report that carbon monoxide is a normal neurotransmitter in carbon monoxide has received significant clinical attention as a biological regulator br Because of carbon monoxide s role in the body abnormalities in its metabolism have been linked to a variety of diseases including neurodegenerations hypertension heart failure and pathological inflammation In many tissues carbon monoxide acts as anti inflammatory vasodilatory and encouragers of neovascular growth In animal model studies carbon monoxide reduced the severity of experimentally induced bacterial sepsis pancreatitis hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury colitis osteoarthritis lung injury lung transplantation rejection and neuropathic pain while promoting skin wound healing Therefore there is significant interest in the therapeutic potential of carbon monoxide becoming pharmaceutical agent and clinical standard of care br br br Medicine br br Studies involving carbon monoxide have been conducted in many laboratories throughout the world for its anti inflammatory and cytoprotective properties These properties have the potential to be used to prevent the development of a series of pathological conditions including ischemia reperfusion injury transplant rejection atherosclerosis severe sepsis severe malaria or autoimmunity Many pharmaceutical drug delivery initiatives have developed methods to safely administer carbon monoxide and subsequent controlled clinical trials have evaluated the therapeutic effect of carbon monoxide br br br Microbiology br Microbiota may also utilize carbon monoxide as a gasotransmitter Carbon monoxide sensing is a signaling pathway facilitated by proteins such as CooA The scope of the biological roles for carbon monoxide sensing is still unknown br The human microbiome produces consumes and responds to carbon monoxide For example in certain bacteria carbon monoxide is produced via the reduction of carbon dioxide by the enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase with favorable bioenergetics to power downstream cellular operations In another example carbon monoxide is a nutrient for methanogenic archaea which reduce it to methane using hydrogen br Carbon monoxide has certain antimicrobial properties which have been studied to treat against infectious diseases br br br Food science br Carbon monoxide is used in modified atmosphere packaging systems in the US mainly with fresh meat products such as beef pork and fish to keep them looking fresh The benefit is two fold carbon monoxide protects against microbial spoilage and it enhances the meat color for consumer appeal The carbon monoxide combines with myoglobin to form carboxymyoglobin a bright cherry red pigment Carboxymyoglobin is more stable than the oxygenated form of myoglobin oxymyoglobin which can become oxidized to the brown pigment metmyoglobin This stable red color can persist much longer than in normally packaged meat Typical levels of carbon monoxide used in the facilities that use this process are between and br The technology was first given generally recognized as safe GRAS status by the U S Food and Drug Administration FDA in for use as a secondary packaging system and does not require labeling In the FDA approved CO as primary packaging method declaring that CO does not mask spoilage odor The process is currently unauthorized in many other countries including Japan Singapore and the European Union br br br Weaponization br In ancient history Hannibal executed Roman prisoners with coal fumes during the Second Punic War br Carbon monoxide had been used for genocide during the Holocaust at some extermination camps the most notable by gas vans in Che mno and in the Action T euthanasia program br br br History br br br Prehistory br Humans have maintained a complex relationship with carbon monoxide since first learning to control fire circa BC Early humans probably discovered the toxicity of carbon monoxide poisoning upon introducing fire into their dwellings The early development of metallurgy and smelting technologies emerging circa BC through the Bronze Age likewise plagued humankind from carbon monoxide exposure Apart from the toxicity of carbon monoxide indigenous Native Americans may have experienced the neuroactive properties of carbon monoxide through shamanistic fireside rituals br br br Ancient history br Early civilizations developed mythological tales to explain the origin of fire such as Prometheus from Greek mythology who shared fire with humans Aristotle BC first recorded that burning coals produced toxic fumes Greek physician Galen AD speculated that there was a change in the composition of the air that caused harm when inhaled and many others of the era developed a basis of knowledge about carbon monoxide in the context of coal fume toxicity Cleopatra may have died from carbon monoxide poisoning br br br Pre industrial revolution br Georg Ernst Stahl mentioned carbonarii halitus in in reference to toxic vapors thought to be carbon monoxide Friedrich Hoffmann conducted the first modern scientific investigation into carbon monoxide poisoning from coal in Herman Boerhaave conducted the first scientific experiments on the effect of carbon monoxide coal fumes on animals in the s br Joseph Priestley is considered to have first synthesized carbon monoxide in Carl Wilhelm Scheele similarly isolated carbon monoxide from charcoal in and thought it could be the carbonic entity making fumes toxic Torbern Bergman isolated carbon monoxide from oxalic acid in Later in the French chemist de Lassone produced CO by heating zinc oxide with coke but mistakenly concluded that the gaseous product was hydrogen as it burned with a blue flame In the presence of oxygen including atmospheric concentrations carbon monoxide burns with a blue flame producing carbon dioxide Antoine Lavoisier conducted similar inconclusive experiments to Lassone in The gas was identified as a compound containing carbon and oxygen by William Cruickshank in br Thomas Beddoes and James Watt recognized carbon monoxide as hydrocarbonate to brighten venous blood in Watt suggested coal fumes could act as an antidote to the oxygen in blood and Beddoes and Watt likewise suggested hydrocarbonate has a greater affinity for animal fiber than oxygen in In Adrien Chenot similarly suggested carbon monoxide to remove the oxygen from blood and then be oxidized by the body to carbon dioxide The mechanism for carbon monoxide poisoning is widely credited to Claude Bernard whose memoirs beginning in and published in phrased prevents arterials blood from becoming venous Felix Hoppe Seyler independently published similar conclusions in the following year br br br Advent of industrial chemistry br Carbon monoxide gained recognition as an essential reagent in the s Three industrial processes illustrate its evolution in industry In the Fischer Tropsch process coal and related carbon rich feedstocks are converted into liquid fuels via the intermediacy of CO Originally developed as part of the German war effort to compensate for their lack of domestic petroleum this technology continues today Also in Germany a mixture of CO and hydrogen was found to combine with olefins to give aldehydes This process called hydroformylation is used to produce many large scale chemicals such as surfactants as well as specialty compounds that are popular fragrances and drugs For example CO is used in the production of vitamin A In a third major process attributed to researchers at Monsanto CO combines with methanol to give acetic acid Most acetic acid is produced by the Cativa process Hydroformylation and the acetic acid syntheses are two of myriad carbonylation processes br br br See
