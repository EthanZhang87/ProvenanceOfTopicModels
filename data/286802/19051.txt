Manganese is a chemical element it has symbol Mn and atomic number It is a hard brittle silvery metal often found in minerals in combination with iron Manganese was first isolated in the s Manganese is a transition metal with a multifaceted array of industrial alloy uses particularly in stainless steels It improves strength workability and resistance to wear Manganese oxide is used as an oxidising agent as a rubber additive and in glass making fertilisers and ceramics Manganese sulfate can be used as a fungicide br Manganese is also an essential human dietary element important in macronutrient metabolism bone formation and free radical defense systems It is a critical component in dozens of proteins and enzymes It is found mostly in the bones but also the liver kidneys and brain In the human brain the manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes br It is familiar in the laboratory in the form of the deep violet salt potassium permanganate It occurs at the active sites in some enzymes Of particular interest is the use of a Mn O cluster the oxygen evolving complex in the production of oxygen by plants br br br Characteristics br br br Physical properties br Manganese is a silvery gray metal that resembles iron It is hard and very brittle difficult to fuse but easy to oxidize Manganese metal and its common ions are paramagnetic Manganese tarnishes slowly in air and oxidizes rusts like iron in water containing dissolved oxygen br br br Isotopes br br Naturally occurring manganese is composed of one stable isotope Mn Several radioisotopes have been isolated and described ranging in atomic weight from u Mn to u Mn The most stable are Mn with a half life of million years Mn with a half life of days and Mn with a half life of days All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half lives of less than three hours and the majority of less than one minute The primary decay mode in isotopes lighter than the most abundant stable isotope Mn is electron capture and the primary mode in heavier isotopes is beta decay Manganese also has three meta states br Manganese is part of the iron group of elements which are thought to be synthesized in large stars shortly before the supernova explosion Mn decays to Cr with a half life of million years Because of its relatively short half life Mn is relatively rare produced by cosmic rays impact on iron Manganese isotopic contents are typically combined with chromium isotopic contents and have found application in isotope geology and radiometric dating Mn Cr isotopic ratios reinforce the evidence from Al and Pd for the early history of the Solar System Variations in Cr Cr and Mn Cr ratios from several meteorites suggest an initial Mn Mn ratio which indicate that Mn Cr isotopic composition must result from in situ decay of Mn in differentiated planetary bodies Hence Mn provides additional evidence for nucleosynthetic processes immediately before coalescence of the Solar System br br br Allotropes br br Four allotropes structural forms of solid manganese are known labeled and and occurring at successively higher temperatures All are metallic stable at standard pressure and have a cubic crystal lattice but they vary widely in their atomic structures br Alpha manganese Mn is the equilibrium phase at room temperature It has a body centered cubic lattice and is unusual among elemental metals in having a very complex unit cell with atoms per cell atoms per primitive unit cell in four different types of site It is paramagnetic at room temperature and antiferromagnetic at temperatures below K C br br Beta manganese Mn forms when heated above the transition temperature of K C F It has a primitive cubic structure with atoms per unit cell at two types of sites which is as complex as that of any other elemental metal It is easily obtained as a metastable phase at room temperature by rapid quenching It does not show magnetic ordering remaining paramagnetic down to the lowest temperature measured K br Gamma manganese Mn forms when heated above K C F It has a simple face centered cubic structure four atoms per unit cell When quenched to room temperature it converts to Mn but it can be stabilized at room temperature by alloying it with at least percent of other elements such as C Fe Ni Cu Pd or Au and these solute stabilized alloys distort into a face centered tetragonal structure br Delta manganese Mn forms when heated above K C F and is stable up to the manganese melting point of K C F It has a body centered cubic structure two atoms per cubic unit cell br br br Chemical compounds br br Common oxidation states of manganese are and although all oxidation states from to except have been observed Manganese in oxidation state is represented by salts of the intensely purple permanganate anion MnO Potassium permanganate is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties it is used as a topical medicine for example in the treatment of fish diseases Solutions of potassium permanganate were among the first stains and fixatives to be used in the preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy br Aside from various permanganate salts Mn VII is represented by the unstable volatile derivative Mn O Oxyhalides MnO F and MnO Cl are powerful oxidizing agents The most prominent example of Mn in the oxidation state is the green anion manganate MnO Manganate salts are intermediates in the extraction of manganese from its ores Compounds with oxidation states are somewhat elusive and often found associated to an oxide O or nitride N ligand One example is the blue anion hypomanganate MnO br Mn IV is somewhat enigmatic because it is common in nature but far rarer in synthetic chemistry The most common Mn ore pyrolusite is MnO It is the dark brown pigment of many cave drawings but is also a common ingredient in dry cell batteries Complexes of Mn IV are well known but they require elaborate ligands Mn IV OH complexes are an intermediate in some enzymes including the oxygen evolving center OEC in plants br br Simple derivatives Mn are rarely encountered but can be stabilized by suitably basic ligands Manganese III acetate is an oxidant useful in organic synthesis Solid compounds of manganese III are characterized by its strong purple red color and a preference for distorted octahedral coordination resulting from the Jahn Teller effect br A particularly common oxidation state for manganese in aqueous solution is which has a pale pink color Many manganese II compounds are known such as the aquo complexes derived from manganese II sulfate MnSO and manganese II chloride MnCl This oxidation state is also seen in the mineral rhodochrosite manganese II carbonate Manganese II commonly exists with a high spin S ground state because of the high pairing energy for manganese II There are no spin allowed d d transitions in manganese II which explain its faint color br br br Organomanganese compounds br br Manganese forms a large variety of organometallic derivatives i e compounds with Mn C bonds The organometallic derivatives include numerous examples of Mn in its lower oxidation states i e Mn III up through Mn I This area of organometallic chemistry is attractive because Mn is inexpensive and of relatively low toxicity br Of greatest commercial interest is MMT methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl which is used as an anti knock compound added to gasoline petrol in some countries It features Mn I Consistent with other aspects of Mn II chemistry manganocene Mn C H is high spin In contrast its neighboring metal iron forms an air stable low spin derivative in the form of ferrocene Fe C H When conducted under an atmosphere of carbon monoxide reduction of Mn II salts gives dimanganese decacarbonyl Mn CO an orange and volatile solid The air stability of this Mn compound and its many derivatives reflects the powerful electron acceptor properties of carbon monoxide Many alkene complexes and alkyne complexes are derived from Mn CO br In Mn CH dmpe Mn II is low spin which contrasts with the high spin character of its precursor MnBr dmpe dmpe CH PCH CH P CH Polyalkyl and polyaryl derivatives of manganese often exist in higher oxidation states reflecting the electron releasing properties of alkyl and aryl ligands One example is Mn CH br br br History br The origin of the name manganese is complex In ancient times two black minerals were identified from the regions of the Magnetes either Magnesia located within modern Greece or Magnesia ad Sipylum located within modern Turkey They were both called magnes from their place of origin but were considered to differ in sex The male magnes attracted iron and was the iron ore now known as lodestone or magnetite and which probably gave us the term magnet The female magnes ore did not attract iron but was used to decolorize glass This female magnes was later called magnesia known now in modern times as pyrolusite or manganese dioxide Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic In the th century manganese dioxide was called manganesum note the two Ns instead of one by glassmakers possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a magnesia nigra the black ore from magnesia alba a white ore also from Magnesia also useful in glassmaking Michele Mercati called magnesia nigra manganesa and finally the metal isolated from it became known as manganese German Mangan The name magnesia eventually was then used to refer only to the white magnesia alba magnesium oxide which provided the name magnesium for the free element when it was isolated much later br br Manganese dioxide which is abundant in nature has long been used as a pigment The cave paintings in Gargas that are to years old are made from the mineral form of MnO pigments br Manganese compounds were used by Egyptian and Roman glassmakers either to add to or remove color from glass Use as glassmakers soap continued through the Middle Ages until modern times and is evident in th century glass from Venice br br Because it was used in glassmaking manganese dioxide was available for experiments by alchemists the first chemists Ignatius Gottfried Kaim and Johann Glauber th century discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to permanganate a useful laboratory reagent Kaim also may have reduced manganese dioxide to isolate the metal but that is uncertain By the mid th century the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used manganese dioxide to produce chlorine First hydrochloric acid or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with manganese dioxide and later hydrochloric acid from the Leblanc process was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the Weldon process The production of chlorine and hypochlorite bleaching agents was a large consumer of manganese ores br Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite mineral form of manganese dioxide contained a new element Johan Gottlieb Gahn isolated an impure sample of manganese metal in which he did by reducing the dioxide with carbon br The manganese content of some iron ores used in Greece led to speculations that steel produced from that ore contains additional manganese making the Spartan steel exceptionally hard Around the beginning of the th century manganese was used in steelmaking and several patents were granted In it was documented that iron alloyed with manganese was harder but not more brittle In British academic James Couper noted an association between miners heavy exposure to manganese and a form of Parkinson s disease In United States patents were granted for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion with manganese phosphate electrochemical conversion coatings and the process has seen widespread use ever since br The invention of the Leclanch cell in and the subsequent improvement of batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic depolarizer increased the demand for manganese dioxide Until the development of batteries with nickel cadmium and lithium most batteries contained manganese The zinc carbon battery and the alkaline battery normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because naturally occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities In the th century manganese dioxide was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard zinc carbon and alkaline types br Manganese is essential to iron and steel production by virtue of its sulfur fixing deoxidizing and alloying properties This application was first recognized by the British metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet who in introduced the element in the form of Spiegeleisen br br br Occurrence br br Manganese comprises about ppm of the Earth s crust and is the th most abundant element Soil contains ppm of manganese with an average of ppm The atmosphere contains g m Manganese occurs principally as pyrolusite MnO braunite Mn Mn SiO psilomelane Ba H O Mn O and to a lesser extent as rhodochrosite MnCO br br The most important manganese ore is pyrolusite MnO Other economically important manganese ores usually show a close spatial relation to the iron ores such as sphalerite Land based resources are large but irregularly distributed About of the known world manganese resources are in South Africa other important manganese deposits are in Ukraine Australia India China Gabon and Brazil According to estimate the ocean floor has billion tons of manganese nodules Attempts to find economically viable methods of harvesting manganese nodules were abandoned in the s br In South Africa most identified deposits are located near Hotazel in the Northern Cape Province Kalahari manganese fields with a estimate of billion tons In South Africa produced million tons topping all other nations br Manganese is mainly mined in South Africa Australia China Gabon Brazil India Kazakhstan Ghana Ukraine and Malaysia br br br Production br br For the production of ferromanganese the manganese ore is mixed with iron ore and carbon and then reduced either in a blast furnace or in an electric arc furnace The resulting ferromanganese has a manganese content of Pure manganese used for the production of iron free alloys is produced by leaching manganese ore with sulfuric acid and a subsequent electrowinning process br br A more progressive extraction process involves directly reducing a low grade manganese ore by heap leaching This is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap the natural gas provides the heat needs to be at least C and the reducing agent carbon monoxide This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide MnO which is a leachable form The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between and m increasing the surface area to aid leaching The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron Fe in a ratio The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide MnO to form iron hydroxide FeO OH and elemental manganese Mn br This process yields approximately recovery of the manganese For further purification the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility br br br Oceanic environment br In the CIA s Project Azorian through billionaire Howard Hughes commissioned the ship Hughes Glomar Explorer with the cover story of harvesting manganese nodules from the sea floor That triggered a rush of activity to collect manganese nodules which was not actually practical The real mission of Hughes Glomar Explorer was to raise a sunken Soviet submarine the K with the goal of retrieving Soviet code books br An abundant resource of manganese in the form of manganese nodules found on the ocean floor These nodules which are composed of manganese are located along the ocean floor The environmental impacts of nodule collection are of interest br Dissolved manganese dMn is found throughout the world s oceans of which originates from hydrothermal vents Particulate Mn develops in buoyant plumes over an active vent source while the dMn behaves conservatively Mn concentrations vary between the water columns of the ocean At the surface dMn is elevated due to input from external sources such as rivers dust and shelf sediments Coastal sediments normally have lower Mn concentrations but can increase due to anthropogenic discharges from industries such as mining and steel manufacturing which enter the ocean from river inputs Surface dMn concentrations can also be elevated biologically through photosynthesis and physically from coastal upwelling and wind driven surface currents Internal cycling such as photo reduction from UV radiation can also elevate levels by speeding up the dissolution of Mn oxides and oxidative scavenging preventing Mn from sinking to deeper waters Elevated levels at mid depths can occur near mid ocean ridges and hydrothermal vents The hydrothermal vents release dMn enriched fluid into the water The dMn can then travel up to km due to the microbial capsules present preventing exchange with particles lowing the sinking rates Dissolved Mn concentrations are even higher when oxygen levels are low Overall dMn concentrations are normally higher in coastal regions and decrease when moving offshore br br br Soils br Manganese occurs in soils in three oxidation states the divalent cation Mn and as brownish black oxides and hydroxides containing Mn III IV such as MnOOH and MnO Soil pH and oxidation reduction conditions affect which of these three forms of Mn is dominant in a given soil At pH values less than or under anaerobic conditions Mn II dominates while under more alkaline and aerobic conditions Mn III IV oxides and hydroxides predominate These effects of soil acidity and aeration state on the form of Mn can be modified or controlled by microbial activity Microbial respiration can cause both the oxidation of Mn to the oxides and it can cause reduction of the oxides to the divalent cation br The Mn III IV oxides exist as brownish black stains and small nodules on sand silt and clay particles These surface coatings on other soil particles have high surface area and carry negative charge The charged sites can adsorb and retain various cations especially heavy metals e g Cr Cu Zn and Pb In addition the oxides can adsorb organic acids and other compounds The adsorption of the metals and organic compounds can then cause them to be oxidized while the Mn III IV oxides are reduced to Mn e g Cr to Cr VI and colorless hydroquinone to tea colored quinone polymers br br br Applications br br br Steel br br Manganese is essential to iron and steel production by virtue of its sulfur fixing deoxidizing and alloying properties Manganese has no satisfactory substitute in these applications in metallurgy Steelmaking including its ironmaking component has accounted for most manganese demand presently in the range of to of the total demand Manganese is a key component of low cost stainless steel Often ferromanganese usually about manganese is the intermediate in modern processes br Small amounts of manganese improve the workability of steel at high temperatures by forming a high melting sulfide and preventing the formation of a liquid iron sulfide at the grain boundaries If the manganese content reaches the embrittlement of the steel becomes a dominant feature The embrittlement decreases at higher manganese concentrations and reaches an acceptable level at Steel containing to of manganese has a high tensile strength of up to MPa Steel with manganese was discovered in by Robert Hadfield and is still known as Hadfield steel mangalloy It was used for British military steel helmets and later by the U S military br br br Aluminium alloys br br Manganese is used in production of alloys with aluminium Aluminium with roughly manganese has increased resistance to corrosion through grains that absorb impurities which would lead to galvanic corrosion The corrosion resistant aluminium alloys and to manganese are used for most beverage cans Before more than million tonnes of those alloys were used at manganese this consumed tonnes of manganese br br br Batteries br Manganese IV oxide was used in the original type of dry cell battery as an electron acceptor from zinc and is the blackish material in carbon zinc type flashlight cells The manganese dioxide is reduced to the manganese oxide hydroxide MnO OH during discharging preventing the formation of hydrogen at the anode of the battery br br MnO H O e MnO OH OH br The same material also functions in newer alkaline batteries usually battery cells which use the same basic reaction but a different electrolyte mixture In more than tons of manganese dioxide was used for this purpose br br br Resistors br Copper alloys of manganese such as Manganin are commonly found in metal element shunt resistors used for measuring relatively large amounts of current These alloys have very low temperature coefficient of resistance and are resistant to sulfur This makes the alloys particularly useful in harsh automotive and industrial environments br br br Fertilizers and feed additive br Manganese oxide and sulfate are components of fertilizers In the year an estimated tons of these compounds were used in fertilizers in the US alone A comparable amount of Mn compounds was also used in animal feeds br br br Niche br Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl is an additive in some unleaded gasoline to boost octane rating and reduce engine knocking br Manganese IV oxide manganese dioxide MnO is used as a reagent in organic chemistry for the oxidation of benzylic alcohols where the hydroxyl group is adjacent to an aromatic ring Manganese dioxide has been used since antiquity to oxidize and neutralize the greenish tinge in glass from trace amounts of iron contamination MnO is also used in the manufacture of oxygen and chlorine and in drying black paints In some preparations it is a brown pigment for paint and is a constituent of natural umber br Tetravalent manganese is used as an activator in red emitting phosphors While many compounds are known which show luminescence the majority are not used in commercial application due to low efficiency or deep red emission However several Mn activated fluorides were reported as potential red emitting phosphors for warm white LEDs But to this day only K SiF Mn is commercially available for use in warm white LEDs br The metal is occasionally used in coins until the only United States coin to use manganese was the wartime nickel from to An alloy of copper and nickel was traditionally used for the production of nickel coins However because of shortage of nickel metal during the war it was substituted by more available silver and manganese thus resulting in an alloy of copper silver and manganese Since dollar coins for example the Sacagawea dollar and the Presidential coins are made from a brass containing of manganese with a pure copper core In both cases of nickel and dollar the use of manganese in the coin was to duplicate the electromagnetic properties of a previous identically sized and valued coin in the mechanisms of vending machines In the case of the later U S dollar coins the manganese alloy was intended to duplicate the properties of the copper nickel alloy used in the previous Susan B Anthony dollar br Manganese compounds have been used as pigments and for the coloring of ceramics and glass The brown color of ceramic is sometimes the result of manganese compounds In the glass industry manganese compounds are used for two effects Manganese III reacts with iron II to reduce strong green color in glass by forming less colored iron III and slightly pink manganese II compensating for the residual color of the iron III Larger quantities of manganese are used to produce pink colored glass In Mas Subramanian and associates at Oregon State University discovered that manganese can be combined with yttrium and indium to form an intensely blue non toxic inert fade resistant pigment YInMn Blue the first new blue pigment discovered in years br br br Biochemistry br br Many classes of enzymes contain manganese cofactors including oxidoreductases transferases hydrolases lyases isomerases and ligases Other enzymes containing manganese are arginase and a Mn containing superoxide dismutase Mn SOD Some reverse transcriptases of many retroviruses although not lentiviruses such as HIV contain manganese Manganese containing polypeptides are the diphtheria toxin lectins and integrins br The oxygen evolving complex OEC containing four atoms of manganese is a part of photosystem II contained in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts The OEC is responsible for the terminal photooxidation of water during the light reactions of photosynthesis i e it is the catalyst that makes the O produced by plants br br br Human health and nutrition br Manganese is an essential human dietary element and is present as a coenzyme in several biological processes which include macronutrient metabolism bone formation and free radical defense systems Manganese is a critical component in dozens of proteins and enzymes The human body contains about mg of manganese mostly in the bones The soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidneys In the human brain the manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes br br br Regulation br The U S Institute of Medicine IOM updated Estimated Average Requirements EARs and Recommended Dietary Allowances RDAs for minerals in For manganese there was not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs so needs are described as estimates for Adequate Intakes AIs As for safety the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels ULs for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient In the case of manganese the adult UL is set at mg day Collectively the EARs RDAs AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes DRIs Manganese deficiency is rare br The European Food Safety Authority EFSA refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values with Population Reference Intake PRI instead of RDA and Average Requirement instead of EAR AI and UL defined the same as in United States For people ages and older the AI is set at mg day AIs for pregnancy and lactation is mg day For children ages years the AIs increase with age from to mg day The adult AIs are higher than the U S RDAs The EFSA reviewed the same safety question and decided that there was insufficient information to set a UL br For U S food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value DV For manganese labeling purposes of the Daily Value was mg but as of May it was revised to mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake br Excessive exposure or intake may lead to a condition known as manganism a neurodegenerative disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and symptoms similar to Parkinson s disease br br br Deficiency br br Manganese deficiency in humans which is rare results in a number of medical problems A deficiency of manganese causes skeletal deformation in animals and inhibits the production of collagen in wound healing br br br Exposure br br br In water br Waterborne manganese has a greater bioavailability than dietary manganese According to results from a study higher levels of exposure to manganese in drinking water are associated with increased intellectual impairment and reduced intelligence quotients in school age children It is hypothesized that long term exposure due to inhaling the naturally occurring manganese in shower water puts up to million Americans at risk However data indicates that the human body can recover from certain adverse effects of overexposure to manganese if the exposure is stopped and the body can clear the excess br Mn levels can increase in seawater when hypoxic periods occur Since there have been reports of Mn accumulation in marine organisms including fish crustaceans mollusks and echinoderms Specific tissues are targets in different species including the gills brain blood kidney and liver hepatopancreas Physiological effects have been reported in these species Mn can affect the renewal of immunocytes and their functionality such as phagocytosis and activation of pro phenoloxidase suppressing the organisms immune systems This causes the organisms to be more susceptible to infections As climate change occurs pathogen distributions increase and in order for organisms to survive and defend themselves against these pathogens they need a healthy strong immune system If their systems are compromised from high Mn levels they will not be able to fight off these pathogens and die br br br Gasoline br br Methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl MMT is an additive developed to replace lead compounds for gasolines to improve the octane rating MMT is used only in a few countries Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides which damage exhaust valves br br br Air br Compared to levels of manganese in air have dropped Generally exposure to ambient Mn air concentrations in excess of g Mn m can lead to Mn induced symptoms Increased ferroportin protein expression in human embryonic kidney HEK cells is associated with decreased intracellular Mn concentration and attenuated cytotoxicity characterized by the reversal of Mn reduced glutamate uptake and diminished lactate dehydrogenase leakage br br br Regulation br Manganese exposure in United States is regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA People can be exposed to manganese in the workplace by breathing it in or swallowing it OSHA has set the legal limit permissible exposure limit for manganese exposure in the workplace as mg m over an hour workday The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has set a recommended exposure limit REL of mg m over an hour workday and a short term limit of mg m At levels of mg m manganese is immediately dangerous to life and health br br br Health and safety br Manganese is essential for human health albeit in milligram amounts br The current maximum safe concentration under U S EPA rules is g Mn L br br br Manganism br Manganese overexposure is most frequently associated with manganism a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation Historically persons employed in the production or processing of manganese alloys have been at risk for developing manganism however health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations The disorder was first described in by British academic John Couper who studied two patients who were manganese grinders br Manganism is a biphasic disorder In its early stages an intoxicated person may experience depression mood swings compulsive behaviors and psychosis Early neurological symptoms give way to late stage manganism which resembles Parkinson s disease Symptoms include weakness monotone and slowed speech an expressionless face tremor forward leaning gait inability to walk backwards without falling rigidity and general problems with dexterity gait and balance Unlike Parkinson s disease manganism is not associated with loss of the sense of smell and patients are typically unresponsive to treatment with L DOPA Symptoms of late stage manganism become more severe over time even if the source of exposure is removed and brain manganese levels return to normal br Chronic manganese exposure has been shown to produce a parkinsonism like illness characterized by movement abnormalities This condition is not responsive to typical therapies used in the treatment of PD suggesting an alternative pathway than the typical dopaminergic loss within the substantia nigra Manganese may accumulate in the basal ganglia leading to the abnormal movements A mutation of the SLC A gene a manganese efflux transporter necessary for decreasing intracellular Mn has been linked with the development of this Parkinsonism like disease The Lewy bodies typical to PD are not seen in Mn induced parkinsonism br Animal experiments have given the opportunity to examine the consequences of manganese overexposure under controlled conditions In non aggressive rats manganese induces mouse killing behavior br br br Toxicity br br Manganese compounds are less toxic than those of other widespread metals such as nickel and copper However exposure to manganese dusts and fumes should not exceed the ceiling value of mg m even for short periods because of its toxicity level Manganese poisoning has been linked to impaired motor skills and cognitive disorders br br br Neurodegenerative diseases br A protein called DMT is the major transporter in manganese absorption from the intestine and may be the major transporter of manganese across the blood brain barrier DMT also transports inhaled manganese across the nasal epithelium The proposed mechanism for manganese toxicity is that dysregulation leads to oxidative stress mitochondrial dysfunction glutamate mediated excitotoxicity and
