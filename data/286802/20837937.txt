Cerium III oxide also known as cerium oxide cerium trioxide cerium sesquioxide cerous oxide or dicerium trioxide is an oxide of the rare earth metal cerium It has chemical formula Ce O and is gold yellow in color br br br Applications br br br Engine and exhaust catalysts br Cerium oxide is used as a catalytic converter for the minimisation of CO emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles br When there is a shortage of oxygen cerium IV oxide is reduced by carbon monoxide to cerium III oxide br br CeO CO Ce O CO br When there is an oxygen surplus the process is reversed and cerium III oxide is oxidized to cerium IV oxide br br Ce O O CeO br Major automotive applications for cerium III oxide are as a catalytic converter for the oxidation of CO and NOx emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles and secondly cerium oxide finds use as a fuel additive to diesel fuels which results in increased fuel efficiency and decreased hydrocarbon derived particulate matter emissions however the health effects of the cerium oxide bearing engine exhaust is a point of study and dispute br br br Water splitting br The cerium IV oxide cerium III oxide cycle or CeO Ce O cycle is a two step thermochemical water splitting process based on cerium IV oxide and cerium III oxide for hydrogen production br br br Photoluminescence br Cerium III oxide combined with tin II oxide SnO in ceramic form is used for illumination with UV light It absorbs light with a wavelength of nm and emits light with a wavelength of nm This combination of cerium III oxide and tin II oxide is rare and obtained only with difficulty on a laboratory scale br br br Production br Cerium III oxide is produced by the reduction of cerium IV oxide with hydrogen at approximately C F Samples produced in this way are only slowly air oxidized back to the dioxide at room temperature br br br br br br External links br Transformation of CeO to Ce O films
