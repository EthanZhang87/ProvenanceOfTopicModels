title: Motor oil
id: 216189
Motor oil engine oil or engine lubricant is any one of various substances used for the lubrication of internal combustion engines They typically consist of base oils enhanced with various additives particularly antiwear additives detergents dispersants and for multi grade oils viscosity index improvers The main function of motor oil is to reduce friction and wear on moving parts and to clean the engine from sludge one of the functions of dispersants and varnish detergents It also neutralizes acids that originate from fuel and from oxidation of the lubricant detergents improves the sealing of piston rings and cools the engine by carrying heat away from moving parts br In addition to the aforementioned basic constituents almost all lubricating oils contain corrosion and oxidation inhibitors Motor oil may be composed of only a lubricant base stock in the case of non detergent oil or a lubricant base stock plus additives to improve the oil s detergency extreme pressure performance and ability to inhibit corrosion of engine parts br Motor oils are blended using base oils composed of petroleum based hydrocarbons polyalphaolefins PAO or their mixtures in various proportions sometimes with up to by weight of esters for better dissolution of additives br br br History br On September American John Ellis founded the Continuous Oil Refining Company While studying the possible healing powers of crude oil Dr Ellis was disappointed to find no real medicinal value but was intrigued by its potential lubricating properties He eventually abandoned the medical practice to devote his time to the development of an all petroleum high viscosity lubricant for steam engines which at the time were using inefficient combinations of petroleum and animal and vegetable fats He made his breakthrough when he developed an oil that worked effectively at high temperatures This meant fewer gummed up valves and corroded cylinders br br br Use br Motor oil is a lubricant used in internal combustion engines which power cars motorcycles lawnmowers engine generators and many other machines In engines there are parts which move against each other and the friction between the parts wastes otherwise useful power by converting kinetic energy into heat It also wears away those parts which could lead to lower efficiency and degradation of the engine Proper lubrication decreases fuel consumption decreases wasted power and increases engine longevity br Lubricating oil creates a separating film between surfaces of adjacent moving parts to minimize direct contact between them decreasing frictional heat and reducing wear thus protecting the engine In use motor oil transfers heat through conduction as it flows through the engine In an engine with a recirculating oil pump this heat is transferred by means of airflow over the exterior surface of the oil pan airflow through an oil cooler and through oil gases evacuated by the positive crankcase ventilation PCV system While modern recirculating pumps are typically provided in passenger cars and other engines of similar or larger in size total loss oiling is a design option that remains popular in small and miniature engines br br In petrol gasoline engines the top piston ring can expose the motor oil to temperatures of C F In diesel engines the top ring can expose the oil to temperatures over C F Motor oils with higher viscosity indices thin less at these higher temperatures br Coating metal parts with oil also keeps them from being exposed to oxygen inhibiting oxidation at elevated operating temperatures preventing rust or corrosion Corrosion inhibitors may also be added to the motor oil Many motor oils also have detergents and dispersants added to help keep the engine clean and minimize oil sludge build up The oil is able to trap soot from combustion in itself rather than leaving it deposited on the internal surfaces It is a combination of this and some singeing that turns used oil black after some running br Rubbing of metal engine parts inevitably produces some microscopic metallic particles from the wearing of the surfaces Such particles could circulate in the oil and grind against moving parts causing wear Because particles accumulate in the oil it is typically circulated through an oil filter to remove harmful particles An oil pump a vane or gear pump powered by the engine pumps the oil throughout the engine including the oil filter Oil filters can be a full flow or bypass type br In the crankcase of a vehicle engine motor oil lubricates rotating or sliding surfaces between the crankshaft journal bearings main bearings and big end bearings and rods connecting the pistons to the crankshaft The oil collects in an oil pan or sump at the bottom of the crankcase In some small engines such as lawn mower engines dippers on the bottoms of connecting rods dip into the oil at the bottom and splash it around the crankcase as needed to lubricate parts inside In modern vehicle engines the oil pump takes oil from the oil pan and sends it through the oil filter into oil galleries from which the oil lubricates the main bearings holding the crankshaft up at the main journals and camshaft bearings operating the valves In typical modern vehicles oil pressure fed from the oil galleries to the main bearings enters holes in the main journals of the crankshaft br From these holes in the main journals the oil moves through passageways inside the crankshaft to exit holes in the rod journals to lubricate the rod bearings and connecting rods Some simpler designs relied on these rapidly moving parts to splash and lubricate the contacting surfaces between the piston rings and interior surfaces of the cylinders However in modern designs there are also passageways through the rods which carry oil from the rod bearings to the rod piston connections and lubricate the contacting surfaces between the piston rings and interior surfaces of the cylinders This oil film also serves as a seal between the piston rings and cylinder walls to separate the combustion chamber in the cylinder head from the crankcase The oil then drips back down into the oil pan br Motor oil may also serve as a cooling agent In some engines oil is sprayed through a nozzle inside the crankcase onto the piston to provide cooling of specific parts that undergo high temperature strain On the other hand the thermal capacity of the oil pool has to be filled i e the oil has to reach its designed temperature range before it can protect the engine under high load This typically takes longer than heating the main cooling agent water or mixtures thereof up to its operating temperature In order to inform the driver about the oil temperature some older and most high performance or racing engines feature an oil thermometer br Continued operation of an internal combustion engine without adequate engine oil can cause damage to the engine first by wear and tear and in extreme cases by engine seizure where the lack of lubrication and cooling causes the engine to cease operation suddenly Engine seizure can cause extensive damage to the engine mechanisms br br br Non vehicle motor oils br An example is lubricating oil for four stroke or four cycle internal combustion engines such as those used in portable electricity generators and walk behind lawn mowers Another example is two stroke oil for lubrication of two stroke or two cycle internal combustion engines found in snow blowers chain saws model airplanes gasoline powered gardening equipment like hedge trimmers leaf blowers and soil cultivators Often these motors are not exposed to as wide of service temperature ranges as in vehicles so these oils may be single viscosity oils br In small two stroke engines the oil may be pre mixed with the gasoline or fuel often in a rich gasoline oil ratio of or and burned in use along with the gasoline Larger two stroke engines used in boats and motorcycles may have a more economical oil injection system rather than oil pre mixed into the gasoline The oil injection system is not used on small engines used in applications like snowblowers and trolling motors as the oil injection system is too expensive for small engines and would take up too much room on the equipment The oil properties will vary according to the individual needs of these devices Non smoking two stroke oils are composed of esters or polyglycols Environmental legislation for leisure marine applications especially in Europe encouraged the use of ester based two cycle oil br br br Properties br Most motor oils are made from a heavier thicker petroleum hydrocarbon base stock derived from crude oil with additives to improve certain properties The bulk of a typical motor oil consists of hydrocarbons with between and carbon atoms per molecule One of the most important properties of motor oil in maintaining a lubricating film between moving parts is its viscosity The viscosity of a liquid can be thought of as its thickness or a measure of its resistance to flow The viscosity must be high enough to maintain a lubricating film but low enough that the oil can flow around the engine parts under all conditions The viscosity index is a measure of how much the oil s viscosity changes as temperature changes A higher viscosity index indicates the viscosity changes less with temperature than a lower viscosity index br Motor oil must be able to flow adequately at the lowest temperature it is expected to experience in order to minimize metal to metal contact between moving parts upon starting up the engine The pour point defined first this property of motor oil as defined by ASTM D as an index of the lowest temperature of its utility for a given application but the cold cranking simulator CCS see ASTM D and mini rotary viscometer MRV see ASTM D ASTM D are today the properties required in motor oil specs and define the Society of Automotive Engineers SAE classifications br Oil is largely composed of hydrocarbons which can burn if ignited Still another important property of motor oil is its flash point the lowest temperature at which the oil gives off vapors which can ignite It is dangerous for the oil in a motor to ignite and burn so a high flash point is desirable At a petroleum refinery fractional distillation separates a motor oil fraction from other crude oil fractions removing the more volatile components and therefore increasing the oil s flash point reducing its tendency to burn br Another manipulated property of motor oil is its total base number TBN which is a measurement of the reserve alkalinity of an oil meaning its ability to neutralize acids The resulting quantity is determined as mg KOH gram of lubricant Analogously total acid number TAN is the measure of a lubricant s acidity Other tests include zinc phosphorus or sulfur content and testing for excessive foaming br The Noack volatility test ASTM D determines the physical evaporation loss of lubricants in high temperature service A maximum of evaporation loss is allowable to meet API SL and ILSAC GF specifications Some automotive OEM oil specifications require lower than br Table of thermal and physical properties of typical unused engine oil br br br Viscosity grades br br The Society of Automotive Engineers SAE has established a numerical code system for grading motor oils according to their viscosity characteristics known as SAE J This standard is commonly used throughout the world and standards organizations that do so include API and ACEA The grades include single grades such as SAE and also multi grades such as SAE W A multi grade consists of a winter grade specifying the viscosity at cold temperatures and a non winter grade specifying the viscosity at operating temperatures An engine oil using a polymeric viscosity index improver VII must be classified as multi grade br Breakdown of VIIs under shear is a concern in motorcycle applications where the transmission may share lubricating oil with the motor For this reason motorcycle specific oil is sometimes recommended The necessity of higher priced motorcycle specific oil has also been challenged by at least one consumer organization br br br Maintenance br br br br The oil and the oil filter need to be periodically replaced the process is called an oil change While there is an entire industry surrounding regular oil changes and maintenance an oil change is a relatively simple car maintenance operation that many car owners can do themselves It involves draining the oil from the engine into a drip pan replacing the filter and adding fresh oil br In engines there is some exposure of the oil to products of internal combustion and microscopic coke particles from black soot accumulate in the oil during operation Also the rubbing of metal engine parts produces some microscopic metallic particles from the wearing of the surfaces Such particles could circulate in the oil and grind against the part surfaces causing wear The oil filter removes many of the particles and sludge but eventually the oil filter can become clogged if used for extremely long periods br The motor oil and especially the additives also undergo thermal and mechanical degradation which reduces the viscosity and reserve alkalinity of the oil At reduced viscosity the oil is not as capable of lubricating the engine thus increasing wear and the chance of overheating Reserve alkalinity is the ability of the oil to resist the formation of acids Should the reserve alkalinity decline to zero those acids form and corrode the engine br Some engine manufacturers specify which Society of Automotive Engineers SAE viscosity grade of oil should be used but different viscosity motor oil may perform better based on the operating environment Many manufacturers have varying requirements and have designations for motor oil they require to be used This is driven by the EPA requirement that the same viscosity grade of oil used in the MPG test must be recommended to the customer This exclusive recommendation led to the elimination of informative charts depicting climate temperature range along with several corresponding oil viscosity grades being suggested br In general unless specified by the manufacturer thicker oils are not necessarily better than thinner oils heavy oils tend to stick longer to parts between two moving surfaces and this degrades the oil faster than a lighter oil that flows better allowing fresh oil in its place sooner Cold weather has a thickening effect on conventional oil and this is one reason thinner oils are manufacturer recommended in places with cold winters br Motor oil changes are usually scheduled based on the time in service or the distance that the vehicle has traveled These are rough indications of the real factors that control when an oil change is appropriate which include how long the oil has been run at elevated temperatures how many heating cycles the engine has been through and how hard the engine has worked The vehicle distance is intended to estimate the time at high temperature while the time in service is supposed to correlate with the number of vehicle trips and capture the number of heating cycles Oil does not degrade significantly just sitting in a cold engine On the other hand if a car is driven just for very short distances the oil will not fully heat up and it will accumulate contaminants such as water due to lack of sufficient heat to boil off the water Oil in this condition just sitting in an engine can cause problems br Also important is the quality of the oil used especially with synthetics synthetics are more stable than conventional oils Some manufacturers address this for example BMW and VW with their respective long life standards while others do not br Time based intervals account for the short trip drivers who drive short distances which build up more contaminants Manufacturers advise to not exceed their time or distance driven interval for a motor oil change Many modern cars now list somewhat higher intervals for changing oil and filter with the constraint of severe service requiring more frequent changes with less than ideal driving This applies to short trips of under kilometres mi where the oil does not get to full operating temperature long enough to boil off condensation excess fuel and other contamination that leads to sludge varnish acids or other deposits Many manufacturers have engine computer calculations to estimate the oil s condition based on the factors which degrade it such as RPM temperature and trip length one system adds an optical sensor for determining the clarity of the oil in the engine These systems are commonly known as oil life monitors or OLMs br Some quick oil change shops recommend intervals of kilometres mi or every three months this is not necessary according to many automobile manufacturers This has led to a campaign by the California EPA against the mile myth promoting vehicle manufacturer s recommendations for oil change intervals over those of the oil change industry br The engine user can in replacing the oil adjust the viscosity for the ambient temperature change thicker for summer heat and thinner for the winter cold Lower viscosity oils are common in newer vehicles br By the mid s recommended viscosities had moved down to W primarily to improve fuel efficiency A typical modern application would be Honda motor s use of W and in their newest vehicles W viscosity oil for kilometres mi Engine designs are evolving to allow the use of even lower viscosity oils without the risk of excessive metal to metal abrasion principally in the cam and valve mechanism areas In line with car manufacturers push towards these lower viscosities in search of better fuel economy on April the Society of Automotive Engineers SAE introduced an SAE viscosity rating a break from its traditional divisible by numbering system for its high temperature viscosity ratings that spanned from low viscosity SAE to high viscosity SAE br br br Standards br br br American Petroleum Institute API br Engine lubricants are evaluated against the American Petroleum Institute API SJ SL SM SN SP CH CI CI PLUS CJ CK and FA as well as International Lubricant Standardization and Approval Committee ILSAC GF GF GF GF A GF B and Cummins Mack and John Deere and other Original Equipment Manufacturers OEM requirements These evaluations include chemical and physical properties using bench test methods as well as actual running engine tests to quantify engine sludge oxidation component wear oil consumption piston deposits and fuel economy Originally S for spark ignition and C for compression as used with diesel engines Many oil producers still refer these categories in their marketing br The API sets minimum performance standards for lubricants Motor oil is used for the lubrication cooling and cleaning of internal combustion engines Motor oil may be composed of only a lubricant base stock in the case of mostly obsolete non detergent oil or a lubricant base stock plus additives to improve the oil s detergency extreme pressure performance and ability to inhibit corrosion of engine parts br br Groups br Lubricant base stocks are categorized into five groups by the API Group I base stocks are composed of fractionally distilled petroleum which is further refined with solvent extraction processes to improve certain properties such as oxidation resistance and to remove wax Poorly refined mineral oils that fail to meet the minimum VI of required in group I fit into Group V Group II base stocks are composed of fractionally distilled petroleum that has been hydrocracked to further refine and purify it Group III base stocks have similar characteristics to Group II base stocks except that Group III base stocks have higher viscosity indexes Group III base stocks are produced by further hydrocracking of either Group II base stocks or hydroisomerized slack wax a Group I and II dewaxing process by product Group IV base stock are polyalphaolefins PAOs Group V is a catch all group for any base stock not described by Groups I to IV Examples of group V base stocks include polyolesters POE polyalkylene glycols PAG and perfluoropolyalkylethers PFPAEs and poorly refined mineral oil Groups I and II are commonly referred to as mineral oils group III is typically referred to as synthetic except in Germany and Japan where they must not be called synthetic and group IV is a synthetic oil Group V base oils are so diverse that there is no catch all description br The API service classes have two general classifications S for service spark ignition typical passenger cars and light trucks using gasoline engines and C for commercial compression ignition typical diesel equipment Engine oil which has been tested and meets the API standards may display the API Service Symbol also known as the Donut with the service categories on containers sold to oil users br The latest API service category is API SP for gasoline automobile and light truck engines The SP standard refers to a group of laboratory and engine tests including the latest series for control of high temperature deposits Current API service categories include SP SN SM SL and SJ for gasoline engines All earlier service categories are obsolete Motorcycle oils commonly still use the SF SG standard though br All the current gasoline categories including the obsolete SH have placed limitations on the phosphorus content for certain SAE viscosity grades the xW xW due to the chemical poisoning that phosphorus has on catalytic converters Phosphorus is a key anti wear component in motor oil and is usually found in motor oil in the form of zinc dithiophosphate ZDDP Each new API category has placed successively lower phosphorus and zinc limits and thus has created a controversial issue of obsolescent oils needed for older engines especially engines with sliding flat cleave tappets API and ILSAC which represents most of the world s major automobile engine manufacturers state API SM ILSAC GF is fully backwards compatible and it is noted that one of the engine tests required for API SM the Sequence IVA is a sliding tappet design to test specifically for cam wear protection Not everyone is in agreement with backwards compatibility and in addition there are special situations such as performance engines or fully race built engines where the engine protection requirements are above and beyond API ILSAC requirements Because of this there are specialty oils out in the market place with higher than API allowed phosphorus levels Most engines built before have the flat cleave bearing style systems of construction which is sensitive to reducing zinc and phosphorus For example in API SG rated oils this was at the ppm level for zinc and phosphorus where the current SM is under ppm This reduction in anti wear chemicals in oil has caused premature failures of camshafts and other high pressure bearings in many older automobiles and has been blamed for premature failure of the oil pump drive cam position sensor gear that is meshed with camshaft gear in some modern engines br The current diesel engine service categories are API CK CJ CI PLUS CI CH and FA The previous service categories such as API CC or CD are obsolete API solved problems with API CI by creating a separate API CI PLUS category that contains some additional requirements this marking is located in the lower portion of the API Service Symbol Donut br API CK and FA have been introduced for model American engines API CK is backward compatible that means API CK oils are assumed to provide superior performance to oils made to previous categories and could be used without problems in all previous model engines but see Ford below br API FA oils are different that is why API decided to start a new group in addition to API Sx and API Cx API FA oils are formulated for enhanced fuel economy presented as reduced greenhouse gas emission To achieve that they are SAE xW oils blended to a high temperature high shear viscosity from cP to cP They are not suitable for all engines thus their use depends on the decision of each engine manufacturer They cannot be used with diesel fuel containing more than ppm sulfur br Cummins reacted to the introduction of API CK and API FA by issuing its CES list of API CK registered oils and CES list of API FA registered oils Valvoline oils are preferred br Ford recommends FA motor oil in its smaller diesel engines for example the F with the L diesel engine and the Transit with the L diesel engine The Ford specification number is WSS M C B br Ford recommends motor oils meeting the Ford specification WSS M C F in the L and L Ford diesel engines as well as older Ford diesel engines L L L and L Ford publishes a list of approved oils and most CK oils are on the list br While engine oils are formulated to meet a specific API service category they in fact conform closely enough to both the gasoline and diesel categories Thus diesel rated engine oils usually carry the relevant gasoline categories e g an API CJ oil could show either API SL or API SM on the container The rule is that the first mentioned category is fully met and the second one is fully met except where its requirements clash with the requirements of the first one br br br Motorcycle oil br The API oil classification structure has eliminated specific support for wet clutch motorcycle applications in their descriptors and API SJ and newer oils are referred to be specific to automobile and light truck use Accordingly motorcycle oils are subject to their own unique standards See JASO below As discussed above motorcycle oils commonly still use the obsolescent SF SG standard br br br ILSAC br The International Lubricant Standardization and Approval Committee ILSAC also has standards for motor oil Introduced in GF applies to SAE W W W W and W viscosity grade oils In general ILSAC works with API in creating the newest gasoline oil specification with ILSAC adding an extra requirement of fuel economy testing to their specification For GF a Sequence VIB Fuel Economy Test ASTM D is required that is not required in API service category SM br A key new test for GF which is also required for API SM is the Sequence IIIG which involves running a litres cu in GM L V at hp kW rpm and C F oil temperature for hours These are much more severe conditions than any API specified oil was designed for cars which typically push their oil temperature consistently above C F are most turbocharged engines along with most engines of European or Japanese origin particularly small capacity high power output br The IIIG test is about more difficult than the previous IIIF test used in GF and API SL oils Engine oils bearing the API starburst symbol since are ILSAC GF compliant br To help consumers recognize that an oil meets the ILSAC requirements API developed a starburst certification mark br A new set of specifications GF took effect in October The industry had one year to convert their oils to GF and in September ILSAC no longer offered licensing for GF br After nearly a decade of GF ILSAC released final GF specifications in with licensed sales to oil manufacturers and re branders to begin May There are two GF standards GF A being a progression and fully backwards compatible with GF and GF B specifically for SAE W viscosity oil br br br ACEA br The ACEA Association des Constructeurs Europ ens d Automobiles performance quality classifications A A tests used in Europe are arguably more stringent than the API and ILSAC standards CEC The Co ordinating European Council is the development body for fuel and lubricant testing in Europe and beyond setting the standards via their European Industry groups ACEA ATIEL ATC and CONCAWE br ACEA does not certify oils nor license nor register compliance certificates Oil manufacturers are themselves responsible for carrying out all oil testing and evaluation according to recognised engine lubricant industry standards and practices br Popular categories include A B and A B which are defined as Stable stay in grade Engine Oil intended for use in Passenger Car Light Duty Van Gasoline Diesel Engines with extended drain intervals A B is suitable only for engines designed to use low viscosities Category C oils are designated for use with catalysts and particulate filters while Category E is for heavy duty diesel br br br JASO br The Japanese Automotive Standards Organization JASO has created their own set of performance and quality standards for petrol engines of Japanese origin br For four stroke gasoline engines the JASO T standard is used and is particularly relevant to motorcycle engines The JASO T MA and MA standards are designed to distinguish oils that are approved for wet clutch use with MA lubricants delivering higher friction performance The JASO T MB standard denotes oils not suitable for wet clutch use and are therefore used in scooters equipped with continuously variable transmissions The addition of friction modifiers to JASO MB oils can contribute to greater fuel economy in these applications br For two stroke gasoline engines the JASO M FA FB FC FD standard is used and this refers particularly to low ash lubricity detergency low smoke and exhaust blocking br These standards especially JASO MA for motorcycles and JASO FC are designed to address oil requirement issues not addressed by the API service categories One element of the JASO MA standard is a friction test designed to determine suitability for wet clutch usage An oil that meets JASO MA is considered appropriate for wet clutch operations Oils marketed as motorcycle specific will carry the JASO MA label br br br ASTM br A American Society for Testing and Materials ASTM report stated that its year effort to come up with a new high temperature high shear HTHS standard was not successful Referring to SAE J the basis for current grading standards the report stated br br The rapid growth of non Newtonian multigraded oils has rendered kinematic viscosity as a nearly useless parameter for characterising real viscosity in critical zones of an engine There are those who are disappointed that the twelve year effort has not resulted in a redefinition of the SAE J Engine Oil Viscosity Classification document so as to express high temperature viscosity of the various grades In the view of this writer this redefinition did not occur because the automotive lubricant market knows of no field failures unambiguously attributable to insufficient HTHS oil viscosity br br br Manufacturer Specifications br Some current engine or vehicle manufacturers require a specific oil formula known as oil specs be used to add extra levels of protection for special engine designs materials and operating conditions Starting in the late s BMW for example came out with a spec called LL Long Life which requires special additives in oils that were approved to meet that spec BMW regularly develops new specs to meet the increasing demands of the EPA emission standards and MPG requirements as well as new engines Failure to use the correct specification oil has been known to cause PCV positive crankcase ventilation VVT variable valve timing system gasket and sealing system and other internal combustion component premature clogging and other failures Some of the additives in those specs are designed to aid in keeping systems lubricated and clean Some examples of BMW s other specs are LL LL fe LL LL LL fe European vehicle manufacturers have led the way for oil specs but Asian and American manufacturers have since joined in creating a need for oil change repair shops and dealerships to carry many different oils to avoid damages both mechanical and monetarily Examples of some VW specs are VW VW VW VW VW VW VW VW VW VW VW Mercedes Benz specs include MB MB MB MB MB MB MB br br br Other additives br br In addition to the viscosity index improvers motor oil manufacturers often include other additives such as detergents and dispersants to help keep the engine clean by minimizing sludge buildup corrosion inhibitors and alkaline additives to neutralize acidic oxidation products of the oil Most commercial oils have a minimal amount of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate as an anti wear additive to protect contacting metal surfaces with zinc and other compounds in case of metal to metal contact The quantity of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate is limited to minimize adverse effect on catalytic converters Another aspect for after treatment devices is the deposition of oil ash which increases the exhaust back pressure and reduces fuel economy over time The so called chemical box limits today the concentrations of sulfur ash and phosphorus SAP br There are other additives available commercially which can be added to the oil by the user for purported additional benefit Some of these additives include br br Antiwear additives like zinc dialkyldithiophosphate ZDDP and its alternatives due to phosphorus limits in some specifications Calcium sulfonates additives are also added to protect motor oil from oxidative breakdown and to prevent the formation of sludge and varnish deposits Both were the main basis of additive packages used by lubricant manufacturers up until the s when the need for ashless additives arose Main advantage was very low price and wide availability sulfonates were originally waste byproducts Currently there are ashless oil lubricants without these additives which can only fulfill the qualities of the previous generation with more expensive basestock and more expensive organic or organometallic additive compounds Some new oils are not formulated to provide the level of protection of previous generations to save manufacturing costs br Some molybdenum disulfide containing additives to lubricating oils are claimed to reduce friction bond to metal or have anti wear properties MoS particles can be shear welded on steel surface and some engine components were even treated with MoS layer during manufacture namely liners in engines Trabant for example They were used in World War II in flight engines and became commercial after World War II until the s They were commercialized in the s ELF ANTAR Molygraphite and are today still available Liqui Moly MoS W Main disadvantage of molybdenum disulfide is anthracite black color so oil treated with it is hard to distinguish from a soot filled engine oil with metal shavings from spun crankshaft bearing br In the s and s additives with suspended PTFE particles were available e g Slick to consumers to increase motor oil s ability to coat and protect metal surfaces There is controversy as to the actual effectiveness of these products as they can coagulate and clog the oil filter and tiny oil passages in the engine It is supposed to work under boundary lubricating conditions which good engine designs tend to avoid anyway Also Teflon alone has little to no ability to firmly stick on a sheared surface unlike molybdenum disulfide for example br Many patents proposed use perfluoropolymers to reduce friction between metal parts such as PTFE Teflon or micronized PTFE However the application obstacle of PTFE is insolubility in lubricant oils Their application is questionable and depends mainly on the engine design one that can not maintain reasonable lubricating conditions might benefit while properly designed engine with oil film thick enough would not see any difference PTFE is a very soft material thus its friction coefficient becomes worse than that of hardened steel to steel mating surfaces under common loads PTFE is used in composition of sliding bearings where it improves lubrication under relatively light load until the oil pressure builds up to full hydrodynamic lubricating conditions br Some molybdenum disulfide containing oils may be unsuitable for motorcycles which share wet clutch lubrication with the engine br br br Environmental effects br br Due to its chemical composition worldwide dispersion and effects on the environment used motor oil is considered a serious environmental problem Most current motor oil lubricants contain petroleum base stocks which are toxic to the environment and difficult to dispose of after use Over of the pollution in America s waterways is from used motor oil Used oil is considered the largest source of oil pollution in the U S harbors and waterways at ML US gal per year mostly from improper disposal By far the greatest cause of motor oil pollution in oceans comes from drains and urban street runoff much of it caused by improper disposal of engine oil One US gallon L of used oil can generate a m acres slick on surface water threatening fish waterfowl and other aquatic life According to the U S EPA films of oil on the surface of water prevent the replenishment of dissolved oxygen impair photosynthetic processes and block sunlight Toxic effects of used oil on freshwater and marine organisms vary but significant long term effects have been found at concentrations of ppm in several freshwater fish species and as low as ppm in marine life forms Motor oil can have an incredibly detrimental effect on the environment particularly to plants that depend on healthy soil to grow There are three main ways that motor oil affects plants br br contaminating water supplies br contaminating soil br poisoning plants br Used motor oil dumped on land reduces soil productivity Improperly disposed used oil ends up in landfills sewers backyards or storm drains where soil groundwater and drinking water may become contaminated br br br Synthetic oils br br Synthetic lubricants were first made in significant quantities as replacements for mineral lubricants and fuels by German scientists in the late s and early s because of their insufficient quantities of crude needed to fight in World War II A significant factor in their gain in popularity was the ability of synthetic based lubricants to remain fluid in very low temperatures such as those encountered on Germany s eastern front which caused petroleum based lubricants to solidify owing to their higher wax content The use of synthetic lubricants widened through the s and s owing to a property at the other end of the temperature spectrum the ability to lubricate aviation engines at high temperatures that caused mineral based lubricants to break down In the mid s synthetic motor oils were formulated and commercially applied for the first time in automotive applications The same SAE system for designating motor oil viscosity also applies to synthetic oils br Synthetic oils are derived from either Group III Group IV or some Group V bases Synthetics include classes of lubricants like synthetic esters Group V as well as others like GTL methane gas to liquid Group III and polyalpha olefins Group IV Higher purity and therefore better property control theoretically means synthetic oil has better mechanical properties at extremes of high and low temperatures The molecules are made large and soft enough to retain good viscosity at higher temperatures yet branched molecular structures interfere with solidification and therefore allow flow at lower temperatures Thus although the viscosity still decreases as temperature increases these synthetic motor oils have a higher viscosity index over the traditional petroleum base Their specially designed properties allow a wider temperature range at higher and lower temperatures and often include a lower pour point With their improved viscosity index synthetic oils need lower levels of viscosity index improvers which are the oil components most vulnerable to thermal and mechanical degradation as the oil ages and thus they do not degrade as quickly as traditional motor oils However they still fill up with particulate matter although the matter better suspends within the oil and the oil filter still fills and clogs up over time So periodic oil and filter changes should still be done with synthetic oil but some synthetic oil suppliers suggest that the intervals between oil changes can be longer sometimes as long as kilometres mi primarily due to reduced degradation by oxidation br Tests show that fully synthetic oil is superior in extreme service conditions to conventional oil and may perform better for longer under standard conditions But in the vast majority of vehicle applications mineral oil based lubricants fortified with additives and with the benefit of over a century of development continue to be the predominant lubricant for most internal combustion engine applications br br br Bio based oils br Bio based oils existed prior to the development of petroleum based oils in the th century They have become the subject of renewed interest with the advent of bio fuels and the push for green products The development of canola based motor oils began in in order to pursue environmentally friendly products Purdue University has funded a project to develop and test such oils Test results indicate satisfactory performance from the oils tested A review on the status of bio based motor oils and base oils globally as well as in the U S shows how bio based lubricants show promise in augmenting the current petroleum based supply of lubricating materials as well as replacing it in many cases br The USDA National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research developed an Estolide lubricant technology made from vegetable and animal oils Estolides have shown great promise in a wide range of applications including engine lubricants Working with the USDA a California based company Biosynthetic Technologies has developed a high performance drop in biosynthetic oil using Estolide technology for use in motor oils and industrial lubricants This biosynthetic oil American Petroleum Institute API has the potential to greatly reduce environmental challenges associated with petroleum Independent testing not only shows biosynthetic oils to be among the highest rated products for protecting engines and machinery they are also bio based biodegradable non toxic and do not bioaccumulate in marine organisms Also motor oils and lubricants formulated with biosynthetic base oils can be recycled and re refined with petroleum based oils The U S based company Green Earth Technologies manufactures a bio based motor oil called G Oil made from animal oils br br br Future br A new process to break down polyethylene a common plastic product found in many consumer containers converts it into a paraffin like wax with the correct molecular properties for conversion into a lubricant avoiding the expensive Fischer Tropsch process The plastic is melted and then pumped into a furnace The heat of the furnace breaks down the molecular chains of polyethylene into wax Finally the wax is subjected to a catalytic process that alters the wax s molecular structure leaving a clear oil br br Biodegradable motor oils based on esters or hydrocarbon ester blends appeared in the s followed by formulations beginning in which respond to the bio no tox criteria of the European preparations directive EC This means that they not only are biodegradable according to OECD x test methods but also the aquatic toxicities fish algae daphnia are each above mg L br Another class of base oils suited for engine oil are the polyalkylene glycols They offer zero ash bio no tox properties and lean burn characteristics br br br Re refined motor oil br br The oil in a motor oil product does break down and burns as it is used in an engine it also gets contaminated with particles and chemicals that make it a less effective lubricant Re refining cleans the contaminants and used additives out of the dirty oil From there this clean base stock is blended with some virgin base stock and a new additives package to make a finished lubricant product that can be just as effective as lubricants made with all virgin oil The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA defines re refined products as containing at least re refined base stock but other standards are significantly higher The California State public contract code defines a re refined motor oil as one that contains at least re refined base stock br br br Packaging br br Motor oils were sold at retail in glass bottles metal cans and metal cardboard cans before the advent of the current polyethylene plastic bottle which began to appear in the early s Reusable spouts were made separately from the cans with a
