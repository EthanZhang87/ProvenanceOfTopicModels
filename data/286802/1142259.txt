Balance shafts are used in piston engines to reduce vibration by cancelling out unbalanced dynamic forces The counter balance shafts have eccentric weights and rotate in opposite direction to each other which generates a net vertical force br The balance shaft was invented and patented by British engineer Frederick W Lanchester in It is most commonly used in inline four and V engines used in automobiles and motorcycles br br br Overview br br The operating principle of a balance shaft system is that two shafts carrying identical eccentric weights rotate in opposite directions at twice the engine speed The phasing of the shafts is such that the centrifugal forces produced by the weights cancel the vertical second order forces at twice the engine RPM produced by the engine The horizontal forces produced by the balance shafts are equal and opposite and so cancel each other br The balance shafts do not reduce the vibrations experienced by the crankshaft br br br Applications br br br Two cylinder engines br Numerous motorcycle engines particularly parallel twin engines have employed balance shaft systems for example the Yamaha TRX and Yamaha TDM engines have a crankshaft with a balance shaft An alternative approach as used by the BMW GS parallel twin is to use a dummy connecting rod which moves a hinged counterweight br br br Four cylinder engines br br Balance shafts are often used in inline four engines to reduce the second order vibration a vertical force oscillating at twice the engine RPM that is inherent in the design of a typical inline four engine This vibration is generated because the movement of the connecting rods in an even firing inline four engine is not symmetrical throughout the crankshaft rotation thus during a given period of crankshaft rotation the descending and ascending pistons are not always completely opposed in their acceleration giving rise to a net vertical force twice in each revolution which increases quadratically with RPM br The amount of vibration also increases with engine displacement resulting in balance shafts often being used in inline four engines with displacements of L cu in or more Both an increased stroke or bore cause an increased secondary vibration a larger stroke increases the difference in acceleration and a larger bore increases the mass of the pistons br The Lanchester design of balance shaft systems was refined with the Mitsubishi Astron an inline four car engine introduced in This engine was the first to locate one balance shaft higher than the other to counteract the second order rolling couple i e about the crankshaft axis due to the torque exerted by the inertia caused by increases and decreases in engine speed br In a flat four engine the forces are cancelled out by the pistons moving in opposite directions Therefore balance shafts are not needed in flat four engines br br br Five cylinder engines br Balance shafts are also used in straight five engines such as GM Vortec br br br Six cylinder engines br In a straight six engine and flat six engine the rocking forces are naturally balanced out therefore balance shafts are not required br V engines are inherently unbalanced regardless of the V angle Any inline engine with an odd number of cylinders has a primary imbalance which causes an end to end rocking motion As each cylinder bank in a V has three cylinders each cylinder bank experiences this motion Balance shaft s are used on various V engines to reduce this rocking motion br br br Eight cylinder engines br Examples are the Mercedes Benz OM and Volvo B S engine br br br See also br Balancing machine br Engine balance br br br
