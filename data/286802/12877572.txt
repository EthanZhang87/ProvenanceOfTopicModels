id: 12877572
A fan is a powered machine used to create a flow of air A fan consists of a rotating arrangement of vanes or blades generally made of wood plastic or metal which act on the air The rotating assembly of blades and hub is known as an impeller rotor or runner Usually it is contained within some form of housing or case This may direct the airflow or increase safety by preventing objects from contacting the fan blades Most fans are powered by electric motors but other sources of power may be used including hydraulic motors handcranks and internal combustion engines br Mechanically a fan can be any revolving vane or vanes used for producing currents of air Fans produce air flows with high volume and low pressure although higher than ambient pressure as opposed to compressors which produce high pressures at a comparatively low volume A fan blade will often rotate when exposed to an air fluid stream and devices that take advantage of this such as anemometers and wind turbines often have designs similar to that of a fan br Typical applications include climate control and personal thermal comfort e g an electric table or floor fan vehicle engine cooling systems e g in front of a radiator machinery cooling systems e g inside computers and audio power amplifiers ventilation fume extraction winnowing e g separating chaff from cereal grains removing dust e g sucking as in a vacuum cleaner drying usually in combination with a heat source and providing draft for a fire Some fans may be indirectly used for cooling in the case of industrial heat exchangers br While fans are effective at cooling people they do not cool air but rather work by evaporative cooling of sweat and increased heat convection into the surrounding air due to the airflow from the fans Thus fans may become less effective at cooling the body if the surrounding air is near body temperature and contains high humidity br br br History br br The punkah fan was used in India about BCE It was a handheld fan made from bamboo strips or other plant fiber that could be rotated or fanned to move air During British rule the word came to be used by Anglo Indians to mean a large swinging flat fan fixed to the ceiling and pulled by a servant called the punkawallah br For purposes of air conditioning the Han dynasty craftsman and engineer Ding Huan fl CE invented a manually operated rotary fan with seven wheels that measured m ft in diameter in the th century during the Tang dynasty the Chinese applied hydraulic power to rotate the fan wheels for air conditioning while the rotary fan became even more common during the Song dynasty br During the Heian period in Japan fans adapted the role of symbolizing social class as well as a mechanical role The tessen a Japanese fan used in Feudal times was a dangerous weapon hidden in plain sight in the shape of a regular fan a weapon used by samurais when katanas were not ideal br In the th century the experiments of scientists including Otto von Guericke Robert Hooke and Robert Boyle established the basic principles of vacuum and airflow The English architect Sir Christopher Wren applied an early ventilation system in the Houses of Parliament that used bellows to circulate air Wren s design was the catalyst for much later improvement and innovation The first rotary fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the th century as illustrated by Georg Agricola br John Theophilus Desaguliers a British engineer demonstrated the successful use of a fan system to draw out stagnant air from coal mines in ventilation was particularly important in coal mines to prevent asphyxiation and soon afterwards he installed a similar apparatus in Parliament The civil engineer John Smeaton and later John Buddle installed reciprocating air pumps in the mines in the North of England though the machinery was liable to breaking down br br br Steam br In a m radius steam driven fan designed by William Brunton was made operational in the Gelly Gaer Colliery of South Wales The model was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of Also in David Boswell Reid a Scottish doctor installed four steam powered fans in the ceiling of St George s Hospital in Liverpool so that the pressure produced by the fans would force the incoming air upward and through vents in the ceiling Improvements in the technology were made by James Nasmyth Frenchman Theophile Guibal and J R Waddle br br br Electrical br br Between and Schuyler Wheeler invented a fan powered by electricity It was commercially marketed by the American firm Crocker Curtis electric motor company In a desktop direct drive electric fan was commercially available by Stout Meadowcraft Co in New York br In Philip Diehl developed the world s first electric ceiling mounted fan During this intense period of innovation fans powered by alcohol oil or kerosene were common around the turn of the th century br In KDK of Japan pioneered the invention of mass produced electric fans for home use In the s industrial advances allowed steel fans to be mass produced in different shapes bringing fan prices down and allowing more homeowners to afford them In the s the first art deco fan the Silver Swan was designed by Emerson By the s Crompton Greaves of India became the world s largest manufacturer of electric ceiling fans mainly for sale in India Asia and the Middle East By the s table and stand fans were manufactured in bright colors and eye catching br Window and central air conditioning in the s caused many companies to discontinue production of fans but in the mid s with an increasing awareness of the cost of electricity and the amount of energy used to heat and cool homes turn of the century styled ceiling fans became popular again as both decorative and energy efficient br In William Fairbank and Walter K Boyd invented the high volume low speed HVLS ceiling fan designed to reduce energy consumption by using long fan blades rotating at low speed to move a relatively large volume of air br br br Social implications br Before powered fans were widely accessible their use related to the social divide between social classes In Britain and China they were initially only installed in the buildings of Parliament and in noble homes In Ancient Egypt BC servants were required to fan Pharaohs and important figures br In parts of the world such as India where the temperature reaches above F C standing and electric box fans are essential in the business world for customer comfort and an efficient work environment Fans have become solar powered energy efficient and battery powered in places with unreliable energy sources br In South Korea fans play a part in an old wives tale Many older South Korean citizens believe in the unscientific and unsupported myth of fan death due to excessive use of an electric fan Korean electric fans usually turn off after a few hours to protect from fan death br Typical room electrical fans consume to watts of power while air conditioning units use to watts fans use less electricity but do not cool the air simply providing evaporative cooling of sweat Commercial fans are louder than AC units and can be to disruptively loud According to the U S Consumer Product Safety Commission reported incidents related to box fans include fire incidents potential fire incidents electrocution electric shock incidents and electrical hazard incidents Injuries related to AC units mostly relate to their falling from buildings br br br Types br br Mechanical revolving blade fans are made in a wide range of designs They are used on the floor table desk or hung from the ceiling ceiling fan and can be built into a window wall roof etc Electronic systems generating significant heat such as computers incorporate fans Appliances such as hair dryers and space heaters also use fans They move air in air conditioning systems and in automotive engines Fans used for comfort inside a room create a wind chill by increasing the heat transfer coefficient but do not lower temperatures directly Fans used to cool electrical equipment or in engines or other machines do cool the equipment directly by exhausting hot air into the cooler environment outside of the machine so that cooler air flows in br There are three main types of fans used for moving air axial centrifugal also called radial and cross flow also called tangential The American Society of Mechanical Engineers Performance Testing Code PTC provides standard procedures for conducting and reporting tests on fans including those of the centrifugal axial and mixed flows br br br Axial flow br br Axial flow fans have blades that force air to move parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate This type of fan is used in a wide variety of applications ranging from small cooling fans for electronics to the giant fans used in cooling towers Axial flow fans are applied in air conditioning and industrial process applications Standard axial flow fans have diameters of mm or mm and work under pressures up to Pa Special types of fans are used as low pressure compressor stages in aircraft engines br Examples of axial fans are br br Table fan Basic elements of a typical table fan include the fan blade base armature and lead wires motor blade guard motor housing oscillator gearbox and oscillator shaft The oscillator is a mechanism that motions the fan from side to side The armature axle shaft comes out on both ends of the motor one end of the shaft is attached to the blade and the other is attached to the oscillator gearbox The motor case joins to the gearbox to contain the rotor and stator The oscillator shaft combines the weighted base and the gearbox A motor housing covers the oscillator mechanism The blade guard joins to the motor case for safety br Domestic extractor fan Wall or ceiling mounted the domestic extractor fan is employed to remove moisture and stale air from domestic dwellings Bathroom extractor fans typically utilize a four inch mm impeller whilst kitchen extractor fans typically use a six inch mm impeller as the room itself is often bigger Axial fans with five inch mm impellers are also used in larger bathrooms though are much less common Domestic axial extractor fans are not suitable for duct runs over m or m depending on the number of bends in the run as the increased air pressure in longer pipework inhibits the performance of the fan br Continuous running extractor fans run continuously at a very slow rate running fast when necessary for example when a bathroom light is switched on At working speed they are just normal extractor fans At continuous speed they extract typically to l sec and use little electricity or watts for low annual cost Some have humidity sensors to control trickle operation They have the advantage of ensuring ventilation and preventing build up of humidity Alternatively a normal extractor fan may be fitted to operate intermittently at full power for the same purpose In cold weather they may have noticeably cool the room they are in or if the door is open the house br Electro mechanical fans Among collectors are rated according to their condition size age and number of blades Four blade designs are the most common Five blade or six blade designs are rare The materials from which the components are made such as brass are important factors in fan desirability br Ceiling fan is a fan suspended from the ceiling of a room Most ceiling fans rotate at relatively low speeds and being inaccessible to reach do not have blade guards Ceiling fans are used in both residential and industrial commercial settings br In automobiles a mechanical or electrically driven fan provides engine cooling and prevents the engine from overheating by blowing or drawing air through a coolant filled radiator The fan may be driven with a belt and pulley off the engine s crankshaft or an electric motor switched on or off by a thermostatic switch br Computer fan for cooling electrical components and in laptop coolers br Fans inside audio power amplifiers help to draw heat away from the electrical components br Variable pitch fan A variable pitch fan is used where precise control of static pressure within supply ducts is required The blades are arranged to rotate upon a control pitch hub The fan wheel will spin at a constant speed The blades follow the control pitch hub As the hub moves toward the rotor the blades increase their angle of attack and an increase in flow results br br br Centrifugal br br Often called a squirrel cage because of its general similarity in appearance to exercise wheels for pet rodents or scroll fan the centrifugal fan has a moving component called an impeller that consists of a central shaft about which a set of blades that form a spiral or ribs are positioned Centrifugal fans blow air at right angles to the intake of the fan and spin the air outwards to the outlet by deflection and centrifugal force The impeller rotates causing air to enter the fan near the shaft and move perpendicularly from the shaft to the opening in the scroll shaped fan casing A centrifugal fan produces more pressure for a given air volume and is used where this is desirable such as in leaf blowers blowdryers air mattress inflators inflatable structures climate control in air handling units and various industrial purposes They are typically noisier than comparable axial fans although some types of centrifugal fans are quieter such as in air handling units br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Cross flow br br The cross flow or tangential fan sometimes known as a tubular fan was patented in by Paul Mortier and is used extensively in heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC especially in ductless split air conditioners The fan is usually long relative to its diameter so the flow remains approximately two dimensional away from the ends The cross flow fan uses an impeller with forward curved blades placed in a housing consisting of a rear wall and a vortex wall Unlike radial machines the main flow moves transversely across the impeller passing the blading twice br The flow within a cross flow fan may be broken up into three distinct regions a vortex region near the fan discharge called an eccentric vortex the through flow region and a paddling region directly opposite Both the vortex and paddling regions are dissipative and as a result only a portion of the impeller imparts usable work on the flow The cross flow fan or transverse fan is thus a two stage partial admission machine The popularity of the crossflow fan in HVAC comes from its compactness shape quiet operation and ability to provide a high pressure coefficient Effectively a rectangular fan in terms of inlet and outlet geometry the diameter readily scales to fit the available space and the length is adjustable to meet flow rate requirements for the particular application br Common household tower fans are also cross flow fans Much of the early work focused on developing the cross flow fan for both high and low flow rate conditions and resulted in numerous patents Key contributions were made by Coester Ilberg and Sadeh Porter and Markland and Eck One interesting phenomenon particular to the cross flow fan is that as the blades rotate the local air incidence angle changes The result is that in certain positions the blades act as compressors pressure increase while at other azimuthal locations the blades act as turbines pressure decrease br Since the flow both enters and exits the impeller radially the crossflow fan has been studied and prototyped for potential aircraft applications Due to the two dimensional nature of the flow the fan can be integrated into a wing for use in both thrust production and boundary layer control A configuration that utilizes a crossflow fan is located at the wing leading edge is the FanWing design concept initially developed around and under development by a company of the same name This design creates lift by deflecting the wake downward due to the rotational direction of the fan causing a large Magnus force similar to a spinning leading edge cylinder Another configuration utilizing a crossflow fan for thrust and flow control is the propulsive wing another experimental concept prototype initially developed in the s and s In this design the crossflow fan is placed near the trailing edge of a thick wing and draws the air of the wing s suction top surface By doing this the propulsive wing is nearly stall free even at extremely high angles of attack producing very high lift However the fanwing and propulsive wing concepts remain experimental and have only been used for unmanned prototypes br A cross flow fan is a centrifugal fan in which the air flows straight through the fan instead of at a right angle The rotor of a cross flow fan is covered to create a pressure differential Cross flow fans are made to have a double circular arc rear wall with a thick vortex wall that decreases in radial gap The gap decreases in the direction of the fans impeller rotation The rear wall has a log spiral profile while the vortex stabilizer is a horizontal thin wall with rounded edge The resultant pressure difference allows air to flow straight through the fan even though the fan blades counter the flow of air on one side of the rotation Cross flow fans give airflow along the entire width of the fan however they are noisier than ordinary centrifugal fans Cross flow fans are often used in ductless air conditioners air doors in some types of laptop coolers in automobile ventilation systems and for cooling in medium sized equipment such as photocopiers br br br Bladeless fans br br Dyson Air Multiplier fans introduced to the consumer market in have popularized a design by Toshiba that produces a fan that has no exposed fan blades or other visibly moving parts unless augmented by other features such as for oscillation and directional adjustment A relatively small quantity of air from a high pressure bladed impeller fan which is contained inside the base rather than exposed induces the slower flow of a larger airmass through a circular or oval shaped opening via a low pressure area created by an airfoil surface shape the Coand effect br Air curtains and air doors also utilize this effect to help retain warm or cool air within an otherwise exposed area that lacks a cover or door Air curtains are commonly used on open face dairy freezer and vegetable displays to help retain chilled air within the cabinet using a laminar airflow circulated across the display opening The airflow is typically generated by a mechanical fan of any type described in this article hidden in the base of the display cabinet HVAC linear slot diffusers also utilize this effect to increase airflow evenly in rooms compared to registers while reducing the energy used by the air handling unit blower br br br Installation br Fans may be installed in various ways according to the application They are often used in a free installation without any housing of any kind There are also some specialised installations br br br Ducted fan br In vehicles a ducted fan is a method of propulsion in which a fan propeller or rotor is surrounded by an aerodynamic duct or shroud which enhances its performance to create aerodynamic thrust or lift to transport the vehicle br br br Jet fan br In ventilation systems a jet fan also known as an impulse or induction fan ejects a stream of air which entrains ambient air along with it in order to circulate the ambient air The system takes up less space than conventional ventilation ducting and can significantly increase the rates of inflow of fresh air and expulsion of stale air br br br Noise br Fans generate noise from the rapid flow of air around blades and obstacles causing vortexes and from the motor Fan noise is roughly proportional to the fifth power of fan speed halving speed reduces noise by about dB br The perceived loudness of fan noise also depends on the frequency distribution of the noise This in turn depends on the shape and distribution of moving parts especially of the blades and of stationary parts struts in particular Like with tire treads and similar to the principle of acoustic diffusors an irregular shape and distribution can flatten the noise spectrum making the noise sound less disturbing br The inlet shape of the fan can also influence the noise levels generated by the fan br br br Fan motor drive methods br br Standalone fans are usually powered by an electric motor often attached directly to the motor s output with no gears or belts The motor is either hidden in the fan s center hub or extends behind it For big industrial fans three phase asynchronous motors are commonly used may be placed near the fan and drive it through a belt and pulleys Smaller fans are often powered by shaded pole AC motors or brushed or brushless DC motors AC powered fans usually use mains voltage while DC powered fans typically use low voltage typically V V or V br In machines with a rotating part the fan is often connected to it rather than being powered separately This is commonly seen in motor vehicles with internal combustion engines large cooling systems locomotives and winnowing machines where the fan is connected to the drive shaft or through a belt and pulleys Another common configuration is a dual shaft motor where one end of the shaft drives a mechanism while the other has a fan mounted on it to cool the motor itself Window air conditioners commonly use a dual shaft fan to operate separate fans for the interior and exterior parts of the device br Where electrical power or rotating parts are not readily available fans may be driven by other methods High pressure gases such as steam can be used to drive a small turbine and high pressure liquids can be used to drive a pelton wheel either of which can provide the rotational drive for a fan br Large slow moving energy sources such as a flowing river can also power a fan using a water wheel and a series of step down gears or pulleys to increase the rotational speed to that which is required for efficient fan operation br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Solar power br Electric fans used for ventilation may be powered by solar panels instead of mains current This is an attractive option because once the capital costs of the solar panel have been covered the resulting electricity is free If ventilation needs are greatest during sunny weather a solar powered fan can be a suitable choice br A typical example uses a detached watt in in cm cm solar panel and is supplied with appropriate brackets cables and connectors It can be used to ventilate up to square feet m of area and can move air at up to cubic feet per minute L s Because of the wide availability of V brushless DC electric motors and the convenience of wiring such a low voltage such fans usually operate on volts br The detached solar panel is typically installed in the spot which gets most of the sunlight and then connected to the fan mounted as far as feet m away Other permanently mounted and small portable fans include an integrated non detachable solar panel br br br See also br br br br br br External links
