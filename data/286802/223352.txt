An alternator is an electrical generator that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy in the form of alternating current For reasons of cost and simplicity most alternators use a rotating magnetic field with a stationary armature Occasionally a linear alternator or a rotating armature with a stationary magnetic field is used In principle any AC electrical generator can be called an alternator but usually the term refers to small rotating machines driven by automotive and other internal combustion engines br An alternator that uses a permanent magnet for its magnetic field is called a magneto Alternators in power stations driven by steam turbines are called turbo alternators Large or Hz three phase alternators in power plants generate most of the world s electric power which is distributed by electric power grids br br br History br br Alternating current generating systems were known in simple forms from the discovery of the magnetic induction of electric current in the s Rotating generators naturally produced alternating current but since there was little use for it it was normally converted into direct current via the addition of a commutator in the generator The early machines were developed by pioneers such as Michael Faraday and Hippolyte Pixii Faraday developed the rotating rectangle whose operation was heteropolar each active conductor passed successively through regions where the magnetic field was in opposite directions Lord Kelvin and Sebastian Ferranti also developed early alternators producing frequencies between and Hz br The late s saw the introduction of first large scale electrical systems with central generation stations to power Arc lamps used to light whole streets factory yards or the interior of large warehouses Some such as Yablochkov arc lamps introduced in ran better on alternating current and the development of these early AC generating systems was accompanied by the first use of the word alternator Supplying the proper amount of voltage from generating stations in these early systems was left up to the engineer s skill in riding the load In the Ganz Works invented the constant voltage generator that could produce a stated output voltage regardless of the value of the actual load The introduction of transformers in the mid s led to the widespread use of alternating current and the use of alternators needed to produce it After polyphase alternators were introduced to supply currents of multiple differing phases Later alternators were designed for various alternating current frequencies between sixteen and about one hundred hertz for use with arc lighting incandescent lighting and electric motors Specialized radio frequency alternators like the Alexanderson alternator were developed as longwave radio transmitters around World War and used in a few high power wireless telegraphy stations before vacuum tube transmitters replaced them br br br Principle of operation br br A conductor moving relative to a magnetic field develops an electromotive force EMF in it Faraday s Law This EMF reverses its polarity when it moves under magnetic poles of opposite polarity Typically a rotating magnet called the rotor turns within a stationary set of conductors called the stator wound in coils on an iron core The field cuts across the conductors generating an induced EMF electromotive force as the mechanical input causes the rotor to turn br The rotating magnetic field induces an AC voltage in the stator windings Since the currents in the stator windings vary in step with the position of the rotor an alternator is a synchronous generator br The rotor s magnetic field may be produced by permanent magnets or by a field coil electromagnet Automotive alternators use a rotor winding which allows control of the alternator s generated voltage by varying the current in the rotor field winding Permanent magnet machines avoid the loss due to magnetizing current in the rotor but are restricted in size due to the cost of the magnet material Since the permanent magnet field is constant the terminal voltage varies directly with the speed of the generator Brushless AC generators are usually larger than those used in automotive applications br An automatic voltage control device controls the field current to keep output voltage constant If the output voltage from the stationary armature coils drops due to an increase in demand more current is fed into the rotating field coils through the voltage regulator VR This increases the magnetic field around the field coils which induces a greater voltage in the armature coils Thus the output voltage is brought back up to its original value br Alternators used in central power stations also control the field current to regulate reactive power and to help stabilize the power system against the effects of momentary faults Often there are three sets of stator windings physically offset so that the rotating magnetic field produces a three phase current displaced by one third of a period with respect to each other br br br Synchronous speeds br One cycle of alternating current is produced each time a pair of field poles passes over a point on the stationary winding The relation between speed and frequency is br br br br N br br br f br br br br P br br br displaystyle N f P br br where br br br br f br br br displaystyle f br br is the frequency in Hz cycles per second br br br br P br br br displaystyle P br br is the number of poles and br br br br N br br br displaystyle N br br is the rotational speed in revolutions per minute r min Very old descriptions of alternating current systems sometimes give the frequency in terms of alternations per minute counting each half cycle as one alternation so alternations per minute corresponds to Hz br The output frequency of an alternator depends on the number of poles and the rotational speed The speed corresponding to a particular frequency is called the synchronous speed for that frequency This table gives some examples br br br Classifications br Alternators may be classified by method of excitation number of phases the type of rotation cooling method and their application br br br By excitation br There are two main ways to produce the magnetic field used in the alternators by using permanent magnets which create their own persistent magnetic field or by using field coils The alternators that use permanent magnets are specifically called magnetos br In other alternators wound field coils form an electromagnet to produce the rotating magnetic field br A device that uses permanent magnets to produce alternating current is called a permanent magnet alternator PMA A permanent magnet generator PMG may produce either alternating current or direct current if it has a commutator br br br Direct connected direct current DC generator br This method of excitation consists of a smaller direct current DC generator fixed on the same shaft with the alternator The DC generator generates a small amount of electricity just enough to excite the field coils of the connected alternator to generate electricity A variation of this system is a type of alternator which uses direct current from a battery for initial excitation upon start up after which the alternator becomes self excited br br br Transformation and rectification br This method depends on residual magnetism retained in the iron core to generate weak magnetic field which would allow a weak voltage to be generated This voltage is used to excite the field coils for the alternator to generate stronger voltage as part of its build up process After the initial AC voltage buildup the field is supplied with rectified voltage from the alternator br br br Brushless alternators br A brushless alternator is composed of two alternators built end to end on one shaft Until alternators used brushes with rotating field With advancement in semiconductor technology brushless alternators are possible Smaller brushless alternators may look like one unit but the two parts are readily identifiable on the large versions The larger of the two sections is the main alternator and the smaller one is the exciter The exciter has stationary field coils and a rotating armature power coils The main alternator uses the opposite configuration with a rotating field and stationary armature A bridge rectifier called the rotating rectifier assembly is mounted on the rotor Neither brushes nor slip rings are used which reduces the number of wearing parts The main alternator has a rotating field as described above and a stationary armature power generation windings br Varying the amount of current through the stationary exciter field coils varies the phase output from the exciter This output is rectified by a rotating rectifier assembly mounted on the rotor and the resultant DC supplies the rotating field of the main alternator and hence alternator output The result of all this is that a small DC exciter current indirectly controls the output of the main alternator br br br By number of phases br br Another way to classify alternators is by the number of phases of their output voltage The output can be single phase or polyphase Three phase alternators are the most common but polyphase alternators can be two phase six phase or more br br br By rotating part br The revolving part of alternators can be the armature or the magnetic field The revolving armature type has the armature wound on the rotor where the winding moves through a stationary magnetic field The revolving armature type is not often used The revolving field type has magnetic field on the rotor to rotate through a stationary armature winding The advantage is that then the rotor circuit carries much less power than the armature circuit making the slip ring connections smaller and less costly only two contacts are needed for the direct current rotor whereas often a rotor winding has three phases and multiple sections which would each require a slip ring connection The stationary armature can be wound for any convenient medium voltage level up to tens of thousands of volts manufacture of slip ring connections for more than a few thousand volts is costly and inconvenient br br br Cooling methods br Many alternators are cooled by ambient air forced through the enclosure by an attached fan on the same shaft that drives the alternator In vehicles such as transit buses a heavy demand on the electrical system may require a large alternator to be oil cooled In marine applications water cooling is also used Expensive automobiles may use water cooled alternators to meet high electrical system demands br br br Specific applications br br br Electric generators br br Most power generation stations use synchronous machines as their generators Connection of these generators to the utility grid requires synchronization conditions to be met br br br Automotive alternators br br Alternators are used in modern internal combustion engine automobiles to charge the battery and to power the electrical system when its engine is running br Until the s automobiles used DC dynamo generators with commutators With the availability of affordable silicon diode rectifiers alternators were used instead br br br Diesel electric locomotive alternators br In later diesel electric locomotives and diesel electric multiple units the prime mover turns an alternator which provides electricity for the traction motors AC or DC br The traction alternator usually incorporates integral silicon diode rectifiers to provide the traction motors with up to volts DC br The first diesel electric locomotives and many of those still in service use DC generators as before silicon power electronics it was easier to control the speed of DC traction motors Most of these had two generators one to generate the excitation current for a larger main generator br Optionally the generator also supplies head end power HEP or power for electric train heating The HEP option requires a constant engine speed typically r min for a V Hz HEP application even when the locomotive is not moving br br br Marine alternators br Marine alternators used in yachts are similar to automotive alternators with appropriate adaptations to the salt water environment Marine alternators are designed to be explosion proof ignition protected so that brush sparking will not ignite explosive gas mixtures in an engine room environment They may be or volt depending on the type of system installed Larger marine diesels may have two or more alternators to cope with the heavy electrical demand of a modern yacht On single alternator circuits the power may be split between the engine starting battery and the domestic or house battery or batteries by use of a split charge diode battery isolator or a voltage sensitive relay Due to the high cost of large house battery banks Marine alternators generally use external regulators Multistep regulators control the field current to maximize the charging effectiveness time to charge and battery life Multistep regulators can be programmed for different battery types Two temperature sensors can be added one for the battery to adjust charging voltage and an over temperature sensor on the actual alternator to protect it from overheating br br br Aviation br br br Radio alternators br High frequency alternators of the variable reluctance type were applied commercially to radio transmission in the low frequency radio bands These were used for transmission of Morse code and experimentally for transmission of voice and music In the Alexanderson alternator both the field winding and armature winding are stationary and current is induced in the armature by virtue of the changing magnetic reluctance of the rotor which has no windings or current carrying parts Such machines were made to produce radio frequency current for radio transmissions although the efficiency was low br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br White Thomas H Alternator Transmitter Development EarlyRadioHistory us br Alternators
