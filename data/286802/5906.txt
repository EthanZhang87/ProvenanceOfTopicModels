Carbon dioxide is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CO It is made up of molecules that each have one carbon atom covalently double bonded to two oxygen atoms It is found in the gas state at room temperature and as the source of available carbon in the carbon cycle atmospheric CO is the primary carbon source for life on Earth In the air carbon dioxide is transparent to visible light but absorbs infrared radiation acting as a greenhouse gas Carbon dioxide is soluble in water and is found in groundwater lakes ice caps and seawater When carbon dioxide dissolves in water it forms carbonate and mainly bicarbonate HCO which causes ocean acidification as atmospheric CO levels increase br It is a trace gas in Earth s atmosphere at parts per million ppm or about as of May having risen from pre industrial levels of ppm or about Burning fossil fuels is the primary cause of these increased CO concentrations and also the primary cause of climate change br Its concentration in Earth s pre industrial atmosphere since late in the Precambrian was regulated by organisms and geological phenomena Plants algae and cyanobacteria use energy from sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water in a process called photosynthesis which produces oxygen as a waste product In turn oxygen is consumed and CO is released as waste by all aerobic organisms when they metabolize organic compounds to produce energy by respiration CO is released from organic materials when they decay or combust such as in forest fires Since plants require CO for photosynthesis and humans and animals depend on plants for food CO is necessary for the survival of life on earth br Carbon dioxide is more dense than dry air but is long lived and thoroughly mixes in the atmosphere About half of excess CO emissions to the atmosphere are absorbed by land and ocean carbon sinks These sinks can become saturated and are volatile as decay and wildfires result in the CO being released back into the atmosphere CO is eventually sequestered stored for the long term in rocks and organic deposits like coal petroleum and natural gas Sequestered CO is released into the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels or naturally by volcanoes hot springs geysers and when carbonate rocks dissolve in water or react with acids br CO is a versatile industrial material used for example as an inert gas in welding and fire extinguishers as a pressurizing gas in air guns and oil recovery and as a supercritical fluid solvent in decaffeination and supercritical drying It is a byproduct of fermentation of sugars in bread beer and wine making and is added to carbonated beverages like seltzer and beer for effervescence It has a sharp and acidic odor and generates the taste of soda water in the mouth but at normally encountered concentrations it is odorless br br br Chemical and physical properties br Carbon dioxide cannot be liquefied at atmospheric pressure Low temperature carbon dioxide is commercially used in its solid form commonly known as dry ice The solid to gas phase transition occurs at Kelvin and is called sublimation br br br Structure bonding and molecular vibrations br br The symmetry of a carbon dioxide molecule is linear and centrosymmetric at its equilibrium geometry The length of the carbon oxygen bond in carbon dioxide is pm noticeably shorter than the roughly pm length of a typical single C O bond and shorter than most other C O multiply bonded functional groups such as carbonyls Since it is centrosymmetric the molecule has no electric dipole moment br br As a linear triatomic molecule CO has four vibrational modes as shown in the diagram In the symmetric and the antisymmetric stretching modes the atoms move along the axis of the molecule There are two bending modes which are degenerate meaning that they have the same frequency and same energy because of the symmetry of the molecule When a molecule touches a surface or touches another molecule the two bending modes can differ in frequency because the interaction is different for the two modes Some of the vibrational modes are observed in the infrared IR spectrum the antisymmetric stretching mode at wavenumber cm wavelength m and the degenerate pair of bending modes at cm wavelength m The symmetric stretching mode does not create an electric dipole so is not observed in IR spectroscopy but it is detected in Raman spectroscopy at cm wavelength m br In the gas phase carbon dioxide molecules undergo significant vibrational motions and do not keep a fixed structure However in a Coulomb explosion imaging experiment an instantaneous image of the molecular structure can be deduced Such an experiment has been performed for carbon dioxide The result of this experiment and the conclusion of theoretical calculations based on an ab initio potential energy surface of the molecule is that none of the molecules in the gas phase are ever exactly linear This counter intuitive result is trivially due to the fact that the nuclear motion volume element vanishes for linear geometries This is so for all molecules except diatomic molecules br br br In aqueous

converted into carbonic acid but remains as CO molecules not affecting the pH br The relative concentrations of CO H CO and the deprotonated forms HCO bicarbonate and CO carbonate depend on the pH As shown in a Bjerrum plot in neutral or slightly alkaline water pH the bicarbonate form predominates becoming the most prevalent at the pH of seawater In very alkaline water pH the predominant form is carbonate The oceans being mildly alkaline with typical pH contain about mg of bicarbonate per liter br Being diprotic carbonic acid has two acid dissociation constants the first one for the

is comparable to benzaldehyde or strongly electrophilic unsaturated carbonyl compounds However unlike electrophiles of similar reactivity the reactions of nucleophiles with CO are thermodynamically less favored and are often found to be highly reversible The reversible reaction of carbon dioxide with amines to make carbamates is used in CO scrubbers and has been suggested as a possible starting point for carbon capture and storage by amine gas treating br Only very strong nucleophiles like the carbanions provided by Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds react with CO to give carboxylates br br MR CO RCO M br where M Li or MgBr and R alkyl or aryl br In metal carbon dioxide complexes CO serves as a ligand which can facilitate the conversion of CO to other chemicals br The reduction of CO to CO is ordinarily a difficult and slow reaction br br CO e H CO H O br The redox potential for this reaction near pH is about V versus the standard hydrogen electrode The nickel containing enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase catalyses this process br Photoautotrophs i e plants and cyanobacteria use the energy contained in sunlight to photosynthesize simple sugars from CO absorbed from the air and water br br n CO n H O CH O n n O br br br Physical properties br br Carbon dioxide is colorless At low concentrations the gas is odorless however at sufficiently high concentrations it has a sharp acidic odor At standard temperature and pressure the density of carbon dioxide is around kg m about times that of air br Carbon dioxide has no liquid state at pressures below MPa atm At a pressure of atm MPa the gas deposits directly to a solid at temperatures below K C and the solid sublimes directly to a gas above this temperature In its solid state carbon dioxide is commonly called dry ice br br Liquid carbon dioxide forms only at pressures above MPa atm the triple point of carbon dioxide is K C at MPa atm see phase diagram The critical point is K C at MPa atm Another form of solid carbon dioxide observed at high pressure is an amorphous glass like solid This form of glass called carbonia is produced by supercooling heated CO at extreme pressures GPa or about atmospheres in a diamond anvil This discovery confirmed the theory that carbon dioxide could exist in a glass state similar to other members of its elemental family like silicon dioxide silica glass and germanium dioxide Unlike silica and germania glasses however carbonia glass is not stable at normal pressures and reverts to gas when pressure is released br At temperatures and pressures above the critical point carbon dioxide behaves as a supercritical fluid known as supercritical carbon dioxide br br Table of thermal and physical properties of saturated liquid carbon dioxide br br Table of thermal and physical properties of carbon dioxide CO at atmospheric pressure br br br Biological role br Carbon dioxide is an end product of cellular respiration in organisms that obtain energy by breaking down sugars fats and amino acids with oxygen as part of their metabolism This includes all plants algae and animals and aerobic fungi and bacteria In vertebrates the carbon dioxide travels in the blood from the body s tissues to the skin e g amphibians or the gills e g fish from where it dissolves in the water or to the lungs from where it is exhaled During active photosynthesis plants can absorb more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than they release in respiration br br br Photosynthesis and carbon fixation br br Carbon fixation is a biochemical process by which atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated by plants algae and cyanobacteria into energy rich organic molecules such as glucose thus creating their own food by photosynthesis Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to produce sugars from which other organic compounds can be constructed and oxygen is produced as a by product br Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase commonly abbreviated to RuBisCO is the enzyme involved in the first major step of carbon fixation the production of two molecules of phosphoglycerate from CO and ribulose bisphosphate as shown in the diagram at left br RuBisCO is thought to be the single most abundant protein on Earth br br Phototrophs use the products of their photosynthesis as internal food sources and as raw material for the biosynthesis of more complex organic molecules such as polysaccharides nucleic acids and proteins These are used for their own growth and also as the basis of the food chains and webs that feed other organisms including animals such as ourselves Some important phototrophs the coccolithophores synthesise hard calcium carbonate scales A globally significant species of coccolithophore is Emiliania huxleyi whose calcite scales have formed the basis of many sedimentary rocks such as limestone where what was previously atmospheric carbon can remain fixed for geological timescales br Plants can grow as much as faster in concentrations of ppm CO when compared with ambient conditions though this assumes no change in climate and no limitation on other nutrients Elevated CO levels cause increased growth reflected in the harvestable yield of crops with wheat rice and soybean all showing increases in yield of under elevated CO in FACE experiments br Increased atmospheric CO concentrations result in fewer stomata developing on plants which leads to reduced water usage and increased water use efficiency Studies using FACE have shown that CO enrichment leads to decreased concentrations of micronutrients in crop plants This may have knock on effects on other parts of ecosystems as herbivores will need to eat more food to gain the same amount of protein br The concentration of secondary metabolites such as phenylpropanoids and flavonoids can also be altered in plants exposed to high concentrations of CO br Plants also emit CO during respiration and so the majority of plants and algae which use C photosynthesis are only net absorbers during the day Though a growing forest will absorb many tons of CO each year a mature forest will produce as much CO from respiration and decomposition of dead specimens e g fallen branches as is used in photosynthesis in growing plants Contrary to the long standing view that they are carbon neutral mature forests can continue to accumulate carbon and remain valuable carbon sinks helping to maintain the carbon balance of Earth s atmosphere Additionally and crucially to life on earth photosynthesis by phytoplankton consumes dissolved CO in the upper ocean and thereby promotes the absorption of CO from the atmosphere br br br Toxicity br br Carbon dioxide content in fresh air averaged between sea level and kPa level i e about km mi altitude varies between ppm and ppm depending on the location br CO is an asphyxiant gas and not classified as toxic or harmful in accordance with Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals standards of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe by using the OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals In concentrations up to ppm it will make some people feel drowsy and give the lungs a stuffy feeling Concentrations of to to ppm may cause suffocation even in the presence of sufficient oxygen manifesting as dizziness headache visual and hearing dysfunction and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour The physiological effects of acute carbon dioxide exposure are grouped together under the term hypercapnia a subset of asphyxiation br Because it is heavier than air in locations where the gas seeps from the ground due to sub surface volcanic or geothermal activity in relatively high concentrations without the dispersing effects of wind it can collect in sheltered pocketed locations below average ground level causing animals located therein to be suffocated Carrion feeders attracted to the carcasses are then also killed Children have been killed in the same way near the city of Goma by CO emissions from the nearby volcano Mount Nyiragongo The Swahili term for this phenomenon is mazuku br br Adaptation to increased concentrations of CO occurs in humans including modified breathing and kidney bicarbonate production in order to balance the effects of blood acidification acidosis Several studies suggested that percent inspired concentrations could be used for closed air spaces e g a submarine since the adaptation is physiological and reversible as deterioration in performance or in normal physical activity does not happen at this level of exposure for five days Yet other studies show a decrease in cognitive function even at much lower levels Also with ongoing respiratory acidosis adaptation or compensatory mechanisms will be unable to reverse the condition br br br Below br There are few studies of the health effects of long term continuous CO exposure on humans and animals at levels below Occupational CO exposure limits have been set in the United States at ppm for an eight hour period At this CO concentration International Space Station crew experienced headaches lethargy mental slowness emotional irritation and sleep disruption Studies in animals at CO have demonstrated kidney calcification and bone loss after eight weeks of exposure A study of humans exposed in hour sessions demonstrated significant negative effects on cognitive abilities at concentrations as low as ppm CO likely due to CO induced increases in cerebral blood flow Another study observed a decline in basic activity level and information usage at ppm when compared to ppm br However a review of the literature found that a reliable subset of studies on the phenomenon of carbon dioxide induced cognitive impairment to only show a small effect on high level decision making for concentrations below ppm Most of the studies were confounded by inadequate study designs environmental comfort uncertainties in exposure doses and differing cognitive assessments used Similarly a study on the effects of the concentration of CO in motorcycle helmets has been criticized for having dubious methodology in not noting the self reports of motorcycle riders and taking measurements using mannequins Further when normal motorcycle conditions were achieved such as highway or city speeds or the visor was raised the concentration of CO declined to safe levels br br br Ventilation br br Poor ventilation is one of the main causes of excessive CO concentrations in closed spaces leading to poor indoor air quality Carbon dioxide differential above outdoor concentrations at steady state conditions when the occupancy and ventilation system operation are sufficiently long that CO concentration has stabilized are sometimes used to estimate ventilation rates per person Higher CO concentrations are associated with occupant health comfort and performance degradation ASHRAE Standard ventilation rates may result in indoor concentrations up to ppm above ambient outdoor conditions Thus if the outdoor concentration is ppm indoor concentrations may reach ppm with ventilation rates that meet this industry consensus standard Concentrations in poorly ventilated spaces can be found even higher than this range of or ppm br Miners who are particularly vulnerable to gas exposure due to insufficient ventilation referred to mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen as blackdamp choke damp or stythe Before more effective technologies were developed miners would frequently monitor for dangerous levels of blackdamp and other gases in mine shafts by bringing a caged canary with them as they worked The canary is more sensitive to asphyxiant gases than humans and as it became unconscious would stop singing and fall off its perch The Davy lamp could also detect high levels of blackdamp which sinks and collects near the floor by burning less brightly while methane another suffocating gas and explosion risk would make the lamp burn more brightly br In February three people died from suffocation at a party in Moscow when dry ice frozen CO was added to a swimming pool to cool it down A similar accident occurred in when a woman died from CO fumes emanating from the large amount of dry ice she was transporting in her car br br br Indoor air br Humans spend more and more time in a confined atmosphere around of the time in a building or vehicle According to the French Agency for Food Environmental and Occupational Health Safety ANSES and various actors in France the CO rate in the indoor air of buildings linked to human or animal occupancy and the presence of combustion installations weighted by air renewal is usually between about and ppm br In homes schools nurseries and offices there are no systematic relationships between the levels of CO and other pollutants and indoor CO is statistically not a good predictor of pollutants linked to outdoor road or air etc traffic CO is the parameter that changes the fastest with hygrometry and oxygen levels when humans or animals are gathered in a closed or poorly ventilated room In poor countries many open hearths are sources of CO and CO emitted directly into the living environment br br br Outdoor areas with elevated concentrations br Local concentrations of carbon dioxide can reach high values near strong sources especially those that are isolated by surrounding terrain At the Bossoleto hot spring near Rapolano Terme in Tuscany Italy situated in a bowl shaped depression about m ft in diameter concentrations of CO rise to above overnight sufficient to kill insects and small animals After sunrise the gas is dispersed by convection High concentrations of CO produced by disturbance of deep lake water saturated with CO are thought to have caused fatalities at Lake Monoun Cameroon in and casualties at Lake Nyos Cameroon in br br br Human physiology br br br Content br br The body produces approximately pounds kg of carbon dioxide per day per person containing pounds g of carbon In humans this carbon dioxide is carried through the venous system and is breathed out through the lungs resulting in lower concentrations in the arteries The carbon dioxide content of the blood is often given as the partial pressure which is the pressure which carbon dioxide would have had if it alone occupied the volume In humans the blood carbon dioxide contents are shown in the adjacent table br br br Transport in the blood br CO is carried in blood in three different ways Exact percentages vary between arterial and venous blood br br Majority about to is converted to bicarbonate ions HCO by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in the red blood cells by the reaction br CO H O H CO H HCO br is dissolved in blood plasma br is bound to hemoglobin as carbamino compounds br Hemoglobin the main oxygen carrying molecule in red blood cells carries both oxygen and carbon dioxide However the CO bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen Instead it combines with the N terminal groups on the four globin chains However because of allosteric effects on the hemoglobin molecule the binding of CO decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen This is known as the Haldane Effect and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs Conversely a rise in the partial pressure of CO or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin which is known as the Bohr effect br br br Regulation of respiration br Carbon dioxide is one of the mediators of local autoregulation of blood supply If its concentration is high the capillaries expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue br Bicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH A person s breathing rate influences the level of CO in their blood Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes respiratory acidosis while breathing that is too rapid leads to hyperventilation which can cause respiratory alkalosis br Although the body requires oxygen for metabolism low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing Rather breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels As a result breathing low pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all such as pure nitrogen can lead to loss of consciousness without ever experiencing air hunger This is especially perilous for high altitude fighter pilots It is also why flight attendants instruct passengers in case of loss of cabin pressure to apply the oxygen mask to themselves first before helping others otherwise one risks losing consciousness br The respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial CO pressure of mmHg With intentional hyperventilation the CO content of arterial blood may be lowered to mmHg the oxygen content of the blood is little affected and the respiratory drive is diminished This is why one can hold one s breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving br br br Concentrations and role in the environment br br br Atmosphere br br br Oceans br br br Ocean acidification br Carbon dioxide dissolves in the ocean to form carbonic acid H CO bicarbonate HCO and carbonate CO There is about fifty times as much carbon dioxide dissolved in the oceans as exists in the atmosphere The oceans act as an enormous carbon sink and have taken up about a third of CO emitted by human activity br br br Hydrothermal vents br Carbon dioxide is also introduced into the oceans through hydrothermal vents The Champagne hydrothermal vent found at the Northwest Eifuku volcano in the Mariana Trench produces almost pure liquid carbon dioxide one of only two known sites in the world as of the other being in the Okinawa Trough The finding of a submarine lake of liquid carbon dioxide in the Okinawa Trough was reported in br br br Production br br br Biological processes br Carbon dioxide is a by product of the fermentation of sugar in the brewing of beer whisky and other alcoholic beverages and in the production of bioethanol Yeast metabolizes sugar to produce CO and ethanol also known as alcohol as follows br br C H O CO CH CH OH br All aerobic organisms produce CO when they oxidize carbohydrates fatty acids and proteins The large number of reactions involved are exceedingly complex and not described easily Refer to cellular respiration anaerobic respiration and photosynthesis The equation for the respiration of glucose and other monosaccharides is br br C H O O CO H O br Anaerobic organisms decompose organic material producing methane and carbon dioxide together with traces of other compounds Regardless of the type of organic material the production of gases follows well defined kinetic pattern Carbon dioxide comprises about of the gas that emanates from decomposition in landfills termed landfill gas Most of the remaining is methane br br br Industrial processes br Carbon dioxide can be obtained by distillation from air but the method is inefficient Industrially carbon dioxide is predominantly an unrecovered waste product produced by several methods which may be practiced at various scales br br br Combustion br The combustion of all carbon based fuels such as methane natural gas petroleum distillates gasoline diesel kerosene propane coal wood and generic organic matter produces carbon

producing pig iron and carbon dioxide br br Fe O CO CO Fe br br br By product from hydrogen production br Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of the industrial production of hydrogen by steam reforming and the water gas shift reaction in ammonia production These processes begin with the reaction of water and natural gas mainly methane This is a major source of food grade carbon dioxide for use in carbonation of beer and soft drinks and is also used for stunning animals such as poultry In the summer of a shortage of carbon dioxide for these purposes arose in Europe due to the temporary shut down of several ammonia plants for maintenance br br br Thermal decomposition of limestone br It is produced by thermal decomposition of limestone CaCO by heating calcining at about C F in the manufacture of quicklime calcium oxide CaO a compound that has many industrial uses br br CaCO CaO CO br Acids liberate CO from most metal carbonates Consequently it may be obtained directly from natural carbon dioxide springs where it is produced by the action of acidified water on limestone or dolomite The reaction between hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate limestone or chalk is shown below br br CaCO HCl CaCl H CO br The carbonic acid H CO then decomposes to water and CO br br H CO CO H O br Such reactions are accompanied by foaming or bubbling or both as the gas is released They have widespread uses in industry because they can be used to neutralize waste acid streams br br br Commercial uses br Carbon dioxide is used by the food industry the oil industry and the chemical industry br The compound has varied commercial uses but one of its greatest uses as a chemical is in the production of carbonated beverages it provides the sparkle in carbonated beverages such as soda water beer and sparkling wine br br br Precursor to chemicals br br In the chemical industry carbon dioxide is mainly consumed as an ingredient in the production of urea with a smaller fraction being used to produce methanol and a range of other products Some carboxylic acid derivatives such as sodium salicylate are prepared using CO by the Kolbe Schmitt reaction br In addition to conventional processes using CO for chemical production electrochemical methods are also being explored at a research level In particular the use of renewable energy for production of fuels from CO such as methanol is attractive as this could result in fuels that could be easily transported and used within conventional combustion technologies but have no net CO emissions br br br Agriculture br Plants require carbon dioxide to conduct photosynthesis The atmospheres of greenhouses may if of large size must be enriched with additional CO to sustain and increase the rate of plant growth At very high concentrations times atmospheric concentration or greater carbon dioxide can be toxic to animal life so raising the concentration to ppm or higher for several hours will eliminate pests such as whiteflies and spider mites in a greenhouse Some plants respond more favorably to rising carbon dioxide concentrations than others which can lead to vegetation regime shifts like woody plant encroachment br br br Foods br br Carbon dioxide is a food additive used as a propellant and acidity regulator in the food industry It is approved for usage in the EU listed as E number E US Australia and New Zealand listed by its INS number br A candy called Pop Rocks is pressurized with carbon dioxide gas at about kPa bar psi When placed in the mouth it dissolves just like other hard candy and releases the gas bubbles with an audible pop br Leavening agents cause dough to rise by producing carbon dioxide Baker s yeast produces carbon dioxide by fermentation of sugars within the dough while chemical leaveners such as baking powder and baking soda release carbon dioxide when heated or if exposed to acids br br br Beverages br Carbon dioxide is used to produce carbonated soft drinks and soda water Traditionally the carbonation of beer and sparkling wine came about through natural fermentation but many manufacturers carbonate these drinks with carbon dioxide recovered from the fermentation process In the case of bottled and kegged beer the most common method used is carbonation with recycled carbon dioxide With the exception of British real ale draught beer is usually transferred from kegs in a cold room or cellar to dispensing taps on the bar using pressurized carbon dioxide sometimes mixed with nitrogen br The taste of soda water and related taste sensations in other carbonated beverages is an effect of the dissolved carbon dioxide rather than the bursting bubbles of the gas Carbonic anhydrase converts carbon dioxide to carbonic acid leading to a sour taste and also the dissolved carbon dioxide induces a somatosensory response br br br Winemaking br br Carbon dioxide in the form of dry ice is often used during the cold soak phase in winemaking to cool clusters of grapes quickly after picking to help prevent spontaneous fermentation by wild yeast The main advantage of using dry ice over water ice is that it cools the grapes without adding any additional water that might decrease the sugar concentration in the grape must and thus the alcohol concentration in the finished wine Carbon dioxide is also used to create a hypoxic environment for carbonic maceration the process used to produce Beaujolais wine br Carbon dioxide is sometimes used to top up wine bottles or other storage vessels such as barrels to prevent oxidation though it has the problem that it can dissolve into the wine making a previously still wine slightly fizzy For this reason other gases such as nitrogen or argon are preferred for this process by professional wine makers br br br Stunning animals br Carbon dioxide is often used to stun animals before slaughter Stunning may be a misnomer as the animals are not knocked out immediately and may suffer distress br br br Inert gas br Carbon dioxide is one of the most commonly used compressed gases for pneumatic pressurized gas systems in portable pressure tools Carbon dioxide is also used as an atmosphere for welding although in the welding arc it reacts to oxidize most metals Use in the automotive industry is common despite significant evidence that welds made in carbon dioxide are more brittle than those made in more inert atmospheres When used for MIG welding CO use is sometimes referred to as MAG welding for Metal Active Gas as CO can react at these high temperatures It tends to produce a hotter puddle than truly inert atmospheres improving the flow characteristics Although this may be due to atmospheric reactions occurring at the puddle site This is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding as it tends to embrittle the site but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding where ultimate ductility is not a major concern br Carbon dioxide is used in many consumer products that require pressurized gas because it is inexpensive and nonflammable and because it undergoes a phase transition from gas to liquid at room temperature at an attainable pressure of approximately bar psi atm allowing far more carbon dioxide to fit in a given container than otherwise would Life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation Aluminium capsules of CO are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for air guns paintball markers guns inflating bicycle tires and for making carbonated water High concentrations of carbon dioxide can also be used to kill pests Liquid carbon dioxide is used in supercritical drying of some food products and technological materials in the preparation of specimens for scanning electron microscopy and in the decaffeination of coffee beans br br br Fire extinguisher br br Carbon dioxide can be used to extinguish flames by flooding the environment around the flame with the gas It does not itself react to extinguish the flame but starves the flame of oxygen by displacing it Some fire extinguishers especially those designed for electrical fires contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure Carbon dioxide extinguishers work well on small flammable liquid and electrical fires but not on ordinary combustible fires because they do not cool the burning substances significantly and when the carbon dioxide disperses they can catch fire upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen They are mainly used in server rooms br Carbon dioxide has also been widely used as an extinguishing agent in fixed fire protection systems for local application of specific hazards and total flooding of a protected space International Maritime Organization standards recognize carbon dioxide systems for fire protection of ship holds and engine rooms Carbon dioxide based fire protection systems have been linked to several deaths because it can cause suffocation in sufficiently high concentrations A review of CO systems identified incidents between and the date of the report causing deaths and injuries br br br Supercritical CO as solvent br br Liquid carbon dioxide is a good solvent for many lipophilic organic compounds and is used to decaffeinate coffee Carbon dioxide has attracted attention in the pharmaceutical and other chemical processing industries as a less toxic alternative to more traditional solvents such as organochlorides It is also used by some dry cleaners for this reason It is used in the preparation of some aerogels because of the properties of supercritical carbon dioxide br br br Medical and pharmacological uses br In medicine up to carbon dioxide times atmospheric concentration is added to oxygen for stimulation of breathing after apnea and to stabilize the O CO balance in blood br Carbon dioxide can be mixed with up to oxygen forming an inhalable gas this is known as Carbogen and has a variety of medical and research uses br Another medical use are the mofette dry spas that use carbon dioxide from post volcanic discharge for therapeutic purposes br br br Energy br Supercritical CO is used as the working fluid in the Allam power cycle engine br br br Fossil fuel recovery br Carbon dioxide is used in enhanced oil recovery where it is injected into or adjacent to producing oil wells usually under supercritical conditions when it becomes miscible with the oil This approach can increase original oil recovery by reducing residual oil saturation by additional to primary extraction It acts as both a pressurizing agent and when dissolved into the underground crude oil significantly reduces its viscosity and changing surface chemistry enabling the oil to flow more rapidly through the reservoir to the removal well In mature oil fields extensive pipe networks are used to carry the carbon dioxide to the injection points br In enhanced coal bed methane recovery carbon dioxide would be pumped into the coal seam to displace methane as opposed to current methods which primarily rely on the removal of water to reduce pressure to make the coal seam release its trapped methane br br br Bio transformation into fuel br br It has been proposed that CO from power generation be bubbled into ponds to stimulate growth of algae that could then be converted into biodiesel fuel A strain of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus has been genetically engineered to produce the fuels isobutyraldehyde and isobutanol from CO using photosynthesis br Researchers have developed an electrocatalytic technique using enzymes isolated from bacteria to power the chemical reactions which convert CO into fuels br br br Refrigerant br br Liquid and solid carbon dioxide are important refrigerants especially in the food industry where they are employed during the transportation and storage of ice cream and other frozen foods Solid carbon dioxide is called dry ice and is used for small shipments where refrigeration equipment is not practical Solid carbon dioxide is always below C F at regular atmospheric pressure regardless of the air temperature br Liquid carbon dioxide industry nomenclature R or R was used as a refrigerant prior to the use of dichlorodifluoromethane R a chlorofluorocarbon CFC compound CO might enjoy a renaissance because one of the main substitutes to CFCs tetrafluoroethane R a a hydrofluorocarbon HFC compound contributes to climate change more than CO does CO physical properties are highly favorable for cooling refrigeration and heating purposes having a high volumetric cooling capacity Due to the need to operate at pressures of up to bars psi kPa CO systems require highly mechanically resistant reservoirs and components that have already been developed for mass production in many sectors In automobile air conditioning in more than of all driving conditions for latitudes higher than CO R operates more efficiently than systems using HFCs e g R a Its environmental advantages GWP of non ozone depleting non toxic non flammable could make it the future working fluid to replace current HFCs in cars supermarkets and heat pump water heaters among others Coca Cola has fielded CO based beverage coolers and the U S Army is interested in CO refrigeration and heating technology br br br Minor uses br br Carbon dioxide is the lasing medium in a carbon dioxide laser which is one of the earliest type of lasers br Carbon dioxide can be used as a means of controlling the pH of swimming pools by continuously adding gas to the water thus keeping the pH from rising Among the advantages of this is the avoidance of handling more hazardous acids Similarly it is also used in the maintaining reef aquaria where it is commonly used in calcium reactors to temporarily lower the pH of water being passed over calcium carbonate in order to allow the calcium carbonate to dissolve into the water more freely where it is used by some corals to build their skeleton br Used as the primary coolant in the British advanced gas cooled reactor for nuclear power generation br Carbon dioxide induction is commonly used for the euthanasia of laboratory research animals Methods to administer CO include placing animals directly into a closed prefilled chamber containing CO or exposure to a gradually increasing concentration of CO The American Veterinary Medical Association s guidelines for carbon dioxide induction state that a displacement rate of of the chamber or cage volume per minute is optimal for the humane euthanasia of small rodents Percentages of CO vary for different species based on identified optimal percentages to minimize distress br Carbon dioxide is also used in several related cleaning and surface preparation techniques br br br History of discovery br br Carbon dioxide was the first gas to be described as a discrete substance In about the Flemish chemist Jan Baptist van Helmont observed that when he burned charcoal in a closed vessel the mass of the resulting ash was much less than that of the original charcoal His interpretation was that the rest of the charcoal had been transmuted into an invisible substance he termed a gas from Greek chaos or wild spirit spiritus sylvestris br The properties of carbon dioxide were further studied in the s by the Scottish physician Joseph Black He found that limestone calcium carbonate could be heated or treated with acids to yield a gas he called fixed air He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and supported neither flame nor animal life Black also found that when bubbled through limewater a saturated aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide it would precipitate calcium carbonate He used this phenomenon to illustrate that carbon dioxide is produced by animal respiration and microbial fermentation In English chemist Joseph Priestley published a paper entitled Impregnating Water with Fixed Air in which he described a process of dripping sulfuric acid or oil of vitriol as Priestley knew it on chalk in order to produce carbon dioxide and forcing the gas to dissolve by agitating a bowl of water in contact with the gas br Carbon dioxide was first liquefied at elevated pressures in by Humphry Davy and Michael Faraday The earliest description of solid carbon dioxide dry ice was given by the French inventor Adrien Jean Pierre Thilorier who in opened a pressurized container of liquid carbon dioxide only to find that the cooling produced by the rapid evaporation of the liquid yielded a snow of solid CO br Carbon dioxide in combination with nitrogen was known from earlier times as Blackdamp stythe or choke damp Along with the other types of damp it was encountered in mining operations and well sinking Slow oxidation of coal and biological processes replaced the oxygen to create a suffocating mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br br Current global map of carbon dioxide concentration br CDC NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical
