Aluminium oxide or aluminium III oxide is a chemical compound of aluminium and oxygen with the chemical formula Al O It is the most commonly occurring of several aluminium oxides and specifically identified as aluminium oxide It is commonly called alumina and may also be called aloxide aloxite or alundum in various forms and applications It occurs naturally in its crystalline polymorphic phase Al O as the mineral corundum varieties of which form the precious gemstones ruby and sapphire Al O is used to produce aluminium metal as an abrasive owing to its hardness and as a refractory material owing to its high melting point br br br Natural occurrence br Corundum is the most common naturally occurring crystalline form of aluminium oxide Rubies and sapphires are gem quality forms of corundum which owe their characteristic colours to trace impurities Rubies are given their characteristic deep red colour and their laser qualities by traces of chromium Sapphires come in different colours given by various other impurities such as iron and titanium An extremely rare form occurs as the mineral deltalumite br br br History br The field of aluminium oxide ceramics has a long history Aluminium salts were widely used in ancient and medieval alchemy Several older textbooks cover the history of the field A textbook by Andrew Ruys contains a detailed timeline on the br history of aluminium oxide from ancient times to the st century br br br Properties br br Al O is an electrical insulator but has a relatively high thermal conductivity Wm K for a ceramic material Aluminium oxide is insoluble in water In its most commonly occurring crystalline form called corundum or aluminium oxide its hardness makes it suitable for use as an abrasive and as a component in cutting tools br Aluminium oxide is responsible for the resistance of metallic aluminium to weathering Metallic aluminium is very reactive with atmospheric oxygen and a thin passivation layer of aluminium oxide nm thickness forms on any exposed aluminium surface in a matter of hundreds of picoseconds This layer protects the metal from further oxidation The thickness and properties of this oxide layer can be enhanced using a process called anodising A number of alloys such as aluminium bronzes exploit this property by including a proportion of aluminium in the alloy to enhance corrosion resistance The aluminium oxide generated by anodising is typically amorphous but discharge assisted oxidation processes such as plasma electrolytic oxidation result in a significant proportion of crystalline aluminium oxide in the coating enhancing its hardness br Aluminium oxide was taken off the United States Environmental Protection Agency s chemicals lists in Aluminium oxide is on the EPA s Toxics Release Inventory list if it is a fibrous form br br br Amphoteric nature br Aluminium oxide is an amphoteric substance meaning it can react with both acids and bases such as hydrofluoric acid and sodium hydroxide acting as an acid with a base and a base with an acid neutralising the other and producing a salt br br Al O HF AlF H O br Al O NaOH H O NaAl OH sodium aluminate br br br Structure br br The most common form of crystalline aluminium oxide is known as corundum which is the thermodynamically stable form The oxygen ions form a nearly hexagonal close packed structure with the aluminium ions filling two thirds of the octahedral interstices Each Al center is octahedral In terms of its crystallography corundum adopts a trigonal Bravais lattice with a space group of R c number in the International Tables The primitive cell contains two formula units of aluminium oxide br Aluminium oxide also exists in other metastable phases including the cubic and phases the monoclinic phase the hexagonal phase the orthorhombic phase and the phase that can be tetragonal or orthorhombic Each has a unique crystal structure and properties Cubic Al O has important technical applications The so called Al O proved to be NaAl O br Molten aluminium oxide near the melting temperature is roughly tetrahedral i e of the Al are surrounded by oxygen neighbors and coordinated with very little octahedral Al O present Around of the oxygen atoms are shared among three or more Al O polyhedra and the majority of inter polyhedral connections are corner sharing with the remaining being edge sharing The breakdown of octahedra upon melting is accompanied by a relatively large volume increase the density of the liquid close to its melting point is g cm The structure of molten alumina is temperature dependent and the fraction of and fold aluminium increases during cooling and supercooling at the expense of tetrahedral AlO units approaching the local structural arrangements found in amorphous alumina br br br Production br br Aluminium hydroxide minerals are the main component of bauxite the principal ore of aluminium A mixture of the minerals comprise bauxite ore including gibbsite Al OH boehmite AlO OH and diaspore AlO OH along with impurities of iron oxides and hydroxides quartz and clay minerals Bauxites are found in laterites Bauxite is typically purified using the Bayer process br br Al O H O NaOH NaAl OH br Al OH NaOH NaAl OH br Except for SiO the other components of bauxite do not dissolve in base Upon filtering the basic mixture Fe O is removed When the Bayer liquor is cooled Al OH precipitates leaving the silicates in solution br br NaAl OH NaOH Al OH br The solid Al OH Gibbsite is then calcined heated to over C to give aluminium oxide br br Al OH Al O H O br The product aluminium oxide tends to be multi phase i e consisting of several phases of aluminium oxide rather than solely corundum The production process can therefore be optimized to produce a tailored product The type of phases present affects for example the solubility and pore structure of the aluminium oxide product which in turn affects the cost of aluminium production and pollution control br br br Applications br Known as alpha alumina in materials science and as alundum in fused form or aloxite in mining and ceramic communities aluminium oxide finds wide use Annual global production of aluminium oxide in was approximately million tonnes over of which was used in the manufacture of aluminium metal The major uses of speciality aluminium oxides are in refractories ceramics polishing and abrasive applications Large tonnages of aluminium hydroxide from which alumina is derived are used in the manufacture of zeolites coating titania pigments and as a fire

strength Its naturally occurring form corundum is a on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness just below diamond It is widely used as an abrasive including as a much less expensive substitute for industrial diamond Many types of sandpaper use aluminium oxide crystals In addition its low heat retention and low specific heat make it widely used in grinding operations particularly cutoff tools As

available to most civilians in jurisdictions where it is legal but is not considered military grade It is also used to produce bullet proof alumina glass capable to withstand impact of BMG calibre rounds br br br Abrasion protection br Aluminium oxide can be grown as a coating on aluminium by anodizing or by plasma electrolytic oxidation see the Properties above Both the hardness and abrasion resistant characteristics of the coating originate from the high strength of aluminium oxide yet the porous coating layer produced with conventional direct current anodizing procedures is within a Rockwell hardness C range which is comparable only to hardened carbon steel alloys but considerably inferior to the hardness of natural and synthetic corundum Instead with plasma electrolytic oxidation the coating is porous only on the surface oxide layer while the lower oxide layers are much more compact than with standard DC anodizing procedures and present a higher crystallinity due to the oxide layers being remelted and densified to obtain Al O clusters with much higher coating hardness values circa Vickers hardness br br Alumina is used to manufacture tiles which are attached inside pulverized fuel lines and flue gas ducting on coal fired power stations to protect high wear areas They are not suitable for areas with high impact forces as these tiles are brittle and susceptible to breakage br br br Electrical insulation br Aluminium oxide is an electrical insulator used as a substrate silicon on sapphire for integrated circuits but also as a tunnel barrier for
