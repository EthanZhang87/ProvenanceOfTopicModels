Phosphorus is a chemical element it has symbol P and atomic number Elemental phosphorus exists in two major forms white phosphorus and red phosphorus but because it is highly reactive phosphorus is never found as a free element on Earth It has a concentration in the Earth s crust of about one gram per kilogram compare copper at about grams In minerals phosphorus generally occurs as phosphate br Elemental phosphorus was first isolated as white phosphorus in In white phosphorus phosphorus atoms are arranged in groups of written as P White phosphorus emits a faint glow when exposed to oxygen hence a name taken from Greek mythology meaning light bearer Latin Lucifer referring to the Morning Star the planet Venus The term phosphorescence meaning glow after illumination has its origin in phosphorus although phosphorus itself does not exhibit phosphorescence phosphorus glows due to oxidation of the white but not red phosphorus a process now called chemiluminescence Phosphorus is classified as a pnictogen together with nitrogen arsenic antimony bismuth and moscovium br Phosphorus is an element essential to sustaining life largely through phosphates compounds containing the phosphate ion PO Phosphates are a component of DNA RNA ATP and phospholipids complex compounds fundamental to cells Elemental phosphorus was first isolated from human urine and bone ash was an important early phosphate source Phosphate mines contain fossils because phosphate is present in the fossilized deposits of animal remains and excreta Low phosphate levels are an important limit to growth in a number of plant ecosystems The vast majority of phosphorus compounds mined are consumed as fertilisers Phosphate is needed to replace the phosphorus that plants remove from the soil and its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population Other applications include organophosphorus compounds in detergents pesticides and nerve agents br br br Characteristics br br br Allotropes br br Phosphorus has several allotropes that exhibit strikingly diverse properties The two most common allotropes are white phosphorus and red phosphorus br For both pure and applied uses the most important allotrope is white phosphorus often abbreviated WP White phosphorus is a soft waxy molecular solid composed of P tetrahedra This P tetrahedron is also present in liquid and gaseous phosphorus up to the temperature of C F K when it starts decomposing to P molecules The nature of bonding in this P tetrahedron can be described by spherical aromaticity or cluster bonding that is the electrons are highly delocalized This has been illustrated by calculations of the magnetically induced currents which sum up to nA T much more than in the archetypical aromatic molecule benzene nA T br br White phosphorus exists in two crystalline forms alpha and beta At room temperature the form is stable It is more common has cubic crystal structure and at K C it transforms into form which has hexagonal crystal structure These forms differ in terms of the relative orientations of the constituent P tetrahedra br White phosphorus is the least stable the most reactive the most volatile the least dense and the most toxic of the allotropes White phosphorus gradually changes to red phosphorus accelerated by light and heat Samples of white phosphorus almost always contain some red phosphorus and accordingly appear yellow For this reason white phosphorus that is aged or otherwise impure e g weapons grade not lab grade WP is also called yellow phosphorus White phosphorus is highly flammable and pyrophoric self igniting in air it faintly glows green and blue in the dark when exposed to oxygen The autoxidation commonly coats samples with white phosphorus pentoxide P O P tetrahedra but with oxygen inserted between the phosphorus atoms and at the vertices White phosphorus is a napalm additive and the characteristic odour of combustion is garlicky White phosphorus is insoluble in water but soluble in carbon disulfide br Thermal decomposition of P at K gives diphosphorus P This species is not stable as a solid or liquid The dimeric unit contains a triple bond and is analogous to N It can also be generated as a transient intermediate in solution by thermolysis of organophosphorus precursor reagents At still higher temperatures P dissociates into atomic P br br Red phosphorus is polymeric in structure It can be viewed as a derivative of P wherein one P P bond is broken and one additional bond is formed with the neighbouring tetrahedron resulting in chains of P molecules linked by van der Waals forces Red phosphorus may be formed by heating white phosphorus to C F or by exposing white phosphorus to sunlight Phosphorus after this treatment is amorphous Upon further heating this material crystallises In this sense red phosphorus is not an allotrope but rather an intermediate phase between the white and violet phosphorus and most of its properties have a range of values For example freshly prepared bright red phosphorus is highly reactive and ignites at about C F though it is more stable than white phosphorus which ignites at about C F After prolonged heating or storage the color darkens see infobox images the resulting product is more stable and does not spontaneously ignite in air br Violet phosphorus is a form of phosphorus that can be produced by day long annealing of red phosphorus above C In Hittorf discovered that when phosphorus was recrystallised from molten lead a red purple form is obtained Therefore this form is sometimes known as Hittorf s phosphorus or violet or metallic phosphorus br Black phosphorus is the least reactive allotrope and the thermodynamically stable form below C F It is also known as metallic phosphorus and has a structure somewhat resembling that of graphite It is obtained by heating white phosphorus under high pressures about standard atmospheres or gigapascals It can also be produced at ambient conditions using metal salts e g mercury as catalysts In appearance properties and structure it resembles graphite being black and flaky a conductor of electricity and has puckered sheets of linked atoms br Another form scarlet phosphorus is obtained by allowing a solution of white phosphorus in carbon disulfide to evaporate in sunlight br br br Chemiluminescence br br When first isolated it was observed that the green glow emanating from white phosphorus would persist for a time in a stoppered jar but then cease Robert Boyle in the s ascribed it to debilitation of the air Actually it is oxygen being consumed By the th century it was known that in pure oxygen phosphorus does not glow at all there is only a range of partial pressures at which it does Heat can be applied to drive the reaction at higher pressures br In the glow was explained by R J van Zee and A U Khan A reaction with oxygen takes place at the surface of the solid or liquid phosphorus forming the short lived molecules HPO and P O that both emit visible light The reaction is slow and only very little of the intermediates are required to produce the luminescence hence the extended time the glow continues in a stoppered jar br Since its discovery phosphors and phosphorescence were used loosely to describe substances that shine in the dark without burning Although the term phosphorescence is derived from phosphorus the reaction that gives phosphorus its glow is properly called chemiluminescence glowing due to a cold chemical reaction not phosphorescence re emitting light that previously fell onto a substance and excited it br br br Isotopes br br There are known isotopes of phosphorus ranging from P to P Only P is stable and is therefore present at abundance The half integer nuclear spin and high abundance of P make phosphorus NMR spectroscopy a very useful analytical tool in studies of phosphorus containing samples br Two radioactive isotopes of phosphorus have half lives suitable for biological scientific experiments These are br br P a beta emitter MeV with a half life of days which is used routinely in life science laboratories primarily to produce radiolabeled DNA and RNA probes e g for use in Northern blots or Southern blots br P a beta emitter MeV with a half life of days It is used in life science laboratories in applications in which lower energy beta emissions are advantageous such as DNA sequencing br The high energy beta particles from P penetrate skin and corneas and any P ingested inhaled or absorbed is readily incorporated into bone and nucleic acids For these reasons Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the United States and similar institutions in other developed countries require personnel working with P to wear lab coats disposable gloves and safety glasses or goggles to protect the eyes and avoid working directly over open containers Monitoring personal clothing and surface contamination is also required Shielding requires special consideration The high energy of the beta particles gives rise to secondary emission of X rays via Bremsstrahlung braking radiation in dense shielding materials such as lead Therefore the radiation must be shielded with low density materials such as acrylic or other plastic water or when transparency is not required even wood br br br Occurrence br br br Universe br In astronomers detected phosphorus in Cassiopeia A which confirmed that this element is produced in supernovae as a byproduct of supernova nucleosynthesis The phosphorus to iron ratio in material from the supernova remnant could be up to times higher than in the Milky Way in general br In astronomers analysed ALMA and ROSINA data from the massive star forming region AFGL to detect phosphorus bearing molecules and how they are carried in comets to the early Earth br br br Crust and organic sources br Phosphorus has a concentration in the Earth s crust of about one gram per kilogram compare copper at about grams It is not found free in nature but is widely distributed in many minerals usually as phosphates Inorganic phosphate rock which is partially made of apatite a group of minerals being generally pentacalcium triorthophosphate fluoride hydroxide is today the chief commercial source of this element According to the US Geological Survey USGS about percent of the global phosphorus reserves are in Amazigh nations like Morocco Algeria and Tunisia of Earth s known reserves are in Morocco with smaller deposits in China Russia Florida Idaho Tennessee Utah and elsewhere Albright and Wilson in the UK and their Niagara Falls plant for instance were using phosphate rock in the s and s from Tennessee Florida and the les du Conn table guano island sources of phosphate by they were using phosphate rock mainly from Tennessee and North Africa br Organic sources namely urine bone ash and in the latter th century guano were historically of importance but had only limited commercial success As urine contains phosphorus it has fertilising qualities which are still harnessed today in some countries including Sweden using methods for reuse of excreta To this end urine can be used as a fertiliser in its pure form or part of being mixed with water in the form of sewage or sewage sludge br br br Compounds br br br Phosphorus V br br The most prevalent compounds of phosphorus are derivatives of phosphate PO a tetrahedral anion Phosphate is the conjugate base of phosphoric acid which is produced on a massive scale for use in fertilisers Being triprotic phosphoric acid converts stepwise to three conjugate bases br br H PO H O H O H PO Ka br H PO H O H O HPO Ka br HPO H O H O PO Ka br Phosphate exhibits a tendency to form chains and rings containing P O P bonds Many polyphosphates are known including ATP Polyphosphates arise by dehydration of hydrogen phosphates such as HPO and H PO For example the industrially important pentasodium triphosphate also known as sodium tripolyphosphate STPP is produced industrially by the megatonne by this condensation reaction br br Na HPO NaH PO Na P O H O br Phosphorus pentoxide P O is the acid anhydride of phosphoric acid but several intermediates between the two are known This waxy white solid reacts vigorously with water br With metal cations phosphate forms a variety of salts These solids are polymeric featuring P O M linkages When the metal cation has a charge of or the salts are generally insoluble hence they exist as common minerals Many phosphate salts are derived from hydrogen phosphate HPO br PCl and PF are common compounds PF is a colourless gas and the molecules have trigonal bipyramidal geometry PCl is a colourless solid which has an ionic formulation of PCl PCl but adopts the trigonal bipyramidal geometry when molten or in the vapour phase PBr is an unstable solid formulated as PBr Br and PI is not known The pentachloride and pentafluoride are Lewis acids With fluoride PF forms PF an anion that is isoelectronic with SF The most important oxyhalide is phosphorus oxychloride POCl which is approximately tetrahedral br Before extensive computer calculations were feasible it was thought that bonding in phosphorus V compounds involved d orbitals Computer modeling of molecular orbital theory indicates that this bonding involves only s and p orbitals br br br Phosphorus III br All four symmetrical trihalides are well known gaseous PF the yellowish liquids PCl and PBr and the solid PI These materials are moisture sensitive hydrolysing to give phosphorous acid The trichloride a common reagent is produced by chlorination of white phosphorus br br P Cl PCl br The trifluoride is produced from the trichloride by halide exchange PF is toxic because it binds to haemoglobin br Phosphorus III oxide P O also called tetraphosphorus hexoxide is the anhydride of P OH the minor tautomer of phosphorous acid The structure of P O is like that of P O without the terminal oxide groups br br br Phosphorus I and phosphorus II br br These compounds generally feature P P bonds Examples include catenated derivatives of phosphine and organophosphines Compounds containing P P double bonds have also been observed although they are rare br br br Phosphides and phosphines br Phosphides arise by reaction of metals with red phosphorus The alkali metals group and alkaline earth metals can form ionic compounds containing the phosphide ion P These compounds react with water to form phosphine Other phosphides for example Na P are known for these reactive metals With the transition metals as well as the monophosphides there are metal rich phosphides which are generally hard refractory compounds with a metallic lustre and phosphorus rich phosphides which are less stable and include semiconductors Schreibersite is a naturally occurring metal rich phosphide found in meteorites The structures of the metal rich and phosphorus rich phosphides can be complex br Phosphine PH and its organic derivatives PR are structural analogues of ammonia NH but the bond angles at phosphorus are closer to for phosphine and its organic derivatives Phosphine is an ill smelling toxic gas Phosphorus has an oxidation number of in phosphine Phosphine is produced by hydrolysis of calcium phosphide Ca P Unlike ammonia phosphine is oxidised by air Phosphine is also far less basic than ammonia Other phosphines are known which contain chains of up to nine phosphorus atoms and have the formula PnHn The highly flammable gas diphosphine P H is an analogue of hydrazine br br br Oxoacids br Phosphorus oxoacids are extensive often commercially important and sometimes structurally complicated They all have acidic protons bound to oxygen atoms some have nonacidic protons that are bonded directly to phosphorus and some contain phosphorus phosphorus bonds Although many oxoacids of phosphorus are formed only nine are commercially important and three of them hypophosphorous acid phosphorous acid and phosphoric acid are particularly important br br br Nitrides br The PN molecule is considered unstable but is a product of crystalline phosphorus nitride decomposition at K Similarly H PN is considered unstable and phosphorus nitride halogens like F PN Cl PN Br PN and I PN oligomerise into cyclic polyphosphazenes For example compounds of the formula PNCl n exist mainly as rings such as the trimer hexachlorophosphazene The phosphazenes arise by treatment of phosphorus pentachloride with ammonium chloride PCl NH Cl n NPCl n HClWhen the chloride groups are replaced by alkoxide RO a family of polymers is produced with potentially useful properties br br br Sulfides br br Phosphorus forms a wide range of sulfides where the phosphorus can be in P V P III or other oxidation states The three fold symmetric P S is used in strike anywhere matches P S and P O have analogous structures Mixed oxyhalides and oxyhydrides of phosphorus III are almost unknown br br br Organophosphorus compounds br br Compounds with P C and P O C bonds are often classified as organophosphorus compounds They are widely used commercially The PCl serves as a source of P in routes to organophosphorus III compounds For example it is the precursor to triphenylphosphine br br PCl Na C H Cl P C H NaCl br Treatment of phosphorus trihalides with alcohols and phenols gives phosphites e g triphenylphosphite br br PCl C H OH P OC H HCl br Similar reactions occur for phosphorus oxychloride affording triphenylphosphate br br OPCl C H OH OP OC H HCl br br br History br br br Etymology br The name Phosphorus in Ancient Greece was the name for the planet Venus and is derived from the Greek words light carry which roughly translates as light bringer or light carrier In Greek mythology and tradition Augerinus morning star still in use today Hesperus or Hesperinus or or evening star still in use today and Eosphorus dawnbearer not in use for the planet after Christianity are close homologues and also associated with Phosphorus the morning star br According to the Oxford English Dictionary the correct spelling of the element is phosphorus The word phosphorous is the adjectival form of the P valence so just as sulfur forms sulfurous and sulfuric compounds phosphorus forms phosphorous compounds e g phosphorous acid and P valence phosphoric compounds e g phosphoric acids and phosphates br br br Discovery br br The discovery of phosphorus the first element to be discovered that was not known since ancient times is credited to the German alchemist Hennig Brand in although others might have discovered phosphorus around the same time Brand experimented with urine which contains considerable quantities of dissolved phosphates from normal metabolism Working in Hamburg Brand attempted to create the fabled philosopher s stone through the distillation of some salts by evaporating urine and in the process produced a white material that glowed in the dark and burned brilliantly It was named phosphorus mirabilis miraculous bearer of light br Brand s process originally involved letting urine stand for days until it gave off a terrible stench Then he boiled it down to a paste heated this paste to a high temperature and led the vapours through water where he hoped they would condense to gold Instead he obtained a white waxy substance that glowed in the dark Brand had discovered phosphorus Specifically Brand produced ammonium sodium hydrogen phosphate NH NaHPO While the quantities were essentially correct it took about litres US gal of urine to make about g of phosphorus it was unnecessary to allow the urine to rot first Later scientists discovered that fresh urine yielded the same amount of phosphorus br Brand at first tried to keep the method secret but later sold the recipe for thalers to Johann Daniel Kraft de from Dresden Krafft toured much of Europe with it including England where he met with Robert Boyle The secret that the substance was made from urine leaked out and Johann Kunckel was able to reproduce it in Sweden Later Boyle in London also managed to make phosphorus possibly with the aid of his assistant Ambrose Godfrey Hanckwitz Godfrey later made a business of the manufacture of phosphorus br Boyle states that Krafft gave him no information as to the preparation of phosphorus other than that it was derived from somewhat that belonged to the body of man This gave Boyle a valuable clue so that he too managed to make phosphorus and published the method of its manufacture Later he improved Brand s process by using sand in the reaction still using urine as base material br br NaPO SiO C Na SiO CO P br Robert Boyle was the first to use phosphorus to ignite sulfur tipped wooden splints forerunners of our modern matches in br Phosphorus was the th element to be discovered Because of its tendency to spontaneously combust when left alone in air it is sometimes referred to as the Devil s element br br br Bone ash and guano br br Antoine Lavoisier recognized phosphorus as an element in after Johan Gottlieb Gahn and Carl Wilhelm Scheele in showed that calcium phosphate Ca PO is found in bones by obtaining elemental phosphorus from bone ash br Bone ash was the major source of phosphorus until the s The method started by roasting bones then employed the use of fire clay retorts encased in a very hot brick furnace to distill out the highly toxic elemental phosphorus product Alternately precipitated phosphates could be made from ground up bones that had been de greased and treated with strong acids White phosphorus could then be made by heating the precipitated phosphates mixed with ground coal or charcoal in an iron pot and distilling off phosphorus vapour in a retort Carbon monoxide and other flammable gases produced during the reduction process were burnt off in a flare stack br In the s world phosphate production turned to the mining of tropical island deposits formed from bird and bat guano see also Guano Islands Act These became an important source of phosphates for fertiliser in the latter half of the th century br br br Phosphate rock br Phosphate rock which usually contains calcium phosphate was first used in to make phosphorus and following the introduction of the electric arc furnace by James Burgess Readman in patented elemental phosphorus production switched from the bone ash heating to electric arc production from phosphate rock After the depletion of world guano sources about the same time mineral phosphates became the major source of phosphate fertiliser production Phosphate rock production greatly increased after World War II and remains the primary global source of phosphorus and phosphorus chemicals today Phosphate rock remains a feedstock in the fertiliser industry where it is treated with sulfuric acid to produce various superphosphate fertiliser products br br br Incendiaries br White phosphorus was first made commercially in the th century for the match industry This used bone ash for a phosphate source as described above The bone ash process became obsolete when the submerged arc furnace for phosphorus production was introduced to reduce phosphate rock The electric furnace method allowed production to increase to the point where phosphorus could be used in weapons of war In World War I it was used in incendiaries smoke screens and tracer bullets A special incendiary bullet was developed to shoot at hydrogen filled Zeppelins over Britain hydrogen being highly flammable During World War II Molotov cocktails made of phosphorus dissolved in petrol were distributed in Britain to specially selected civilians within the British resistance operation for defence and phosphorus incendiary bombs were used in war on a large scale Burning phosphorus is difficult to extinguish and if it splashes onto human skin it has horrific effects br Early matches used white phosphorus in their composition which was dangerous due to its toxicity Murders suicides and accidental poisonings resulted from its use An apocryphal tale tells of a woman attempting to murder her husband with white phosphorus in his food which was detected by the stew s giving off luminous steam In addition exposure to the vapours gave match workers a severe necrosis of the bones of the jaw known as phossy jaw When a safe process for manufacturing red phosphorus was discovered with its far lower flammability and toxicity laws were enacted under the Berne Convention requiring its adoption as a safer alternative for match manufacture The toxicity of white phosphorus led to discontinuation of its use in matches The Allies used phosphorus incendiary bombs in World War II to destroy Hamburg the place where the miraculous bearer of light was first discovered br br br Production br br In the USGS estimated billion tons of world reserves where reserve figures refer to the amount assumed recoverable at current market prices billion tons were mined in Critical to contemporary agriculture its annual demand is rising nearly twice as fast as the growth of the human population The production of phosphorus may have peaked before and some scientists predict reserves will be depleted before the end of the st century Phosphorus comprises about by mass of the average rock and consequently the Earth s supply is vast though dilute br br br Wet process br Most phosphorus bearing material is for agriculture fertilisers In this case where the standards of purity are modest phosphorus is obtained from phosphate rock by what is called the wet process The minerals are treated with sulfuric acid to give phosphoric acid Phosphoric acid is then neutralized to give various phosphate salts which comprise fertilizers In the wet process phosphorus does not undergo redox About five tons of phosphogypsum waste are generated per ton of phosphoric acid production Annually the estimated generation of phosphogypsum worldwide is to Mt br br br Thermal process br For the use of phosphorus in drugs detergents and foodstuff the standards of purity are high which led to the development of the thermal process In this process phosphate minerals are converted to white phosphorus which can be purified by distillation The white phosphorus is then oxidised to phosphoric acid and subsequently neutralised with a base to give phosphate salts The thermal process is conducted in a submerged arc furnace which is energy intensive Presently about short tons t of elemental phosphorus is produced annually Calcium phosphate as phosphate rock mostly mined in Florida and North Africa can be heated to C with sand which is mostly SiO and coke to produce P The P product being volatile is readily isolated br br Ca PO F SiO C P CO CaSiO CaF br Ca PO SiO C CaSiO CO P br Side products from the thermal process include ferrophosphorus a crude form of Fe P resulting from iron impurities in the mineral precursors The silicate slag is a useful construction material The fluoride is sometimes recovered for use in water fluoridation More problematic is a mud containing significant amounts of white phosphorus Production of white phosphorus is conducted in large facilities in part because it is energy intensive The white phosphorus is transported in molten form Some major accidents have occurred during transportation br br br Historical routes br Historically before the development of mineral based extractions white phosphorus was isolated on an industrial scale from bone ash In this process the tricalcium phosphate in bone ash is converted to monocalcium phosphate with sulfuric acid br br Ca PO H SO Ca H PO CaSO br Monocalcium phosphate is then dehydrated to the corresponding metaphosphate br br Ca H PO Ca PO H O br When ignited to a white heat C with charcoal calcium metaphosphate yields two thirds of its weight of white phosphorus while one third of the phosphorus remains in the residue as calcium orthophosphate br br Ca PO C Ca PO CO P br br br Peak phosphorus br br Peak phosphorus is a concept to describe the point in time when humanity reaches the maximum global production rate of phosphorus as an industrial and commercial raw material The term is used in an equivalent way to the better known term peak oil The issue was raised as a debate on whether phosphorus shortages might be imminent around which was largely dismissed after USGS and other organizations increased world estimates on available phosphorus resources mostly in the form of additional resources in Morocco However exact reserve quantities remain uncertain as do the possible impacts of increased phosphate use on future generations This is important because rock phosphate is a key ingredient in many inorganic fertilizers Hence a shortage in rock phosphate or just significant price increases might negatively affect the world s food security br Phosphorus is a finite limited resource that is widespread in the Earth s crust and in living organisms but is relatively scarce in concentrated forms which are not evenly distributed across the Earth The only cost effective production method to date is the mining of phosphate rock but only a few countries have significant commercial reserves The top five are Morocco including reserves located in Western Sahara China Egypt Algeria and Syria Estimates for future production vary significantly depending on modelling and assumptions on extractable volumes but it is inescapable that future production of phosphate rock will be heavily influenced by Morocco in the foreseeable future br Means of commercial phosphorus production besides mining are few because the phosphorus cycle does not include significant gas phase transport The predominant source of phosphorus in modern times is phosphate rock as opposed to the guano that preceded it According to some researchers Earth s commercial and affordable phosphorus reserves are expected to be depleted in years and peak phosphorus to be reached in approximately Others suggest that supplies will last for several hundreds of years As with the timing of peak oil the question is not settled and researchers in different fields regularly publish different estimates of the rock phosphate reserves br br br Background br br The peak phosphorus concept is connected with the concept of planetary boundaries Phosphorus as part of biogeochemical processes belongs to one of the nine Earth system processes which are known to have boundaries As long as the boundaries are not crossed they mark the safe zone for the planet br br br Estimates of world phosphate reserves br br The accurate determination of peak phosphorus is dependent on knowing the total world s commercial phosphate reserves and resources especially in the form of phosphate rock a summarizing term for over ores of different origin composition and phosphate content Reserves refers to the amount assumed recoverable at current market prices and resources refers to estimated amounts of such a grade or quality that they have reasonable prospects for economic extraction br Unprocessed phosphate rock has a concentration of phosphorus by mass phosphorus pentoxide By comparison the Earth s crust contains phosphorus by mass and vegetation Although quadrillions of tons of phosphorus exist in the Earth s crust these are currently not economically extractable br In the United States Geological Survey USGS estimated that economically extractable phosphate rock reserves worldwide are billion tons while world mining production in was million tons Assuming zero growth the reserves would thus last for around years This broadly confirms a International Fertilizer Development Center IFDC report that global reserves would last for several hundred years Phosphorus reserve figures are intensely debated Gilbert suggest that there has been little external verification of the estimate A review concluded that the IFDC report presents an inflated picture of global reserves in particular those of Morocco where largely hypothetical and inferred resources have simply been relabeled reserves br The countries with most phosphate rock commercial reserves in billion metric tons Morocco China Egypt Algeria Syria Brazil Saudi Arabia South Africa Australia United States Finland Russia Jordan br Rock phosphate shortages or just significant price increases might negatively affect the world s food security Many agricultural systems depend on supplies of inorganic fertilizer which use rock phosphate Under the food production regime in developed countries shortages of rock phosphate could lead to shortages of inorganic fertilizer which could in turn reduce the global food production br Economists have pointed out that price fluctuations of rock phosphate do not necessarily indicate peak phosphorus as these have already occurred due to various demand and supply side factors br br br United States br br US production of phosphate rock peaked in at million metric tons The United States was the world s largest producer of phosphate rock from at least up until when US production was exceeded by that of China In the US produced percent of the world s phosphate rock br br br Exhaustion of guano reserves br br In Garcilaso de la Vega wrote the book Comentarios Reales in which he described many of the agricultural practices of the Incas prior to the arrival of the Spaniards and introduced the use of guano as a fertilizer As Garcilaso described the Incas near the coast harvested guano In the early s Alexander von Humboldt introduced guano as a source of agricultural fertilizer to Europe after having discovered it on islands off the coast of South America It has been reported that at the time of its discovery the guano on some islands was over meters deep The guano had previously been used by the Moche people as a source of fertilizer by mining it and transporting it back to Peru by boat International commerce in guano did not start until after By the start of the th century guano had been nearly completely depleted and was eventually overtaken with the discovery of methods of production of superphosphate br br br Phosphorus conservation and recycling br br br Overview br Phosphorus can be transferred from the soil in one location to another as food is transported across the world taking the phosphorus it contains with it Once consumed by humans it can end up in the local environment in the case of open defecation which is still widespread on a global scale or in rivers or the ocean via sewage systems and sewage treatment plants in the case of cities connected to sewer systems An example of one crop that takes up large amounts of phosphorus is soy br In an effort to postpone the onset of peak phosphorus several methods of reducing and reusing phosphorus are in practice such as in agriculture and in sanitation systems The Soil Association the UK organic agriculture certification and pressure group issued a report in A Rock and a Hard Place encouraging more recycling of phosphorus One potential solution to the shortage of phosphorus is greater recycling of human and animal wastes back into the environment br br br Agricultural practices br Reducing agricultural runoff and soil erosion can slow the frequency with which farmers have to reapply phosphorus to their fields Agricultural methods such as no till farming terracing contour tilling and the use of windbreaks have been shown to reduce the rate of phosphorus depletion from farmland These methods are still dependent on a periodic application of phosphate rock to the soil and as such methods to recycle the lost phosphorus have also been proposed Perennial vegetation such as grassland or forest is much more efficient in its use of phosphate than arable land Strips of grassland and or forest between arable land and rivers can greatly reduce losses of phosphate and other nutrients br Integrated farming systems which use animal sources to supply phosphorus for crops do exist at smaller scales and application of the system to a larger scale is a potential alternative for supplying the nutrient although it would require significant changes to the widely adopted modern crop fertilizing methods br br br Excreta reuse br br The oldest method of recycling phosphorus is through the reuse of animal manure and human excreta in agriculture Via this method phosphorus in the foods consumed are excreted and the animal or human excreta are subsequently collected and re applied to the fields Although this method has maintained civilizations for centuries the current system of manure management is not logistically geared towards application to crop fields on a large scale At present manure application could not meet the phosphorus needs of large scale agriculture Despite that it is still an efficient method of recycling used phosphorus and returning it to the soil br br br Sewage sludge br Sewage treatment plants that have an enhanced biological phosphorus removal step produce a sewage sludge that is rich in phosphorus Various processes have been developed to extract phosphorus from sewage sludge directly from the ash after incineration of the sewage sludge or from other products of sewage sludge treatment This includes the extraction of phosphorus rich materials such as struvite from waste processing plants The struvite can be made by adding magnesium to the waste Some companies such as Ostara in Canada and NuReSys in Belgium are already using this technique to recover phosphate br Research on phosphorus recovery methods from sewage sludge has been carried out in Sweden and Germany since around but the technologies currently under development are not yet cost effective given the current price of phosphorus on the world market br br br Applications br br br Flame retardant br Phosphorus compounds are used as flame retardants Flame retardant materials and coatings are being developed that are both phosphorus and bio based br br br Food additive br Phosphorus is an essential mineral for humans listed in the Dietary Reference Intake DRI br Food grade phosphoric acid additive E is used to acidify foods and beverages such as various colas and jams providing a tangy or sour taste The phosphoric acid also serves as a preservative Soft drinks containing phosphoric acid including Coca Cola are sometimes called phosphate sodas or phosphates Phosphoric acid in soft drinks has the potential to cause dental erosion Phosphoric acid also has the potential to contribute to the formation of kidney stones especially in those who have had kidney stones previously br br br Fertiliser br br Phosphorus is an essential plant nutrient the most often limiting nutrient after nitrogen and the bulk of all phosphorus production is in concentrated phosphoric acids for agriculture fertilisers containing as much as to P O That led to large increase in phosphate PO production in the second half of the th century Artificial phosphate fertilisation is necessary because phosphorus is essential to all living organisms it is involved in energy transfers strength of root and stems photosynthesis the expansion of plant roots formation of seeds and flowers and other important factors effecting overall plant health and genetics Heavy use of phosphorus fertilizers and their runoff have resulted in eutrophication overenrichment of aquatic ecosystems br Natural phosphorus bearing compounds are mostly inaccessible to plants because of the low solubility and mobility in soil Most phosphorus is very stable in the soil minerals or organic matter of the soil Even when phosphorus is added in manure or fertilizer it can become fixed in the soil Therefore the natural phosphorus cycle is very slow Some of the fixed phosphorus is released again over time sustaining wild plant growth however more is needed to sustain intensive cultivation of crops Fertiliser is often in the form of superphosphate of lime a mixture of calcium dihydrogen phosphate Ca H PO and calcium sulfate dihydrate CaSO H O produced reacting sulfuric acid and water with calcium phosphate br Processing phosphate minerals with sulfuric acid for obtaining fertiliser is so important to the global economy that this is the primary industrial market for sulfuric acid and the greatest industrial use of elemental sulfur br br br Organophosphorus br White phosphorus is widely used to make organophosphorus compounds through intermediate phosphorus chlorides and two phosphorus sulfides phosphorus pentasulfide and phosphorus sesquisulfide Organophosphorus compounds have many applications including in plasticisers flame retardants pesticides extraction agents nerve agents and water treatment br br br Metallurgical aspects br Phosphorus is also an important component in steel production in the making of phosphor bronze and in many other related products Phosphorus is added to metallic copper during its smelting process to react with oxygen present as an impurity in copper and to produce phosphorus containing copper CuOFP alloys with a higher hydrogen embrittlement resistance than normal copper br Phosphate conversion coating is a chemical treatment applied to steel parts to improve their corrosion resistance br br br Matches br br The first striking match with a phosphorus head was invented by Charles Sauria in These matches and subsequent modifications were made with heads of white phosphorus an oxygen releasing compound potassium chlorate lead dioxide or sometimes nitrate and a binder They were poisonous to the workers in manufacture sensitive to storage conditions toxic if ingested and hazardous when accidentally ignited on a rough surface Production in several countries was banned between and The international Berne Convention ratified in prohibited the use of white phosphorus in matches br In consequence phosphorous matches were gradually replaced by safer alternatives Around French chemists Henri S v ne and Emile David Cahen invented the modern strike anywhere match wherein the white phosphorus was replaced by phosphorus sesquisulfide P S a non toxic and non pyrophoric compound that ignites under friction For a time these safer strike anywhere matches were quite popular but in the long run they were superseded by the modern safety match br Safety matches are very difficult to ignite on any surface other than a special striker strip The strip contains non toxic red phosphorus and the match head potassium chlorate an oxygen releasing compound When struck small amounts of abrasion from match head and striker strip are mixed intimately to make a small quantity of Armstrong s mixture a very touch sensitive composition The fine powder ignites immediately and provides the initial spark to set off the match head Safety matches separate the two components of the ignition mixture until the match is struck This is the key safety advantage as it prevents accidental ignition Nonetheless safety matches invented in by Gustaf Erik Pasch and market ready by the s did not gain consumer acceptance until the prohibition of white phosphorus Using a dedicated striker strip was considered clumsy br br br Water softening br Sodium tripolyphosphate made from phosphoric acid is used in laundry detergents in some countries but banned for this use in others This compound softens the water to enhance the performance of the detergents and to prevent pipe boiler tube corrosion br br br Miscellaneous br Phosphates are used to make special glasses for sodium lamps br Bone ash mostly calcium phosphate is used in the production of fine china br Phosphoric acid made from elemental phosphorus is used in food applications such as soft drinks and as a starting point for food grade phosphates These include monocalcium phosphate for baking powder and sodium tripolyphosphate Phosphates are used to improve the characteristics of processed meat and cheese and in toothpaste br White phosphorus called WP slang term Willie Peter is used in military applications as incendiary bombs for smoke screening as smoke pots and smoke bombs and in tracer ammunition It is also a part of an obsolete M White Phosphorus US hand grenade This multipurpose grenade was mostly used for signaling smoke screens and inflammation it could also cause severe burns and had a psychological impact on the enemy Military uses of white phosphorus are constrained by international law br P and P are used as radioactive tracers in biochemical laboratories br br br Biological role br br Inorganic phosphorus in the form of the phosphate PO is required for all known forms of life Phosphorus plays a major role in the structural framework of DNA and RNA Living cells use phosphate to transport cellular energy with adenosine triphosphate ATP necessary for every cellular process that uses energy ATP is also important for phosphorylation a key regulatory event in cells Phospholipids are the main structural components of all cellular membranes Calcium phosphate salts assist in stiffening bones Biochemists commonly use the abbreviation Pi to refer to inorganic phosphate br Every living cell is encased in a membrane that separates it from its surroundings Cellular membranes are composed of a phospholipid matrix and proteins typically in the form of a bilayer Phospholipids are derived from glycerol with two of the glycerol hydroxyl OH protons replaced by fatty acids as an ester and the third hydroxyl proton has been replaced with phosphate bonded to another alcohol br An average adult human contains about kg of phosphorus about in bones and teeth in the form of apatite and the remainder in soft tissues and extracellular fluids The phosphorus content increases from about by mass in infancy to by mass in adults Average phosphorus concentration in the blood is about g L about of that is organic and inorganic phosphates An adult with healthy diet consumes and excretes about grams of phosphorus per day with consumption in the form of inorganic phosphate and phosphorus containing biomolecules such as nucleic acids and phospholipids and excretion almost exclusively in the form of phosphate ions such as H PO and HPO Only about of body phosphate circulates in the blood paralleling the amount of phosphate available to soft tissue cells br br br Bone and teeth enamel br The main component of bone is hydroxyapatite as well as amorphous forms of calcium phosphate possibly including carbonate Hydroxyapatite is the main component of tooth enamel Water fluoridation enhances the resistance of teeth to decay by the partial conversion of this mineral to the still harder material fluorapatite br br Ca PO OH F Ca PO F OH br br br Phosphorus deficiency br In medicine phosphate deficiency syndrome may be caused by malnutrition by failure to absorb phosphate and by metabolic syndromes that draw phosphate from the blood such as in refeeding syndrome after malnutrition or passing too much of it into the urine All are characterised by hypophosphatemia which is a condition of low levels of soluble phosphate levels in the blood serum and inside the cells Symptoms of hypophosphatemia include neurological dysfunction and disruption of muscle and blood cells due to lack of ATP Too much phosphate can lead to diarrhoea and calcification hardening of organs and soft tissue and can interfere with the body s ability to use iron calcium magnesium and zinc br Phosphorus is an essential macromineral for plants which is studied extensively in edaphology to understand plant uptake from soil systems Phosphorus is a limiting factor in many ecosystems that is the scarcity of phosphorus limits the rate of organism growth An excess of phosphorus can also be problematic especially in aquatic systems where eutrophication sometimes leads to algal blooms br br br Nutrition br br br Dietary recommendations br The U S Institute of Medicine IOM updated Estimated Average Requirements EARs and Recommended Dietary Allowances RDAs for phosphorus in If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs an estimate designated Adequate Intake AI is used instead The current EAR for phosphorus for people ages and up is mg day The RDA is mg day RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements RDA for pregnancy and lactation are also mg day For people ages years the RDA increases with age from to mg day As for safety the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels ULs for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient In the case of phosphorus the UL is mg day Collectively the EARs RDAs AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes DRIs br The European Food Safety Authority EFSA refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values with Population Reference Intake PRI instead of RDA and Average Requirement instead of EAR AI and UL are defined the same as in the United States For people ages and older including pregnancy and lactation the AI is set at mg day For children ages the AI is mg day and for ages it is mg day These AIs are lower than the U S RDAs In both systems teenagers need more than adults The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and decided that there was not sufficient information to set a UL br For U S food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value DV For phosphorus labeling purposes of the Daily Value was mg but as of May it was revised to mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake br br br Food sources br The main food sources for phosphorus are the same as those containing protein although proteins do not contain phosphorus For example milk meat and soya typically also have phosphorus As a rule if a diet has sufficient protein and calcium the amount of phosphorus is probably sufficient br br br Precautions br br Organic compounds of phosphorus form a wide class of materials many are required for life but some are extremely toxic Fluorophosphate esters are among the most potent neurotoxins known A wide range of organophosphorus compounds are used for their toxicity as pesticides herbicides insecticides fungicides etc and weaponised as nerve agents against enemy humans Most inorganic phosphates are relatively nontoxic and essential nutrients br The white phosphorus allotrope presents a significant hazard because it ignites in the air and produces phosphoric acid residue Chronic white phosphorus poisoning leads to necrosis of the jaw called phossy jaw White phosphorus is toxic causing severe liver damage on ingestion and may cause a condition known as Smoking Stool Syndrome br In the past external exposure to elemental phosphorus was treated by washing the affected area with copper II sulfate solution to form harmless compounds that are then washed away According to the recent US Navy s Treatment of Chemical Agent Casualties and Conventional Military Chemical Injuries FM Part Conventional Military Chemical Injuries Cupric copper II sulfate has been used by U S personnel in the past and is still being used by some nations However copper sulfate is toxic and its use will be discontinued Copper sulfate may produce kidney and cerebral toxicity as well as intravascular hemolysis br The manual suggests instead a bicarbonate solution to neutralise phosphoric acid which will then allow removal of visible white phosphorus Particles often can be located by their emission of smoke when air strikes them or by their phosphorescence in the dark In dark surroundings fragments are seen as luminescent spots Promptly debride the burn if the patient s condition will permit removal of bits of WP white phosphorus that might be absorbed later and possibly produce systemic poisoning DO NOT apply oily based ointments until it is certain that all WP has been removed Following complete removal of the particles treat the lesions as thermal burns As white phosphorus readily mixes with oils any oily substances or ointments are not recommended until the area is thoroughly cleaned and all white phosphorus removed br People can be exposed to phosphorus in the workplace by inhalation ingestion skin contact and eye contact The Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA has set the phosphorus exposure limit Permissible exposure limit in the workplace at mg m over an hour workday The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health NIOSH has set a Recommended exposure limit REL of mg m over an hour workday At levels of mg m phosphorus is immediately dangerous to life and health br br br US DEA List I status br Phosphorus can reduce elemental iodine to hydroiodic acid which is a reagent effective for reducing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine For this reason red and white phosphorus were designated by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration as List I precursor chemicals under CFR effective on November In the United States handlers of red or white phosphorus are subject
