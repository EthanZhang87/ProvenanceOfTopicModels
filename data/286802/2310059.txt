A nitrogen oxide sensor or NOx sensor is typically a high temperature device built to detect nitrogen oxides in combustion environments such as an automobile truck tailpipe or smokestack br br br Overview br The term NOx represents several forms of nitrogen oxides such as NO nitric oxide NO nitrogen dioxide and N O nitrous oxide also known as laughing gas In a gasoline engine NO is the most common form of NOx at around while NO is around and the rest is N O There are other forms of NOx such as N O the dimer of NO which only exists at lower temperatures and N O for example br Meanwhile for diesel engines the emissions situation is different Owing to their much higher combustion temperatures resulting from their high cylinder compression ratios as well as turbocharging or supercharging diesel engines produce much higher engine out NOx emissions than spark ignition gasoline engines The recent availability of Selective catalytic reduction SCR allows properly equipped diesel engines to emit similar values of NOx at the tailpipe compared to a typical gasoline engine with a way catalyst The SCR changes the harmful nitrogen oxides by adding the solution AdBlue which reduces environmental pollution and protects the exhaust system In addition the diesel oxidation catalyst significantly increases the fraction of NO in NOx by oxidizing over of NO using the excess oxygen in the diesel exhaust gases br The drive to develop a NOx sensor arises from environmental factors NOx gases can cause various problems such as smog and acid rain Many governments around the world have passed laws to limit their emissions along with other combustion gases such as SOx oxides of sulfur CO carbon monoxide and CO carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons Companies have realized that one way of minimizing NOx emissions is to first detect them and then to employ some sort of feedback loop in the combustion process thereby enabling the minimization of NOx production by for example combustion optimization or regeneration of NOx traps Therefore in many applications with exhaust gas treatment systems one NOx sensor is used upstream of the exhaust gas treatment system upstream and a second sensor is used downstream of the exhaust gas treatment system The upstream sensor is used for the aforementioned feedback loop Meanwhile the downstream sensor is used mainly to confirm that the legislated emissions limits have not been exceeded br br br Challenges br br br Harsh environment br Due to the high temperature of the combustion environment only certain types of material can operate in situ The majority of NOx sensors developed have been made out of ceramic type metal oxides with the most common being yttria stabilized zirconia YSZ which is currently used in the decades old oxygen sensor The YSZ is compacted into a dense ceramic and conducts oxygen ions O at the high temperatures of a tailpipe such at C and above To get a signal from the sensor a pair of high temperature electrodes such as noble metals platinum gold or palladium or other metal oxides are placed onto the surface and an electrical signal such as the change in voltage or current is measured as a function of NOx concentration br br br High sensitivity and durability required br The levels of NO are around ppm parts per million and NO ppm in a range of O The sensor has to be very sensitive to pick up these levels br The main challenges in the sensor development are selectivity sensitivity stability reproducibility response time limit of detection and cost In addition due to the harsh environment of combustion the high gas flow rate can cool the sensor which alters the signal or it can delaminate the electrodes over time and soot particles can degrade the materials br One of the major challenges faced by such gas sensors is humidity The relative effect on signal response is highly subjective to the sensor type Electrochemical sensors are mostly immune from humidity effect as water molecules help regulate the electrolyte concentration but long term exposure to dry gas can reduce the solvent concentration of the electrolyte High amount of cross sensitivity has been observed in gas sensors due to similarity in electron exchange mechanism between target gases and water molecules br br br See also br List of sensors br br br
