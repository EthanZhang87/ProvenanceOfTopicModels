these films often are nobody is making animated characters as funny or likable or marketable as the Minions Serena Puang from Boston Globe gave the film two and a half stars out of four and wrote The movie is fun The music is unironically good a particular standout is the Minions s rendition of Simon and Garfunkel s Cecilia Bob as cute as ever learns that even the smallest of us are capable of great things br Scroll in s Udita Jhunjhunwala giving a positive review wrote The animated comedy is an minute delight further enlivened by the talented voice cast Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent rated the film three out of five stars saying that There s nothing all that special about The Rise of Gru but it runs like a well oiled machine RogerEbert com s Odie Henderson rated the film three out of five stars and praised the humor writing The laughs are well paced and the viewer isn t given too much time to reflect on how ridiculous Matthew Fogel s screenplay is despite feeling the pacing was breakneck He also commended the film s animation deeming it striking from the gorgeously rendered Chinatown of the City by the Bay to the charming look of young Gru He has the same big

would you want it any other way The Associated Press s Jake Coyle scored the film two and a half stars out of four and ended his review If anything the Minion craze has proven the timeless versatility

of fumes Bilge Ebiri from Vulture gave the film a negative review writing that it looks nice the kids will enjoy it and at minutes it all goes down relatively smoothly but it s not quite smart enough to be as stupid as it wants to be Los Angeles Times s Katie Walsh in a negative review wrote These references and the relentless assault of s needle drops are fun to a point but the movie itself is minutes of pure chaos a hallucinatory cacophonous fever dream of nonsensical subplots and Minion gibberish br br br Gentleminions TikTok trend br A popular Internet meme involving groups of young adults dressed in suits like the character Gru attending the film and some dressing up like Minions with the tag Gentleminions began spreading on TikTok almost immediately after the film s release The

formal attire from seeing the film due to their disruptive behavior during screenings The meme was also documented in the United States Norway Singapore and Israel br The substantial meme subculture around The Rise of Gru was noted by The Face to be similar to memes surrounding the superhero film Morbius released earlier in Both meme subcultures focused around a largely ironic appreciation for the supposed strengths of said film often verging on the absurdist but The Face noted that the interest in The Rise of Gru was largely based in genuine interest in the film whereas the interest in Morbius was based solely in the latter s perceived lack of quality br The social media accounts for Universal Pictures Illumination and the franchise acknowledged the meme with the latter two posting a video that depicted the Minions participating in the trend br PostTrak reported that of The Rise of Gru audiences were between the ages of and an unusually high percentage for an animated film
