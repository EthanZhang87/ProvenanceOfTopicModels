are soon picked up as the only survivors br br br Criticism of novel s plan and changes made in filmed version br After publication of the novel the details of Operation Grand Slam were questioned with critics noting it would have taken hours if not days to remove billion from Fort Knox during which the U S Army would have inevitably intervened The issue of getting every soldier on the base to drink the poisoned water without an alarm was also raised A final problem was the clean atomic bomb tactical or not which in all likelihood would have annihilated the vault instead of breaking it open The novel itself has a scene where Bond points out to Goldfinger several reasons why the plan could not possibly work and Goldfinger responds only with a vague assurance that he has prepared solutions for these problems br Consequently the filmed version of the novel altered the details of the plan Although Bond initially believes that Goldfinger intends to steal the bullion he soon realizes that the true plan is to set off a Chinese supplied dirty bomb within the vault The explosion will irradiate the gold and render it unusable for decades crippling the gold standard based economy and greatly increasing the value of Goldfinger s personal bullion holdings During this conversation Bond points out the logistical flaws in the theft as set out in the original novel br br br Film

against a lost historical Nazi gold bar an incident not in the novel the golf game is played for Goldfinger cheats with help from Oddjob but Bond figures out the deception and tricks him into playing the wrong ball on the last hole costing him the match Goldfinger is shown to take sadistic pleasure in killing his enemies which he accomplishes in elaborate ways This is shown when he attempts to kill a captured Bond by slowly cutting him in half with a laser but is talked out of it by Bond and later when he uses nerve gas to execute a group of gangsters he had invited to his ranch br Initially Goldfinger makes it appear that his plan is to rob Fort Knox but when Bond reveals Goldfinger that this is impossible because it would take weeks trucks and men to steal the gold before the authorities find out and force him to return the gold when Goldfinger denies plan steal gold Bond begins to connect the dots and concludes the Goldfinger s real plan is to detonate a small dirty bomb within the gold bullion depository at Fort Knox The explosion will render the gold radioactive and unusable for years increasing the value of his own gold and giving the Chinese an advantage resulting
