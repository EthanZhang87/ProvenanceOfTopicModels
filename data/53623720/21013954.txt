Service agent code number pronounced double O seven residing in London but active internationally Bond was a composite character who was based on a number of commandos whom Fleming knew during his service in the Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War to whom Fleming added his own style and a number of his own tastes Bond s name may have been appropriated from the American ornithologist of the same name although it is possible that Fleming took the name from a Welsh agent with whom he served James C Bond Bond has a number of consistent character traits which run throughout the books including an enjoyment of cars a love of food drink and sex and an average intake of sixty custom made cigarettes a day br Since Fleming s death in there have been other authorised writers of Bond material including John Gardner who wrote fourteen novels and two novelizations Raymond Benson who wrote six novels three novelizations and three short stories and Anthony Horowitz who has written three novels There have also been other authors who wrote one book each Kingsley Amis under the pseudonym Robert Markham Sebastian Faulks Jeffery Deaver and William Boyd Additionally a series of novels based on Bond s youth Young Bond was written by Charlie Higson and later Stephen Cole br As a spin off from the original literary work Casino Royale a television adaptation was made Casino Royale in which Bond was depicted as an American agent A comic strip series also ran in the Daily Express newspaper There have been twenty seven Bond films seven actors have played Bond in the films br br br Background and inspiration br The central figure in Ian Fleming s work is the fictional character of James Bond an intelligence officer in the Secret Service Bond is also known by his code number and was a Royal Naval Reserve Commander br br During the Second World War Ian Fleming had mentioned to friends that he wanted to write a spy novel It was not until however shortly before his wedding to his pregnant girlfriend Ann Charteris that Fleming began to write his first book Casino Royale to distract himself from his forthcoming nuptials Fleming started writing the novel at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica on February typing out words in the morning directly from his own experiences and imagination He finished work on the manuscript in just over a month completing it on March Describing the work as his dreadful oafish opus Fleming showed it to an ex girlfriend Clare Blanchard who advised him not to publish it at all but that if he did so it should be under another name Despite that advice Fleming went on to write a total of twelve Bond novels and two short story collections before his death on August The last two books The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights were published posthumously br br br Inspiration for the character br br Fleming based his creation on a number of individuals which he came across during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division during the Second World War admitting that Bond was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war Among those types were his brother Peter whom Fleming worshipped and who had been involved in behind the lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war br Aside from Fleming s brother a number of others also provided some aspects of Bond s make up including Conrad O Brien ffrench a skiing spy whom Fleming had met in Kitzb hel in the s Patrick Dalzel Job who served with distinction in AU during the war and Bill Biffy Dunderdale station head of MI in Paris who wore cuff links and handmade suits and was chauffeured around Paris in a Rolls Royce Sir Fitzroy Maclean was another figure mentioned as a possibility based on his wartime work behind enemy lines in the Balkans as was the MI double agent Du an Popov br In a BBC Radio documentary explored the possibility that the character of Bond was created by th Century author and mentor to Fleming Phyllis Bottome in her novel The Lifeline Distinct similarities between the protagonist in The Lifeline Mark Chalmers and Bond have been highlighted by spy writer Nigel West br br br Origins of the name br Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond a Caribbean bird expert and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies Fleming a keen birdwatcher himself had a copy of Bond s guide and he later explained to the ornithologist s wife that It struck me that this brief unromantic Anglo Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed and so a second James Bond was born br br On another occasion Fleming said I wanted the simplest dullest plainest sounding name I could find James Bond was much better than something more interesting like Peregrine Carruthers Exotic things would happen to and around him but he would be a neutral figure an anonymous blunt instrument wielded by a government department After Fleming met the ornithologist and his wife he described them as a charming couple who are amused by the whole joke In the first draft of Casino Royale he decided to use the name James Secretan as Bond s cover name while on missions br In it was reported that the name could have emerged from a former member of the Special Operations Executive James Charles Bond who had according to released military records served under Fleming br Bond s code number was assigned by Fleming in reference to one of British naval intelligence s key achievements of First World War the breaking of the German diplomatic code One of the German documents cracked and read by the British was the Zimmermann Telegram which was coded and which was one of the factors that led to the US entering the war br br br Characterisation br br br Appearance br br Facially Bond resembles the composer singer and actor Hoagy Carmichael In Casino Royale Vesper Lynd remarks Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael but there is something cold and ruthless Likewise in Moonraker Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is certainly good looking Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow Much the same bones But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth and the eyes were cold Others such as journalist Ben Macintyre identify aspects of Fleming s own looks in his description of Bond General references in the novels describe Bond as having dark rather cruel good looks br In the novels notably From Russia with Love Bond s physical description has generally been consistent slim build a in mm long thin vertical scar on his right cheek blue grey eyes a cruel mouth short black hair a comma of which rests on his forehead Physically he is described as m ft in in height and kg lb in weight During Casino Royale a SMERSH agent carves the Russian Cyrillic letter SH for Shpion Spy into the back of Bond s right hand by the start of Live and Let Die Bond has had a skin graft to hide the scars br br br Background br br br Early life br In Fleming s stories Bond is in his mid to late thirties but does not age In Moonraker he admits to being eight years shy of mandatory retirement age from the section which would mean he was at the time Fleming did not provide Bond s date of birth but John Pearson s fictional biography of Bond James Bond The Authorized Biography of gives him a birth date of November while a study by Bond scholar John Griswold puts the date at November According to Griswold the Fleming novels take place between around May to February by which time Bond was aged br br Fleming wrote On Her Majesty s Secret Service while Dr No was being filmed in Jamaica and was influenced by the casting of Scottish actor Sean Connery to give Bond Scottish ancestry It was not until the penultimate novel You Only Live Twice that Fleming gave Bond a more complete sense of family background using a fictional obituary purportedly from The Times The novel reveals Bond s parents were Andrew Bond of Glencoe and Monique Delacroix of the Canton de Vaud The book was the first to be written after the release of Dr No in cinemas and Connery s depiction of Bond affected Fleming s interpretation of the character to give Bond a sense of humour that was not present in the previous stories Bond spends much of his early life abroad becoming multilingual in German and French because of his father s work as a Vickers armaments company representative Bond is orphaned at age after his parents are killed in a mountain climbing accident in the Aiguilles Rouges near Chamonix br After the death of his parents Bond went to live with his aunt Miss Charmian Bond in the village of Pett Bottom where he completed his early education Later he briefly attended Eton College at or thereabouts but was expelled after two halves because of girl trouble with a maid After being sent down from Eton Bond was sent to Fettes College in Scotland his father s school On his first visit to Paris at the age of Bond lost his virginity later reminiscing about the event in From a View to a Kill Fleming referenced his own upbringing for his creation with Bond alluding to briefly attending the University of Geneva as did Fleming before being taught to ski in Kitzb hel as was Fleming by Hannes Oberhauser who is later killed in Octopussy br Bond joined the Secret Service in as described by a Russian dossier about him in From Russia with Love He spent two months in at the Monte Carlo Casino watching a Romanian group cheating before he and the Deuxi me Bureau closed them down Bond s obituary in You Only Live Twice states that he joined a branch of what was subsequently to become the Ministry of Defence in where he rose to the rank of principal officer The same year he became a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve ending the war as a commander br At the start of Fleming s first book Casino Royale Bond is already a agent having been given the position after killing two enemy agents a Japanese spy on the thirty sixth floor of the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center then housing the headquarters of British Security Co ordination BSC in New York City and a Norwegian double agent who had betrayed two British agents it is suggested by Bond scholar John Griswold that these were part of Bond s wartime service with Special Operations Executive a British Second World War covert military organisation Bond is made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in either as described by a Russian dossier about Bond in From Russia with Love or as described by Bond s obituary in You Only Live Twice br br br Personal life br Bond lives in a flat off the King s Road in Chelsea Continuation authors John Pearson and William Boyd both identify the location as Wellington Square The former believed the address was No and the latter No His flat is looked after by an elderly Scottish housekeeper named May May s name was taken from May Maxwell the housekeeper of Fleming s close friend the American Ivar Bryce In Bond earned around a year net equivalent to in although when on assignment he worked on an unlimited expense account Much of Fleming s own daily routine while working at The Sunday Times was woven into the Bond stories and he summarised it at the beginning of Moonraker br br Only once in the series does Fleming have a partner for Bond in his flat with the arrival of Tiffany Case following Bond s mission to the US in Diamonds Are Forever By the start of the following book From Russia With Love Case has left to marry an American Bond is married only once in On Her Majesty s Secret Service to Teresa Tracy di Vicenzo but their marriage ends tragically when she is killed on their wedding day by Bond s nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld br In the penultimate novel of the series You Only Live Twice Bond suffers from amnesia and has a relationship with an Ama diving girl Kissy Suzuki As a result of the relationship Kissy becomes pregnant although she does not reveal this to Bond before he leaves the island br br br Tastes and style br br br Drinks br Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett noted that within the first few pages of Casino Royale Ian had introduced most of Bond s idiosyncrasies and trademarks which included his looks his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits The full details of Bond s martini were kept until chapter seven of the book and Bond eventually named it The Vesper after his love interest Vesper Lynd br br Bond s drinking habits run throughout the series of books During the course of On Her Majesty s Secret Service alone Bond consumes forty six drinks Pouilly Fuiss Riquewihr and Marsala wines most of a bottle of Algerian wine some Ch teau Mouton Rothschild claret along with Taittinger and Krug champagnes and Babycham for whiskies he consumes three bourbon and waters half a pint of I W Harper bourbon Jack Daniel s whiskey two double bourbons on the rocks two whisky and sodas two neat scotches and one glass of neat whisky vodka consumption totalled four vodka and tonics and three double vodka martinis other spirits included two double brandies with ginger ale a flask of Enzian schnaps and a double gin he also washes this down with four steins of German beer Bond s alcohol intake does not seem to affect his performance br Regarding non alcoholic drinks Bond eschews tea calling it mud and blaming it for the downfall of the British Empire He instead prefers to drink strong coffee br br br Food br When in England and not on a mission Bond dines as simply as Fleming did on dishes such as grilled sole oeufs en cocotte and cold roast beef with potato salad When on a mission however Bond eats more extravagantly This was partly because in when Casino Royale was published many items of food were still rationed in the UK and Bond was the ideal antidote to Britain s postwar austerity rationing and the looming premonition of lost power This extravagance was more noteworthy with his contemporary readers for Bond eating exotic local foods when abroad at a time when most of his readership did not travel abroad br On April Fleming wrote to The Manchester Guardian in defence of his work referring to that paper s review of Dr No While referring to Bond s food and wine consumption as gimmickery Fleming bemoaned that it has become an unfortunate trade mark I myself abhor Wine and Foodmanship My own favourite food is scrambled eggs Fleming was so keen on scrambled eggs that he used his short story in New York to provide his favourite recipe for the dish in the story this came from the housekeeper of Fleming s friend Ivar Bryce May who gave her name to Bond s own housekeeper Academic Edward Biddulph observed that Fleming fully described seventy meals within the book series and that while a number of these had items in common such as scrambled eggs and steaks each meal was different from the others br br br Smoking br Bond is a heavy smoker at one point smoking cigarettes a day Bond has his cigarettes custom made by Morland of Grosvenor Street mixing Balkan and Turkish tobacco and having a higher nicotine content than normal the cigarettes have three gold bands on the filter Bond carried his cigarettes in a wide gunmetal cigarette case which carried fifty he also used a black oxidised Ronson lighter The cigarettes were the same as Fleming s who had been buying his at Morland since the s the three gold bands on the filter were added during the war to mirror his naval Commander s rank On average Bond smokes sixty cigarettes a day although he cut back to around twenty five a day after his visit to a health farm in Thunderball Fleming himself smoked up to cigarettes a day br br br Drugs br Bond occasionally supplements his alcohol consumption with the use of other drugs for both functional and recreational reasons Moonraker sees Bond consume a quantity of the amphetamine benzedrine accompanied by champagne before his bridge game with Sir Hugo Drax also consuming a carafe of vintage Riga vodka and a vodka martini he also uses the drug for stimulation on missions such as swimming across Shark Bay in Live and Let Die or remaining awake and alert when threatened in the Dreamy Pines Motor Court in The Spy Who Loved Me br br br Cars br Bond was a car enthusiast and took great interest in his vehicles In Moonraker Fleming writes that Bond had once dabbled on the fringe of the racing world implying Bond had raced in the past Over the course of the books Bond owns three cars all Bentleys For the first three books of the series Bond drives a supercharged Bentley Litre painted battleship grey that he bought in During the War he kept the car in storage He wrecks this car in May during the events of Moonraker br Bond subsequently purchases a Bentley Mark VI drophead coup using the money he won from Hugo Drax at Blades This car is also painted battleship grey and has dark blue upholstery Fleming refers to this car as a model even though the last year for the mark was It is possible the year refers to the coachwork which in this case would probably make it a Graber bodied car br In Thunderball Bond buys the wreck of a Bentley R Type Continental with a sports saloon body and L engine Produced between and Bentley built of these cars of which had H J Mulliner bodies Bond s car would have been built before July as the engines fitted after this time were L Fleming curiously calls this car a Mark II a term which was never used Bond replaces the engine with a Mark IV L and commissions a body from Mulliners that was a rather square convertible two seater affair He paints this car battleship grey and upholsters it in black Later against the advice of Bentley he adds an Arnott supercharger In Fleming had written to Rolls Royce s Chairman Whitney Straight to get information about a new car for Bond Fleming wanted the car to be a cross between a Bentley Continental and a Ford Thunderbird Straight pointed Fleming to chassis number BC LC which was probably the inspiration for the vehicle that ended up in the book This car had been delivered in May to a Mr Silva as a Mulliner bodied coup After he rolled the car and wrecked the body Silva commissioned Mulliner to convert it to a drophead However Mulliner s price was too high and Silva eventually had the body built by Henri Chapron with the work completed in July In the coachwork on this car was modified to match the proposed Mulliner conversion more closely br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Attitudes br According to academic Jeremy Black Bond is written as a complex character even though he was also often the voice of Fleming s prejudices Throughout Fleming s books Bond expresses racist sexist and homophobic attitudes The output of these prejudices combined with the tales of Bond s actions led journalist Yuri Zhukov to write an article in for the Soviet daily newspaper Pravda describing Bond s values br br Black does not consider Bond to be the unthinking wild beast Zhukov writes about however In From Russia with Love Bond watches Kerim Bey shoot the Bulgarian killer Krilencu and Bond observes that he had never killed anyone in cold blood In The Living Daylights Bond deliberately misses his target realising the sniper he has been sent to kill is not a professional but simply a beautiful female cello player Bond settles this in his mind by thinking that It wasn t exactly murder Pretty near it though Goldfinger opens with Bond thinking through the experience of killing a Mexican assassin days earlier He is philosophical about it br br In response to a reviewer s criticism of Bond as villainous Fleming said in a Playboy interview that he did not consider his character to be particularly evil or good I don t think that he is necessarily a good guy or a bad guy Who is He s got his vices and very few perceptible virtues except patriotism and courage which are probably not virtues anyway But I didn t intend for him to be a particularly likeable person Fleming agreed with some critics characterisation of Bond as an unthinking killer but expressed that he was a product of his time James Bond is a healthy violent noncerebral man in his middle thirties and a creature of his era I wouldn t say he s particularly typical of our times but he s certainly of the times br Another general attitude and prejudice of Fleming s that Bond gives voice to includes his approach to homosexuality While Fleming had a number of gay friends including No l Coward and his editor William Plomer he said that his books were written for warm blooded heterosexuals His attitude went further with Bond opining that homosexuals were a herd of unhappy sexual misfits barren and full of frustrations the women wanting to dominate and the men to be nannied adding that he was sorry for them but he had no time for them br br br Abilities br br From Casino Royale to From Russia with Love Bond s preferred weapon is a ACP Beretta automatic pistol carried in a light weight chamois leather holster However Fleming was contacted by a Bond enthusiast and gun expert Geoffrey Boothroyd who criticised Fleming s choice of firearm for Bond and suggested a Walther PPK mm instead Fleming used the suggestion in Dr No also taking advice that it should be used with the Berns Martin triple draw shoulder holster By way of thanks the Secret Service Armourer who gives Bond his gun was given the name Major Boothroyd and is introduced by M Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service as the greatest small arms expert in the world br br Kingsley Amis in The James Bond Dossier noted that although Bond is a very good shot and the best in the Secret Service he is still beaten by the instructor something that added realism to Bond s character Amis identified a number of skills where Bond is very good but is still beatable by others These included skiing hand to hand combat elaborated in the SMERSH dossier on Bond in From Russia With Love as proficiency in boxing with a good practical knowledge of judo holds underwater swimming and golf Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good but others were better one of those who is a better driver than Bond is Sir Hugo Drax who causes Bond to write off his battleship grey supercharged Bentley Litre Bond subsequently drives a Mark II Continental Bentley which he uses in the remaining books of the series although he is issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger br br br Continuation Bond works br br br John Gardner br br In writer John Gardner was approached by the Fleming estate and asked to write a continuation novel for Bond Although he initially almost turned the series down Gardner subsequently wrote original novels and two novelizations of the films between Licence Renewed in and COLD in With the influence of the American publishers Putnam s the Gardner novels showed an increase in the number of Americanisms used in the book such as a waiter wearing pants rather than trousers in The Man from Barbarossa James Harker writing in The Guardian considered that the Gardner books were dogged by silliness giving examples of Scorpius where much of the action is set in Chippenham and Win Lose or Die where Bond gets chummy with an unconvincing Maggie Thatcher Ill health forced Gardner to retire from writing the Bond novels in br Gardner stated that he wanted to bring Mr Bond into the s although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them Even though Gardner kept the ages the same he made Bond grey at the temples as a nod to the passing of the years Other s effects also took place with Bond smoking low tar cigarettes and becoming increasingly health conscious br The return of Bond in saw media reports on the more politically correct Bond and his choice of car a Saab Turbo Gardner later put him in a Bentley Mulsanne Turbo Gardner also updated Bond s firearm under Gardner Bond is initially issued with the Browning mm before changing to a Heckler Koch VP and then a Heckler Koch P Bond is also revealed to have taken part in the Falklands War Gardner updated Fleming s characters and used contemporary political leaders in his novels he also used the high tech apparatus of Q Branch from the films although Jeremy Black observed that Bond is more reliant on technology than his own individual abilities Gardner s series linked Bond to the Fleming novels rather than the film incarnations and referred to events covered in the Fleming stories br br br Raymond Benson br Following the retirement of John Gardner Raymond Benson took over as Bond author in as the first American author of Bond it was a controversial choice Benson had previously written the non fiction The James Bond Bedside Companion first published in Benson s first work was a short story Blast from the Past published in By the time he moved on to other projects in Benson had written six Bond novels three novelizations and three short stories His final Bond work was The Man with the Red Tattoo published in br br Benson followed Gardner s pattern of setting Bond in the contemporary timeframe of the s and according to Jeremy Black had more echoes of Fleming s style than John Gardner he also changed Bond s gun back to the Walther PPK put him behind the wheel of a Jaguar XK and made him swear more James Harker noted that whilst Fleming s Bond had been an Express reader Benson s is positively red top He s the first to have group sex and the first to visit a prostitute whilst Black notes an increased level of crudity lacking in either Fleming or Gardner In a interview Benson described his version of Bond as a more ruthless and darker character stating that Bond is not a nice guy Bond is a killer He is an anti hero br br br Others br br br Kingsley Amis br In four years after Fleming s death his literary executors Glidrose Productions approached Kingsley Amis and offered him in pounds to write the first continuation Bond novel The result was Colonel Sun published in under the pen name Robert Markham Journalist James Harker noted that although the book was not literary it was stylish Raymond Benson noted that Bond s character and events from previous novels were all maintained in Colonel Sun saying he is the same darkly handsome man first introduced in Casino Royale br br br Sebastian Faulks br After Gardner and Benson had followed Amis there was a gap of six years until Sebastian Faulks was commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications to write a new Bond novel which was released on May the one hundredth anniversary of Ian Fleming s birth The book entitled Devil May Care was published in the UK by Penguin Books and by Doubleday in the US br Faulks ignored the timeframe established by Gardner and Benson and instead reverted to that used by Fleming and Amis basing his novel in the s he also managed to use a number of the cultural touchstones of the sixties in the book Faulks was true to Bond s original character and background too and provided a Flemingesque hero who drove a battleship grey T series Bentley br br br Jeffery Deaver br On May American writer Jeffery Deaver commissioned by Ian Fleming Publications released Carte Blanche Deaver restarted the chronology of Bond separate from the timelines of any of the previous authors by stating he was born in the novel also saw Bond in a post agency independent of either MI or MI br br Whilst the chronology changed Deaver included a number of elements from the Fleming novels including Bond s tastes for food and wine his gadgets and the rather preposterous names of some of the female characters br br br William Boyd br In William Boyd s continuation novel Solo was released it ignored Deaver s new timeframe and was set in br br br Anthony Horowitz br In September the author Anthony Horowitz released Trigger Mortis a novel containing material written but previously unreleased by Fleming It is set in two weeks after the events of Fleming s novel Goldfinger br In May Horowitz released Forever and a Day again containing unreleased material from Fleming It is set in before the events of Casino Royale and thoroughly details the events leading up to Bond s promotion to status and becoming the character he is by the original Fleming novel br Horowitz released a third Bond novel With a Mind to Kill in This novel is set after the events of The Man with the Golden Gun and features MI sending Bond back to Russia to infiltrate the same group that brainwashed him to try and kill M planting fake evidence that Bond succeeded in his mission Bond is able to eliminate the head of the group and thwart a planned assassination but the novel ends with him deciding to leave the service as he has grown jaded with his own role in the work to the extent that he is in a position where he could be the target of a sniper and he expresses no concern about his fate br br br Young Bond br br In the author and comedian Charlie Higson released SilverFin the first of five novels and one short story in the life of a young James Bond his final work was the short story A Hard Man to Kill released as part of the non fiction work Danger Society The Young Bond Dossier the companion book to the Young Bond series Young Bond is set in the s which would fit the chronology with that of Fleming br br Higson stated that he was instructed by the Fleming estate to ignore all other interpretations of Bond except the original Fleming version As the background to Bond s childhood Higson used Bond s obituary in You Only Live Twice as well as his own and Fleming s childhoods In forming the early Bond character Higson created the origins of some of Bond s character traits including his love of cars and fine wine br Steve Cole continued the Young Bond storyline with four more novels Higson went on to write an adult Bond novel On His Majesty s Secret Service br br br Adaptations br br Adaptations of Bond started early in Fleming s writings with CBS paying him in dollars to adapt his first novel Casino Royale into a one hour television adventure this was broadcast on October The Bond character played by Barry Nelson was changed to Card Sense Jimmy Bond an American agent working for Combined Intelligence br In the Daily Express newspaper adapted Fleming s stories into comic strip format In order to help the artists Fleming commissioned a sketch to show how he saw Bond illustrator John McLusky considered Fleming s version too outdated and pre war and changed Bond to give him a more masculine look br In Eon Productions the company of Canadian Harry Saltzman and American Albert R Cubby Broccoli released the first cinema adaptation of a Fleming novel Dr No featuring Sean Connery as Connery was the first of seven actors to play Bond on the cinema screen six of whom appeared in the Eon series of films As well as looking different each of the actors has interpreted the role of Bond in a different way Besides
