negative review saying The new edition doesn t quite catch that inspired spark Stephen Whitty of The Star Ledger gave the film three stars out of four saying Not only a fun cartoon but that rare thing a sequel which actually improves on the original Soren Anderson of The Seattle Times gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying It s fun It s cheerful It s lollipop colorful Best of all it features lots of minion mischief which guarantees plenty of laughs But what it doesn t have is an edge br Stephen Holden of The New York Times gave the film two and a half stars out of five saying It is consistently diverting and so cute you ll want to pet it Yet it is also weightless and lacks a center Tirdad Derakhshani of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film two and a half stars out of five

the film two stars out of four saying With its predecessor having made a whopping million globally it s no wonder that Universal saw fit to order a sequel But it s not enough just to trot out legions of minions and cobble together a plot Audiences deserve more imagination and inventiveness than this wan recycling Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C grade saying By the end

transforming it into a submarine that scoots around sharks and fish Peter Debruge of Variety gave the film a positive review saying While not quite as charming or unique as the original Despicable Me comes awfully close extending co directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin s delightfully silly sensibility to a bit larger universe Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film three stars out of four saying It s a credit that the writing can be so funny in the moment that it takes time to realize there s no cohesive story zero dramatic tension and nary a practical lesson for either the characters in the film or the people watching in the theater br Mary Pols of Time gave the film a positive review saying As a sequel it stands level with the first film and may have the edge on it Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three stars out of four saying Co directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin who do Minion voices expertly never let up on the laughs A fart joke in D may not be three times as wacky but the high spirits of Despicable Me are irresistible fun A A Dowd of The A V Club gave the film a C grade saying What s missing and this was the crucial component of part one is a little sour to undercut the sweet Like its protagonist a bad guy gone boringly good Despicable Me has no edge It s fatally nice and insufficiently naughty br br br Accolades
