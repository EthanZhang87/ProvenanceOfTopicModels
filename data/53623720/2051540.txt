id: 2051540
A flashback sometimes called an analepsis is an interjected scene that takes the narrative back in time from the current point in the story Flashbacks are often used to recount events that happened before the story s primary sequence of events to fill in crucial backstory In the opposite direction a flashforward or prolepsis reveals events that will occur in the future Both flashback and flashforward are used to cohere a story develop a character or add structure to the narrative In literature internal analepsis is a flashback to an earlier point in the narrative external analepsis is a flashback to a time before the narrative started br In film flashbacks depict the subjective experience of a character by showing a memory of a previous event and they are often used to resolve an enigma Flashbacks are important in film noir and melodrama films In films and television several camera techniques editing approaches and special effects have evolved to alert the viewer that the action shown is a flashback or flashforward for example the edges of the picture may be deliberately blurred photography may be jarring or choppy or unusual coloration or sepia tone or monochrome when most of the story is in full color may be used The scene may fade or dissolve often with the camera focused on the face of the character and there is typically a voice over by a narrator who is often but not always the character who is experiencing the memory br br br Notable examples br br br Literature br An early example of analepsis is in the Ramayana and Mahabharata where the main story is narrated through a frame story set at a later time Another early use of this device in a murder mystery was in The Three Apples an Arabian Nights tale The story begins with the discovery of a young woman s dead body After the murderer later reveals himself he narrates his reasons for the murder in a series of flashbacks leading up to the discovery of her dead body at the beginning of the story Flashbacks are also employed in several other Arabian Nights tales such as Sinbad the Sailor and The City of Brass br Analepsis was used extensively by author Ford Madox Ford and by poet author historian and mythologist Robert Graves The book The Bridge of San Luis Rey by Thornton Wilder is the progenitor of the modern disaster epic in literature and film making where a single disaster intertwines the victims whose lives are then explored by means of flashbacks of events leading up to the disaster Analepsis is also used in Night by Elie Wiesel If flashbacks are extensive and in chronological order one can say that these form the present of the story while the rest of the story consists of flash forwards If flashbacks are presented in non chronological order the time at which the story takes place can be ambiguous An example of such an occurrence is in Slaughterhouse Five where the narrative jumps back and forth in time so there is no actual present time line Os Lus adas is a story about a voyage of Vasco da Gama to India and back The narration starts when they were arriving in Africa but it quickly flashes back to the beginning of the story which is when they were leaving Portugal br The Harry Potter series employs a magical device called a Pensieve which changes the nature of flashbacks from a mere narrative device to an event directly experienced by the characters who are thus able to provide commentary br br br Film br The creator of the flashback technique in cinema was Histoire d un crime directed by Ferdinand Zecca in An early use of the flashback technique in cinema occurs throughout D W Griffith s film Hearts of the World for example during the wall scene with the Boy at Flashbacks were first employed during the sound era in Rouben Mamoulian s film City Streets but were rare until about when in William Wyler s Wuthering Heights as in Emily Bront s original novel the housekeeper Ellen narrates the main story to overnight visitor Mr Lockwood who has witnessed Heathcliff s frantic pursuit of what is apparently a ghost More famously also in Marcel Carn s film Le Jour Se L ve is told almost entirely through flashback the story starts with the murder of a man in a hotel While the murderer played by Jean Gabin is surrounded by the police several flashbacks tell the story of why he killed the man at the beginning of the film br One of the most famous examples of a flashback is in the Orson Welles film Citizen Kane The protagonist Charles Foster Kane dies at the beginning uttering the word Rosebud The remainder of the film is framed by a reporter s interviewing Kane s friends and associates in a futile effort to discover what the word meant to Kane As the interviews proceed pieces of Kane s life unfold in flashback but Welles use of such unconventional flashbacks was thought to have been influenced by William K Howard s The Power and the Glory Lubitsch used a flashback in Heaven Can Wait which tells the story of Henry Van Cleve Though usually used to clarify plot or backstory flashbacks can also act as an unreliable narrator The multiple and contradictory staged reconstructions of a crime in Errol Morris s documentary The Thin Blue Line are presented as flashbacks based on divergent testimony Akira Kurosawa s Rashomon does this in the most celebrated fictional use of contested multiple testimonies br Sometimes a flashback is inserted into a film even though there was none in the original source from which the film was adapted The film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein s stage musical Carousel used a flashback device which somewhat takes the impact away from a very dramatic plot development later in the film This was done because the plot of Carousel was then considered unusually strong for a film musical In the film version of Camelot according to Alan Jay Lerner a flashback was added not to soften the blow of a later plot development but because the stage show had been criticized for shifting too abruptly in tone from near comedy to tragedy br In Billy Wilder s film noir Double Indemnity a flashback from the main character is used to provide a confession to his fraudulent and criminal activities Fish Cat is the first single shot movie with several flashbacks br In John Brahm s film noir The Locket a unique hat trick is used a flashback within a flashback within a flashback to give psychological depth to the story of a woman who was allegedly a kleptomaniac inveterate liar and murderess but had never been punished for any of her crimes br A good example of both flashback and flashforward is the first scene of La Jet e As we learn a few minutes later what we are seeing in that scene is a flashback to the past since the present of the film s diegesis is a time directly following World War III However as we learn at the very end of the film that scene also doubles as a prolepsis since the dying man the boy is seeing is in fact himself In other words he is proleptically seeing his own death We thus have an analepsis and prolepsis in the very same scene br Occasionally a story may contain a flashback within a flashback with the earliest known example appearing in Jacques Feyder s L Atlantide Little Annie Rooney contains a flashback scene in a Chinese laundry with a flashback within that flashback in the corner of the screen In John Ford s The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance the main action of the film is told in flashback with the scene of Liberty Valance s murder occurring as a flashback within that flashback Other examples that contains flashbacks within flashbacks are the Japanese film Lone Wolf Isazo and s The Phantom of the Opera where almost the entire film set in is told as a flashback from in black and white and contains other flashbacks for example Madame Giry rescuing the Phantom from a freak show An extremely convoluted story may contain flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks as in Six Degrees of Separation Passage to Marseille and The Locket br This technique is a hallmark of Kannada movie director Upendra He has employed this technique in his movies Om A and the futuristic flick Super set in containing multiple flashbacks ranging from to depicting a Utopian India br Satyajit Ray experimented with flashbacks in The Adversary Pratidwandi pioneering the technique of photo negative flashbacks He also uses flashbacks in other films such as Nayak Kapurush O Mahapurush Aranyer Din Ratri Jalsaghar In fact in Nayak the entire film proceeds in a non linear narrative which explores the Hero Arindam s past through seven flashbacks and two dreams He also uses extensive flashbacks in the Kanchenjunga br Quentin Tarantino makes extensive use of the flashback and flashforward in many of his films In Reservoir Dogs for example scenes of the story present are intercut with various flashbacks to give each character s backstory and motivation additional context In Pulp Fiction which uses a highly nonlinear narrative traditional flashback is also used in the sequence titled The Gold Watch Other films such as his two part Kill Bill Part I Part II also feature a narrative that bounces between present time and flashbacks br br br Television br The television series Quantico Kung Fu Psych How I Met Your Mother Grounded for Life Once Upon a Time and I Didn t Do It use flashbacks in every
