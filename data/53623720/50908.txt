Roger Joseph Ebert EE burt June April was an American film critic film historian journalist essayist screenwriter and author He was a film critic for the Chicago Sun Times from until his death in Ebert was known for his intimate Midwestern writing style and critical views informed by values of populism and humanism Writing in a prose style intended to be entertaining and direct he made sophisticated cinematic and analytical ideas more accessible to non specialist audiences Ebert frequently endorsed foreign and independent films he believed would be appreciated by mainstream viewers championing filmmakers like Woody Allen Spike Lee Werner Herzog and Errol Morris as well as Martin Scorsese whose first published review he wrote In Ebert became the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism Neil Steinberg of the Chicago Sun Times said Ebert was without question the nation s most prominent and influential film critic and Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called him the best known film critic in America br Early in his career Ebert co wrote the Russ Meyer movie Beyond the Valley of the Dolls Starting in and continuing for decades Ebert and Chicago Tribune critic Gene Siskel helped popularize nationally televised film reviewing when they co hosted the PBS show Sneak Previews followed by several variously named At the Movies programs on commercial TV broadcast syndication The two verbally sparred and traded humorous barbs while discussing films They created and trademarked the phrase two thumbs up used when both gave the same film a positive review They regularly appeared on numerous talk shows together including Late Show with David Letterman After Siskel died from a brain tumor in Ebert continued hosting the show with various co hosts and then starting in with Richard Roeper br In the early s Ebert was diagnosed with cancer of the thyroid and salivary glands He required treatment that included removing a section of his lower jaw in leaving him severely disfigured and unable to speak or eat normally However his ability to write remained unimpaired and he continued to publish frequently online and in print until his death in His RogerEbert com website launched in remains online as an archive of his published writings Richard Corliss wrote Roger leaves a legacy of indefatigable connoisseurship in movies literature politics and to quote the title of his autobiography Life Itself In Life Itself was adapted as a documentary of the same title br br br Early life and education br Roger Joseph Ebert was born on June in Urbana Illinois the only child of Annabel n e Stumm a bookkeeper and Walter Harry Ebert an electrician He was raised Roman Catholic attending St Mary s elementary school and serving as an altar boy in Urbana br His paternal grandparents were German immigrants and his maternal ancestry was Irish and Dutch He began his writing career with letters of comment to the science fiction fanzines of the era At age he was a sportswriter for The News Gazette covering Urbana High School sports He attended Urbana High School where in his senior year he was class president and co editor of his high school newspaper The Echo In he won the Illinois High School Association state speech championship in radio speaking an event that simulates radio newscasts br br Ebert began taking classes at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign as an early entrance student completing his high school courses while also taking his first university class After graduating from Urbana High School in he attended the University of Illinois and received his undergraduate degree in While there Ebert worked as a reporter for The Daily Illini and served as its editor during his senior year while continuing to work for the News Gazette br His college mentor was Daniel Curley who introduced me to many of the cornerstones of my life s reading The Love Song of J Alfred Prufrock Crime and Punishment Madame Bovary The Ambassadors Nostromo The Professor s House The Great Gatsby The Sound and the Fury He approached these works with undisguised admiration We discussed patterns of symbolism felicities of language motivation revelation of character This was appreciation not the savagery of deconstruction which approaches literature as pliers do a rose Years later Ebert coauthored The Perfect London Walk with Curley One of his classmates was Larry Woiwode who went on to be the Poet Laureate of North Dakota At The Daily Illini Ebert befriended William Nack who as a sportswriter would cover Secretariat As an undergraduate he was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity and president of the United States Student Press Association One of the first reviews he wrote was of La Dolce Vita published in The Daily Illini in October br As a graduate student he had the good fortune to enroll in a class on Shakespeare s tragedies taught by G Blakemore Evans It was then that Shakespeare took hold of me and it became clear he was the nearest we have come to a voice for what it means to be human Ebert spent a semester as a master s student in the department of English there before attending the University of Cape Town on a Rotary fellowship for a year He returned from Cape Town to his graduate studies at Illinois for two more semesters and then after being accepted as a PhD student at the University of Chicago he prepared to move to Chicago He needed a job to support himself while he worked on his doctorate and so applied to the Chicago Daily News hoping that as he had already sold freelance pieces to the Daily News including an article on the death of writer Brendan Behan he would be hired by editor Herman Kogan br Instead Kogan referred Ebert to the city editor at the Chicago Sun Times Jim Hoge who hired Ebert as a reporter and feature writer in He attended doctoral classes at the University of Chicago while working as a general reporter for a year After movie critic Eleanor Keane left the Sun Times in April editor Robert Zonka gave the job to Ebert The load of graduate school and being a film critic proved too much so Ebert left the University of Chicago to focus his energies on film criticism br br br Career br br br Early writings br br Ebert began his career as a film critic for the Chicago Sun Times in That same year he met film critic Pauline Kael for the first time at the New York Film Festival After he sent her some of his columns she told him they were the best film criticism being done in American newspapers today That same year Ebert s first book An Illini Century One Hundred Years of Campus Life a history of the University of Illinois was published by the university s press In his review of Night of the Living Dead was published in Reader s Digest One of the first films he reviewed was Ingmar Bergman s Persona He told his editor he wasn t sure how to review it when he didn t feel he could explain it His editor told him he didn t have to explain it just describe it br He was one of the first critics to champion Bonnie and Clyde calling it a milestone in the history of American movies a work of truth and brilliance It is also pitilessly cruel filled with sympathy nauseating funny heartbreaking and astonishingly beautiful If it does not seem that those words should be strung together perhaps that is because movies do not very often reflect the full range of human life He concluded The fact that the story is set years ago doesn t mean a thing It had to be set some time But it was made now and it s about us Thirty one years later he wrote When I saw it I had been a film critic for less than six months and it was the first masterpiece I had seen on the job I felt an exhilaration beyond describing I did not suspect how long it would be between such experiences but at least I learned that they were possible He wrote Martin Scorsese s first review for Who s That Knocking at My Door then titled I Call First and predicted the young director could become an American Fellini br In addition to film Ebert occasionally wrote about other topics for the Sun Times such as music In Ebert wrote the first published concert review of singer songwriter John Prine who at the time was working as a mailman and performing at Chicago folk clubs br Ebert co wrote the screenplay for Russ Meyer s Beyond the Valley of the Dolls and sometimes joked about being responsible for it It was poorly received on its release yet has become a cult film Ebert and Meyer also made Up Beneath the Valley of the Ultra Vixens and other films and were involved in the ill fated Sex Pistols movie Who Killed Bambi In April Ebert posted his screenplay of Who Killed Bambi also known as Anarchy in the UK on his blog br Beginning in Ebert worked for the University of Chicago as an adjunct lecturer teaching a night class on film at the Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies In Ebert received the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism Around this time he was offered jobs by multiple major newspapers including The Washington Post and The New York Times but he declined their offers as he did not wish to leave Chicago In October while continuing to work for the Sun Times and still based in Chicago Ebert replaced Rex Reed as the New York Post s chief film critic br br br Stardom with Siskel Ebert br br In Ebert and Gene Siskel began co hosting a weekly film review television show Sneak Previews which was locally produced by the Chicago public broadcasting station WTTW The series was later picked up for national syndication on PBS The duo became well known for their thumbs up thumbs down review summaries Siskel and Ebert trademarked the phrase Two Thumbs Up br In they moved from PBS to launch a similar syndicated commercial television

Siskel were known for their many appearances on late night talk shows appearing on The Late Show with David Letterman sixteen times and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson fifteen times On one of

Street segment Sneak Peek Previews a parody of Sneak Previews In it they instruct the hosts Oscar the Grouch and Telly Monster on how their thumbs up thumbs down rating system works Oscar asks if there could be a thumbs sideways ratings and goads the two men into an argument about whether or not would be acceptable as Ebert likes the idea but Siskel does not The two were also seen that same

Bunny die in a movie br In Ebert wrote to Nigel Wade then the editor of the Chicago Sun Times and proposed a biweekly series of longer articles great movies of the past He gave his blessing Every other week I have revisited a great movie and the response has been encouraging The first film he wrote about for the series was Casablanca A hundred of these essays were published as The Great Movies he released two more volumes and a fourth was published posthumously For many years on the day of the Academy Awards ceremony Ebert appeared with Roeper on the live pre awards show An Evening at the

awards show entitled An Evening at the Academy Awards The Winners produced and aired by the ABC owned KABC TV in Los Angeles A Mayor Ebert appeared in the remake of Godzilla played by Michael Lerner In his pan of the film Ebert wrote Now that I ve inspired a character in a Godzilla movie all I really still desire is for several Ingmar Bergman characters to sit in a circle and read my reviews to one another in hushed tones Ebert provided DVD audio commentaries for several films including Citizen Kane Casablanca Crumb Dark City Floating Weeds and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls Ebert was also interviewed by Central Park Media for an extra feature on the DVD release of Grave of the Fireflies In Ebert founded his own film festival Ebertfest in his hometown Champaign Illinois br In May Siskel

co hosts including Martin Scorsese A O Scott and Janet Maslin Ebert wrote of his late colleague For the first five years that we knew one another Gene Siskel and I hardly spoke Then it seemed like we never stopped He wrote of Siskel s work ethic of how quickly he returned to work after surgery Someone else might have taken a leave of absence then and there but Gene worked as long as he could Being a film critic was important to him He liked to refer to his job as the national dream beat and say that in reviewing movies he was covering what people hoped for dreamed about and feared Ten years after Siskel s death Ebert blogged about his colleague We once spoke with Disney and CBS about a sitcom to be titled Best Enemies It would be about two movie critics joined in a love hate relationship It never went anywhere but we both believed it was a good idea Maybe the problem was that no one else could possibly understand how meaningless was the hate how deep was the love br br br Ebert Roeper br In September Chicago Sun Times columnist Richard Roeper became the permanent co host and the show was renamed At the Movies with Ebert Roeper and later At the Movies In Ebert interviewed President Bill Clinton at The White House Clinton spoke about his love for the movies his favorite films of and his favorite films of all time such as Casablanca High Noon and The Ten Commandments Clinton named

RogerEbert com br Ebert ended his association with the Disney owned At The Movies in July after the studio indicated it wished to take the program in a new direction As of his reviews were syndicated to more than newspapers in the United States and abroad Ebert also published more than books and dozens of collected reviews His RogerEbert com website launched in and originally underwritten by the Chicago Sun Times remains online as an archive of his published writings and reviews while also hosting new material written by a group of critics who were selected by Ebert before his death Even as he used TV and later the Internet to share his reviews Ebert continued to write for the Chicago Sun Times until he died in On February Ebert reported that he and Roeper would soon announce a new movie review program and reiterated this plan after Disney announced that the program s last episode would air in August br Ebert was one of the principal critics featured in Gerald Peary s documentary For the Love of Movies The Story of American Film Criticism He discusses the dynamics of appearing with Gene Siskel on the s show Coming to a Theatre Near You which was the predecessor of Sneak Previews

his lifetime was for The Host which was published on March The last review Ebert wrote was for To the Wonder which he gave out of stars in a review for the Chicago Sun Times It was posthumously published on April In July a previously unpublished review of Computer Chess appeared on Ebert s website The review had been written in March but had remained unpublished until the film s wide release date Matt Zoller Seitz the editor of Ebert s website confirmed that there were other unpublished reviews that would eventually be posted A second review for The Spectacular Now was published in August br A biographical documentary about Ebert Life Itself directed by Steve James premiered at the Sundance Film Festival The film was executive produced by Martin Scorsese and includes interviews with Scorsese Ava DuVernay Werner Herzog Errol Morris and numerous critics The film received critical acclaim and received numerous accolades including a Emmy Award Producers Guild of America Award and Critics Choice Movie Award br br br Critical style br br Ebert cited Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael as influences and often quoted Robert Warshow who said A man goes to the movies A critic must be honest enough to admit he is that man He tried to judge a movie on its style rather than its content and often said It s not what a movie is about it s how it s about what it s about He awarded four stars to films of the highest quality and generally a half star to those of the lowest unless he considered the film to be artistically inept and morally repugnant in which case it received no stars as with Death Wish II He explained that his star ratings had little meaning outside the context of the review br br When you ask a friend if Hellboy is any good you re not asking if it s any good compared to Mystic River you re asking if it s any good compared to The Punisher And my answer would be on a scale of one to four if Superman is four then Hellboy is three and The Punisher is two In the same way if American Beauty gets four stars then The United States of Leland clocks in at about two br Metacritic later noted that Ebert tended to give more lenient ratings than most critics His average film rating was if translated into a percentage compared to for the site as a whole Of his reviews were positive and of his ratings were better than his colleagues Ebert had acknowledged in that he gave higher ratings on average than other critics though he said this was in part because he considered a rating of out of stars to be the general threshold for a film to get a thumbs up br Although Ebert rarely wrote outright scathing reviews he had a reputation for writing memorable ones for the films he really hated such as North Of that film he wrote I hated this movie Hated hated hated hated hated this movie Hated it Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience insulting moment of it Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it A collection of his pans was published as I Hated Hated Hated This Movie br He wrote that Mad Dog Time is the first movie I have seen that does not improve on the sight of a blank screen viewed for the same length of time Oh I ve seen bad movies before But they usually made me care about how bad they were Watching Mad Dog Time is like waiting for the bus in a city where you re not sure they have a bus line and concluded that the film should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor Of Caligula he wrote It is not good art it is not good cinema and it is not good porn and approvingly quoted the woman in front of him at the drinking fountain who called it the worst piece of shit I have ever seen br Ebert s reviews were also characterized by what has been called dry wit He often wrote in a deadpan style when discussing a movie s flaws in his review of Jaws The Revenge he wrote that Mrs Brody s friends pooh pooh the notion that a shark could identify follow or even care about one individual human being but I am willing to grant the point for the benefit of the plot I believe that the shark wants revenge against Mrs Brody I do I really do believe it After all her husband was one of the men who hunted this shark and killed it blowing it to bits And what shark wouldn t want revenge against the survivors of the men who killed it Here are some things however that I do not believe and went on to list the other ways the film strained credulity br br Ebert often included personal anecdotes in his reviews in his review of The Last Picture Show he recalls his early days as a moviegoer For five or six years of my life the years between when I was old enough to go alone and when TV came to town Saturday afternoon at the Princess was a descent into a dark magical cave that smelled of Jujubes melted Dreamsicles and Crisco in the popcorn machine It was probably on one of those Saturday afternoons that I formed my first critical opinion deciding vaguely that there was something about John Wayne that that set him apart from ordinary cowboys He occasionally wrote reviews in the forms of stories poems songs scripts open letters or imagined conversations br Alex Ross music critic for The New Yorker wrote of how Ebert had influenced his writing I noticed how much Ebert could put across in a limited space He didn t waste time clearing his throat They meet for the first time when she is in her front yard practicing baton twirling begins his review of Badlands Often he managed to smuggle the basics of the plot into a larger thesis about the movie so that you don t notice the exposition taking place Broadcast News is as knowledgeable about the TV news gathering process as any movie ever made but it also has insights into the more personal matter of how people use high pressure jobs as a way of avoiding time alone with themselves The reviews start off in all different ways sometimes with personal confessions sometimes with sweeping statements One way or another he pulls you in When he feels strongly he can bang his fist in an impressive way His review of Apocalypse Now ends thus The whole huge grand mystery of the world so terrible so beautiful seems to hang in the balance br In his introduction to The Great Movies III he wrote br br People often ask me Do you ever change your mind about a movie Hardly ever although I may refine my opinion Among the films here I ve changed on The Godfather Part II and Blade Runner My original review of Part II puts me in mind of the brain cloud that besets Tom Hanks in Joe Versus the Volcano I was simply wrong In the case of Blade Runner I think the director s cut by Ridley Scott simply plays much better I also turned around on Groundhog Day which made it into this book when I belatedly caught on that it wasn t about the weatherman s predicament but about the nature of time and will Perhaps when I first saw it I allowed myself to be distracted by Bill Murray s mainstream comedy reputation But someone in film school somewhere is probably even now writing a thesis about how Murray s famous cameos represent an injection of philosophy into those pictures br In the first Great Movies he wrote br br Movies do not change but their viewers do When I first saw La Dolce Vita in I was an adolescent for whom the sweet life represented everything I dreamed of sin exotic European glamour the weary romance of the cynical newspaperman When I saw it again around I was living in a version of Marcello s world Chicago s North Avenue was not the Via Veneto but at A M the denizens were just as colorful and I was about Marcello s age br When I saw the movie around Marcello was the same age but I was ten years older had stopped drinking and saw him not as role model but as a victim condemned to an endless search for happiness that could never be found not that way By when I analyzed the film a frame at a time at the University of Colorado Marcello seemed younger still and while I had once admired and then criticized him now I pitied and loved him And when I saw the movie right after Mastroianni died I thought that Fellini and Marcello had taken a moment of discovery and made it immortal There may be no such thing as the sweet life But it is necessary to find that out for yourself br br br Preferences br br br Favorites br In an essay looking back at his first years as a film critic Ebert wrote br br If I had to make a generalization I would say that many of my favorite movies are about good people Casablanca is about people who do the right thing The Third Man is about people who do the right thing and can never speak to one another as a result Not all good movies are about good people I also like movies about bad people who have a sense of humor Orson Welles who does not play either of the good people in The Third Man has such a winning way such witty dialogue that for a scene or two we almost forgive him his crimes Henry Hill the hero of Goodfellas is not a good fella but he has the ability to be honest with us about why he enjoyed being bad He is not a hypocrite br Of the other movies I love some are simply about the joy of physical movement When Gene Kelly splashes through Singin in the Rain when Judy Garland follows the yellow brick road when Fred Astaire dances on the ceiling when John Wayne puts the reins in his teeth and gallops across the mountain meadow there is a purity and joy that cannot be resisted In Equinox Flower a Japanese film by the old master Yasujiro Ozu there is this sequence of shots A room with a red teapot in the foreground Another view of the room The mother folding clothes A shot down a corridor with a mother crossing it at an angle and then a daughter crossing at the back A reverse shot in the hallway as the arriving father is greeted by the mother and daughter A shot as the father leaves the frame then the mother then the daughter A shot as the mother and father enter the room as in the background the daughter picks up the red pot and leaves the frame This sequence of timed movement and cutting is as perfect as any music ever written any dance any poem br Ebert argued for the aesthetic values of black and white photography and against colorization writing br br Black and white movies present the deliberate absence of color This makes them less realistic than color films for the real world is in color They are more dreamlike more pure composed of shapes and forms and movements and light and shadow Color films can simply be illuminated Black and white films have to be lighted Black and white is a legitimate and beautiful artistic choice in motion pictures creating feelings and effects that cannot be obtained any other way br Ebert championed animation particularly the films of Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata In his review of Miyazaki s Princess Mononoke he wrote I go to the movies for many reasons Here is one of them I want to see wondrous sights not available in the real world in stories where myth and dreams are set free to play Animation opens that possibility because it is freed from gravity and the chains of the possible Realistic films show the physical world animation shows its essence Animated films are not copies of real movies are not shadows of reality but create a new existence in their own right He concluded his review of Ratatouille by writing Every time an animated film is successful you have to read all over again about how animation isn t just for children but for the whole family and even for adults going on their own No kidding br br Ebert championed documentaries notably Errol Morris s Gates of Heaven They say you can make a great documentary about anything as long as you see it well enough and truly and this film proves it Gates of Heaven which has no connection to the unfortunate Heaven s Gate is about a couple of pet cemeteries and their owners It was filmed in Southern California so of course we expect a sardonic look at the peculiarities of the Moonbeam State But then Gates of Heaven grows ever so much more complex and frightening until at the end it is about such large issues as love immortality failure and the dogged elusiveness of the American Dream Morris credited Ebert s review with putting him on the map He championed Michael Apted s Up films calling them an inspired even noble use of the medium Ebert concluded his review of Hoop Dreams by writing Many filmgoers are reluctant to see documentaries for reasons I ve never understood the good ones are frequently more absorbing and entertaining than fiction Hoop Dreams however is not only documentary It is also poetry and prose muckraking and expose journalism and polemic It is one of the great moviegoing experiences of my lifetime br Ebert said that his favorite film was Citizen Kane joking That s the official answer although he preferred to emphasize it as the most important film He said seeing The Third Man cemented his love of cinema This movie is on the altar of my love for the cinema I saw it for the first time in a little fleabox of a theater on the Left Bank in Paris in during my first a day trip to Europe It was so sad so beautiful so romantic that it became at once a part of my own memories as if it had happened to me He implied that his real favorite film was La Dolce Vita br His favorite actor was Robert Mitchum and his favorite actress was Ingrid Bergman He named Buster Keaton Yasujiro Ozu Robert Altman Werner Herzog and Martin Scorsese as his favorite directors He expressed his distaste for top lists and all movie lists in general but did make an annual list of the years best films joking that film critics are required by unwritten law to do so He also contributed an all time top list for the decennial Sight Sound Critics poll in and In he chose alphabetically A Space Odyssey Aguirre the Wrath of God Bonnie and Clyde Casablanca Citizen Kane La Dolce Vita Notorious Persona Taxi Driver and The Third Man In he chose A Space Odyssey Aguirre the Wrath of God Apocalypse Now Citizen Kane La Dolce Vita The General Raging Bull Tokyo Story The Tree of Life and Vertigo br His favorite Bond film was Goldfinger and he later added it to his Great Movies list Several of the contributors to Ebert s website participated in a video tribute to him featuring films that made his Sight Sound list in and br br br Best films of the year br Ebert made annual ten best lists from to His choices for best film of the year were br br Ebert revisited and sometimes revised his opinions After ranking E T the Extra Terrestrial third on his list it was the only movie from that year to appear on his later Best Films of the s list where it also ranked third He made similar reevaluations of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Ran The Three Colours trilogy Blue White and Red also and Pulp Fiction originally ranked second and third on Ebert s list both were included on his Best Films of the s list but their order had reversed br In Ebert noted his own tendency to place what I now consider the year s best film in second place perhaps because I was trying to make some kind of point with my top pick adding In I should have ranked above The Battle of Algiers In McCabe Mrs Miller was better than The Last Picture Show In Chinatown was probably better in a different way than Scenes from a Marriage In how could I rank Small Change above Taxi Driver In I would put Days of Heaven above An Unmarried Woman And in of course Raging Bull was a better film than The Black Stallion although I later chose Raging Bull as the best film of the entire decade of the s it was only the second best film of am I the same person I was in or I hope not br br br Best films of the decade br Ebert compiled best of the decade movie lists in the s for the s to the s thereby helping provide an overview of his critical preferences Only three films for this listing were named by Ebert as the best film of the year Five Easy Pieces Hoop Dreams and Synecdoche New York br br Five Easy Pieces s br Raging Bull s br Hoop Dreams s br Synecdoche New York s br br br Genres and content br Ebert was often critical of the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system MPAA His main arguments were that they were too strict on sex and profanity too lenient on violence secretive with their guidelines inconsistent in applying them and not willing to consider the wider context and meaning of the film He advocated replacing the NC rating with separate ratings for pornographic and nonpornographic adult films He praised This Film is Not Yet Rated a documentary critiquing the MPAA adding that their rules are Kafkaesque He signed off on his review of Almost Famous by asking Why did they give an R rating to a movie so perfect for teenagers br Ebert also frequently lamented that cinemas outside major cities are booked by computer from Hollywood with no regard for local tastes making high quality independent and foreign films virtually unavailable to most American moviegoers br He wrote that I ve always preferred generic approach to film criticism I ask myself how good a movie is of its type br He gave Halloween four stars Seeing it I was reminded of the favorable review I gave a few years ago to Last House on the Left another really terrifying thriller Readers wrote to ask how I could possibly support such a movie But I wasn t supporting it so much as describing it You don t want to be scared Don t see it Credit must be paid to directors who want to really frighten us to make a good thriller when quite possibly a bad one would have made as much money Hitchcock is acknowledged as a master of suspense it s hypocrisy to disapprove of other directors in the same genre who want to scare us too br Ebert did not believe in grading children s movies on a curve as he thought children were smarter than given credit for and deserved quality entertainment He began his review of Willy Wonka the Chocolate Factory Kids are not stupid They are among the sharpest cleverest most eagle eyed creatures on God s green Earth and very little escapes their notice You may not have observed that your neighbor is still using his snow tires in mid July but every four year old on the block has and kids pay the same attention when they go to the movies They don t miss a thing and have an instinctive contempt for shoddy and shabby work I make this observation because nine out of ten kids movies are stupid witless and display contempt for their audiences Is that all parents want from kids movies That they not have anything bad in them Shouldn t they have something good in them some life imagination fantasy inventiveness something to tickle the imagination If a movie isn t going to do your kids any good why let them watch it Just to kill a Saturday afternoon That shows a subtle contempt for a child s mind I think He went on to say he thought Willy Wonka was the best movie of its kind since The Wizard of Oz br Ebert tried not to judge a film on its ideology Reviewing Apocalypse Now he writes I am not particularly interested in the ideas in Coppola s film Like all great works of art about war Apocalypse Now essentially contains only one idea or message the not especially enlightening observation that war is hell We do not go to see Coppola s movie for that insight something Coppola but not some of his critics knows well Coppola also well knows and demonstrated in The Godfather films that movies aren t especially good at dealing with abstract ideas for those you d be better off turning to the written word but they are superb for presenting moods and feelings the look of a battle the expression on a face the mood of a country Apocalypse Now achieves greatness not by analyzing our experience in Vietnam but by re creating in characters and images something of that experience Ebert commented on films using his Catholic upbringing as a point of reference and was critical of films he believed were grossly ignorant of or insulting to Catholicism such as Stigmata and Priest He also gave favorable reviews of controversial films relating to Jesus Christ or Catholicism including The Last Temptation of Christ The Passion of the Christ and Kevin Smith s religious satire Dogma He defended Spike Lee s Do the Right Thing Some of the advance articles about this movie have suggested that it is an incitement to racial violence Those articles say more about their authors than about the movie I believe that any good hearted person white or black will come out of this movie with sympathy for all of the characters Lee does not ask us to forgive them or even to understand everything they do but he wants us to identify with their fears and frustrations Do the Right Thing doesn t ask its audiences to choose sides it is scrupulously fair to both sides in a story where it is our society itself that is not fair br br br Contrarian reviews br Writing in an online magazine Hazlitt about Ebert s reviews Will Sloan argued that t here were inevitably movies where he veered from consensus but he was not provocative or idiosyncratic by nature Examples of Ebert dissenting from other critics include his negative reviews of such celebrated films as Blue Velvet marred by sophomoric satire and cheap shots A Clockwork Orange a paranoid right wing fantasy masquerading as an Orwellian warning and The Usual Suspects To the degree that I do understand I don t care He gave only two out of four stars to the widely acclaimed Brazil calling it very hard to follow and is the only critic on RottenTomatoes to not like it br He gave a one star review to the critically acclaimed Abbas Kiarostami film Taste of Cherry which won the Palme d Or at the Cannes Film Festival Ebert later added the film to a list of his most hated movies of all time He was dismissive of the Bruce Willis action film Die Hard stating that inappropriate and wrongheaded interruptions reveal the fragile nature of the plot His positive out of stars review of s Speed Cruise Control Movies like this embrace goofiness with an almost sensual pleasure is one of only three positive reviews accounting for that film s approval rating on the reviewer aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes one of the two others having been written by his At the Movies co star Gene Siskel br Ebert reflected on his Speed review in and wrote that it was Frequently cited as an example of what a lousy critic I am but defended his opinion and noted I m grateful to movies that show me what I haven t seen before and Speed had a cruise ship plowing right up the main street of a Caribbean village In Ebert held a contest for University of Colorado Boulder students to create short films with a Speed theme about an object that could not stop moving The winning entrant was set on a roller coaster and was screened at Ebertfest that year br br br Other interests br Ebert was an admirer of Werner Herzog and conducted a Q A session with him at the Walker Arts Center in It was there that Herzog read his Minnesota Declaration which defined his idea of ecstatic truth Herzog dedicated his Encounters at the End of the World to Ebert and Ebert responded with an open letter of gratitude Ebert often quoted something Herzog told him our civilization is starving for new images br Ebert was a lifelong reader and said he had more or less every book I have owned since I was seven starting with Huckleberry Finn Among the authors he considered indispensable were Shakespeare Henry James Willa Cather Colette and Simenon He writes of his friend William Nack He approached literature like a gourmet He relished it savored it inhaled it and after memorizing it rolled it on his tongue and spoke it aloud It was Nack who already knew in the early s when he was a very young man that Nabokov was perhaps the supreme stylist of modern novelists He recited to me from Lolita and from Speak Memory and Pnin I was spellbound Every time Ebert saw Nack he d ask him to recite the last lines of The Great Gatsby Reviewing Stone Reader he wrote get me in conversation with another reader and I ll recite titles too Have you ever read The Quincunx The Raj Quartet A Fine Balance Ever heard of that most despairing of all travel books The Saddest Pleasure by Moritz Thomsen Does anybody hold up better than Joseph Conrad and Willa Cather Know any Yeats by heart Surely P G Wodehouse is as great at what he does as Shakespeare was at what he did Among contemporary authors he admired Cormac McCarthy and credited Suttree with reviving his love of reading after his illness He also loved audiobooks particularly praising Sean Barrett s reading of Perfume He was a fan of Herg s The Adventures of Tintin which he read in French br Ebert was also an advocate and supporter of Asian American cinema famously coming to the defense of the cast and crew of Justin Lin s Better Luck Tomorrow during a Sundance Film Festival screening when a white member of the audience asked how Asians could be portrayed in such a negative light and how a film so empty and amoral could be made for Asian Americans and Americans Ebert responded that What I find very offensive and condescending about your statement is nobody would say to a bunch of white filmmakers How could you do this to your people Asian American characters have the right to be whoever the hell they want to be They do not have to represent their people He was a supporter of the film after the incident at Sundance and also supported a number of Asian American films such as Eric Byler s Charlotte Sometimes and screened them at his film festival br Ebert first visited London in with his professor Daniel Curley who started me on a lifelong practice of wandering around London From to I visited London never less than once a year and usually more than that Walking the city became a part of my education and in this way I learned a little about architecture British watercolors music theater and above all people I felt a freedom in London I ve never felt elsewhere I made lasting friends The city lends itself to walking can be intensely exciting at eye level and is being eaten alive block by block by brutal corporate leg lifting Ebert and Curley coauthored The Perfect London Walk br Ebert attended the Conference on World Affairs at the University of Colorado Boulder for many years where he hosted a program called Cinema Interruptus He would analyze a film with an audience and anyone could say Stop to point out something they found interesting He wrote Boulder is my hometown in an alternate universe I have walked its streets by day and night in rain snow and sunshine I have made life long friends there I was in my twenties when I first came to the Conference on World Affairs and was greeted by Howard Higman its choleric founder with Who invited you back Since then I have appeared on countless panels panels where I have learned and rehearsed debatemanship the art of talking to anybody about anything In Ebert invited Ramin Bahrani to join him in analyzing Bahrani s film Chop Shop a frame at a time The next year they invited Werner Herzog to join them in analyzing Aguirre the Wrath of God After that Ebert announced that he would not return to the conference It is fueled by speech and I m out of gas But I went there for my adult lifetime and had a hell of a good time br br br Views on technology br Ebert was a strong advocate for Maxivision in which the movie projector runs at frames per second as compared to the usual frames per second He was opposed to the practice whereby theaters lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film harder to see Ebert was skeptical of the resurgence of D effects in film which he found unrealistic and distracting br In Ebert opined that video games are not art and are inferior to media created through authorial control such as film and literature stating video games can be elegant subtle sophisticated challenging and visually wonderful but the nature of the medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship to the stature of art This resulted in negative reaction from video game enthusiasts such as writer Clive Barker who defended video games as an art form Ebert wrote a further piece in response to Barker Ebert maintained his position in but conceded that he should not have expressed this skepticism without being more familiar with the actual experience of playing them He admitted that he barely played video games I have played Cosmology of Kyoto which I enormously enjoyed and Myst for which I lacked the patience In the article Ebert wrote It is quite possible a game could someday be great art br Ebert had reviewed Cosmology of Kyoto for Wired in and had praised the exploration depth and graphics found in the game writing This is the most beguiling computer game I have encountered a seamless blend of information adventure humor and imagination the gruesome side by side with the divine Ebert filed one other video game related article for Wired in in which he described his visit to Sega s Joypolis arcade in Tokyo br br br Personal life br br br Marriage br At age Ebert married trial attorney Charlie Chaz Hammel Smith in Chaz Ebert became vice president of the Ebert Company and has emceed Ebertfest He explained in his memoir Life Itself that he did not want to marry before his mother died as he was afraid of displeasing her In a July blog entry Ebert wrote about Chaz She fills my horizon she is the great fact of my life she has my love she saved me from the fate of living out my life alone which is where I seemed to be heading She has been with me in sickness and in health certainly far more sickness than we could have anticipated I will be with her strengthened by her example She continues to make my life possible and her presence fills me with love and a deep security That s what a marriage is for Now I know br br br Alcoholism recovery br Ebert was a recovering alcoholic having quit drinking in He was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous and had written some blog entries on the subject Ebert was a longtime friend of Oprah Winfrey and Winfrey credited him with persuading her to syndicate The Oprah Winfrey Show which became the highest rated talk show in American television history br br br Health br br In February Ebert was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer which was successfully removed In he underwent surgery for salivary gland cancer which was followed up by radiation therapy He was again diagnosed with cancer in In June of that year he had a mandibulectomy to remove cancerous tissue in the right side of his jaw A week later he had a life threatening complication when his carotid artery burst near the surgery site He was confined to bed rest and was unable to speak eat or drink for a time necessitating the use of a feeding tube br The complications kept Ebert off the air for an extended period Ebert made his first public appearance since mid at Ebertfest on April He was unable to speak instead communicating through his wife He returned to reviewing on May when three of his reviews were published in print In July he revealed that he was still unable to speak Ebert adopted a computerized voice system to communicate eventually using a copy of his own voice created from his recordings by CereProc br In February Chris Jones wrote a lengthy profile of Ebert and his health in Esquire In March his health trials and new computerized voice were featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show In Ebert gave a TED talk assisted by his wife Chaz and friends Dean Ornish and John Hunter called Remaking my voice in which he proposed a test to determine the verisimilitude of a synthesized voice br Ebert underwent further surgery in January to try to restore his voice and address the complications from his previous surgeries On April Ebert announced his speech had not been restored Ebert underwent further surgery in April after fracturing his hip in a fall By Ebert had a prosthetic chin made to hide some of the damage done by his many surgeries br In December Ebert was hospitalized due to the fractured hip which was subsequently determined to be the result of cancer br br Ebert wrote that what s sad about not eating was The loss of dining not the loss of food It may be personal but for me unless I m alone it doesn t involve dinner if it doesn t involve talking The food and drink I can do without easily The jokes gossip laughs arguments and shared memories I miss Sentences beginning with the words Remember that time I ran in crowds where anyone was likely to break out in a poetry recitation at any time Me too But not me anymore So yes it s sad Maybe that s why I enjoy this blog You don t realize it but we re at dinner right now br br br Politics br A supporter of the Democratic Party he wrote of how his Catholic schooling led him to his politics Through a mental process that has by now become almost instinctive those nuns guided me into supporting Universal Health Care the rightness of labor unions fair taxation prudence in warfare kindness in peacetime help for the hungry and homeless and equal opportunity for the races and genders It continues to surprise me that many who consider themselves religious seem to tilt away from me During a panel at the University of Colorado Boulder s Conference on World Affairs Ebert coined the Boulder Pledge by which he vowed never to purchase anything offered through the result of an unsolicited email message or to forward chain emails or mass emails to others br Ebert opposed the Iraq War writing Am I against the war Of course Do I support our troops Of course They were sent to endanger their lives by zealots with occult objectives He endorsed Barack Obama for re election in citing the Affordable Care Act as one important reason for his support of Obama He was concerned about income inequality writing I have no objection to financial success I ve had a lot of it myself All of my income came from paychecks from jobs I held and books I published I have the quaint idea that wealth should be obtained by legal and conventional means by working in other words and not through the manipulation of financial scams You re familiar with the ways bad mortgages were urged upon people who couldn t afford them by banks who didn t care that the loans were bad The banks made the loans and turned a profit by selling them to investors while at the same time betting against them on their own account While Wall Street was knowingly trading the worthless paper that led to the financial collapse of executives were being paid huge bonuses He voiced tentative support for the Occupy Wall Street movement I believe the Occupiers are opposed to the lawless and destructive greed in the financial industry and the unhealthy spread in this country between the rich and the rest Referring to the subprime mortgage crisis he wrote I have also felt despair at the way financial instruments were created and manipulated to deliberately defraud the ordinary people in this country At how home buyers were peddled mortgages they couldn t afford and civilian investors were sold worthless securities based on those bad mortgages Wall Street felt no shame in backing paper that was intended to fail and selling it to customers who trusted them This is clear and documented It is theft and fraud on a staggering scale He was also sympathetic to Ron Paul noting that he speaks directly and clearly without a lot of hot air and lip flap In a review of the documentary I O U S A he credited Paul with being a lonely voice talking about the debt proposing based on the film that the US government was already broke He opposed the war on drugs and capital punishment br br br Beliefs br Ebert was critical of intelligent design and stated that people who believe in either creationism or New Age beliefs such as crystal healing or astrology should not be president Ebert expressed disbelief in supernatural claims in general calling them woo woo though he argued that reincarnation is possible from a scientific rationalist point of view He wrote that in Catholic school he learned of the Theory of Evolution which in its elegance and blinding obviousness became one of the pillars of my reasoning explaining so many things in so many ways It was an introduction not only to logic but to symbolism thus opening a window into poetry literature and the arts in general All my life I have deplored those who interpret something only on its most simplistic level br Ebert described himself as an agnostic on at least one occasion but at other times explicitly rejected that designation biographer Matt Singer wrote that Ebert opposed any categorization of his beliefs In Ebert wrote that he did not want his convictions reduced to a word and stated I have never said although readers have freely informed me I am an atheist an agnostic or at the very least a secular humanist which I am He wrote of his Catholic upbringing I believed in the basic Church teachings because I thought they were correct not because God wanted me to In my mind in the way I interpret them I still live by them today Not by the rules and regulations but by the principles For example in the matter of abortion I am pro choice but my personal choice would be to have nothing to do with an abortion certainly not of a child of my own I believe in free will and believe I have no right to tell anyone else what to do Above all the state does not He wrote I am not a believer not an atheist not an agnostic I am still awake at night asking how I am more content with the question than I would be with an answer He writes I was asked at lunch today who or what I worshiped The question was asked sincerely and in the same spirit I responded that I worshiped whatever there might be outside knowledge I worship the void The mystery And the ability of our human minds to perceive an unanswerable mystery To reduce such a thing to simplistic names is an insult to it and to our intelligence br He wrote that I drank for many years in a tavern that had a photograph of Brendan Behan on the wall and under it is this quotation which I memorized I respect kindness in human beings first of all and kindness to animals I don t respect the law I have a total irreverence for anything concerned with society except that which makes the roads safer the beer stronger the food cheaper and the old men and the old women warmer in the winter and happier in the summer For words that does a pretty good job of summing it up Summarizing his beliefs Ebert wrote br br I believe that if at the end of it all according to our abilities we have done something to make others a little happier and something to make ourselves a little happier that is about the best we can do To make others less happy is a crime To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts We must try to contribute joy to the world That is true no matter what our problems our health our circumstances We must try I didn t always know this and am happy I lived long enough to find it out br br br Death and legacy br On April Ebert died at age at a hospital in Chicago shortly before he was set to return to his home and enter hospice care br President Barack Obama wrote For a generation of Americans and especially Chicagoans Roger was the movies he could capture the unique power of the movies to take us somewhere magical The movies won t be the same without Roger Martin Scorsese released a statement saying The death of Roger Ebert is an incalculable loss for movie culture and for film criticism And it s a loss for me personally there was a professional distance between us but then I could talk to him much more freely than I could to other critics Really Roger was my friend It s that simple br Steven Spielberg stated that Ebert s reviews went far deeper than simply thumbs up or thumbs down He wrote with passion through a real knowledge of film and film history and in doing so helped many movies find their audiences He put television criticism on the map Numerous celebrities paid tribute including Christopher Nolan Oprah Winfrey Steve Martin Albert Brooks Jason Reitman Ron Howard Darren Aronofsky Larry King Cameron Crowe Werner Herzog Howard Stern Steve Carell Stephen Fry Diablo Cody Anna Kendrick Jimmy Kimmel and Patton Oswalt br Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune recalled that I came late to film criticism in Chicago after writing about the theater Roger loved the theater His was a theatrical personality a raconteur a spinner of dinner table stories a man who was not shy about his accomplishments But he made room in that theatrical improbable outsized life for others Andrew O Hehir of Salon wrote that He s up there with Will Rogers H L Mencken A J Liebling and not too far short of Mark Twain as one of the great plainspoken commentators on American life br The Onion paid tribute to Ebert Calling the overall human existence poignant thought provoking and a complete tour de force film critic Roger Ebert praised existence as an audacious and thrilling triumph At times brutally sad yet surprisingly funny and always completely honest I wholeheartedly recommend existence If you haven t experienced it yet what are you waiting for It is not to be missed Ebert later said that while human existence s running time was a little on the long side it could have gone on much much longer and he would have been perfectly happy br Hundreds of people attended the funeral Mass held at Chicago s Holy Name Cathedral on April where Ebert was celebrated as a film critic newspaperman advocate for social justice and husband Father Michael Pfleger concluded the service with the balconies of heaven are filled with angels singing Thumbs Up Reverend John F Costello of Loyola University delivered a homily for Ebert br br br Memorials br br A nearly three hour public tribute entitled Roger Ebert A Celebration of Life was held on April at the Chicago Theatre It featured in person remembrances video testimonials video

The film studies Ebert s life and career while also filming Ebert during his final months and includes interviews with his family and friends It was universally praised by critics It has a approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes br Werner Herzog told Entertainment Weekly that Ebert was a soldier of the cinema I always loved Roger for being the good soldier not only the good soldier of cinema but he was a wounded soldier who for years in his affliction held out and plowed on and soldiered on and held the outpost that was given up by almost everyone The monumental shift now is that intelligent deep discourse about cinema has been something that has been vanishing over the last maybe two decades I ve always tried to be a good soldier of cinema myself so of course since he s gone I will plow on as I have plowed on all my life but I will do what I have to do as if Roger was looking over my shoulder And I am not gonna disappoint him br Ebert was inducted as a laureate of The Lincoln Academy
