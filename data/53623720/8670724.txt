Count Dracula is the title character of Bram Stoker s gothic horror novel Dracula He is considered the prototypical and archetypal vampire in subsequent works of fiction Aspects of the character are believed by some to have been inspired by the th century Wallachian prince Vlad the Impaler who was also known as Vlad Dracula and by Sir Henry Irving an actor for whom Stoker was a personal assistant br One of Dracula s most iconic powers is his ability to turn others into vampires by biting them and infecting them with the vampiric disease Other characteristics have been added or altered in subsequent popular fictional works including films cartoons and breakfast cereals br br br Stoker s creation br Bram Stoker s novel takes the form of an epistolary tale in which Count Dracula s characteristics powers abilities and weaknesses are narrated by multiple narrators from different perspectives br Count Dracula is an undead centuries old vampire and a Transylvanian nobleman who claims to be a Sz kely descended from Attila the Hun He inhabits a decaying castle in the Carpathian Mountains near the Borgo Pass Unlike the vampires of Eastern European folklore which are portrayed as repulsive corpse like creatures Dracula is handsome and charismatic with a veneer of aristocratic charm In his conversations with Jonathan Harker he reveals himself as deeply proud of his boyar heritage and nostalgic for the past which he admits has become only a memory of heroism honour and valour in modern times br br br Early life br Details of his early life are undisclosed but it is mentioned that br br he was in life a most wonderful man Soldier statesman and alchemist Which latter was the highest development of the scientific knowledge of his time He had a mighty brain a learning beyond compare and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay br Dracula studied the black arts at the academy of Scholomance in the Carpathian Mountains overlooking the town of Sibiu also known as Hermannstadt and has a deep knowledge of alchemy and magic Taking up arms as befitting his rank and status as a voivode he led troops against the Turks across the Danube According to his nemesis Abraham Van Helsing He must indeed have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey land If it be so then was he no common man for in that time and for centuries after he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning as well as the bravest of the sons of the land beyond the forest Dead and buried in a great tomb in the chapel of his castle Dracula returns from death as a vampire and lives for several centuries in his castle with three terrifyingly beautiful female vampires beside him br br br Narrative br br br Short story br br In Dracula s Guest the narrative follows an unnamed Englishman traveller as he wanders around Munich before leaving for Transylvania It is Walpurgis Night and the young Englishman foolishly leaves his hotel in spite of the coachman s warnings and wanders through a dense forest alone Along the way he feels that he is being watched by a tall and thin stranger br The short story climaxes in an old graveyard where the Englishman encounters a sleeping female vampire called Countess Dolingen in a marble tomb with a large iron stake driven into it This malevolent beautiful vampire awakens from her marble bier to conjure a snowstorm before being struck by lightning and returning to her eternal prison The Englishman s troubles are not quite over as he is dragged away by an unseen force and rendered unconscious He awakens to find a gigantic wolf lying on his chest and licking his throat It keeps him warm and protects him until help arrives When the Englishman is finally taken back to his hotel a telegram awaits him from his expectant host Dracula with a warning about dangers from snow and wolves and night br br br Novel br In Dracula the eponymous vampire has decided to move from Transylvania to London He summons Jonathan Harker a newly qualified English solicitor to provide legal support for a real estate transaction overseen by Harker s employer Dracula at first charms Harker with his cordiality and historical knowledge and even rescues him from the clutches of the three female vampires in the castle In truth Dracula wishes to keep Harker alive long enough to complete the legal transaction and to learn as much as possible about England br br Dracula leaves his castle and boards a Russian ship the Demeter taking along with him boxes of Transylvanian soil which he needs to regain his strength and rest during daylight During the voyage to Whitby a coastal town in northern England he sustains himself on the ship s crew members Only one body is later found that of the captain who is found tied up to the ship s helm The captain s log is recovered and tells of strange events that had taken place during the ship s journey Dracula leaves the ship in the form of a dog and runs up the steps to the graveyard of St Mary s Church in the shadow of the Whitby Abbey ruins br Soon the Count begins menacing Harker s fianc e Wilhelmina Mina Murray and her friend Lucy Westenra There is also a notable link between Dracula and Renfield a patient in an insane asylum overseen by John Seward who is compelled to consume spiders birds and other creatures in ascending order of size to absorb their life force Renfield acts as a kind of sensor reacting to Dracula s proximity and supplying clues accordingly Dracula visits Lucy s bed chamber on a nightly basis draining her of blood while simultaneously infecting her with the curse of vampirism Not knowing the cause for Lucy s deterioration her three suitors Seward Arthur Holmwood and Quincey Morris call upon Seward s mentor the Dutch doctor Abraham Van Helsing Van Helsing soon deduces her condition s supernatural origins and tries to keep the vampire at bay with garlic Nevertheless Dracula attacks Lucy s house one final time killing her mother and transforming Lucy herself into one of the undead after which Van Helsing and her suitors help lay Lucy s soul to rest by driving a stake through her heart br br Harker escapes Dracula s castle and returns to England barely alive and deeply traumatized On Seward s suggestion Mina seeks Van Helsing s assistance in assessing Harker s health She reads his journal and passes it along to Van Helsing This unfolds the first clue to the identity of Lucy s assailant which later prompts Mina to collect all of the events of Dracula s appearance in news articles saved letters newspaper clippings and the journals of each member of the group This assists the group in investigating Dracula s movements and later discovering that Renfield s behaviour is directly influenced by Dracula They then discover that Dracula has purchased a residence next door to Seward s The group gathers intelligence to track down Dracula and destroy him br After the undead Lucy attacks several children Van Helsing Seward Holmwood and Morris enter her crypt and destroy her to save her soul Later Harker joins them and the party works to discover Dracula s intentions Harker aids the party in tracking down the locations of the boxes to the various residences of Dracula and discovers that Dracula purchased multiple real estate properties throughout London under the alias Count De Ville Dracula s main plan was to move each of his boxes of earth to his various properties in order to arrange multiple lairs throughout and around the perimeter of London br The party pries open each of the graves places sacramental wafers within each of them and seals them shut This deprives Dracula of his ability to seek safety in those boxes Dracula gains entry into Seward s residence by coercing an invitation out of Renfield As he attempts to enter the room in which Harker and Mina are staying Renfield tries to stop him Dracula then mortally wounds him With his dying breath Renfield tells Seward and Van Helsing that Dracula is after Mina Van Helsing and Seward discover Dracula biting Mina and forcing her to drink his blood The group repels Dracula using crucifixes and sacramental bread forcing him to flee by turning into a dark vapour The party continues to hunt Dracula to search for his remaining lairs Although Dracula s baptism of Mina grants him a telepathic link to her it backfires when Van Helsing hypnotizes Mina and uses her supernatural link with Dracula to track him as he flees back to Transylvania br The heroes follow Dracula back to Transylvania and in a climactic battle with Dracula s Romani bodyguards finally destroy him Despite the popular image of Dracula having a stake driven through his heart to kill him Mina s narrative describes his decapitation by Harker s kukri while Morris simultaneously pierces his heart with a Bowie knife Mina Harker s Journal November Dracula Chapter His body then turns into dust but not before Mina sees an expression of peace on his face br br br Characteristics br br Although early in the novel Dracula dons a mask of cordiality he often flies into fits of rage when his plans are frustrated When Dracula s brides attempt to seduce Jonathan Harker Dracula physically assaults one and ferociously berates them for their insubordination br Dracula has an appreciation for ancient architecture and prefers purchasing old houses saying a new home would kill me and that it takes a century to make one habitable br Dracula is very proud of his warrior heritage proclaiming his pride to Harker on how the Sz kely people are infused with the blood of heroes He also expresses an interest in the history of the British Empire speaking admiringly of its people He has a somewhat primal and predatory worldview pities ordinary humans for their revulsion to their darker impulses feels human emotions and often says that he can love br Though usually portrayed as having a strong Eastern European accent the original novel only specifies that his spoken English is excellent though strangely toned br His appearance varies in age He is described early in the novel as thin with a long white moustache pointed ears and sharp teeth It is also noted later in the novel Chapter subsection The Escaped Wolf by a zookeeper who sees him that he has a hooked nose and a pointed beard with a streak of white in it He is dressed all in black and has hair on his palms Harker describes him as an old man cruel looking and giving an effect of extraordinary pallor br br I saw Count Dracula with red light of triumph in his eyes and with a smile that Judas in hell might be proud of br As the novel progresses Dracula is described as taking on a more and more youthful appearance After Harker strikes him with a shovel he is left with a scar on his forehead which he bears throughout the course of the novel br Dracula also possesses great wealth and has Romani people in his homeland who are loyal to him as servants and protectors br br br Powers and weaknesses br br Count Dracula is portrayed in the novel using many different supernatural abilities and is believed to have gained his abilities through dealings with the devil Chapter of the novel describes many of the abilities limitations and weaknesses of vampires and Dracula in particular Dracula has superhuman strength which according to Van Helsing is equivalent to that of strong men He does not cast a shadow or have a reflection from mirrors He is immune to conventional means of attack a sailor tries to stab him in the back with a knife but the blade goes through his body as though it is air He can defy gravity to a certain extent and possesses superhuman agility able to climb vertical surfaces upside down in a reptilian manner He can travel onto unhallowed ground such as the graves of suicides and those of his victims He has powerful hypnotic telepathic and illusionary abilities He also has the ability to within limitations vanish and reappear elsewhere at will If he knows the path he can come out from anything or into anything regardless of how close it is bound or even if it is soldered shut br Dracula has amassed cunning and wisdom throughout centuries and is unable to die of senescence He can command animals such as rats owls bats moths foxes and wolves His control is limited as seen when the party first enters his house in London He summons thousands of rats to swarm and attack the group and Holmwood summons his trio of terriers to battle them The dogs prove very efficient rat killers Terrified by their onslaught the rats flee of their own volition br Dracula can also manipulate the weather and within his range is able to direct the elements such as storms fog and mist br br br Shapeshifting br Dracula can change form at will able to grow and become small his featured forms in the novel being that of a bat a large dog and a fog or mist When the moonlight is shining he can travel as elemental dust within its rays He is able to pass through tiny cracks or crevices while retaining his human form or in the form of a vapour described by Van Helsing as the ability to slip through a hairbreadth space of a tomb door or coffin This is also an ability used by his victim Lucy as a vampire When the party breaks into her tomb they open the sealed coffin to find her corpse is no longer located within br br br Vampirism br One of Dracula s powers is the ability to turn others into vampires by biting them According to Van Helsing br br When they become such there comes with the change the curse of immortality they cannot die but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world For all that die from the preying of the Undead become themselves Undead and prey on their kind And so the circle goes on ever widening like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water Friend Arthur if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die or again last night when you open your arms to her you would in time when you had died have become nosferatu as they call it in Eastern Europe and would for all time make more of those Un Deads that so have filled us with horror br The vampire bite itself does not cause death It is the method vampires use to drain blood of the victim and to increase their influence over them This is described by Van Helsing br br The nosferatu do not die like the bee when he sting once He is only stronger and being stronger have yet more power to work evil br Victims who are bitten by a vampire and do not die are hypnotically influenced by them br br Those children whose blood she suck are not yet so much worse but if she live on Un Dead more and more lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her br Van Helsing later describes the aftermath of a bitten victim when the vampire has been killed br br But if she die in truth then all cease the tiny wounds of the throats disappear and they go back to their plays unknowing of whatever has been br As Dracula slowly drains Lucy s blood she dies from acute blood loss and later transforms into a vampire despite the efforts of Seward and Van Helsing to provide her with blood transfusions br He is aided by powers of necromancy and divination of the dead that all who die by his hand may reanimate and do his bidding br br br Bloodletting br Dracula requires no other sustenance but fresh human blood which has the effect of rejuvenating him and allowing him to grow younger His power is drawn from the blood of others and he cannot survive without it Although drinking blood can rejuvenate his youth and strength it does not give him the ability to regenerate months after being struck on the head by a shovel he still bears a scar from the impact br Dracula s preferred victims are women Harker states that he believes Dracula has a state of fasting as well as a state of feeding He tells Mina exerting his abilities raises a desire to feed br br br Vampire s Baptism of Blood br Count Dracula is depicted as the King Vampire and can control other vampires To punish Mina and the party for their efforts against him Dracula bites her on at least three occasions He also forces her to drink his blood this act curses her with the effects of vampirism and gives him a telepathic link to her thoughts Hypnotism only works before dawn Van Helsing refers to the act of drinking blood by both the vampire and the victim the Vampire s Baptism of Blood br br you their best beloved one are now to me flesh of my flesh blood of my blood kin of my kin my bountiful wine press for a while and shall be later on my companion and my helper You shall be avenged in turn for not one of them but shall minister to your needs But as yet you are to be punished for what you have done You have aided in thwarting me Now you shall come to my call When my brain says Come to you you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding br The effects changes Mina physically and mentally over time A few moments after Dracula attacks her Van Helsing takes a wafer of sacramental bread and places it on her forehead to bless her when the bread touches her skin it burns her and leaves a scar on her forehead Her teeth start growing longer but do not grow sharper She begins to lose her appetite feeling repulsed by normal food begins to sleep more and more during the day cannot wake unless at sunset and stops writing in her diary When Van Helsing later crumbles the same bread in a circle around her she is unable to cross or leave the circle discovering a new form of protection br Dracula s death would release the curse on any living transformed vampire Van Helsing reveals that even were he to escape his continued existence would ensure whether or not he victimized Mina further she would become a vampire upon her eventual natural death br br br Limitations of his powers br Dracula is much less powerful in daylight and is only able to shift his form at dawn noon and dusk he can shift his form freely at night or if he is at his grave The sun is not fatal to him as sunlight does not burn and destroy him upon contact though most of his abilities cease br br The sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course Until it sets to night that monster must retain whatever form he now has He is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope He cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies If he goes through a doorway he must open the door like a mortal br His power ceases as does that of all evil things at the coming of the day Only at certain times can he have limited freedom If he be not at the place whither he is bound he can only change himself at noon or exact sunrise or sunset br Later interpretations of the character and vampires in general would amplify this trait into an outright fatal weakness making it so that even the first rays of sunrise are capable of reducing a vampire to ash br He is also limited in his ability to travel as he can only cross running water at low or high tide Owing to this he is unable to fly across a river in the form of a bat or mist or even by himself board a boat or step off a boat onto a dock unless he is physically carried over with assistance He is also unable to enter a place unless invited to do so by someone of the household even a visitor once invited he can enter and leave the premises at will br br br Weaknesses br br br Thirst br Dracula is commonly depicted with a bloodlust which he is seemingly unable to control Adaptations sometimes call this uncontrollable state the thirst br br br Religious symbolism br There are items which afflict him to the point he has no power and can even calm him from his insatiable appetite for blood He is repulsed by garlic as well as sacred items and symbols such as crucifixes and sacramental bread br br at the instant I saw that the cut had bled a little and the blood was trickling over my chin I laid down the razor turning as I did so half round to look for some sticking plaster When the Count saw my face his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury and he suddenly made a grab at my throat I drew away and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix It made an instant change in him for the fury passed so quickly that I could hardly believe that it was ever there br Placing the branch of a wild rose upon the top of his coffin will render him unable to escape it a sacred bullet fired into the coffin could kill him so that he remain true dead br Mountain ash is also described as a form of protection from a vampire although the effects are unknown This was believed to be used as protection against evil spirits and witches during the Victorian era br br br Death sleep br The state of rest to which vampires are prone during the day is described in the novel as a deathlike sleep in which the vampire sleeps open eyed is unable to awaken or move and also may be unaware of any presence of individuals who may be trespassing Dracula is portrayed as being active in daylight at least once to pursue a victim Dracula also purchases many properties throughout London over the counter which shows that he does have the ability to have some type of presence in daylight br br on a pile of newly dug earth lay the Count He was either dead or asleep I could not say which for eyes were open and stony but without the glassiness of death and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor The lips were as red as ever But there was no sign of movement no pulse no breath no beating of the heart I bent over him and tried to find any sign of life but in vain I thought he might have the keys on him but when I went to search I saw the dead eyes and in them dead though they were such a look of hate though unconscious of me or my presence that I fled from the place and leaving the Count s room by the window br He requires Transylvanian soil to be nearby to him in a foreign land or to be entombed within his coffin within Transylvania in order to successfully rest otherwise he will be unable to recover his strength This has forced him to transport many boxes of Transylvanian earth to each of his residences in London He is most powerful when he is within his Earth Home Coffin Home Hell Home or any place unhallowed br Further if Dracula or any vampire has had their fill in blood upon feeding they will be caused to rest in this dead state even longer than usual br br br Other abilities br While universally feared by the local people of Transylvania and even beyond Dracula commands the loyalty of the Romani people as well as a band of Slovaks who transport his boxes on their way to London and to serve as an armed convoy bringing his coffin back to his castle The Slovaks and Romani appear to know his true nature for they laugh at Harker when he tries to communicate his plight and betray Harker s attempt to send a letter through them by giving it to the Count br Dracula seems to be able to hold influence over people with mental disorders such as Renfield who is never bitten but who worships Dracula referring to him over the course of the novel as Master and Lord Dracula also afflicts Lucy with chronic sleepwalking putting her into a trance like state that allows them not only to submit to his will but also seek him and satisfy his need to feed br Dracula s powers and weaknesses vary greatly in the many adaptations Previous and subsequent vampires from different legends have had similar vampire characteristics br br br Character development subsequent to the novel br br Dracula has been portrayed by more actors in more visual media adaptations of the novel than any other horror character Actors who have played him include Max Schreck Bela Lugosi John Carradine Lon Chaney Jr Christopher Lee Francis Lederer

vampire warrior devoted to the British Crown br Dracula is the primary antagonist of the Showtime series Penny Dreadful portrayed by Christian Camargo This version of the character is the brother of Lucifer and thus a fallen angel br br br Modern and postmodern analyses of the character br br Already in Cecil Kirtly proposed that Count Dracula shared his personal past with the historical Transylvanian born Voivode Vlad III Dracula of Wallachia also known as Vlad the Impaler or Vlad epe Following the publication of In Search of Dracula by Radu Florescu and Raymond McNally in this supposed connection attracted much popular attention This work argued that Bram Stoker based his Dracula on Vlad the Impaler br Historically the name Dracula is the family name of Vlad epe family a name derived from a fraternal order of knights called the Order of the Dragon founded by Sigismund of Luxembourg king of Hungary and Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor to uphold Christianity and defend the Empire against the Ottoman Turks Vlad II Dracul father of Vlad III was admitted to the order around because of his bravery in fighting the Turks and was dubbed Dracul dragon or devil thus his son became Dracula son of the dragon From onward Vlad II wore the emblem of the order and later as ruler of Wallachia his coinage bore the dragon symbol br br Stoker came across the name Dracula in his reading on Romanian history and chose this to replace the name Count Wampyr that he had originally intended to use for his villain Some Dracula scholars led by Elizabeth Miller have questioned the depth of this connection as early as They argue that Stoker in fact knew little of the historic Vlad III Vlad the Impaler and that he used only the name Dracula and some miscellaneous scraps of Romanian history Also there are no comments about Vlad III in the author s working notes br While having a conversation with Jonathan Harker in Chapter Dracula refers to his own background and these speeches show elements which Stoker directly copied from An Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia With Various Political Observations Relating to Them by William Wilkinson Stoker mentions the Voivode of the Dracula race who fought against the Turks after the defeat in the Battle of Kosovo and was later betrayed by his brother historical facts which unequivocally point to Vlad III described as Vo vode Dracula by Wilkinson br br Who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground This was a Dracula indeed Woe was it that his own unworthy brother when he had fallen sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery on them Was it not this Dracula indeed who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into Turkey land who when he was beaten back came again and again though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph Chapter pp br The Count s intended identity is later commented by Professor Van Helsing referring to a letter from his friend Arminius br br He must indeed have been that Voivode Dracula who won his name against the Turk over the great river on the very frontier of Turkey land Chapter pp br This indeed encourages the reader to identify the Count with the Voivode Dracula first mentioned by him in Chapter the one betrayed by his brother Vlad III Dracula betrayed by his brother Radu the Handsome who had chosen the side of the Turks But as noted by the Dutch author Hans Corneel de Roos in Chapter Van Helsing and Mina drop this rudimentary connection to Vlad III and instead describe the Count s personal past as that of that other of his race who lived in a later age By smoothly exchanging Vlad III for a nameless double Stoker avoided his main character being unambiguously linked to a historical person traceable in any history book br Similarly the novelist did not want to disclose the precise site of the Count s residence Castle Dracula As confirmed by Stoker s own handwritten research notes the novelist had a specific location for the Castle in mind while writing the narrative an empty mountain top in the Transylvanian Kelemen alps near the former border with Moldavia Efforts to promote the Poenari Castle ca km away from the novel s place of action near the Borgo Pass as the real Castle Dracula have no basis in Stoker s writing although it bears much similarity to the fictional Castle Dracula no written evidence shows Stoker to have heard of it Regarding the Bran Castle near Bra ov Stoker possibly saw an illustration of Castle Bran T rzburg in Charles Boner s book on Transylvania Transylvania Its Products and Its People Although Stoker may have been inspired by its romantic appearance neither Boner nor Mazuchelli nor Crosse who also mention Terzburg or T rzburg associate it with Vlad III for the site of his fictitious Castle Dracula Stoker preferred an empty mountain top br Stoker s detailed notes reveal he was well aware of the ethnic and geopolitical differences between the Roumanians Wallachs Wallachians descendants of the Dacians and the Sz kelys Szeklers allies of the Magyars or Hungarians whose interests were opposed to that of the Wallachians In the novel s original typewritten manuscript the Count speaks of throwing off the Austrian yoke which corresponds to the Szekler political point of view This expression is crossed out and replaced by Hungarian yoke as appearing in the printed version which matches the historical perspective of the Wallachians Some take this to mean that Stoker opted for the Wallachian not the Szekler interpretation thus lending more consistency to his count s Romanian identity Although not identical to Vlad III the vampire is portrayed as one of the Dracula race br br br Portrayals br br br See also br Elizabeth B thory br
