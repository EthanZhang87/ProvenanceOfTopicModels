The Russian mafia Russian r sskaya m fiya rusk j maf j or ross yskaya m fiya r s ijsk j maf j otherwise referred to as Bratva bratv br t va lit brotherhood is a collective of various organized crime related elements originating in the former Soviet Union FSU Any of the mafia s groups may be referred to as an Organized Criminal Group OPG This is sometimes modified to include a specific name such as the Orekhovskaya OPG The P in the initialism comes from the Russian word for criminal prestupnaya Sometimes the Russian word is dropped in favour of a full translation and OCG is used instead of OPG br In there were as many as groups with more than of them having a global reach Criminals of these various groups are either former prison members corrupt officials and business leaders people with ethnic ties or people from the same region with shared criminal experiences and leaders In December Timur Lakhonin the head of the National Central Bureau of Interpol within Russia stated Certainly there is crime involving our former compatriots abroad but there is no data suggesting that an organized structure of criminal groups comprising former Russians exists abroad on the topic of international Russian criminal gangs In August Alain Bauer a criminologist from France said that the Russian mafia is one of the best structured criminal organizations in Europe with a quasi military operation in their international activities br The Russian mafia is similar to the Italian crime groups in many ways in that the groups organizations and structures follow a similar model The two groups also share a similar portfolio of criminal activity The highly publicized Sicilian Mafia is believed to have inspired early criminal groups in Russia to form mafia like organizations eventually spawning their own version The Russian mafia however differed from the Sicilians due to their environment The level of political corruption and arms sales in post Soviet Russia allowed for their massive expansion as well as the incorporation of many government officials into the crime syndicates Russian mafia groups have also been involved in uranium trading stolen from the Soviet nuclear program and human trafficking among other serious activities br br br History br br br Origins br Today s Russian organized crime can be traced back to the Russian Empire in the form of banditry and thievery but it was not until after the establishment of the Soviet Union that certain vory v zakone lit thieves in law emerged as the leaders of prison groups throughout forced labour camps with a generally well defined code of honour In the aftermath of World War II in the death of Joseph Stalin in and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in more gangs emerged in a flourishing black market that exploited the unstable governments of the FSU American attorney Louis Freeh who headed the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI between and said that the Russian mafia posed the greatest threat to the United States in the mid s br When the Bolshevik Revolution came around in the Thieves World was alive and active Vladimir Lenin attempted to wipe them out but it failed and the criminals survived into Joseph Stalin s reign br br br Soviet era br During Stalin s reign as ruler millions of people were sent to gulags Soviet labor camps where powerful criminals worked their way up to become vorami v zakone thieves in law These criminal elites often conveyed their status through complicated tattoos symbols still used by Russian mobsters br After Hitler s invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II Stalin recruited more men to fight for the nation offering prisoners freedom if they joined the army Many flocked to help out in the war but this act betrayed the codes of the Thieves World that one must not ally with the government Those who chose not to fight in the war referred to the traitors as suka bitch and the traitors landed at the bottom of the hierarchy Outcasts the suki separated from the others and formed their own groups and power bases by collaborating with prison officials eventually gaining the luxury of comfortable positions Bitterness between the groups erupted into a series of Bitch Wars from to with many killed every day The prison officials encouraged the violence seeing it as a way to rid the prisons of criminals br Then in the s Mikhail Gorbachev loosened restrictions on private businesses allowing them to grow legally but by then the Soviet Union was already beginning to collapse br Also during the s and s the United States expanded its immigration policies allowing Soviet Jews with most settling in a southern Brooklyn area known as Brighton Beach sometimes nicknamed Little Odessa Here is where Russian organized crime began in the US The earliest known case of Russian crime in the area was in the mid s by the Potato Bag Gang a group of con artists disguised as merchants that told customers that they were selling antique gold rubles for cheap but in fact gave them bags of potatoes when bought in thousands By the head of Russian organized crime in Brighton Beach was Evsei Agron br Pauol Mirzoyan was a prime target among other mobsters including rival Boris Goldberg and his organization and in May Agron was assassinated Boris Biba Nayfeld his bodyguard moved on to employ under Marat Balagula who was believed to have succeeded Agron s authority In the following year Balagula fled the country after he was convicted in a fraud scheme of Merrill Lynch customers and was found in Frankfurt West Germany in where he was extradited back to the US and sentenced to eight years in prison br Balagula would later be convicted on a separate credit card fraud in Nayfield took Balagula s place partnering with the Polish Al Capone Ricardo Fanchiniin in an import export business and setting up a heroin business In his former friend Monya Elson back from a six year prison sentence in Israel returned to America and set up a rival heroin business culminating in a mafia turf war br br br Growth and internationalization br When the USSR collapsed and a free market economy emerged organized criminal groups began to take over Russia s economy with many ex KGB agents and veterans of the Afghan war offering their skills to the crime bosses Gangster summit meetings had taken place in hotels and restaurants shortly before the Soviet s dissolution so that top vory v zakone could agree on who would rule what and set plans on how to take over the post communist states br In the s in Russia and other post Soviet countries vast deposits of natural resources and businesses that the state had owned for decades were privatized Former Soviet bureaucrats factory directors aggressive businessmen and criminal organizations used insider deals bribery and simple brute force to grab lucrative assets Businesses began building their own private armies of security agents bodyguards and commercial spies They often bought the people and weapons of the former Soviet state or even those of the current Russian police Russia s new capitalists spent millions of dollars for protection buying armor plated cars bomb sensors hidden cameras bulletproof vests anti wiretapping gear and weapons recruiting veterans of the Afghan and Chechen wars as their bodyguards However almost every business in Russia from curbside vendors to huge oil and gas companies made payments to organized crime for protection krysha Businessmen said that they needed the krysha because the laws and the court system were not functioning properly in Russia The only way for them to enforce a contract was to turn to a criminal krysha They also used it to intimidate competitors enforce contracts collect debts or take over new markets It was also becoming increasingly common for Russian businesses to turn to the red krysha the corrupt police who doubled as a paid protection racket Contract killings were common br It was the period of internationalization of Russian organized crime It was agreed that Vyacheslav Yaponchik Ivankov would be sent to Brighton Beach in allegedly because he was killing too many people in Russia and also to take control of Russian organized crime in North America Within a year he built an international operation that included but was not limited to narcotics money laundering and prostitution and made ties with the American Mafia and Colombian drug cartels eventually extending to Miami Los Angeles and Boston br Prior to Ivankov s arrival Balagula s downfall left a void for America s next vory v zakone Monya Elson leader of Monya s Brigada a gang that similarly operated from Russia to Los Angeles to New York was in a feud with Boris Nayfeld with bodies dropping on both sides Ivankov s arrival virtually ended the feud although Elson would later challenge his power as well and a number of attempts were made to end the former s life Nayfield and Elson would eventually be arrested in January released in and in Italy in respectively br According to FBI reports the crime boss Semion Mogilevich had alliances with the Camorra in particular with Salvatore DeFalco a lower echelon member of the Giuliano clan Mogilevich and DeFalco would have held meetings in Prague in Semion Mogilevich s net worth is estimated to be billion dollar br Ivankov s reign also ended in June when a million extortion attempt on two Russian businessmen Alexander Volkov and Vladimir Voloshin ended in an FBI arrest that resulted in a ten year maximum security prison sentence Before his arrest and besides his operations in America Ivankov regularly flew around Europe and Asia to maintain ties with his fellow mobsters like members of the Solntsevskaya Bratva as well as reinforce ties with others This did not stop other people from denying his growing power In one instance Ivankov attempted to buy out Georgian boss Valeri Globus Glugech s drug importation business When the latter refused the offer he and his top associates were shot dead A summit held in May in Vienna rewarded him with what was left of Glugech s business Two months later Ivankov got into another altercation with drug kingpin and head of the Orekhovskaya gang Segei Sylvester Timofeyev ending with the latter murdered a month later br In the Camorra cooperated with the Russian mafia in a scheme in which the Camorra would bleach out US bills and reprint them as s These bills would then be transported to the Russian mafia for distribution in post Eastern Bloc countries and former Soviet republics In return the Russian mafia paid the Camorra with property including a Russian bank and firearms smuggled into Eastern Europe and Italy br A report by the United Nations in placed the number of individuals involved in organized crime in Russia at million employed in about gangs br br Back in Eastern Europe in May Semion Mogilevich held a summit meeting of Russian mafia bosses in his U Holubu restaurant in And l a neighborhood of Prague The excuse to bring them together was that it was a birthday party for Victor Averin the second in command of the Solntsevskaya Bratva However Major Tomas Machacek of the Czech police got wind of an anonymous tip off that claimed that the Solntsevskaya were planning to assassinate Mogilevich at the location it was rumored that Mogilevich and Solntsevskaya leader Sergei Mikhailov had a dispute over million and the police successfully raided the meeting guests were arrested but no charges were put against them only key Russian mafia members were banned from the country most of whom moved to Hungary br One person who was not there was Mogilevich himself He claimed that b y the time I arrived at U Holubu everything was already in full swing so I went into a neighboring hotel and sat in the bar there until about five or six in the morning Mikhailov would later be arrested in Switzerland in October on numerous charges including that he was the head of a powerful Russian mafia group but was exonerated and released two years later after evidence was not enough to prove much br The global extent of Russian organized crime was not realized until Ludwig Tarzan Fainberg was arrested in January primarily because of arms dealing In Fainberg moved from Brighton Beach to Miami and opened up a strip club called Porky s which soon became a popular hangout for underworld criminals Fainberg himself gained a reputation as an ambassador among international crime groups becoming especially close to Juan Almeida a Colombian cocaine dealer Planning to expand his cocaine business Fainberg acted as an intermediary between Almeida and the corrupt Russian military He helped him get six Russian military helicopters in and in the following year helped arrange to buy a submarine for cocaine smuggling Unfortunately for the two of them federal agents had been keeping a close eye on Fainberg for months Alexander Yasevich an associate of the Russian military contact and an undercover DEA agent was sent to verify the illegal dealing and in Fainberg was finally arrested in Miami Facing the possibility of life imprisonment the latter agreed to testify against Almeida in exchange for a shorter sentence which ended up being months br The FreeLance Bureau FLB ru published a website in containing Philipp Bobkov s MOST Group Security Database along with files from RUOP and other departments and special services br Vanuatu was a preferred location for Russian mafia laundering money br br br present br As the st century dawned the Russian mafia remained after the death of Aslan Usoyan New mafia bosses sprang up while imprisoned ones were released Among the released were Marat Balagula and Vyacheslav Ivankov both in The latter was extradited to Russia but was jailed once more for his alleged murders of two Turks in a Moscow restaurant in he was cleared of all charges and released in Four years later he was assassinated by a shot in the stomach from a sniper Meanwhile Monya Elson and Leonid Roytman were arrested in March for an unsuccessful murder plot against two Kyiv based businessmen br In FBI agents in Moscow targeted two suspected mafia leaders and two other corrupt businessmen One of the leaders is Yevgeny Dvoskin a criminal who had been in prison with Ivankov in and was deported in for breaking immigration regulations the other is Konstantin Gizya Ginzburg who was reportedly the current big boss of Russian organized crime in America before his reported assassination in it being suspected that Ivankov handed over control to him br In the same year Semion Mogilevich was placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list for his involvement in a complex multimillion dollar scheme that defrauded investors in the stock of his company YBM Magnex International swindling them out of million He was indicted in and arrested in in Russia on tax fraud charges but because the US does not have an extradition treaty with Russia he was released on bail Monya Elson said in that Mogilevich is the most powerful mobster in the world br Around the world Russian mafia groups have popped up as dominating particular areas Russian organized crime has a rather large stronghold in the city of Atlanta where members are distinguished by their tattoos Russian organized crime was reported to have a stronger grip in the French Riviera region and Spain in and Russia was branded as a virtual mafia state according to the WikiLeaks cables br According to recordings released in Alexander Litvinenko
