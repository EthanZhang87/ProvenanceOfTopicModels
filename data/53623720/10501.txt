Espionage spying or intelligence gathering is the act of obtaining secret or confidential information intelligence A person who commits espionage is called an espionage agent or spy Any individual or spy ring a cooperating group of spies in the service of a government company criminal organization or independent operation can commit espionage The practice is clandestine as it is by definition unwelcome In some circumstances it may be a legal tool of law enforcement and in others it may be illegal and punishable by law br Espionage is often part of an institutional effort by a government or commercial concern However the term tends to be associated with state spying on potential or actual enemies for military purposes Spying involving corporations is known as industrial espionage br One way to gather data and information about a targeted organization is by infiltrating its ranks Spies can then return information such as the size and strength of enemy forces They can also find dissidents within the organization and influence them to provide further information or to defect In times of crisis spies steal technology and sabotage the enemy in various ways Counterintelligence is the practice of thwarting enemy espionage and intelligence gathering Almost all sovereign states have strict laws concerning espionage including those who practice espionage in other countries and the penalties for being caught are often severe br br br History br br Espionage has been recognized as of importance in military affairs since ancient times br The oldest known classified document was a report made by a spy disguised as a diplomatic envoy in the court of King Hammurabi who died in around BC The ancient Egyptians had a developed secret service and espionage is mentioned in the Iliad the Bible and the Amarna letters Espionage was also prevalent in the Greco Roman world when spies employed illiterate subjects in civil services br The thesis that espionage and intelligence has a central role in war as well as peace was first advanced in The Art of War and in the Arthashastra In the Middle Ages European states excelled at what has later been termed counter subversion when Catholic inquisitions were staged to annihilate heresy Inquisitions were marked by centrally organised mass interrogations and detailed record keeping Western espionage changed fundamentally during the Renaissance when Italian city states installed resident ambassadors in capital cities to collect intelligence Renaissance Venice became so obsessed with espionage that the Council of Ten which was nominally responsible for security did not even allow the doge to consult government archives freely In the Council of Ten barred all Venetian government officials from making contact with ambassadors or foreigners Those revealing official secrets could face the death penalty Venice became obsessed with espionage because successful international trade demanded that the city state could protect its trade secrets Under Queen Elizabeth I of England r Francis Walsingham c was appointed foreign secretary and intelligence chief The novelist and journalist Daniel Defoe died not only spied for the British government but also developed a theory of espionage foreshadowing modern police state methods br During the American Revolution Nathan Hale and Benedict Arnold achieved their fame as spies and there was considerable use of spies on both sides during the American Civil War Though not a spy himself George Washington was America s first spymaster utilizing espionage tactics against the British br br In the th century at the height of World War I all great powers except the United States had elaborate civilian espionage systems and all national military establishments had intelligence units In order to protect the country against foreign agents the U S Congress passed the Espionage Act of Mata Hari who obtained information for Germany by seducing French officials was the most noted espionage agent of World War I Prior to World War II Germany and Imperial Japan established elaborate espionage nets In the Office of Strategic Services was founded by Gen William J Donovan However the British system was the keystone of Allied intelligence Numerous resistance groups such as the Austrian Maier Messner Group the French Resistance the Witte Brigade Milorg and the Polish Home Army worked against Nazi Germany and provided the Allied secret services with information that was very important for the war effort br Since the end of World War II the activity of espionage has enlarged much of it growing out of the Cold War between the United States and the former USSR The Russian Empire and its successor the Soviet Union have had a long tradition of espionage ranging from the Okhrana to the KGB Committee for State Security which also acted as a secret police force In the United States the National Security Act created the Central Intelligence Agency CIA to coordinate intelligence and the National Security Agency for research into codes and electronic communication In addition to these the United States has other intelligence gathering agencies most of the U S expenditures for intelligence gathering are budgeted to various Defense Dept agencies and their programs Under the intelligence reorganization of the director of national intelligence is responsible for overseeing and coordinating the activities and budgets of the U S intelligence agencies br In the Cold War espionage cases included Alger Hiss Whittaker Chambers and the Rosenberg Case In the Communist Chinese captured two CIA agents and in Francis Gary Powers flying a U reconnaissance mission over the Soviet Union for the CIA was shot down and captured During the Cold War many Soviet intelligence officials defected to the West including Gen Walter Krivitsky Victor Kravchenko Vladimir Petrov Peter Deriabin Pawel Monat and Oleg Penkovsky of the GRU Among Western officials who defected to the Soviet Union are Guy Burgess and Donald D Maclean of Great Britain in Otto John of West Germany in William H Martin and Bernon F Mitchell U S cryptographers in and Harold Kim Philby of Great Britain in U S acknowledgment of its U flights and the exchange of Francis Gary Powers for Rudolf Abel in implied the legitimacy of some espionage as an arm of foreign policy br China has a very cost effective intelligence program that is especially effective in monitoring neighboring countries such as Mongolia Russia and India Smaller countries can also mount effective and focused espionage efforts For instance the Vietnamese communists had consistently superior intelligence during the Vietnam War Some Islamic countries including Libya Iran and Syria have highly developed operations as well SAVAK the secret police of the Pahlavi dynasty was particularly feared by Iranian dissidents before the Iranian Revolution br br br Modern day br Today spy agencies target the illegal drug trade and terrorists as well as state actors br Intelligence services value certain intelligence collection techniques over others The former Soviet Union for example preferred human sources over research in open sources while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT In the Soviet Union both political KGB and military intelligence GRU officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited br br br Targets of espionage br Espionage agents are usually trained experts in a targeted field so they can differentiate mundane information from targets of value to their own organizational development Correct identification of the target at its execution is the sole purpose of the espionage operation br Broad areas of espionage targeting expertise include br br Natural resources strategic production identification and assessment food energy materials Agents are usually found among bureaucrats who administer these resources in their own countries br Popular sentiment towards domestic and foreign policies popular middle class elites Agents often recruited from field journalistic crews exchange postgraduate students and sociology researchers br Strategic economic strengths production research manufacture infrastructure Agents recruited from science and technology academia commercial enterprises and more rarely from among military technologists br Military capability intelligence offensive defensive manoeuvre naval air space Agents are trained by military espionage education facilities and posted to an area of operation with covert identities to minimize prosecution br Counterintelligence operations targeting opponent s intelligence services themselves such as breaching the confidentiality of communications and recruiting defectors or moles br br br Methods and terminology br Although the news media may speak of spy satellites and the like espionage is not a synonym for all intelligence gathering disciplines It is a specific form of human source intelligence HUMINT Codebreaking cryptanalysis or COMINT aircraft or satellite photography IMINT and analysis of publicly available data sources OSINT are all intelligence gathering disciplines but none of them is considered espionage Many HUMINT activities such as prisoner interrogation reports from military reconnaissance patrols and from diplomats etc are not considered espionage Espionage is the disclosure of sensitive information classified to people who are not cleared for that information or access to that sensitive information br Unlike other forms of intelligence collection disciplines espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge There are exceptions to physical meetings such as the Oslo Report or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people who bought his information br br The US defines espionage towards itself as the act of obtaining delivering transmitting communicating or receiving information about the national defence with an intent or reason to believe that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation Black s Law Dictionary defines espionage as gathering transmitting or losing information related to the national defense Espionage is a violation of United States law U S C and Article a of the Uniform Code of Military Justice The United States like most nations conducts espionage against other nations under the control of the National Clandestine Service Britain s espionage activities are controlled by the Secret Intelligence Service br br br Technology and techniques br br Source br br br Organization br br A spy is a person employed to seek out top secret information from a source Within the United States Intelligence Community asset is more common usage A case officer or Special Agent who may have diplomatic status i e official cover or non official cover supports and directs the human collector Cut outs are couriers who do not know the agent or case officer but transfer messages A safe house is a refuge for spies Spies often seek to obtain secret information from another source br In larger networks the organization can be complex with many methods to avoid detection including clandestine cell systems Often the players have never met Case officers are stationed in foreign countries to recruit and supervise intelligence agents who in turn spy on targets in the countries where they are assigned A spy need not be a citizen of the target country and hence does not automatically commit treason when operating within it While the more common practice is to recruit a person already trusted with access to sensitive information sometimes a person with a well prepared synthetic identity cover background called a legend in tradecraft may attempt to infiltrate a target organization br These agents can be moles who are recruited before they get access to secrets defectors who are recruited after they get access to secrets and leave their country or defectors in place who get access but do not leave br A legend is also employed for an individual who is not an illegal agent but is an ordinary citizen who is relocated for example a protected witness Nevertheless such a non agent very likely will also have a case officer who will act as a controller As in most if not all synthetic identity schemes for whatever purpose illegal or legal the assistance of a controller is required br Spies may also be used to spread disinformation in the organization in which they are planted such as giving false reports about their country s military movements or about a competing company s ability to bring a product to market Spies may be given other roles that also require infiltration such as sabotage br Many governments spy on their allies as well as their enemies although they typically maintain a policy of not commenting on this Governments also employ private companies to collect information on their behalf such as SCG International Risk International Intelligence Limited and others br Many organizations both national and non national conduct espionage operations It should not be assumed that espionage is always directed at the most secret operations of a target country National and terrorist organizations and other groups are also targeted This is because governments want to retrieve information that they can use to be proactive in protecting their nation from potential terrorist attacks br Communications both are necessary to espionage and clandestine operations and also a great vulnerability when the adversary has sophisticated SIGINT detection and interception capability Spies rely on COVCOM or covert communication through technically advanced spy devices Agents must also transfer money securely br br br Industrial espionage br br Reportedly Canada is losing billion and German companies are estimated to be losing about billion billion and jobs to industrial espionage every year br br br Agents in espionage br In espionage jargon an agent is the person who does the spying They may be a citizen of a country recruited by that country to spy on another a citizen of a country recruited by that country to carry out false flag assignments disrupting his own country a citizen of one country who is recruited by a second country to spy on or work against his own country or a third country and more br In popular usage this term is sometimes confused with an intelligence officer intelligence operative or case officer who recruits and handles agents br Among the most common forms of agent are br br Agent provocateur instigates trouble or provides information to gather as many people as possible into one location for an arrest br Intelligence agent provides access to sensitive information through the use of special privileges If used in corporate intelligence gathering this may include gathering information of a corporate business venture or stock portfolio In economic intelligence Economic Analysts may use their specialized skills to analyze and interpret economic trends and developments assess and track foreign financial activities and develop new econometric and modelling methodologies This may also include information of trade or tariff br Agent of influence provides political influence in an area of interest possibly including publications needed to further an intelligence service agenda The use of the media to print a story to mislead a foreign service into action exposing their operations while under surveillance br Double agent engages in clandestine activity for two intelligence or security services or more in joint operations who provides information about one or about each to the other and who wittingly withholds significant information from one on the instructions of the other or is unwittingly manipulated by one so that significant facts are withheld from the adversary Peddlers fabricators and others who work for themselves rather than a service are not double agents because they are not agents The fact that double agents have an agent relationship with both sides distinguishes them from penetrations who normally are placed with the target service in a staff or officer capacity br Redoubled agent forced to mislead the foreign intelligence service after being caught as a double agent br Unwitting double agent offers or is forced to recruit as a double or redoubled agent and in the process is recruited by either a third party intelligence service or his own government without the knowledge of the intended target intelligence service or the agent This can be useful in capturing important information from an agent that is attempting to seek allegiance with another country The double agent usually has knowledge of both intelligence services and can identify operational techniques of both thus making third party recruitment difficult or impossible The knowledge of operational techniques can also affect the relationship between the operations officer or case officer and the agent if the case is transferred by an operational targeting officer to a new operations officer leaving the new officer vulnerable to attack This type of transfer may occur when an officer has completed his term of service or when his cover is blown br Sleeper agent recruited to wake up and perform a specific set of tasks or functions while living undercover in an area of interest This type of agent is not the same as a deep cover operative who continually contacts a case officer to file intelligence reports A sleeper agent is not in contact with anyone until activated br Triple agent works for three intelligence services br Less common or lesser known forms of agent include br br Access agent provides access to other potential agents by providing offender profiling information that can help lead to recruitment into an intelligence service br Confusion agent provides misleading information to an enemy intelligence service or attempts to discredit the operations of the target in an operation br Facilities agent provides access to buildings such as garages or offices used for staging operations resupply etc br Illegal agent lives in another country under false credentials and does not report to a local station A nonofficial cover operative can be dubbed an illegal when working in another country without diplomatic protection br Principal agent functions as a handler for an established network of agents usually considered blue chip br br br Law br Espionage against a nation is a crime under the legal code of many nations In the United States it is covered by the Espionage Act of The risks of espionage vary A spy violating the host country s laws may be deported imprisoned or even executed A spy violating its own country s laws can be imprisoned for espionage or and treason which in the United States and some other jurisdictions can only occur if they take up arms or aids the enemy against their own country during wartime or even executed as the Rosenbergs were For example when Aldrich Ames handed a stack of dossiers of U S Central Intelligence Agency CIA agents in the Eastern Bloc to his KGB officer handler the KGB rolled up several networks and at least ten people were secretly shot When Ames was arrested by the U S Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI he faced life in prison his contact who had diplomatic immunity was declared persona non grata and taken to the airport Ames wife was threatened with life imprisonment if her husband did not cooperate he did and she was given a five year sentence Hugh Francis Redmond a CIA officer in China spent nineteen years in a Chinese prison for espionage and died there as he was operating without diplomatic cover and immunity br In United States law treason espionage and spying are separate crimes Treason and espionage have graduated punishment levels br The United States in World War I passed the Espionage Act of Over the years many spies such as the Soble spy ring Robert Lee Johnson the Rosenberg ring Aldrich Hazen Ames Robert Philip Hanssen Jonathan Pollard John Anthony Walker James Hall III and others have been prosecuted under this law br br br History of espionage laws br From ancient times the penalty for espionage in many countries was execution This was true right up until the era of World War II for example Josef Jakobs was a Nazi spy who parachuted into Great Britain in and was executed for espionage br In modern times many people convicted of espionage have been given penal sentences rather than execution For example Aldrich Hazen Ames is an American CIA analyst turned KGB mole who was convicted of espionage in he is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole in the high security Allenwood U S Penitentiary Ames was formerly a year CIA counterintelligence officer and analyst who committed espionage against his country by spying for the Soviet Union and Russia So far as it is known Ames compromised the second largest number of CIA agents second only to Robert Hanssen who also served a prison sentence until his death in br br br Use against non spies br Espionage laws are also used to prosecute non spies In the United States the Espionage Act of was used against socialist politician Eugene V Debs at that time the Act had much stricter guidelines and amongst other things banned speech against military recruiting The law was later used to suppress publication of periodicals for example of Father Coughlin in World War II In the early st century the act was used to prosecute whistleblowers such as Thomas Andrews Drake John Kiriakou and Edward Snowden as well as officials who communicated with journalists for innocuous reasons such as Stephen Jin Woo Kim br As of India and Pakistan were holding several hundred prisoners of each other s country for minor violations like trespass or visa overstay often with accusations of espionage attached Some of these include cases where Pakistan and India both deny citizenship to these people leaving them stateless The BBC reported in on one such case that of Mohammed Idrees who was held under Indian police control for approximately years for overstaying his day visa by days after seeing his ill parents in Much of the years were spent in prison waiting for a hearing and more time was spent homeless or living with generous families The Indian People s Union for Civil Liberties and Human Rights Law Network both decried his treatment The BBC attributed some of the problems to tensions caused by the Kashmir conflict br br br Espionage laws in the UK br Espionage is illegal in the UK under the Official Secrets Acts of and The UK law under this legislation considers espionage as concerning those who intend to help an enemy and deliberately harm the security of the nation According to MI a person commits the offence of spying if they for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the State approaches enters or inspects a prohibited area makes documents such as plans that are intended calculated or could directly or indirectly be of use to an enemy or obtains collects records or publishes or communicates to any other person any secret official code word or password or any sketch plan model article or note or other document which is calculated to be or might be or is intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy The illegality of espionage also includes any action which may be considered preparatory to spying or encouraging or aiding another to spy br Under the penal codes of the UK those found guilty of espionage are liable to imprisonment for a term of up to years although multiple sentences can be issued br br br Government intelligence laws and its distinction from espionage br Government intelligence is very much distinct from espionage and is not illegal in the UK providing that the organisations of individuals are registered often with the ICO and are acting within the restrictions of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act RIPA Intelligence is considered legally as information of all sorts gathered by a government or organisation to guide its decisions It includes information that may be both public and private obtained from much different public or secret sources It could consist entirely of information from either publicly available or secret sources or be a combination of the two br However espionage and intelligence can be linked According to the MI website foreign intelligence officers acting in the UK under diplomatic cover may enjoy immunity from prosecution Such persons can only be tried for spying or indeed any criminal offence if diplomatic immunity is waived beforehand Those officers operating without diplomatic cover have no such immunity from prosecution br There are also laws surrounding government and organisational intelligence and surveillance Generally the body involved should be issued with some form of warrant or permission from the government and should be enacting their procedures in the interest of protecting national security or the safety of public citizens Those carrying out intelligence missions should act within not only RIPA but also the Data Protection Act and Human Rights Act However there are spy equipment laws and legal requirements around intelligence methods that vary for each form of intelligence enacted br br br War br br In war espionage is considered permissible as many nations recognize the inevitability of opposing sides seeking intelligence each about the dispositions of the other To make the mission easier and successful combatants wear disguises to conceal their true identity from the enemy while penetrating enemy lines for intelligence gathering However if they are caught behind enemy lines in disguises they are not entitled to prisoner of war status and subject to prosecution and punishment including execution br The Hague Convention of addresses the status of wartime spies specifically within Laws and Customs of War on Land Hague IV October CHAPTER II Spies Article states that a person is considered a spy who acts clandestinely or on false pretences infiltrates enemy lines with the intention of acquiring intelligence about the enemy and communicate it to the belligerent during times of war Soldiers who penetrate enemy lines in proper uniforms for the purpose of acquiring intelligence are not considered spies but are lawful combatants entitled to be treated as prisoners of war upon capture by the enemy Article states that a spy captured behind enemy lines may only be punished following a trial However Article provides that if a spy successfully rejoined his own military and is then captured by the enemy as a lawful combatant he cannot be punished for his previous acts of espionage and must be treated as a prisoner of war This provision does not apply to citizens who committed treason against their own country or co belligerents of that country and may be captured and prosecuted at any place or any time regardless whether he rejoined the military to which he belongs or not or during or after the war br The ones that are excluded from being treated as spies while behind enemy lines are escaping prisoners of war and downed airmen as international law distinguishes between a disguised spy and a disguised escaper It is permissible for these groups to wear enemy uniforms or civilian clothes in order to facilitate their escape back to friendly lines so long as they do not attack enemy forces collect military intelligence or engage in similar military operations while so disguised Soldiers who are wearing enemy uniforms or civilian clothes simply for the sake of warmth along with other purposes rather than engaging in espionage or similar military operations while so attired are also excluded from being treated as unlawful combatants br Saboteurs are treated as spies as they too wear disguises behind enemy lines for the purpose of waging destruction on an enemy s vital targets in addition to intelligence gathering For example during World War II eight German agents entered the U S in June as part of Operation Pastorius a sabotage mission against U S economic targets Two weeks later all were arrested in civilian clothes by the FBI thanks to two German agents betraying the mission to the U S Under the Hague Convention of these Germans were classified as spies and tried by a military tribunal in Washington D C On August all eight were found guilty and sentenced to death Five days later six were executed by electric chair at the District of Columbia jail Two who had given evidence against the others had their sentences reduced by President Franklin D Roosevelt to prison terms In they were released by President Harry S Truman and deported to the American Zone of occupied Germany br The U S codification of enemy spies is Article of the Uniform Code of Military Justice This provides a mandatory death sentence if a person captured in the act is proven to be lurking as a spy or acting as a spy in or about any place vessel or aircraft within the control or jurisdiction of any of the armed forces or in or about any shipyard any manufacturing or industrial plant or any other place or institution engaged in work in aid of the prosecution of the war by the United States or elsewhere br br br Spy fiction br br Spies have long been favorite topics for novelists and filmmakers An early example of espionage literature is Kim by the English novelist Rudyard Kipling with a description of the training of an intelligence agent in the Great Game between the UK and Russia in th century Central Asia An even earlier work was James Fenimore Cooper s classic novel The Spy written in about an American spy in New York during the Revolutionary War br During the many th century spy scandals much information became publicly known about national spy agencies and dozens of real life secret agents These sensational stories piqued public interest in a profession largely off limits to human interest news reporting a natural consequence of the secrecy inherent in their work To fill in the blanks the popular conception of the secret agent has been formed largely by th and st century fiction and film Attractive and sociable real life agents such as Valerie Plame find little employment in serious fiction however The fictional secret agent is more often a loner sometimes amoral an existential hero operating outside the everyday constraints of society Loner spy personalities may have been a stereotype of convenience for authors who already knew how to write loner private investigator characters that sold well from the s to the present br Johnny Fedora achieved popularity as a fictional agent of early Cold War espionage but James Bond is the most commercially successful of the many spy characters created by intelligence insiders during that struggle Other fictional agents include Le Carr s George Smiley and Harry Palmer as played by Michael Caine br Jumping on the spy bandwagon other writers also started writing about spy fiction featuring female spies as protagonists such as The Baroness which has more graphic action and sex as compared to other novels featuring male protagonists br Spy fiction has permeated the video game world as well in games such as Perfect Dark GoldenEye No One Lives Forever and the Metal Gear series br Espionage has also made its way into comedy depictions The s TV series Get Smart the Finnish film Agent and the Deadly Curves and Johnny English film trilogy portrays an inept spy while the movie Spies Like Us depicts a pair of none too bright men sent to the Soviet Union to investigate a missile br The historical novel The Emperor and the Spy highlights the adventurous life of U S Colonel Sidney Forrester Mashbir who during the s and s attempted to prevent war with Japan and when war did erupt he became General MacArthur s top advisor in the Pacific Theater of World War Two br Black Widow is also a fictional agent who was introduced as a Russian spy an antagonist of the superhero Iron Man She later became an agent of the fictional spy agency S H I E L D and a member of the superhero team the Avengers br br br See also
