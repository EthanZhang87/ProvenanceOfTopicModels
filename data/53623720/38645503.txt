of IGN gave the film a six out of ten score saying It s not much but Despicable Me is at least enough for the younger fans of the franchise Peter Debruge of Variety wrote Despicable Me is unwieldy but it mostly works as co directors Pierre Coffin who also voices the Minions and Kyle Balda never lose sight of the film s emotional center packing the rest with as much humor as they can manage The jokes come so fast and furious the movie can hardly find room for Heitor Pereira s funky score and though Pharrell Williams has contributed five new songs to sell soundtracks including the sweet There
