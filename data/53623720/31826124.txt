wears off and the test ends a mishap launches the riders into the bomb transportation sector Gru questions what the riders are doing in the restricted area As bombs begin to explode around them Agnes loses her gift and the riders must chase after it Once Agnes recovers her present by barely avoiding a huge spiked crusher she starts floating into a huge oscillating fan Gru arrives and saves Agnes

Minion quiz to let them test themselves to see if they are fully prepared to be a Minion The Hollywood version has details to look more like Gru s house than the one in Florida br br br First pre show room Gru s living room br First the guests enter the room Then the pre show starts with Gru Margo Edith and Agnes who welcome the guests to their house through a remote camera and explain to them that they will be trained as minions Gru tells guests what to expect during their time as Minions Afterwards Gru orders the guests to proceed to his lab just as the camera battery runs out Then a voice tells the guests safety instructions Next the doors open to Gru s laboratory with Gru explaining what to do while the guests enter the lab the guests should stay in their row br br br Second pre show room Gru s laboratory br In this pre show room just before the ride Gru along with some Minions enter the room and explains the public are there for a reason henching for the world s supervillain Gru explains his newest scheme turning human beings into Minions using a new device called the Minion Gun created by Doctor Nefario Gru explains that there were a few snags in the initial Minionization test runs and that all of the errors are eradicated as far as the guests know Next the whole audience is given a routine body scan to make sure there are not any human germs in the lab by using high density lasers However the scan is cut short due to a critical error Gru becomes alarmed when the scan proves that some of the guests have not showered in like a week and he remarks on how gross that is Luckily for the audience Gru is in a bit of a time crunch and once he reminds the audience to shower once arriving back at their hotel and to not go straight to the pool he warns the rest of the audience that he will hit them with his fart gun if any of them are thinking of backing out of the process A spotlight shines on the gun which is mounted in the corner of the room The Minions cry and beg that Gru doesn t hit them with the gun However at that moment the girls show up and Gru tells the audience to ignore them br Agnes and Margo start to explain to the audience that they should not be scared of Gru by calling him just a big bald teddy bear Margo remarks that there is no way he will shoot you with a Fart Gun however she is proven to be wrong as Gru activates the Fart Gun causing it to spray out into the audience Everyone holds their breath but Edith states that it actually released a banana scent Upon hearing this the Minions go crazy and start banging on the windows much to Gru s dismay Afterwards Agnes wants to give a present to Gru He states that he would love to accept it but he needs her to wait explaining that he is really behind schedule and has to train the public who are on the verge of becoming Minions Margo eagerly asks Gru if the trio can assist him by training the guests Gru thinks for a moment but responds with I do not think so However as Edith starts begging Gru says that the training is very technical br It all becomes clear when Edith explains that their foster father has been reluctant for a while not wanting to accept his daughters willings When Margo and Edith finally explain to Gru that the Minion training is not like it s rocket science or even fourth grade science and that a trained monkey can do it he agrees irate calmly explaining to the audience that he will leave his daughters in charge of the training He leaves the room and wishes the guests luck in their training and at exactly the same time Agnes attempts to catch up with him to give him her anniversary gift of the girls adoption Edith however tells her that Gru already left which filled Agnes with sorrow causing her to realize that Gru may have forgotten the anniversary of their adoption Margo explains to her that he has not and that also they have an important job to do transforming the audience into Minions and training them for Gru s bidding Margo s determination to initiate the training causes Edith to be pumped up and say Let s do this After that the doors to the ride are opened the public is let through In Japan the guests wait in their rows until they are directed to their individual safety briefing rooms by a lab assistant br br br Safety video and final pre show room Japan only br Once the riders are ushered into their holding rooms the girls greet them and are amazed at how many people volunteered for Minion Training Edith worriedly remarks Woah Someone should tell them what happened to the last bunch Margo tells her to stop as Gru tells the guests that being a minion is serious business and if they make it through training in one piece they can do something fun like get ice cream or watch a movie Then he explains that because there was a high level of losses with previous recruits he is being forced to show them a safety video He hands it over to the girls who explain the safety rules including not to eat or drink secure all loose articles etc The Minions demonstrate these rules in a humorous manner as they re explained After the video ends Margo pleads for the audience to abide by the given rules Agnes tells the guests to enjoy their new life as Minions A recap of the rules is displayed on the screen as the guests are ushered into the garage boarding area br br br Ride br With a loud bang the ride vehicle springs to life shooting forward before rising up a huge tunnel Lights turn on to reveal a bunch of Minions cheering the guests on and waving to them as they rise At the top the vehicle arrives at a conveyor belt and is pushed forward towards a large set of doors Once the doors open riders see Gru s daughters on a hovercraft Japanese version only both American versions have the doors open revealing Gru s daughters zap the riders br Once Edith orders Kevin the Minion to zap the riders he pulls a lever which activates the Minion Gun transforming the riders into Minions Next the riders get pushed down a long tube to training by the girls Margo welcomes the guests to the Minion Training Grounds The vehicle dives down a ramp alongside other Minions and launches over a ramp and straight into a corkscrew As the vehicle slows down and returns to the upright position Margo instructs the guests stating that This is where we test your strength speed and ability to not die As the riders attempt to dodge the water sprayers mist is sprayed on the audience from the ceiling as the sprayers are fired The vehicle bounces off a trampoline and vaults onto a cactus crushing a Minion in the process Once they land they are forced to dodge giant fly swatters narrowly missing a few The vehicle then dives through a laser maze simulation only to get zapped at the end A Minion gets zapped too and its skin puffs up causing Agnes to scream He s so fluffy br The laser wears off and the vehicle brakes in front of a crowd of Minions holding Stop signs A huge boxing glove launches two Minions into a mattress seemingly knocking them unconscious and just when they think they re safe another boxing glove launches into the car sending two Minions flying alongside the vehicle as it is launched backwards landing on a trapdoor that opens and sends the car down a pit knocking over other Minions and coming to an abrupt stop at a chasm This is where the girls put the recruits problem solving and teamwork skills to the test the latter are forced to create a huge human hand like Minion chain to get across the other side However once Edith uses a huge banana as bait the Minions get distracted by it They erratically reach for the banana jumping into the vehicle to grab it which causes the Minion chain to break apart and the riders to unintentionally plummet down a long hole to the bomb transportation sector which is a restricted area Gru appears on a screen questioning what the riders are doing in the restricted area br The cart brakes at another chasm where Margo states that we ve gotta get you out of here panicked Suddenly the worst happens a bomb drops from a claw holder and explodes far below starting a chain reaction which causes other bombs to explode in the bomb transportation room when the girls get startled by the explosions Agnes loses her gift and the guests attempt to retrieve it by plummeting into the abyss and dodging the bombs The vehicle lands on a set of moving cogs and the car narrowly misses a set of two buzzsaws Agnes grabs the gift but her celebration is cut short when a gust of wind shoots up from below sending the gift and the vehicle flying into the air hanging off a girder suspended in mid air The gift rolls off the girder and falls down with Agnes barely catching it However the vehicle lunges down into the conveyor belt below and causes multiple missiles to launch with Kevin the Minion riding one into the sky Gru arrives attempting to catch the riders but a crowd of Minions send him rolling backwards on a missile He falls into a vat of radioactive acid only to be nearly saved by grabbing onto the hovering vehicle that Margo Edith and Agnes are riding However as Agnes is about to give her present to Gru he gets unexpectedly knocked off the vehicle by a huge mallet unseen He bounces off various objects before landing on a spring platform The girls continue and fly out of harm s way but as Gru remarks that he is okay the platform activates and launches him upwards As he falls back down he gets hit by the mallet again and launched straight at the riders The vehicle is pushed back past Kevin who is still riding the rocket and screaming and launches into the machine the girls are riding in They get pushed off their vehicle and into another sector of the lab Agnes grabs her gift as everything around them starts floating making Margo realize that they are in the anti gravity recycling room br To make matters worse a huge robot arm rises from under and pushes the girls up towards a set of crushers When this happens Margo warns her younger siblings to just hold on to the robot arm A large tremor causes the girls to grab hold of the arm This shocks Agnes and causes her to let go of her gift sending it floating into the crushers above She panics and frees herself from Margo s grip to retrieve the gift much to Margo s concern As she attempts to float off to recover the gift the riders narrowly avoid a bomb and the crushers However once Agnes recovers her present by barely avoiding a huge spiked crusher she starts floating into a huge oscillating fan when all of a sudden Gru arrives blocking the crushers with a steel beam and saving Agnes Seeing each other Gru and Agnes hug when suddenly the crushers start moving again leaving Gru no choice but to summon all of his strength to stop the huge crusher just in time saving all of them including himself from being smashed Because of Gru s strength and pressure that he used to both save Agnes and stop the huge crusher the anti gravity recycling room s power goes down and the riders along with Gru and his daughters plummet towards the ground and land safely on a crowd of Minions br Once both the Gru residence and the guests land safely on the Minions Gru opens Agnes present revealing a doll replica of himself Despite it being a little squashed and burnt Gru finds it absolutely perfect and gives his daughters a hug also gifting the trio with a little something an amusement park like anniversary party asking if they really thought he would forget the most important day of his life the day he adopted his girls Once the huge doors open to the party the riders follow the Gru residence now riding on a hovering vehicle through the party The vehicle plummets down a rollercoaster and crashes into the car ahead of them They dodge various rides and decorations knocking over a Minion and launching into the stage Once there Gru congratulates the guests of being successful in their training However Kevin arrives riding the stray rocket from earlier It is launched at the Minion Gun right next to Gru however the gun breaks and goes off on the riders causing the effects to be reversed transforming the guests into humans again Once this happens Gru gets disappointed realizing the riders are human again and he orders someone off screen for the next troop This is where the ride ends in Orlando Hollywood and Beijing as the doors from the start close The vehicle is pushed backwards and slowly lowers down through the same hole they came up through Rainbow colored mist is sprayed which covers the vehicle as it reaches the bottom and the ride ends Once the vehicle s doors open guests exit the lab br br br Gift shop br In May the ride s gift shop Super Silly Stuff opened at Universal Studios Florida
