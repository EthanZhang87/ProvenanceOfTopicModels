Dracula and thick Hungarian accent greatly limited the roles offered to him and he unsuccessfully tried for years to avoid typecasting br He co starred in a number of films with Boris Karloff who was able to demand top billing To his frustration Lugosi a charter member of the American Screen Actors Guild was increasingly restricted to mad scientist roles because of his inability to speak English more clearly He was kept employed by the studios principally so that they could put his name on the posters Among his teamings with Karloff he performed major roles only in The Black Cat The Raven and Son of Frankenstein even in The Raven Karloff received top billing despite Lugosi performing the lead role br By this time Lugosi had been receiving regular medication for sciatic neuritis and he

With fellow expatriate Hungarian actors he formed a small stock company that toured Eastern cities playing for immigrant audiences Lugosi acted in several Hungarian language plays before starring in his first English Broadway play The Red Poppy in Three more parts came in including a five month run in the comedy fantasy The Devil in the Cheese In he played an Arab Sheik in Arabesque which premiered in Buffalo New York at the Teck Theatre before moving to Broadway br His first American film role was in the silent melodrama The Silent Command which was filmed in New York Four other silent roles followed villains and continental types all in productions made in the New York area A rumor has circulated for decades among film historians that Lugosi played an uncredited bit part as a clown in the Lon Chaney Hollywood film He Who Gets Slapped but this has been heavily disputed The rumor originated from the discovery of a publicity still from this film found posthumously in Lugosi s scrapbook which showed an unidentified clown in heavy makeup standing near Lon Chaney in one scene It was thought to be evidence that Lugosi appeared in the film but historians all agree that is very unlikely since Lugosi was in both Chicago appearing in a play called The Werewolf and New York at the time that film was being made in Hollywood br br br Dracula br br Lugosi was approached in the summer of to star in a Broadway theatre production of Dracula which had been adapted by Hamilton Deane and John L Balderston from Bram Stoker s novel The Horace Liveright production was successful running in New York City for performances before touring the United States to much fanfare and critical acclaim throughout and In Lugosi decided to stay in California when the play ended its first West Coast run His performance had piqued the interest of Fox Film and he was cast in the Hollywood studio s silent film The Veiled Woman He also appeared in the film Prisoners also believed lost which was released in both a silent and partial talkie version br br In with no other film roles in sight he returned to the stage as Dracula for a short West Coast tour of the play Lugosi remained in California where he resumed his film work under contract with Fox appearing in early talkies often as a heavy or an exotic sheik He also continued to lobby for his prized role in the film version of Dracula br Despite his critically acclaimed performance on stage Lugosi was not Universal Pictures first choice for the role of Dracula when the company optioned the rights to the Deane play and began production in Different prominent actors such as Paul Muni Chester Morris Ian Keith John Wray Joseph Schildkraut Arthur Edmund Carewe William Courtenay John Carradine and Conrad Veidt were considered Lew Ayres was eventually hired to play Jonathan Harker only to be replaced by Robert Ames after being cast in a different role in a different Universal Pictures film Ames was in turn replaced with David Manners Lugosi had played the role on Broadway and was considered before director Tod Browning cast him in the role The film was a major hit but Lugosi was paid a salary of only since he had too eagerly accepted the role br br br Typecasting br br Through his association with Dracula in which he appeared with minimal makeup using his natural heavily accented voice Lugosi found himself typecast as a horror villain in films such as Murders in the Rue Morgue The Black Cat and The Raven for Universal and the independent White Zombie His accent while a part of his image limited the type of role he could play br Lugosi did attempt to break type by auditioning for other roles He lost out to Lionel Barrymore for the role of Grigori Rasputin in Rasputin and the Empress also C Henry Gordon for the role of Surat Khan in Charge of the Light Brigade and Basil Rathbone for the role of Commissar Dimitri Gorotchenko in Tovarich a role Lugosi had played on stage He played the elegant somewhat hot tempered General Nicholas Strenovsky Petronovich in International House br Regardless of controversy five films at Universal The Black Cat The Raven The Invisible Ray Son of Frankenstein Black Friday plus minor cameo performances in Gift of Gab and two at RKO Pictures You ll Find Out and The Body Snatcher paired Lugosi with Boris Karloff Despite the relative size of their roles Lugosi inevitably received second billing below Karloff There are contradictory reports of Lugosi s attitude toward Karloff some claiming that he was openly resentful of Karloff s long term success and ability to gain good roles beyond the horror arena while others suggested the two actors were for a time at least amicable Karloff himself in interviews suggested that Lugosi was initially mistrustful of him when they acted together believing that the Englishman would attempt to upstage him When this proved not to be the case according to Karloff Lugosi settled down and they worked together amicably though some have further commented that the English Karloff s on set demand to break from filming for mid afternoon tea annoyed Lugosi Lugosi did get a few heroic leads as in Universal s The Black Cat after Karloff had been accorded the more colorful role of the villain The Invisible Ray and a romantic role in producer Sol Lesser s adventure serial The Return of Chandu but his typecasting problem appears to have been too entrenched to be alleviated by those films br Lugosi addressed his plea to be cast in non horror roles directly to casting directors through his listing in the Players Directory published by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in which he or his agent calls the idea that he is only fit for horror films an error br br br Career decline br br Lugosi developed severe chronic sciatica ostensibly aggravated by injuries received during his military service Though at first he was treated with benign pain remedies such as asparagus juice doctors increased the medication to opiates The growth of his dependence on opiates particularly morphine and after when it became available in America methadone was directly proportional to the dwindling of Lugosi s screen offers The problem first manifested itself in when Lugosi was forced to withdraw from a leading role in a serial production The Secret of Treasure Island due to constant back pain br Historian John McElwee reports in his book Showmen Sell It Hot that Bela Lugosi s popularity received a much needed boost in August when California theater owner Emil Umann revived Dracula and Frankenstein as a special double feature The combination was so successful that Umann scheduled extra shows to accommodate the capacity crowds and invited Lugosi to appear in person which thrilled new audiences that had never seen Lugosi s classic performance I owe it all to that little man at the Regina Theatre said Lugosi of exhibitor Umann I was dead and he brought me back to life Universal took notice of the tremendous business and launched its own national re release of the same two horror favorites The studio then rehired Lugosi to star in new films fortunately just as Lugosi s fourth wife had given birth to a son br br Universal cast Lugosi in Son of Frankenstein appearing in the character role of Ygor a mad blacksmith with a broken neck in heavy makeup and beard Lugosi was third billed with his name above the title alongside Basil Rathbone as Dr Frankenstein s son and Boris Karloff reprising his role as Frankenstein s monster Regarding Son of Frankenstein the film s director Rowland V Lee said his crew let Lugosi work on the characterization the interpretation he gave us was imaginative and totally unexpected when we finished shooting there was no doubt in anyone s mind that he stole the show Karloff s monster was weak by comparison br The same year saw Lugosi making a rare appearance in an A list motion picture he was a stern Soviet commissar in the Metro Goldwyn Mayer romantic comedy Ninotchka starring Greta Garbo and directed by Ernst Lubitsch Lugosi was quite effective in this small but prestigious character part and even received top billing among the film s supporting cast all of whom had significantly larger roles It might have been a turning point for the actor but within the year he was back on Hollywood s Poverty Row playing leads for Sam Katzman These horror comedy and mystery B films were mostly released by Monogram Pictures At Universal he often received star billing for what amounted to a supporting part br br Lugosi went to th Century Fox for The Gorilla which had him playing straight man a butler to Patsy Kelly and the Ritz Brothers When Lugosi s Black Friday premiered in on a double bill with the Vincent Price film The House of the Seven Gables Lugosi and Price both appeared in person at the Chicago Theatre where it opened on Feb and remained for four performances He was finally cast in the role of Frankenstein s monster for Universal s Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man At the end of the previous film in the series The Ghost of Frankenstein Lugosi s voice had been dubbed over that of Lon Chaney Jr since Ygor s brain was now in the Monster s skull But at the last minute Lugosi s heavily accented dialogue was edited out after the film was completed along with the idea of the Monster being blind leaving his performance featuring groping outstretched arms and moving lips seeming enigmatic and funny to audiences br Lugosi kept busy during the s as a screen menace In addition to his nine Monogram features he worked in three features for RKO and one for Columbia The Return of the Vampire He also accepted the lead in an experimental economical feature shot in the semi professional mm film format and blown up to mm for theatrical release Scared to Death produced in but not released until The feature is noteworthy as being Bela Lugosi s only color film br Lugosi played Dracula for a second and final time on film in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein which was his last A movie For the remainder of his life he appeared less and less frequently in obscure forgettable low budget B features From to he performed in summer stock often in productions of Dracula or Arsenic and Old Lace and during the rest of the year made personal appearances in a touring spook show and on early commercial television br In September Milton Berle invited Lugosi to appear in a sketch on Texaco Star Theatre Lugosi memorized the script for the skit but became confused on the air when Berle began to ad lib He also appeared on the anthology series Suspense on October in a live adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe s The Cask of Amontillado br In while in England to play a six month tour of Dracula Lugosi co starred in a lowbrow film comedy Mother Riley Meets the Vampire also known as Vampire Over London and My Son the Vampire released the following year Following his return to the United States he was interviewed for television and reflected wistfully on his typecasting in horror parts Now I am the boogie man In the same interview he expressed a desire to play more comedy as he had in the Mother Riley farce Independent producer Jack Broder took Lugosi at his word casting him in a jungle themed comedy Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla starring nightclub comedians Duke Mitchell and Jerry Lewis look alike Sammy Petrillo whose act closely resembled that of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis Martin and Lewis Hal B Wallis Martin and Lewis s producer unsuccessfully sued Broder br br br Stage and personal appearances br Lugosi enjoyed a lively career on stage with plenty of personal appearances As film offers declined he became more and more dependent on live venues to support his family Lugosi took over the role of Jonathan Brewster from Boris Karloff for Arsenic and Old Lace Lugosi had also expressed interest in playing Elwood P Dowd in Harvey to help himself professionally He also made plenty of personal live appearances to promote his horror image or an accompanying film br The Vincent Price film House of Wax premiered in Los Angeles at the Paramount Theatre on April The film played at midnight with a number of celebrities in the audience that night Judy Garland Ginger Rogers Rock Hudson Broderick Crawford Gracie Allen Eddie Cantor Shelley Winters and others Producer Alex Gordon knowing Lugosi was in dire need of cash arranged for the actor to stand outside the theater wearing a cape and dark glasses holding a man costumed as a gorilla on a leash He later allowed himself to be photographed drinking a glass of milk at a Red Cross booth there When Lugosi playfully attempted to bite the nurse in attendance she overreacted and spilled a glass of milk all over his shirt and cape Afterward Lugosi was interviewed by a reporter who botched the interview by asking the prearranged questions out of order thoroughly confusing the aging star Embarrassed Lugosi left abruptly without attending the screening br br br Ed Wood and final projects br br Late in his life Bela Lugosi again received star billing in films when the ambitious but financially limited filmmaker Ed Wood a fan of Lugosi found him living in obscurity and near poverty and offered him roles in his films such as an anonymous narrator in Glen or Glenda and a mad scientist in Bride of the Monster During post production of the latter Lugosi decided to seek treatment for his drug addiction and the film s premiere was arranged to raise money for Lugosi s hospital expenses resulting in a paltry amount of money According to Kitty Kelley s biography of Frank Sinatra when the entertainer heard of Lugosi s problems he visited Lugosi at the hospital and gave him a check Sinatra would recall Lugosi s amazement at his visit since the two men had never met before br During an impromptu interview upon his release from the treatment center in Lugosi stated that he was about to begin work on a new Ed Wood film called The Ghoul Goes West This was one of several projects proposed by Wood including The Phantom Ghoul and Dr Acula With Lugosi in his Dracula cape Wood shot impromptu test footage with no particular storyline in mind in front of Tor Johnson s home at a suburban graveyard and in front of Lugosi s apartment building on Carlton Way This footage ended up posthumously in Wood s Plan from Outer Space which was filmed in soon after Lugosi died Wood hired Tom Mason his wife s chiropractor to double for Lugosi in additional shots Mason was noticeably taller and thinner than Lugosi and had the lower half of his face covered with his cape in every shot as Lugosi sometimes did in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein br Following his treatment Lugosi made one final film in late The Black Sleep for Bel Air Pictures which was released in the summer of through United Artists with a promotional campaign that included several personal appearances by Lugosi and his co stars as well as Maila Nurmi TV s horror host Vampira To Lugosi s disappointment however his role in this film was that of a mute butler with no dialogue Lugosi was intoxicated and very ill during the film s promotional campaign and had to return to L A earlier than planned He never got to see the finished film Tor Johnson said in interviews that Lugosi kept screaming that he wanted to die the night they shared a hotel room together br In a British film called Lock Up Your Daughters was theatrically released in the U K composed of clips from Bela Lugosi s Monogram pictures from the s The film is lost today but a March critical review in the Kinematograph Weekly mentioned that the movie contained new Lugosi footage intriguing since Lugosi had died in Back in however Lugosi had appeared on a one hour TV program called Murder and Bela Lugosi which WPIX TV broadcast on Sept in which Lugosi was interviewed and provided commentary about a number of his old horror films while clips from the films were
