Guillon who was the art director and final designer of the Minions and they took some of those ideas and together we came up with what the Minions look like The more the filmmakers worked on the little guys the more yellow and more cylindrical they became Eric continued to refine the idea and made the Minions closer to children He made them funnier and simpler and a brighter color Among the
