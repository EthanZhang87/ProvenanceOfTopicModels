Anti Russian sentiment or Russophobia is dislike or fear or hatred of Russia Russian people Russian culture or Russian policy The Collins English Dictionary defines it as intense and often irrational hatred of Russia The opposite of Russophobia is Russophilia br Historically Russophobia has included state sponsored and grassroots mistreatment and discrimination as well as propaganda containing anti Russian sentiment In Europe Russophobia was based on various more or less fantastic fears of Russian conquest of Europe such as those based on The Will of Peter the Great forgery documented in France in the th century and later resurfacing in Britain as a result of fears of a Russian attack on British colonized India in relation to the Great Game Pre existing anti Russian sentiment in Germany is considered to be one of the factors influencing treatment of Russian population under German occupation during World War II br Nowadays a variety of popular culture clich s and negative stereotypes about Russians still exist notably in the Western world Some individuals may have prejudice or hatred against Russians due to history racism propaganda or ingrained stereotypes br Negative views of Russia are widespread but most prevalent in Western liberal democracies br Some analysts have argued that official Western rhetoric and journalism about Russian actions abroad have contributed to the resurgence of anti Russian sentiment besides disapproval of the Second Chechen War Russian reaction to NATO expansion the Russo Georgian war and Russian interference in the United States election br Anti Russian sentiment worsened considerably after the Russian actions in Ukraine in br By the summer of majority of Western nations had unfavorable views of Russia br Academic and former US Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul spoke about combatting Russophobia appealing to US officials and journalists to cease demonizing Russian people criticizing propagation of stereotypes about Russians Russian culture and Russian national proclivities br Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine Russian speaking immigrants experienced harassment open hostility and discrimination br Some researchers have described use of Russophobia narratives to be a tactic used by Vladimir Putin These narratives emphasizes the belief that Russia faces an existential threat from the Western powers and must take drastic measures to ensure domestic stability including support for the ongoing war in Ukraine Such narratives have been described as Russian imperialism br br br History br br br th and th centuries br br On October the French Directory received a document from a Polish general Micha Sokolnicki entitled Aper u sur la Russie This forgery is known as the so called The Will of Peter the Great and was first published in October during the Napoleonic wars in Charles Louis Lesur s much read Des progr s de la puissance russe this was at the behest of Napoleon I who ordered a series of articles to be published showing that Europe is inevitably in the process of becoming booty for Russia Subsequent to the Napoleonic wars propaganda against Russia was continued by Napoleon s former confessor Dominique Georges Fr d ric de Pradt who in a series of books portrayed Russia as a power grasping barbaric power hungry to conquer Europe With reference to Russia s new constitutional laws in the Savoyard philosopher Joseph de Maistre wrote the now famous statement Every nation gets the government it deserves Toute nation a le gouvernement qu elle m rite br Beginning from and lasting roughly until British commentators began criticizing the perceived conservatism of the Russian state and its resistance to reform efforts In The Westminster Review attributed growth of British navy to Ministers that are smitten with the epidemic disease of Russo phobia However Russophobia in Britain for the rest of the th century was primarily related to British fears that the Russian conquest of Central Asia was a precursor to an attack on British colonized India These fears led to the Great Game a series of political and diplomatic confrontations between Britain and Russia during the late th and early th centuries br In the Marquis de Custine published his hugely successful page four volume travelogue La Russie en Custine s scathing narrative reran what were by now clich s which presented Russia as a place where the veneer of European civilization was too thin to be credible Such was its huge success that several official and pirated editions quickly followed as well as condensed versions and translations in German Dutch and English By approximately thousand copies had been sold br In Fyodor Tyutchev a Russian poet diplomat and member of His Imperial Majesty s Own Chancellery introduced the actual term of russophobia in a letter to his daughter Anna Aksakova on September where he applied it to a number of pro Western Russian liberals who pretending that they were merely following their liberal principles developed a negative attitude towards their own country and always stood on a pro Western and anti Russian position regardless of any changes in the Russian society and having a blind eye on any violations of these principles in the West violations in the sphere of justice morality and even civilization He put the emphasis on the irrationality of this sentiment Tyutchev saw Western anti Russian sentiment as the result of misunderstanding caused by civilizational differences between East and West br br br German atrocities in World War II br br Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party regarded Slavic peoples especially Poles and East Slavs as non Aryan Untermenschen subhumans As early as Hitler suggested in Mein Kampf that the German people needed Lebensraum living space to achieve German expansion eastwards Drang nach Osten at the expense of the inferior Slavs Hitler believed that the organization of a Russian state formation was not the result of the political abilities of the Slavs in Russia but only a wonderful example of the state forming efficacity of the German element in an inferior race br After the invasion of the Soviet Union Hitler expressed his plans for the Slavs br br As for the ridiculous hundred million Slavs we will mold the best of them as we see fit and we will isolate the rest of them in their pig styes and anyone who talks about cherishing the local inhabitants and civilizing them goes straight off into a concentration camp br Plans to eliminate Russians and other Slavs from Soviet territory to allow German settlement included starvation American historian Timothy D Snyder maintains that there were million victims of the German Hunger Plan in the Soviet Union largely Russians Belarusians and Ukrainians including million Soviet POWs and million civilian deaths in the Siege of Leningrad According to Snyder Hitler intended eventually to exterminate up to million Slavs by planned famine as part of Generalplan Ost br Influenced by the guidelines in a directive sent out to the troops under his command General Erich Hoepner of the th Panzer Army stated br br The war against Russia is an important chapter in the German nation s struggle for existence It is the old battle of the Germanic against the Slavic people of the defense of European culture against Muscovite Asiatic inundation and the repulse of Jewish Bolshevism The objective of this battle must be the demolition of present day Russia and must therefore be conducted with unprecedented severity Every military action must be guided in planning and execution by an iron resolution to exterminate the enemy remorselessly and totally In particular no adherents of the contemporary Russian Bolshevik system are to be spared br br br Cold War br br An extreme interpretation of George F Kennan s X Article was exploited by American politicians in the Cold War to advance aggressive containment policy towards Russia in spite of Kennan later denouncing this interpretation Russophobic stereotypes of an illiberal tradition were also favored by Cold War historiographers even as scholars of early Russia debunked such essentialist notions br Widely criticized for being antisemitic and extremist nationalistic Igor Shafarevich s work Russophobia blamed Jews seeking world rule for alleged vast conspiracy against Russia and all mankind and seeking destruction of Russia through adoption of a Western style democracy br br br After br br Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in and the collapse of Communism anti Russian sentiment in the United States was at an all time low However it has experienced a resurgence during the late s due to Russia s opposition to the enlargement of NATO According to a Gallup poll of surveyed Americans viewed Russia negatively in compared to in br Anatol Lieven considered the Western commentary on the Second Chechen War and a Russian reaction to eastward NATO expansion to be the main cause of growing Russophobia in the s Condemning the brutality of the Russian army and an exaggerated fear of NATO he argued that the influence of the Cold War elites and ethnic lobbies coupled with th century stereotypes about Russian expansionism led Western journalists and intellectuals to drop professional standards and engage in propaganda spreading Russophobia and national hatred In April David Johnson founder of the Johnson s Russia List said in interview to the Moscow News I am sympathetic to the view that these days Putin and Russia are perhaps getting too dark a portrayal in most Western media Or at least that critical views need to be supplemented with other kinds of information and analysis An openness to different views is still warranted California based international relations scholar Andrei Tsygankov has remarked that anti Russian political rhetoric coming from Washington circles has received wide echo in American mainstream media asserting that Russophobia s revival is indicative of the fear shared by some U S and European politicians that their grand plans to control the world s most precious resources and geostrategic sites may not succeed if Russia s economic and political recovery continues In contrast Krystyna Kurczab Redlich and some other reporters active in Chechnya alarmed already in early s that Putin s true nature and intentions have been exposed by the Russian atrocities during the Second Chechen War as by no means resembling those of a Western democrat It was however convenient for the Western elites to brand these reports as Russophobic and disregard them in spite of such reports being delivered also by Anna Politkovskaya a Russian journalist and human rights activist later assassinated The first among these views has ultimately suffered utter discreditation in a humiliating manner after primarily because it was inherently flawed as it focused exclusively on the fantastic motivations behind anti Russian sentiment in Western Europe while entirely disregarding the precisely specified reasons of negative views of Russia in Central and Eastern Europe which stem in turn from real experience and knowledge br In October the International Gallup Organization announced that according to its poll anti Russia sentiment remained fairly strong throughout Europe and the West in general It found that Russia was the least popular G country globally Overall the percentage of respondents with a positive view of Russia was only br Anti Russian sentiment in the United States and Western European countries decreased during the presidency of Dmitry Medvedev with about half of respondents in US UK Germany Spain and France having positive views of Russia in It began to deteriorate again after The Transatlantic Trends Report indicated that views of Russia turned from favorable to unfavorable on both sides of the Atlantic noting that most Americans and Europeans as well as many Russians said that they were not confident that the election results expressed the will of voters br Attitudes towards Russia in most countries worsened considerably following Russia s annexation of Crimea the subsequent fomenting of the pro Russian unrest in Ukraine and its intervention in the resulting War in Donbas From to the median negative attitudes in Europe rose from to and from to in the United States Negative attitudes also rose compared to throughout the Middle East Latin America Asia and Africa br According to political scientist Peter Schulze the accusations of collusion with Trump campaign coupled with the criminal case of Lisa F which was reported in Germany as an instance of Russia s hybrid war sparked fears that the Kremlin could meddle in German campaigns as well resulting in growth of anti Russian sentiment in Germany after br By the summer of majority of Western nations had unfavorable views of Russia with an exception of Italy which was attributed by Pew Research Center to a delivery of medical aid by Moscow early during the pandemic br of Americans polled by Gallup between and February had unfavorable view of Russia br br br Russian invasion of Ukraine br There was a sharp uptick in manifestations of anti Russian sentiment after the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine following the start of the invasion anti Russian sentiment soared across the Western world Since the invasion commenced ethnic Russians and Russian speaking immigrants from post Soviet states are globally reporting rising instances of open hostility and discrimination towards them This hostility is not just towards Russian people it has also been seen directed towards businesses as well br A pervasive climate of distrust towards Russian passport holders in Europe and rejections of bank account applications because of nationality were reported br United Kingdom limited how much Russian nationals are allowed to save on bank accounts The banking industry considered the restriction to violate UK equality laws which forbid discrimination by nationality br Leonid Gozman called European restrictions discriminatory and said that they harmed dissidents who were forced to leave Russia leaving them without means to survive br Outrage was caused by pro war demonstrations held in Athens Berlin Dublin Hanover Frankfurt and Limassol consisting of vehicles emblazoned with the pro war Z symbol and marches attended by hundreds of flag waving nationalists Experts surveyed by The Times said that the rallies were likely coordinated by the Kremlin via the soft power Rossotrudnichestvo agency stressing that a bottom up element of support for Russia also exists br By the most negative perception of Russia was in Ukraine net negative followed by Portugal with Japan with and Poland with according to the Democracy Perception Index br Researchers describe the present use of the term Russophobia by the Russian government to a political strategy that implies that other countries are enemies of Russia building up an image of Russophobic countries is a tool for shaping the neo imperial political identity of Russia s citizens of mobilising them in the face of real or alleged threats and of restoring psychological comfort to them in the face of the failure of the Kremlin s actions as in Ukraine br See As a polemic device below br br br By country br br br Within Russia br br br Northern Caucasus br br In a Chechen man Goychaev was sentenced to death for murder rape and robbery His sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment According to information from prosecutors Goychaev s gang targeted Russians and murdered in Chervlyonnaya Shelkovskoy District Republic of Chechnya between and Goyachev was charged with genocide however the court did not find him guilty of genocide because genocide was understood to be a crime against the peace and safety of humanity Russian NTV channel journalist Yelena Masyuk who was captured by Chechens said in that she had not seen any signs of ethnic cleansing in Chechnya that had been rumoured br br br As a polemic device br The Kremlin and its supporters are sometimes criticised for using allegations of Russophobia as a form of propaganda to counter criticism of government policy Sources critical of the Russian government claim that it is Russian state owned media and administration who attempt to discredit the neutral criticism by generalizing it into indiscriminate accusations of the whole Russian population or Russophobia In poet and essayist Lev Rubinstein wrote that similarly to the term fascism the term Russophobia has become a political sticker slapped onto people who disagree with words or actions of people or organizations who position themselves as Russian ones in the ideological rather than an ethnic or geographical sense br Russian responses to outside anti Russian criticism has intensified the growth of contemporary Russian nationalist ideology which in many ways mirrors its predecessor Soviet nationalism Sociologist Anatoly Khazanov states that there s a national patriotic movement which believes that there s a clash of civilizations a global struggle between the materialistic individualistic consumerist cosmopolitan corrupt and decadent West led by the United States and the idealist collectivist morally and spiritually superior Eurasia led by Russia In their view the United States wants to break up Russia and turn it into a source of raw materials The West being accused of Russophobia is a major part of their beliefs br Joseph Stiglitz wrote that these attitudes are reinforced by the failure of the post Soviet liberal economic reforms which are perceived to have been influenced by the US Treasury A mismatch between U S rhetoric about promoting democratic reforms in Russia and actual U S actions and policy has been said to cause deep resentment among Russians helping Russian propaganda to construct a narrative of U S malign interference br Since the annexation of Crimea and subsequent sanctions there was a rapid growth of charges of Russophobia in the official discourse Use of the term on the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website rose dramatically during the period between and Russian President Vladimir Putin compared Russophobia to antisemitism Academic Jade McGlynn considered conflation of modern Russophobia and Nazi antisemitism to be a part of propaganda strategy that uses historical framing to create a flattering narrative that the Russo Ukrainian War is a restaging of the Great Patriotic War Kathryn Stoner and Michael McFaul explained the turn to radical nationalism as a strategy to preserve the regime within domestic economical and political pressures claiming that To maintain his argument for legitimacy at home Putin needs constant confrontation that supports the narrative that Russia is under siege from the West that Russia is at war with the United States br A Russian political scientist and a senior visiting fellow at the George Washington University Institute for European Russian and Eurasian Studies Maria Lipman said that this narrative was made more convincing by imposing sanctions on Russia and supporting Ukraine with weapons as well as by statements about weakening Russia made by American establishment amplified on Russian television br The Washington Post reported effectiveness of using the label of Russophobia by Russian propaganda to sustain support for the invasion of Ukraine by presenting it as an existential confrontation with the West According to an independent polling agency people explain that a significant part of the world is against us and it s only Putin who hopes to hold onto Russia otherwise we would be eaten up completely To them it is Russia that is defending itself br br br South Caucasus br br br Armenia br br After Nicholas II intensified russification policies and did not provide significant opposition to the Ottoman Empire s massacres against Armenians anti Russian sentiment among Armenian nationalist groups rose After the Russian government confiscated Armenian Church lands in this led to attacks on Russian authorities and Armenians who cooperated with them by Armenians mobilised by the ARF party br In July during the Karabakh movement the killing of an Armenian man and the injury of tens of others by the Soviet army in a violent clash at Zvartnots Airport near Yerevan sparked anti Russian and anti Soviet demonstrations In relations between Armenia and Russia were strained after the massacre of an Armenian family of in Gyumri by a Russian serviceman stationed at the Russian base there br Relations between Armenia and Russia have worsened in recent years due to Russia s refusal to help Armenia in the Nagorno Karabakh war and the September Armenia Azerbaijan clashes as well as due to statements perceived to be anti Armenian made by figures close to Russian President Vladimir Putin This has resulted in anti Russian sentiment rising sharply in the country br br br Azerbaijan br br The Black January massacre prior to Azerbaijani independence and Russia s complicated role in the First Nagorno Karabakh War between Azerbaijan and Armenia increased the negative perception of Russia Under Abulfaz Elchibey s presidency in relations between Russia and Azerbaijan were damaged due to his anti Russian policies however under Ilham Aliyev relations instead improved br br br Georgia br br There has been increased animosity towards Russians in Tbilisi after the Russian invasion of Ukraine which has also been directed towards exiled Russians who recently fled their home country It has included signs from businesses and posts from Airbnb hosts declaring Russians not welcome anti Russian graffiti found on many central streets the famous Bassiani nightclub banning anyone with a Russian passport and an online petition signed by thousands of locals demanding tougher immigration rules for Russians br Accordingly in March a strong majority of of respondents to a Georgian poll said Russia is the enemy of Georgia a sharp uptick compared with a decade earlier According to a poll of Georgians perceived Russia as Georgia s biggest enemy Furthermore in a February poll a majority of said Russia is Georgia s biggest political and economic threat as opposed to of those who looked at Russia as the most important partner for Georgia In November preferred closer ties with Russia while abandoning western ties and wanted to deepen ties with Russia br The root of the Georgian anti Russian sentiment lies in the history of Russian colonialism of Transcaucasia For Georgians the country was twice occupied and annexed by Russia First in under the Tsarist regime and then after a short interlude of independence of the Democratic Republic of Georgia a year period of forceful Soviet occupation This sentiment was further fed by the events of the s when Russia supported the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia two historically inalienable parts of Georgia causing the Abkhaz Georgian conflict the Georgian Ossetian conflict and later the war with Russia in It was also followed by Georgian sympathy to the Chechens during the Chechen Russian conflict of the s br br br Rest of Europe br Anti Russian sentiment in Europe has a long history dating back several centuries Initially it was largely driven by religious and cultural differences as well as Russia s expansionist policies This sentiment has evolved over time but the underlying themes of perceived barbarism imperialism and cultural inferiority have remained constant br Negative views of Russia in Europe began to take shape in the th century during the period of Russian expansion into non Russian lands under Ivan III Russia s campaigns against Poland Lithuania Livonian cities and Swedish held Finland marked the beginning of a perception of Russia as a threat During this era Russia was often portrayed as a barbaric un Christian and imperialistic nation by its European adversaries Michael C Paul argued that the crusades of the th century against Russian Christian cities like Novgorod and Pskov may highlight even more deeply rooted religious and cultural animosity br During the Livonian War European powers particularly Poland Lithuania and the Livonian German cities intensified their negative perception of Russia They imposed embargoes on war supplies to Russia fearing the possibility of it receiving military supplies from England which had an active trade mission in Russia Queen Elizabeth denied the accusations br Contemporaries described Tsardom of Russia and early Russian Empire as a barbaric enemy of Christianity Accounts by Western travelers like Austrian Ambassador Sigismund von Herberstein and English Ambassador Giles Fletcher in the th century portrayed Russia in a negative light focusing on aspects like superstition brutality and backwardness Negative views persisted into the th and th centuries with Western observers continuing to highlight aspects like superstition drunkenness and barbaric practices in Russian society Notable figures like Captain John Perry and French travelers Jacques Margeret and Jean Chappe d Auteroche contributed to these perceptions often comparing Russian society unfavorably with Western standards br More recently Russophobia in Western Europe was based on various more or less fantastic fears of Russian conquest of Europe such as those based on The Will of Peter the Great forgery documented in France in the th century and later resurfacing in Britain as a result of fears of a Russian attack on British colonized India in relation to the Great Game The modern day negative attitude and distrust to Russia in nations of Central and Eastern Europe has in turn been firmly anchored in historic violence by the Soviet Union and present day Russia br In a survey the percentage of Russian immigrants in the EU that indicated that they had experienced racially motivated hate crimes was which is less than the average of reported by several groups of immigrants and ethnic minorities in the EU of Russian immigrants in the EU said that they had been victims of crimes in the preceding months as compared to an average of among several groups of immigrants and ethnic minorities br br br Baltics br In the chairman of the Russian State Duma s Foreign Affairs Committee Aleksey Pushkov alleged that Russophobia had become the state policy in the Baltic states and in Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov accused the Baltic states of being the leaders of the Russophobic minority in NATO and the European Union br br br Estonia br br A poll conducted by Gallup International suggested that Estonians have a positive attitude towards Russia but it is supposed that survey results were likely impacted by a large ethnic Russian minority in the country However in a poll only of the Russian minority in Estonia reported that they had experienced a hate crime as compared to an average of among ethnic minorities and immigrants in EU br According to Estonian philosopher Jaan Kaplinski the birth of anti Russian sentiment in Estonia dates back to as there was little or none during the czarist and first independence period when anti German sentiment predominated Kaplinski states the imposition of Soviet rule under Joseph Stalin in and subsequent actions by Soviet authorities led to the replacement of anti German sentiment with anti Russian sentiment within just one year and characterized it as one of the greatest achievements of the Soviet authorities Kaplinski supposes that anti Russian sentiment could disappear as quickly as anti German sentiment did in however he believes the prevailing sentiment in Estonia is sustained by Estonia s politicians who employ the use of anti Russian sentiments in political combat together with the tendentious attitude of the Estonian media Kaplinski says that a rigid East West attitude is to be found to some degree in Estonia when it comes to Russia in the form that everything good comes from the West and everything bad from the East this attitude in Kaplinski s view probably does not date back further than and presumably originates from Nazi propaganda br br br Latvia br br According to The Moscow Times Latvia s fears of Russia are rooted in recent history including conflicting views on whether Latvia and other Baltic states were occupied by the USSR or joined it voluntarily as well as the June and March deportations that followed and more recently the annexation of Crimea that fueled a fear that Latvia could also be annexed by Russia Russian American journalist and broadcaster Vladimir Pozner believed the fact that many Russian migrants in the Latvian SSR did not learn Latvian and expected the local population to speak Russian also contributed to an accumulation of anti Russian sentiment br No Russians have ever been killed or even wounded for political nationalistic or racist reasons in Latvia ever since it regained its independence and in a poll only of the Russian minority in Latvia reported having experienced a racially motivated hate crime as compared to an average of among immigrants and minorities in EU An earlier research Ethnic tolerance and integration of the Latvian society by the Baltic Institute of Social Sciences found that Latvian respondents on average rated their relations with Russians out of whereas non Latvian respondents rated their relationship with Latvians out of Both groups believed that the ties between them were satisfactory had not changed in the last five years and were to either remain the same or improve in the next five years of non Russian respondents said they would also support their son or daughter marrying an ethnic Russian Respondents did mention some ethnic conflicts but all of them were classified as psycholinguistic such as verbal confrontations br Occasionally Russians in Latvia have been targeted by anti Russian rhetoric from some of the more radical members of both the mainstream and radical right parties in Latvia In Civic Union s internal e mail correspondence between Minister for Foreign Affairs of Latvia irts Valdis Kristovskis and Latvian American doctor and party member Aivars Slucis was leaked In one of the e mails titled Do Latvians Surrender Slucis complained of the current situation in Latvia and being unable to return and work in Latvia because he would not be able to treat Russians in the same way as Latvians Kristovskis agreed with his opinion and evaluation but warned against hysterical responses cautioning party members to avoid discussions counterproductive to the party s political goals After the leak the Civic Union ousted Slucis from the party for views unacceptable to the party and returned his financial contributions while the opposition parties Harmony Centre and For a Good Latvia initiated an unsuccessful vote of no confidence against Kristovskis br On the other hand the results of a yearly poll by the research agency SKDS showed that the population of Latvia was more split on its attitude towards the Russian Federation In percent of respondents had a positive view of Russia and had a negative one while the remaining percent found it hard to define their opinion It peaked in when percent of respondents felt positive towards Russia in comparison with the percent that felt negative In following the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation however it dropped to the lowest level since and for the first time the people with a negative attitude towards Russia surpassed people with a positive attitude percent also believed Russia posed a military threat to Latvia and even in that number had decreased only slightly and stood at percent br br br Lithuania br br Due to historical experiences there is a fear prevailed in Lithuania that Russia has never stopped wanting to consolidate power over the Baltics including fears of Russian plans for an eventual annexation of Lithuania as was seen in Crimea There are also concerns over Russia s increasing military deployment such as in the Russian region of Kaliningrad an exclave of Russia bordering Lithuania br br br Eastern Europe br br br Romania br br Anti Russian sentiment dates back to the conflict between the Russian and Ottoman empires in the th and early th centuries and the ceding of part of the Moldavian principality to Russia by the Ottoman Empire in after its de facto annexation and to the annexations during World War II and after by the Soviet Union of Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia and the policies of ethnic cleansing Russification and deportations that have taken place in those territories against ethnic Romanians Following WWII Romania a former ally of Nazi Germany was occupied by Soviet forces Soviet dominance over the Romanian economy was manifested through the so called Sovroms exacting a tremendous economic toll ostensibly as war time reparations br The emergence of anti Russian sentiment in the Danubian Principalities the precursors to unified Romania which became independent of the Ottoman Empire with the Treaty of Adrianople concluding the Russo Turkish War arose from the post relationship of the Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia to Russia and was caused by mutually economic and political grievances of two influential classes that were often odds also with each other As per the treaty Russia was named the protector of the two principalities allowed to occupy them and also drafted a quasi constitution known as the Organic Regulations which formed a powerful assembly of boyars the local landowning economic elite nominally under the authority of the less nominal prince the document crafted with strong support from the boyars The boyars a reactionary oligarchy as described by Misha Glenny stopped short any hint of liberal reform and the growing urban elite began to associate Russia with the slow progress of reform and the obstacles they faced in building an industrial base On the other hand the boyars themselves began to sour on Russia during the s and s due to their economic conflict of interest with Russia After the Ottomans withdrew from the three forts along the Danube basin the boyars exploited the highly fertile land to drastically increase Romanian wheat production such that eventually future Romania consisting of Wallachia unified with Moldavia would become the fourth largest wheat producer in the world Whereas before Wallachian and Moldavian wheat had been limited to Ottoman markets Russia increasingly felt threatened by growing competition in its jurisdiction that it feared could drive down the price of Russian wheat Accordingly Russia exploited its role as protector of the Principalities to let the Danube silt up sabotaging the possible market competitor As a result of this as well as Russian foot dragging on the economy the boyars too became increasingly resentful of Russian domination The rapid erosion of public relations with Russia led to a revolution in in which the newly emerging Romanian intellectual and political class sought the help of the Ottomans their old hegemon to drive out Russian influence although after pressure applied by Russia the Russian and Ottoman armies joined forces to squash the movement br br br Ukraine br br In the leader of the marginal Svoboda party Oleh Tyahnybok urged his party to fight the Moscow Jewish mafia ruling Ukraine For these remarks Tyahnybok was expelled from the Our Ukraine parliamentary faction in July The former coordinator of Right Sector in West Ukraine Oleksandr Muzychko talked about fighting communists Jews and Russians for as long as blood flows in my veins br In May a poll held by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in Ukraine said that of respondents were positive about Russians as an ethnic group respected the Russian Federation and respected the Russian establishment br In October statistics by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine said that positive attitudes towards Russians have been decreasing since In response to a question gauging tolerance of Russians of Western Ukrainians responded positively In Central Ukraine responded positively from in responded positively in Southern Ukraine from in and responded positively in Eastern Ukraine from in Furthermore of Western Ukrainians would banish Russians entirely from Ukraine and in Central Ukraine responded similarly This level of sentiment was not found in Southern or Eastern Ukraine br The ultranationalist party Svoboda once prominent but now marginal has invoked radical anti Russian rhetoric and has electoral support enough to garner majority support in local councils as seen in the Ternopil regional council in Western Ukraine Analysts explained Svoboda s victory in Eastern Galicia during the Ukrainian local elections as a result of the policies of the Azarov Government who were seen as too pro Russian by the voters of Svoboda According to Andreas Umland Senior Lecturer in Political Science at the National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy Svoboda s increasing exposure in the Ukrainian media has contributed to these successes According to British academic Taras Kuzio the presidency of Viktor Yanukovich fabricated this exposure in order to discredit the opposition Since the Euromaidan revolution the Svoboda party lost a lot of its support In the Ukrainian parliamentary election Svoboda formed a united party list with the Governmental Initiative of Yarosh Right Sector and National Corps The united list received only of the votes less than half of the election threshold and thus no parliamentary seats via the national party list br According to the Brookings Institution after Ukraine regained its independence only a small minority of nationalists expressed strong anti Russian views the majority hoped to have good relations with Russia In after the Russian annexation of Crimea the attitude to Russia changed sharply In April a poll by Sociological group RATING found that of respondents expressed a very cold or cold attitude toward Russia while expressed a very warm or warm attitude In February of Ukrainians had a positive attitude towards Russians of Ukrainians had a positive view of Russia but only of Ukrainians had positive attitude towards the Russian government Sentiments due to the war have declined enormously In March of Ukrainians said they had an unfavourable view of Russian President Putin with a further saying they had a very unfavourable or somewhat unfavourable view of the Russian people However of Ukrainians agreed that despite our differences there is more that unites ethnic Russians living in Ukraine and Ukrainians than divides us Ukrainian officials are working to rid the country s cities of streets named after Russian historical figures like Tchaikovsky or Tolstoy According to historian at the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv Vasyl Kmet this is being done to undo the Russian propaganda of the so called Russkiy Mir the Russian speaking world by creating a powerful alternative a modern Ukrainian national discourse br br br Central Europe br br br Czech Republic br br Russia remains continuously among the most negatively perceived countries among Czechs in polls conducted since and just of Czechs responded that they had a positive opinion about Russia in November br According to writer Tim Nollen in Russians in Czechia were almost universally disliked as a people due in part to the presence of Russian mafiosi as well as the arrogant hordes of Russian visitors that descend upon Prague and the Spas in Karlovy Vary br Following the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine anti Russian tensions rose in the country Martin Dlouh a professor at the Prague University of Economics and Business wrote on Facebook on February that he would not conduct test or correct the final thesis of Russian students due to conscience and moral principles but deleted the post after a strong backlash Violence in elementary schools prompted attack by students on their ethnic Russian classmates prompting a condemnation by Prime Minister Petr Fiala Many Czech shops and restaurants put up signs saying that Russians and Belarusians were not allowed br br br Poland br br In The New York Times reported after the Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza that relations between the nations are as bad as they have been since the collapse of the Soviet bloc in Jakub Boraty ski the director of international programs at the independent Polish think tank Stefan Batory Foundation said in that anti Russian feelings have substantially decreased since Poland joined the EU and NATO and that Poles feel more secure than before but he also admitted that many people in Poland still look suspiciously at Russian foreign policy moves and are afraid Russia is seeking to recreate an empire in a different form According to Boris Makarenko deputy director of the Moscow based think tank Center for Political Technologies much of the modern anti Russian feelings in Poland is caused by grievances of the past One contentious issue is the Katyn massacre in as well as the Stalinist era ethnic cleansing operations including the deportation of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Poles even though the Russian government has officially acknowledged and apologized for the atrocity br According to a BBC World Service poll of Poles viewed Russia s influence positively with expressing a negative view According to a Gazeta pl report in some Polish hoteliers disliked

officials escalated the tensions A Russian deputy foreign minister stated in Oslo that Russia views the October Trident Juncture NATO military exercises in Norway to be anti Russian in nature Russian expansion in the arctic has contributed to increasing mutual distrust between Russia and Norway Norway s perceptions of Russian militarism and regional antagonism as well as Norway s hosting of the US Marine Corps in the country have contributed to the deterioration of relations between Norway and Russia br br br Finland br br In Finland anti Russian sentiment has been studied since the s The history of anti Russian sentiment has two main theories One of them claims that Finns and Russians have been archenemies throughout history The position is considered to have been dominated at least the s since the days of the Greater Wrath This view largely assumes that through the centuries Russia is a violent slayer and Finland is an innocent virginal victim br Another perhaps a more plausible view holds that idea of Russia as the archenemy was only invented during the early years of independence for the purposes of building the national identity br The Finnish Civil War in between the Reds and the Whites won by the Whites left behind a popular wave of anti Russian and anti Communist feelings in Finland Hundreds of ethnic Russians were executed in in the city of Vyborg br According to polls in of Finnish citizens had a negative view of Russia In a poll of Russian immigrants in Finland reported that they had experienced a racially motivated hate crime as compared to an average of of

correspondents described the country as a semi barbaric and despotic country an image which ingrained itself in the British public consciousness as such depictions were frequently published in the British media these depictions had the effect of increasing Russophobia in Britain despite growing economic and political ties between the two countries The Russian conquest of Central Asia was perceived in Britain as being a precursor to an attack on British India and led to the Great Game while the Crimean War between the two countries in deepened Russophobia in Britain br In tension lessened as Queen Victoria s second son Prince Alfred married Tsar Alexander II s only daughter Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna followed by a state visit to Britain by the tsar The goodwill lasted no more than three years when structural forces again pushed the two nations to the verge of war leading to a re emergence of Russophobia in Britain Large outbursts of Russophobia in Britain typically occurred during periods of tense political standoffs such as the Dogger Bank incident when the Baltic Fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy attacked a group of British fishing trawlers in the mistaken belief they were Japanese warships outrage in Britain led to the Russian government paying compensation to the fishermen involved br British Russophobia also manifested itself in popular literature of the period Bram Stoker s Dracula has been seen by some historians as depicting an allegorical narrative in which the eponymous character representing Imperial Russia is destroyed by warriors pledged to the Crown However by the tail end of the th century Russophobia in Britain subsided somewhat as Russian literature including works written by authors such as Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky began

sentiment among New Zealanders was influenced by the general Victorian dislike of Tsarist autocracy and British immigrants to the colony who brought with them the high level of anti Russian sentiment at home Polish Hungarian and Jewish refugees fleeing Russia s suppression of various rebellions and outbreaks of anti Jewish pogroms also influenced Russophobia in New Zealand In the aftermath of the Crimean War suspicion of a possible Russian invasion of New Zealand led the colonial government to construct a series of Russian scare coastal fortifications along the coastline However during the First World War anti Russian sentiment subsided as New Zealand and Russia found themselves fighting on the same side against Imperial Germany and anti German sentiment grew in its place By late s pragmatism moderated anti Russian sentiment in official circles especially during the Great Depression Influential visitors to the Soviet Union such as George Bernard Shaw provided a sympathetic view of what they experienced The history of Russophobia in New Zealand was analyzed in Glynn Barratt s book Russophobia in New Zealand expanded to cover the period up to in an article by Tony Wilson br br br Asia and Middle East br br br Iran br br br th th centuries br Anti Russian sentiment in Iran dates back centuries The modern historian Rudi Matthee explains that already by the Safavid period the Iranians had long despised Russians for their uncouthness Russians enjoyed a bad reputation in Iran where by the th century they were known as the Uzbegs of Europe the worst of all Christians unmannered unintelligent and perpetually intoxicated This perception can be traced back to ancient Greco Roman cosmographical conceptions which had been conveyed to the Islamic world According to this concept the world was divided into seven climes the farther away the concentric clime from the center the more barbarian its inhabitants were deemed The notion was also connected to the old concept of Gog and Magog as found in the Quran according to which beyond this boundary lay a murky land inhabited by dimwitted people Hence describing this stereotype in written Safavid sources the denigratory adjective rus e manhus inauspicious Russia or ominous Russia was coined Over time it became a generic term for Iranians referring to Russians br By the mid th century the term rus e manhus designated Cossacks in particular who created havoc around the Caspian littoral and whom the Iranians did not really distinguish from real Russians By the th century according to Matthee stereotypes about a primitive people more given to act out of instinct than reason are also likely to have been reinforced by the fact that Iranians in Jonas Hanway s words probably did not see more of Russians than tribal nomadic peoples living around the Caspian Sea and of real Russians at most uncouth soldiers and illiterate fishermen It is to be noted however that contemporaneous Iranians were probably no less prone to view Russians as primitive and uncivilized than contemporary English commentators were br Due to said perceptions th century Russian envoys were treated with occasional rudeness by the Iranians Most of the mistreatment of said envoys was however grounded in suspicion and resentment about possible hidden objectives and designs by the Russians However this was a common global view at the time regarding envoys Envoys and emissaries were basically invariably seen as having secret motives and being spies In fact it was this very view that prevented the establishment of permanent diplomatic missions in Europe in the early modern period Iranian suspicions in the mid th century about Russian motives were nevertheless longstanding ran deep amongst the populace and were based on genuine concerns br At the time the Russians tried to present profitable commercial missions as diplomatic embassies and covertly tried to support Cossack attacks on Iran The construction of fortresses in the Caucasus however was the most important factor at the time see also Russo Persian War with Iranian concerns about Russian plans to subjugate the Caucasus dating back to the mid th century With the rise of the Tsarist realm of Peter the Great and his aggression against Iran in the first half of the th century such concerns were quickly reinvigorated and were ultimately prophetic in view of the later Russian annexation of the Caucasus in the course of the th century br In the course of the th century Iranian views of Russians were somewhat adjusted due to Peter the Great s modernization efforts and expansionism as initiated by Catherine the Great However Iranian views of their northern neighbors as being somewhat bland and primitive were apparently never relinquished br br br th st centuries br In his book Iran at War Interactions with the Modern World and the Struggle with Imperial Russia focusing on the two Russo Iranian Wars of the first half of the th century the historian Maziar Behrooz explains that Iranian and Russian elites held a demeaning view of each other prior to the reunification campaigns of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar r as well as through the early th century They viewed each other as uncivilized and backwards and thus held each other in contempt For instance the most commonly used contemporaneous denigratory adjective in Iran for Russians was the aforementioned adjective rus e manhus The contemporaneous British diplomat traveller and novelist James Justinian Morier writing in noted that the Iranians spoke of Russians with the greatest disdain As a result of aforementioned wars Russia annexed large parts of Iranian territory in the Caucasus With the Treaty of Gulistan and Treaty of Turkmenchay Iran was forced to cede what is present day Azerbaijan Armenia eastern Georgia and southern Dagestan to Russia This fuelled anti Russian sentiment which led to an angry mob storming the Russian embassy in Tehran and killing everyone in Among those killed in the massacre was the newly appointed Russian ambassador to Iran Alexander Griboyedov a celebrated playwright Griboyedov had previously played an active role in negotiating the terms of the treaty of br Soviet involvement in the Azerbaijani and Kurdish separatist movements also fueled negative attitudes In negative attitudes to Russia among the Iranian opposition was also observed

for each nation During the old Tsardom of Russia the Ottomans often raided and attacked Russian villagers With the transformation into Russian Empire Russia started to expand and clashed heavily with
