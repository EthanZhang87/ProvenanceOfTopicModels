Crisis on Infinite Earths is a to American comic book crossover series published by DC Comics Written by Marv Wolfman and pencilled by George P rez it was first released as a issue limited series from April to March As the main piece of a crossover event some plot elements were featured in tie in issues of other publications Since its initial publication the series has been reprinted in various formats and editions br The idea for the series stemmed from Wolfman s desire to abandon the DC Multiverse depicted in the company s comics which he thought was unfriendly to readers and create a single unified DC Universe DCU The foundation of Crisis on Infinite Earths developed through a character called the Monitor introduced in Wolfman s The New Teen Titans in July before the series itself started br At the start of Crisis on Infinite Earths the Anti Monitor the Monitor s evil counterpart is unleashed on the DC Multiverse and begins to destroy the various Earths that it comprises The Monitor tries to recruit heroes from around the Multiverse but is murdered while Brainiac collaborates with the villains to conquer the remaining Earths Eventually both the heroes and villains are united by the Spectre the series concludes with Kal L Superboy Prime and Alexander Luthor Jr defeating the Anti Monitor and the creation of a single Earth in place of the Multiverse Crisis on Infinite Earths is noted for its high death count hundreds of characters died including DC icons Kara Zor El the original Supergirl and Barry Allen the Flash of the Silver Age The story s events resulted in the entire DCU being rebooted dividing the fictional universe s timeline into pre Crisis and post Crisis eras br The series was a bestseller for DC The story is credited with popularizing the idea of a large scale crossover in comics Crisis on Infinite Earths is the first installment in what became known as the Crisis trilogy It was followed by Infinite Crisis and Final Crisis Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths also served as a sequel to Crisis on Infinite Earths br br br Publication history br br br Background br DC Comics is an American comic book publisher best known for its superhero stories featuring characters including Batman Superman and Wonder Woman The company debuted in February with New Fun The Big Comic Magazine Most of DC s comic books as well as some published under its imprints Vertigo and Young Animal take place within a shared universe called the DC Universe DCU allowing plot elements characters and settings to cross over with each other The concept of the DCU has provided DC s writers some challenges in maintaining continuity due to conflicting events within different comics that need to reflect the shared nature of the universe Flash of Two Worlds from The Flash September which featured Barry Allen the Silver Age Flash teaming up with Jay Garrick the Golden Age Flash was the first DC comic to suggest that the DCU was a part of a multiverse br The DC Multiverse concept was expanded in later years with the DCU having infinite Earths for example the Golden Age versions of DC heroes resided on Earth Two while DC s Silver Age heroes were from Earth One Since Crisis on Earth One DC has used the word Crisis to describe important crossovers within the DC Multiverse Over the years various writers took liberties creating additional parallel Earths as plot devices and to house characters DC had acquired from other companies making the DC Multiverse a convoluted mess DC s comic book sales were also far below those of their competitor Marvel Comics According to ComicsAlliance journalist Chris Sims the DC multiverse felt old fashioned Marvel on the other hand felt contemporary and when you stack them up against each other there s one difference that sticks out above anything else Marvel feels unified br Writer Marv Wolfman became popular among DC s readers for his work on Weird War Tales and The New Teen Titans George P rez who illustrated The New Teen Titans also began to rise to prominence in this era In P rez entered into an exclusive contract with DC which was later extended one year Although The New Teen Titans was a major success for DC the company s comic book sales were still below Marvel s Wolfman began to attribute this to the DC Multiverse feeling The Flash of Two Worlds had created a nightmare it was not reader friendly for new readers to be able to keep track of and writers struggled with the continuity errors it caused In The New Teen Titans July Wolfman introduced a new character the shadowy potentially villainous Monitor this laid the foundation for Crisis on Infinite Earths br br br Development br In Wolfman was editing Green Lantern He got a letter from a fan asking why a character did not recognize Green Lantern in a recent issue despite the two having had worked together in an issue three years earlier Soon afterward Wolfman pitched Crisis on Infinite Earths as The History of the DC Universe seeing it as a way to simplify the DCU and attract new readers The History of the DC Universe s title was changed to Crisis on Infinite Earths because its premise involving the destruction of entire worlds sounded more like a crisis br Wolfman said when he pitched the series to DC he realized it was going to be a completely new beginning for the DCU I knew up front and they did too how big this was going to be he said But no one knew how well it would sell or whether it would sell at all It was a risk DC was willing to take because my thoughts were that DC needed a lot of help at that time and they did too Wolfman also said he saw it as an attempt to improve DC s reputation for storytelling which many readers at the time saw as old fashioned br The crossover was fleshed out and coordinated at a meeting attended by president Jenette Kahn Paul Levitz vice president and executive editor Dick Giordano and DC s editors In DC hired a researcher to go through their library and read every comic the company had published a task that took two years The series was delayed to due to the time for research and again to when it was still not ready for and to coincide with DC s fiftieth anniversary As an event like Crisis on Infinite Earths had never happened before those working on it met for around two hours a week at the time this was uncommon br The groundwork for the series was laid the year before it was published One of the greatest challenges for Wolfman and Giordano was coming up with a story Wolfman cited making use of every DC character and creating a plot that was fun to read and filled with surprises as difficulties as the series needed to sell well if it did not it could have caused a disaster for DC Plotting became easier once a beginning and an ending had been determined and when P rez became involved Crisis on Infinite Earths was DC s first mainstream maxiseries which was still a relatively new concept br Early in planning for Crisis on Infinite Earths a list was made of characters that were part of the DCU characters from other universes such as those that formerly belonged to Charlton Comics also were used According to Wolfman one of the purposes of Crisis on Infinite Earths was to showcase all the characters DC had The series is infamous for its high death count Hundreds of characters died among the most noted was Barry Allen s Wolfman has said he did not want to kill Allen but DC ordered him to because it perceived the character as dull Therefore he conceived Allen s death in which he runs through time before vanishing as a way to make the character seem more interesting and hopefully spare him Wolfman wanted to make the series unforgettable he said that many writers had expressed interest in simplifying DC s continuity and he wanted to be the one to do so br P rez says he was not the intended artist for Crisis on Infinite Earths but was excited when he learned about it seeing it as an opportunity for revenge against Marvel which he blamed for blocking the JLA Avengers crossover he had been working on He enjoyed working with Wolfman again and took a leave of absence from The New Teen Titans to draw the series DC initially did not know P rez would want to work on it According to P rez he was motivated by the fact that DC did not know if the series was going to be a success He also wanted to draw everybody I could get my hands on and called illustrating the series some of the most fun he ever had P rez was excited because not only did he get to draw the Teen Titans again but also obscure characters he was not familiar with saying he could possibly have never gotten another chance Wolfman has said one panel in Crisis on Infinite Earths shows the Marvel Universe being destroyed When Giordano the series initial inker had difficulty meeting deadlines while continuing as DC vice president and executive editor editorial coordinator Pat Bastienne reassigned the inking to Jerry Ordway despite Giordano s objections br br br Publication br The idea for Crisis on Infinite Earths was first noted in the December issue of The Comics Journal which mentioned a twelve part maxiseries scheduled for The series was announced in Giordano s Meanwhile column DC ran in its titles cover dated June Giordano warned readers that odd occurrences would begin to happen throughout DC s comics He also clarified it would commemorate DC s fiftieth anniversary and would provide the company wonderful stepping stones for new characters and comics The series was marketed with the tagline Worlds will live worlds will die and nothing will ever be the same br The series began in January and lasted for twelve issues ending in December issues cover dated April through March The close spacing of Crisis on Infinite Earths and Marvel s similar crossover Secret Wars caused some fans to create conspiracy theories about idea theft According to writer Steve Gerber the series got virtually no promotion How many handouts did you see How many posters did you see in people s windows How much information was really distributed to the press and how much was gotten just by individual reporters going to Marv Wolfman and Crisis artist George P rez br br br Tie ins br br Elements to set up Crisis on Infinite Earths were put in DC s comics years before the crossover took place an example of this was the Monitor s appearance in The New Teen Titans In a January memo Giordano Wolfman and Len Wein instructed editors and writers to use the Monitor twice in the coming year but not to show him Because this series involves the entire DC Universe we do ask that each Editor and writer cooperate with the project by using a character called The Monitor in their books twice during the next year This served to set up the series When Wolfman and Giordano reiterated this in a meeting some editors were not pleased one was so miffed he did not speak for the rest of the meeting br Tie ins for Crisis on Infinite Earths were published in DC s ongoing series Unlike the Marvel crossover storyline The Infinity Gauntlet where Marvel only published tie ins in titles that needed a boost in sales the vast majority of DC s comics featured events that directly tied to the crossover The following comic book issues were labeled as part of the crossover their covers contained a banner that read Special Crisis Cross Over along with the logo

being unsure if the series would be successful Crisis on Infinite Earths was a bestseller br IGN s Hilary Goldstein summarized the series as a crucial turning point for DC Comics and credited it with saving the company Goldstein called Wolfman s idea to simplify the DCU bold and unprecedented noting the story s exceptional size and saying the story was unbelievable if somewhat aged He also praised P rez s detailed artwork saying no other artist could have possibly illustrated it as well as he did and gave the book a must have rating Fellow IGN writer Jesse Schedeen named Crisis on Infinite Earths one of the best DC crossovers agreeing it was unprecedented and dramatic br Marc Buxton of Comic Book Resources named Crisis on Infinite Earths the greatest comic book crossover ever saying that no crossover has been bigger or as ambitious where some events seem hesitant to actually leave a mark on their respective universes Crisis did it with aplomb He praised the series for exploring the entire DCU and felt it was a fitting event for DC s fiftieth anniversary Nerdist News noted that many of the series central events such as the deaths of Supergirl and Barry Allen have become iconic moments in DC s history br Not all reviewers have been as positive Chris Sims wrote the series was messy and built awkwardly describing it as a textbook definition of style over substance Sims said it was far from the best work of Wolfman and P rez however he still thought it was groundbreaking saying It s the first time in comics history that EVERYTHING was in danger br br br Merchandise br A novelization of Crisis on Infinite Earths was written by Wolfman and published by iBooks in with cover art by P rez and Alex Ross The book follows the events of the original series most of the

Batman Doctor Light Earth Prime Superboy Earth Huntress and Weaponer of Qward br br br Legacy br Though it was not the first large scale comic book crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths is generally credited with popularizing the idea Comics historian Matthew K Manning wrote that Crisis on Infinite Earths paved way for all future crossovers of similar scale and Andrew J Friedenthal said Crisis showed the two major superhero comic book publishers DC Comics and Marvel Comics how they could utilize the continuity established by decades worth of stories to weave together a cohesive metatextual tapestry that both appealed to long time readers and brought in massive amounts of money The series success inspired DC to begin a tradition of summer crossovers some of these include Invasion Armageddon Zero Hour Crisis in Time and Identity Crisis and some mention the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths The second part of one of DC s later crossovers Convergence heavily references the series and sees DC s superheroes travel back to its era The writers of Convergence all had fun writing stories set during Crisis on Infinite Earths calling the series an exciting time for DC br The series had an immediate effect on DC dividing the company s history into two eras Pre Crisis and Post Crisis Wolfman and P rez teamed again to produce the History of the DC Universe limited series to summarize the DCU s new history In the post Crisis history during the Crisis many heroes fought the Anti Monitor s army He attempted to collapse the positive universe s past and future into a single point in time to destroy it leaving only the antimatter universe br Many of DC s characters had their histories rebooted Wonder Woman s comic was relaunched entirely by P rez Wein and Greg Potter

Extended Universe and the Marvel Cinematic Universe said We look at it as the multiverse We have our TV universe and our film universe but they all co exist For us creatively it s about allowing everyone to make the best possible product to tell the best story to do the best world Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through It s just a different approach The
