gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three stars out of four saying the directors were skilled at springing surprises from the writers ingenious screenplay Peter Debruge of Variety wrote Since villains so often steal the show in animation Despicable Me smartly turns the whole operation over to megalomaniacal rogue Gru Robert Wilonsky of The Village Voice wrote The result is pleasant and diverting if ultimately forgettable and it s one of the rare instances in the recent history of D s resurrection as The Savior of Cinema in which the technology doesn t dim the screen or distract the focus Christy Lemire of the Associated Press wrote Kids will dig it adults will smile with amusement and no one will be any different afterward

four saying Short sweet and sour and amusing rather than funny Despicable Me can t help but be likable Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying You ll

smart family movie that makes inventive use of the summer s ubiquitous D technology is something worth cheering Tom Keogh of The Seattle Times gave the film three stars out of four saying Despicable Me appeals both to our innocence and our glee over cartoon anarchy Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film three stars out of four saying Despicable Me has enough visual novelty and high spirits to keep the kiddies diverted and just enough wit to placate the parents Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four saying The film is funny energetic teeth gnashingly venomous and animated with an eye to exploiting the D process with such sure fire techniques as a visit to an amusement park Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying By taking the heart part just seriously enough and in the nick of time the movie saves itself from itself br Kim Newman of Empire gave the film three stars out of five saying It s no first rank CGI cartoon but shows how Pixar s quality over crass is inspiring the mid list Fun with teary bits for kids fresh and smart for adults Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying The film throws so much ersatz cleverness and overdone emotion at the audience that we end up more worn out than entertained Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star Ledger gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying Unfortunately Despicable Me is just predictably eh And the one thing the larcenous Gru never steals is our heart Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film three stars out of four saying An improbably heartwarming not to mention visually delightful diversion Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail gave the film four stars out of four saying This animated thing pretty near out Pixars Pixar Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two stars out of four saying When compared with the ambition and achievement of recent animated films such as Coraline and Toy Story Despicable Me hardly seems to have been worth making and it s barely worth watching br Bob Mondello of NPR gave the film an eight out of ten saying It s all thoroughly adorable and with an overlay that s nearly as odd as Carell s accent Despicable Me looks a lot like other computer animated pictures A O Scott of The New York Times gave the film two stars out of five saying So much is going on in this movie that while there s nothing worth despising there s not much to remember either Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter wrote Despicable doesn t measure up to Pixar at its best Nonetheless it s funny clever and warmly animated with memorable characters Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times gave the film a B saying Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud craft a fun stretch run wrapping the story with warm fuzzy funnies and nothing to suggest a sequel which is probably wise Tasha Robinson of The A V Club gave the film a B saying Until the creep orphans happy family
