Alexander Joseph Lex Luthor is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics The character was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster Lex Luthor originally appeared in Action Comics cover dated April He has since endured as the archenemy of the superhero Superman br Lex Luthor was depicted as a narcissistic and egotistical mad scientist from the s to the mid s Since the mid late s he has more often been portrayed as the power mad CEO of LexCorp He wishes to rid the world of Superman ostensibly because he views Superman as a threat to humanity but in reality because he envies Superman s popularity and influence Given his high profile as a supervillain however he has often come into conflict with Batman and other superheroes in the DC Universe Lex Luthor is physically an ordinary human and has no natural superpowers but he is a genius with a high aptitude for business politics science and technology He is typically portrayed as a mad scientist lacking a secret identity costume or other elements of supervillains but he occasionally wears his warsuit a suit of mechanized armor that gives him enhanced strength flight advanced weaponry and other capabilities While Lex is primarily depicted as a supervillain allied with other villains such as Metallo Parasite and Bizarro and frequently leading DC supervillain teams such as the Legion of Doom he has also been portrayed as an antihero who will ally himself with Superman and other heroes when the situation calls for it br The character was ranked th on IGN s list of the Top Comic Book Villains of All Time and as the th Greatest Villain by Wizard on its Greatest Villains of All Time list Luthor is one of a few genre crossing villains whose adventures take place in a world in which the ordinary laws of nature are slightly suspended Scott James Wells Sherman Howard John Shea Michael Rosenbaum Jon Cryer Titus Welliver and Michael Cudlitz have portrayed the character in television series while Lyle Talbot Gene Hackman Kevin Spacey and Jesse Eisenberg have portrayed the character in films and Nicholas Hoult is set to play him in the upcoming film Superman Several actors have provided Luthor s voice in animated adaptations including Clancy Brown Mark Rolston James Marsters Giancarlo Esposito Marc Maron and Max Mittelman br br br Publication history br br br Creation and development br br In his first story appearance Action Comics April Luthor is depicted as a diabolical genius and is referred to only by his surname He resides in a flying city suspended by a dirigible and plots to provoke a war between two European nations Lois Lane and Clark Kent investigate which results in Lois being kidnapped Luthor battles Superman with a green ray but he is ultimately defeated and Lois is rescued Superman destroys Luthor s dirigible with him still on it implying Luthor may have died Stories ending with Luthor s apparent death become common in his earliest appearances with him turning up alive later on br br Luthor returns in Superman and steals a weapon from the U S Army capable of causing earthquakes Superman battles and defeats Luthor then destroys the earthquake device The scientist who made the device commits suicide to prevent its reinvention In a story in the same issue Luthor creates a city on the sunken Lost continent of Pacifo and populates it with recreated prehistoric monsters he plans to unleash upon the world Superman thwarts his plans and Luthor is seemingly killed by the dinosaurs he created Luthor returns in Superman with a plan to place hypnotic gas in the offices of influential people so he can throw the nation into a depression with the help of corrupt financier Moseley The story ends with Superman defeating him br In these early stories Luthor s schemes are centered around financial gain or megalomaniacal ambitions unlike most later incarnations he demonstrates no strong animosity toward Superman beyond inevitable resentment of the hero s constant interference with his plans Luthor s obsessive hatred of Superman came later in the character s development br In Luthor s earliest appearances he is shown as a middle aged man with a full head of red hair Less than a year later however an artistic mistake resulted in Luthor being depicted as completely bald in a newspaper strip The original error is attributed to Leo Nowak a studio artist who illustrated for the Superman dailies during this period One hypothesis is that Nowak mistook Luthor for the Ultra Humanite a recurring mad scientist foe of Superman who in his Golden Age incarnation resembled a balding elderly man Other evidence suggests Luthor s design was confused with that of a stockier bald henchman in Superman Spring Luthor s next appearance occurs in Superman May in which Nowak depicted him as significantly heavier with visible jowls The character s abrupt hair loss has been made reference to several times over the course of his history In writer Jerry Siegel altered Luthor s backstory to incorporate his hair loss into his origin br During World War II the War Department asked for dailies of the Superman comic strip to be pulled The strips in question were created in April and depicted Lex Luthor bombarding Superman with the radiation from a cyclotron This violated wartime voluntary censorship guidelines meant to help conceal the Manhattan Project br br br Silver Age Lex Luthor br In DC Comics reimagined the Flash with a new secret identity costume and origin This led to the new Silver Age of Comics and the first DC Comics reboot with characters across the board being reimagined or having their histories and nature redefined The earlier Golden Age stories of Superman and Batman were later said to have taken place on Earth Two a parallel universe that was part of the larger DC Multiverse br The Silver Age version of Luthor was introduced in Adventure Comics April now given the first name Lex later said to be short for Alexis eventually retconned as Alexander and an origin story Originally hero worshiping Superboy teenage Lex Luthor of Smallville is determined to prove he is Earth s greatest scientist by creating artificial life His recklessness and inexperience causes a fire in his lab and he calls on Superboy to save him The Boy of Steel puts out the fire but in the process accidentally destroys the artificial life form and the years of research notes that led to its creation while fumes from the chemical fire cause Luthor s hair to fall out Unwilling to hold himself responsible for the lab fire and the destruction of his own life s work Luthor decides that Superboy was jealous of his intellect and caused the fire himself Believing he s been betrayed by his hero and friend Lex swears revenge His first attempts at that are grandiose scientific and engineering projects around Smallville to steal Superboy s thunder When these attempts for which unknown to Luthor Superboy was supportive as consolation that Lex was at least being constructive in his vendetta each go disastrously awry and force Superboy to intervene while earning the citizenry s scorn Lex s hate for Superboy only grew in rationalization of his failures br This revised origin makes Luthor s fight with Superman a personal one and suggests that if events had unfolded differently Luthor might have grown to be a more noble person Luthor s ego preventing him from personal growth and the tragedy that he and Clark could have been a force for good together are played up in various stories throughout the s and s particularly in Elliot S Maggin s novels Last Son of Krypton and Miracle Monday br The Golden Age version of Luthor appears again as a villain still alive and well on Earth Two To distinguish him from the modern day Lex Luthor the original incarnation is shown as having kept his red hair and is retroactively given the first name Alexei In DC Comics Presents Annual Alexei Luthor of Earth Two and Lex Luthor of Earth One team up It is shown that Alexei is arguably colder and more villainous perfectly willing to destroy all of Earth in order to prove his superiority whereas Lex hesitates to do so because he had no desire to rule a lifeless world and doesn t want his sister to die br Years later Lex Luthor and the villain Brainiac recruit an army of super villains during Crisis on Infinite Earths including Alexei Luthor from Earth Two When Alexei argues that the army doesn t need two Luthors Brainiac agrees and executes him br br br Post Crisis reboot br br Following Crisis on Infinite Earths DC rebooted its universe yet again creating the Post Crisis reality In the limited series The Man of Steel John Byrne redesigned Lex Luthor from scratch intending to make him a villain that the s would recognize an evil corporate executive Byrne intentionally chose to base this new depiction of Luthor on the businessmen Donald Trump Ted Turner and Howard Hughes as well as Satan Initially brutish and overweight the character later evolved into a sleeker more athletic version of his old self Luthor is no longer recounted as having lost his hair in a chemical fire rather his hairline is shown to be receding naturally over time Marv Wolfman a writer on Action Comics who had one conversation with Byrne prior to Luthor s reboot recalled br br I never believed the original Luthor Every story would begin with him breaking out of prison finding some giant robot in an old lab he hid somewhere and then he d be defeated My view was if he could afford all those labs and giant robots he wouldn t need to rob banks I also thought later that Luthor should not have super powers Every other villain had super powers Luthor s power was his mind He needed to be smarter than Superman Superman s powers had to be useless against him because they couldn t physically fight each other and Superman was simply not as smart as Luthor br As originally presented in the Post Crisis version of the DC Comics Universe Lex Luthor is a product of child abuse and early poverty Born in the Suicide Slum district of Metropolis he is instilled with a desire to become a self made man of great power and influence As a teenager he takes out a large life insurance policy on his parents without their knowledge then sabotages their car s brakes causing their deaths Upon graduating from MIT Luthor founds his own business LexCorp which grows to dominate much of Metropolis br Luthor does not fully appear in The Man of Steel mini series until the fourth issue which takes place over a year after Superman s arrival in Metropolis Terrorists seize Luthor s yacht forcing Superman to intervene Satisfied at the hero s performance Luthor attempts to hire him admitting he knew about the incoming attack and allowed it to occur so he could see how Superman responded assuming that the Man of Steel would arrive in time Enraged the Mayor deputizes Superman to arrest Luthor for reckless endangerment Although Luthor is released from jail quickly and has the charges dropped the humiliation of being publicly arrested and processed coupled with indignation that Superman refused to work for him results in the villain pledging to destroy Superman simply to prove his power br Despite general acceptance of Byrne s characterization which led to its influence in media adaptations DC Comics writers began bringing back his quality of being a scientific genius in the s in stories such as The Final Night By it was said that Luthor s genuine accomplishments in several scientific fields is what helped create LexCorp and make it so successful so quickly in early Post Crisis stories Byrne suggested that Luthor was recognized as a brilliant inventor and great scientific mind but had largely withdrawn from his laboratory in favor of the boardroom Regarding the character being a corrupt billionaire rather than a mad scientist author Neil Gaiman commented br br It s a pity Lex Luthor has become a multinationalist I liked him better as a bald scientist He was in prison but they couldn t put his mind in prison Now he s just a skinny Kingpin br Luthor s romantic aspirations toward Lois Lane established early on in the series become a focal point of the stories immediately following it He is shown making repeated attempts to court her during The Man of Steel though Lois plainly does not return his feelings br In the Superman Adventures comic line based on the TV series of the same name Luthor s backstory is identical to that of the Post Crisis origin with slight changes Luthor is shown originating in Suicide Slum his intelligence outshining other children fueling his ambition to have all of Metropolis look up to him one day Luthor s baldness is never explained save for a brief depiction of him with blond hair in childhood it is assumed the hair loss was natural Luthor s parents die during his teenage years however their deaths are indeed accidental Lex uses the insurance to pay for his tuition to MIT and then founds LexCorp His hatred of Superman is explained as the citizens of Metropolis have admired the Man of Steel more than him br br br Modern depictions br Superman Birthright a limited series written by Mark Waid in offers an alternate look at Luthor s history including his youth in Smallville and his first encounter with Superman The story has similarities to the television series Smallville which follows Clark Kent s life as a teenager and into early adulthood One plot element shared by the comic and the show is the problematic relationship between Lex and his father Lionel Along with this Birthright restores the Silver Age concept of Luthor befriending Clark Kent as a young man The two find a kinship in both feeling like outsiders and sharing a wish to explore outer space and discover alien alife despite one resenting humanity and the other hoping to understand and be accepted by it Lex discovers kryptonite samples in Smallville and uses them as a power source for a machine he hopes will pierce space and time so he can communicate with Krypton When Clark falls ill approaching the machine Lex mistakes his reaction as doubt in the young scientist s ability and sanity Feeling betrayed Lex continues the experiment but an explosion erupts the radiation blast causing his hair to fall out Luthor leaves Metropolis and years later his scientific work largely based on his ideas about alien life results in a fortune he uses to create LexCorp When Superman appears Lex is angry that the powerful alien the kind of companion he d often hoped for looks on him with disapproval and openly disrespects him in front of the media For this and his interference with Luthor s criminal operations the scientist businessman decides to humiliate and destroy the alien br Waid s original intention was to jettison the notion of Lex Luthor being an evil businessman restoring his status as a mad scientist He ultimately conceded however that the CEO Luthor would be easier for readers to recognize In Birthright Luthor remains a wealthy corporate magnate in contrast to Byrne s characterization however LexCorp is founded upon Luthor s study of extraterrestrial life thereby providing a link between him and Superman In the retrospective section of the Superman Birthright trade paperback Waid explains br br Despite my own personal prejudices I say we leave Lex the criminal businessman he s been for the past years The Lois Clark producers liked it the WB cartoon guys liked it so clearly it works on some level My concern is that at least in my eyes the fact that Luthor s allowed to operate uncontested for years makes Superman look ineffectual br Birthright was initially intended to establish a new origin for Superman and Luthor Immediately the Superman comics and the series Superman Batman made references to the canonicity of the new origin series But after Infinite Crisis ended in new stories discredited parts of it and it was officially replaced by the series Superman Secret Origin Superman Secret Origin revised Lex s backstory so that he now again had a sister Lena While he knew Clark as a teenager in Smallville he rejected the other boy s attempts to form a friendship Resentful toward his alcoholic and abusive father Lex arranges his parents to die in a car accident and uses the insurance money to leave Smallville and start a better life After studying under the villains Ra s al Ghul and Darkseid he founds LexCorp and uses his PR resources and media control to set himself up as a near savior in Metropolis The Daily Planet opposes Luthor and he retaliates in ways that leave the newspaper almost bankrupt Superman s arrival challenges Luthor s image and brings renewed interest to the Planet when he does exclusive interviews with their staff Clark Kent Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane work together to oppose Luthor s power and Superman tells the public they should strive to achieve great things themselves and not wait for others to be their saviors Angry at Superman s interference and blaming him for losing the love of the public Luthor swears vengeance br Following changes to continuity in s DC Rebirth the history from Superman Secret Origin is still largely intact though it has also been revealed that for a time Lionel Luthor worked as a scientist for Vandal Savage and that this led to a brief friendship between Lex and J onn J onzz the Martian Manhunter when both were children br br br Fictional character biography br Whether he is a mad scientist corrupt businessman or both Luthor s ego is a defining trait in all his incarnations he believes he is entitled to both popularity and power While each incarnation initially wants the adoration of others and control over either Smallville or Metropolis the goal eventually rises to control over Earth and possibly universal domination Luthor s other defining trait is his obsession to destroy Superman and humiliate the alien hero either by displaying his own superiority by achieving victory without the benefit of superpowers or to prove the Man of Steel is motivated by selfish desire rather than altruism Many times Luthor has claimed he could create a better way of life for the entire human race if not for Superman s interference with his work he has even argued that the Man of Tomorrow s presence not only invites danger it actually encourages human society not to strive for greatness because a powerful alien is around to protect them and solve problems During the Blackest Night crossover Wonder Woman restrains Luthor with her magic lasso and under its spell of truth he confesses he secretly wants to be Superman revealing that beneath all his blustering Luthor covets Superman s powers for himself When Superman was out of sight for a year Luthor used the time to create the Everyman project intending to create new superheroes to replace the Kryptonian then later attacks Metropolis with a long buried Kryptonian warship Returning to action Superman points out that Luthor had a year to prove his old argument that he could help others and improve Earth if Superman didn t interfere with his life but instead of curing disease or making technological breakthroughs all he did was focus on increasing his power and finding a big destructive machine so he could break things In the storyline The Black Ring Luthor is endowed with cosmic powers that could enable him to bring peace and bliss to the entire universe and therefore achieve his dream of being more respected than Superman but he ultimately chooses to renounce his new powers when he realizes that his greatest enemy would never suffer again if he used them br At times Lex has been shown evidence that Clark Kent is Superman and almost always he denies this possibility unable to imagine a man of such power spending half his time pretending to be average since in his mind such a possibility would be too humiliating to bear In stories appearing in JLA and by Grant Morrison Luthor cannot bring himself to believe Superman is truly altruistic and deeply cares about a planet that is not his native world concluding the hero s good deeds are often actually passive aggressive ways of flaunting his power and popularity to Lex When the hero joins forces with others to form a new powerful version of the Justice League of America Lex decides this is Superman s direct challenge to his own power and establishes an Injustice League composed of various supervillains to rival them br br br Silver Age br While the Golden Age Luthor later named Alexei Luthor is simply an amoral and brilliant man driven by a simple desire for power the Silver Age incarnation was given a more developed personality and backstory Teenage Lex Luthor is an aspiring scientist who resides in Smallville and greatly admires its local hero Superboy After Lex saves him from kryptonite the Boy of Steel builds him a private laboratory in gratitude After thousands of experiments the young scientist creates an artificial life form of primitive protoplasm Overjoyed he accidentally causes a chemical fire in the lab Superboy puts out the fire inadvertently spilling other chemicals destroying the artificial life form and the accumulated research notes that led to its creation The chemical fumes also cause Lex s hair to completely fall out Enraged he has lost years of research but unwilling to accept responsibility for the fire Luthor concludes Superboy intentionally sabotaged his work jealous of the young scientist s achievements and swears revenge br Luthor creates grandiose engineering projects to prove his superiority over the superhero but each one fails and causes problems that Superboy then solves Luthor then makes his first attempt to murder the Last Son of Krypton and fails Instead of bringing him to the authorities Superboy declares they are even now and expresses hope Lex will straighten out and use his intelligence to help humanity rather than try to prove his superiority or waste time seeking power and vengeance br Superman s Girl Friend Lois Lane reveals the Silver Age Lex Luthor parents are Jules and Arlene and that he has a younger sister Lena When Lex becomes a criminal the family moves away from Smallville and changes its name to Thorul an anagram to start a new life free of him Lena Thorul is a toddler at the time and grows up not remembering her real last name while her parents say her older brother died in a mountain climbing accident Lex later watches over the adult Lena making sure she does not discover her connection to one of Earth s greatest villains br As an adult Lex Luthor s driving ambitions are to kill Superman and rule Earth a stepping stone to dominating the universe believing a man of his intellect deserves such power On several occasions he joins forces with Superman s enemy Brainiac though the two often betray each other as well Lex is repeatedly imprisoned but his genius allows him to routinely escape He also makes it a point to be out of prison on the birthday of Albert Einstein regarding it as a holiday A famous non canonical imaginary story from entitled The Death of Superman has Luthor finally succeed in killing Superman after pretending to reform and befriend him br On a distant arid planet orbiting a red star Luthor challenges Superman to a fight since Kryptonians lose power when exposed to red sun radiation Befriending the planet s inhabitants Luthor aids them in rediscovering lost technology that restores the water supply and helps the society rebuild As a result Luthor becomes a hero in the eyes of the planet whereas his enemy Superman is detested as a villain The people rename the planet Lexor and it becomes a regular home base and retreat for Luthor in between his efforts to fight Superman and take over Earth He later meets a local woman named Ardora first called Tharla but renamed Ardora in later stories as well as the reprint of her first appearance The two eventually fall in love and marry br br br Bronze Age br br Deciding to retire permanently Luthor returns to Lexor and learns he has fathered a son by Ardora Lex Luthor Jr He spends the next several weeks with his new family before discovering Lexor suffers from the same planetary instability that destroyed Krypton While creating a Neutrarod tower to stabilize the planetary core Luthor s pathological hatred for Superman resurfaces and he reflects on feeling unsatisfied in life without their conflict The villain then unearths an ancient underground laboratory of great technology a relic from Lexor s lost age After one of Luthor s still active satellites threatens the people of Earth he concludes Superman will soon come to Lexor to take him back to Earth authorities With the underground lab s resources he spends weeks creating a warsuit highly destructive flight capable power armor to finally match the Kryptonian in physical combat and counter his powers To test the suit Luthor performs several acts of destruction on Lexor feigning ignorance when he hears about the mystery marauder and telling Ardora he has no knowledge of the armored man br When Superman arrives Luthor dons his warsuit and attacks now obsessed with the need to best the hero in combat and prove his superiority The people of Lexor are shocked to realize he is the mystery marauder and does not care about the harm he has caused them During the battle Luthor releases an energy salvo that accidentally overloads the Neutrarod resulting in the complete destruction of the planet Lexor and all its inhabitants including Ardora and Lex Jr Similar to how he reacted after the destruction of his lab in Smallville Lex is unable to process his grief and accept his responsibility for Lexor s destruction He psychologically blocks part of his own memory to convince himself Superman is at fault renewing his need for vengeance In his subsequent stories he regularly uses the Lexorian warsuit The warsuit was designed by George P rez as part of the Super Powers toyline in the early s before being introduced into the comics in The suit vanished in after Crisis on Infinite Earths rebooted DC Comics continuity but was reintroduced in now said to be built with a combination of Earth and alien technology including tech from the other dimensional world Apokolips and armed with different forms of kryptonite in the gauntlet br Lex Luthor of Earth One teams up with Alexei Luthor of Earth Two It is shown that Alexei is arguably colder and more villainous perfectly willing to destroy all of Earth in order to prove his superiority whereas Lex hesitates to do so because he had no desire to rule a lifeless world and doesn t want his sister to die They even extend their alliance to Ultraman when Earth Three s Lex Luthor is a good guy All three villains were defeated by Superman of Earth One Superman of Earth Two and Lex Luthor of Earth Three br During the issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths Luthor allies himself with fellow Superman foe Brainiac to recruit an army of supervillains spanning the DC Multiverse Alexei Luthor is present and complains this army does not need two Luthors Brainiac kills Alexei in response At the conclusion of the series reality is altered so that each of the different universes converge into one Luthor is subsequently returned to prison with all his memories of the Crisis forgotten br This incarnation of Lex Luthor met his end in the non canonical two part story Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow that closed out the Pre Crisis Superman continuity of the Silver and Bronze Age Luthor finds Brainiac s robotic head hoping to revive the villain for a new team up Instead Brainiac takes control of Luthor s body forcing him to be a host as he attempts to destroy Superman Luthor later begs a superpowered Lana Lang to kill him who does so Brainiac retains control of the body for a short period of time before rigor mortis sets in then abandons it running out of power shortly afterward br br br Post Crisis br As part of the continuity changes which followed The Man of Steel and Superman Secret Origin Alexander Lex Joseph Luthor is corrupt businessman profiting from many hidden criminal operations This Luthor grew up a poor child alongside Perry White later causing his parents death via a car accident so he can inherit their life insurance and create a better life for himself creating LexCorp He marries and divorces several times and desires a romance with Lois Lane When Superman appears Luthor takes advantage of a terrorist attack to see the hero in action and then attempts to make him an employee But the Man of Steel acting as a special deputy of Metropolis arrests him for endangering people by not warning authorities of the impending terrorist attack Humiliated Luthor swears revenge repeatedly letting Superman know about his criminal schemes but never leaving him enough evidence to bring the man to justice again Luthor becomes obsessed with Superman and gathers all information on him and his associates leading a computer analysis to conclude Clark Kent and Superman are the same person Unable to believe someone as powerful as Superman regularly hides his powers and pretends to be average as that is something he would never do himself Luthor dismisses the computer s findings and concludes both the machine and its programmer are at fault br As a nod to the previous continuity Luthor has his lab create high tech armor that resembles the Lexorian warsuit Rather than act directly he has an employee don the armor and attack Superman for him The man is defeated and cannot testify against Luthor because the armor s neural control unit destroys his mind Along with this Luthor participates in the creation of two Superman villains Parasite indirectly and Bizarro a failed attempt by Luthor s scientists to clone Superman br br When Superman fights the cyborg Metallo Luthor intervenes In Superman vol discovering Metallo is powered by a heart of kryptonite that can hurt and potentially kill Superman Luthor steals it and a creates a kryptonite ring for himself He wears the radioactive ore around his finger as a symbol that he is untouchable causing the Man of Tomorrow pain and weakness whenever he approaches Not realizing humans can be affected by severe or long term meteoric radiation exposure Luthor eventually suffers from Kryptonite poisoning He had his right hand amputated to prevent the cancer s spread and not long afterwards said kryptonite ring which he kept in cold storage prior to the surgery would be stolen Eventually coming into the possession of Superman who in turn entrusts it to Batman tasking the Dark Knight to use it if the Man of Steel ever becomes corrupt or falls under the control of another But removing the tainted limb was a mere half measure as his affliction had already metastasized rendering Lex s condition terminal br Luthor fakes his death in a plane crash in the Andes and secretly has his brain transferred to a cloned body one younger taller with full hair and more physically fit With aid from trusted assistants the now physically year old Luthor presents himself to the world as his own hitherto unknown illegitimate son and heir from Australia Lex Luthor II who only wishes to do good and can t be judged by the actions of his father He quickly manipulates and recruits the new Supergirl a protoplasmic being who falls in love with him due to his resemblance to her lost love and creator the Luthor of a parallel Earth When Superman is seemingly killed by the living weapon Doomsday the genetic research facility Project Cadmus creates a seeming clone of the hero called Superboy Kon El As Earth science cannot perfectly replicate Kryptonian DNA Superboy is created by genetic manipulation essentially giving him Superman s DNA and DNA of a human being revealed years later to be Luthor himself br Luthor s clone body eventually begins to deteriorate causing him to lose his hair and age at an accelerated rate a side effect of a disease affecting all clones Lois Lane discovers proof of Luthor s clone harvesting and false identity and exposes him with help from Superman Desperate to evade arrest Luthor activates technology left on Earth by Brainiac destroying large sections of Metropolis in the process In the end Luthor becomes a prisoner in his own body unable to move or even blink internally swearing vengeance on Superman During the crossover Underworld Unleashed the demon lord Neron offers Luthor full health and vitality in exchange for services and his soul Not believing in the existence of souls Lex agrees and is restored regaining the physical fitness of his Lex II body but again lacking head and facial hair and is physically approximately in his true age His soul is later restored after Neron is defeated by Captain Marvel and the Trickster Returning to Metropolis Luthor submits to a trial He claims all his crimes were committed by a violent clone created by renegade scientists from Cadmus Labs who secretly held the true Luthor hostage Luthor is acquitted of all charges He later arranges to reacquire his old kryptonite ring br When Superman and others form a new powerful version of the Justice League of America Lex decides this is Superman s direct challenge to his own power so he creates a new Injustice Gang in response Along with his new teammates Lex acquires a powerful artifact known as the Worlogog which can warp space and time The Injustice Gang kills several people while attacking the League then lures the heroes into a trap but then is defeated The Joker gains control of the Worlogog but is then telepathically attacked becoming temporarily sane and remorseful Before the killer s mind reverts Luthor has Joker use the Worlogog to revise history so that those killed no longer died With the deaths removed and little physical evidence linking him to any wrongdoing Luthor is free to go While Batman concludes Luthor simply used Joker to avoid murder charges Superman believes it is a sign Luthor does not truly desire the deaths of innocents and still has the potential to be a good man br Luthor marries Contessa Erica Alexanda Del Portenza a near immortal and formidable woman with her own agenda After the birth of their daughter Lena Luthor attempts to raise the girl without her interference After several clashes Luthor has the Contessa seemingly killed by a missile barrage Later on the time traveling villain Brainiac infuses Metropolis with technology from the future while his ancestor Brainiac in need of a new physical vessel mentally inhabits young Lena s body Brainiac offers Luthor control of

first action as president is to take a proposed moratorium on fossil based fuels to the U S Congress On the night of the election Batman threatens that Luthor can keep the kryptonite ring or the White House but not both Later on Superman Batman and Lois Lane seemingly try to steal the ring only to be thwarted In actuality they manipulated Luthor into retrieving a fake while Batman keeps the actual ring Superman upon learning that Lex Luthor was about to be elected president flew off in a fit of rage and split one of Saturn s small moons in half with one fly through br Before he takes office in the White House Luthor cuts ties with his own company LexCorp turning over leadership to Talia al Ghul using the alias Talia Head daughter of international terrorist cult leader Ra s al Ghul one of Batman s greatest enemies Luthor s popularity is assisted by the extreme unpopularity of the previous administration s mishandling of the Gotham City earthquake crisis as depicted in the No Man s Land storyline in the Batman titles and his own seemingly heroic efforts to rebuild Gotham before it rejoins the United States Batman learns Luthor attempted to take control of Gotham by forging deeds for its lands in his own name This results in Bruce Wayne severing all commercial ties between the U S government and his company Wayne Enterprises In response to Wayne Enterprises severing ties with his government Luthor arranges the murder of Wayne s lover Vesper Fairchild and frames Wayne for the murder as seen in Bruce Wayne Fugitive the plan being more successful than Luthor anticipated when his chosen assassin of David Cain realizes Wayne s identity as Batman and sets up a complex frame br Soon after Luthor discovers evidence that leads him to conclude Clark Kent is Superman the Our Worlds at War saga begins in which Topeka Kansas is destroyed in an attack by the alien Imperiex Luthor is warned of the impending attack beforehand but alerts no one so Earth can enter a great war and he can prove his leadership to the world Luthor coordinates the U S Army Earth s superheroes and a number of untrustworthy alien forces to battle the main villain of the story arc Although Lex Luthor is able to devise a plan to destroy Imperiex s body the plan is subsequently hijacked by Brainiac requiring Superman to propose a new plan where Darkseid and Luthor coordinate their efforts to defeat Imperiex by sending him back in time Following the battle Superman retrieves Lena and returns her to Lex advising Luthor to stop trying to be a god and just be a man Soon afterward Superman s

removing Lex Luthor s knowledge that the Man of Steel is Clark Kent br br br Presidential appointees br Cabinet officials br br Other appointments br br br Revised backstory and removal from office br Following the publication of Superman Birthright in Luthor s history is altered and the new canon is quickly referenced in both Superman comics and the series Superman Batman that begins in In the new history Luthor is only a few years older than Clark Kent and his family moves to Smallville when he is a teenager Possibly abused by his father Lionel and alienated from others by his intelligence and his ignorance of certain social cues and behaviors he does not understand why gifts are given on birthdays without a promise of payment of some kind Lex only finds friendship with Clark impressed by the young man s knowledge though also finding him naive Luthor discovers kryptonite meteors in Smallville and uses the radioactive mineral as a power source for his experiments When Clark sees the machine and feels ill from proximity to kryptonite Luthor mistakes his reaction to mean the young man doesn t believe in the experiment that he also thinks Lex is lying or crazy as others do The machine then explodes and Luthor survives but loses his hair as a result of radiation Years later his scientific research largely based on his ideas about alien life results in a small fortune that he uses to create LexCorp When Superman appears in Metropolis Lex is angered the man won t bow to his control and takes it very personally that a powerful alien the kind of companion Luthor had often hoped for and believed would see him as a peer instead looks on him with disapproval and moral judgment This along with Superman interfering with his criminal agenda and openly disrespecting Luthor in front of the media motivates Lex to humiliate and destroy the alien hero br The initial story arc of the Superman Batman ongoing series depicts the fall of Luthor s reign as U S president before he finishes his first term of office In The World s Finest more commonly referred to as Public Enemies a kryptonite asteroid threatens Earth with its incoming impact and intense radiation Luthor has been secretly injecting himself with a new version of the super steroid Venom a chemical associated with the Batman villain Bane mixed with liquified synthetic kryptonite of his own design While increasing his physical strength and speed it starts making him irrational and more prone to aggression Seeing an opportunity with the appearance of the asteroid Luthor decides to finally end Superman and tells the media that he has evidence the Man of Steel himself is drawing the deadly radioactive rock towards Earth He offers a billion dollar reward for the Last Son of Krypton s capture As these efforts fail and the meteorite is destroyed an enraged Luthor decides to fight Superman directly injecting himself with more of the synthetic kryptonite laced Venom and donning a high tech warsuit br Maddened by the Venom Luthor admits during the battle that he has no real proof Superman is the cause of the deadly asteroid heading to Earth and reveals he traded the creature Doomsday a living weapon of mass destruction to Darkseid in return for weapons during the Our Worlds at War crisis and Apokoliptian technology to create a new warsuit a deal that was done illegally and would be considered immoral by many After Superman damages his warsuit Luthor retreats to LexCorp HQ only to discover that Talia has sold the entire company to the Wayne Foundation Without resources and realizing his confession to
