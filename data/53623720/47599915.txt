Minions Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack album to the film Minions a spin off prequel and the third installment overall in the Despicable Me franchise directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda the latter in his feature directorial debut The original music is composed by Heitor Pereira who previously worked on Despicable Me and Despicable Me where he composed the score with Pharrell Williams Minions however is the first film in the franchise without the involvement of Williams and Pereira taking over the sole credit as the composer The soundtrack for the film was released alongside the film on July by Back Lot Music br br br Development br Pereira who watched the Despicable Me films observed audience reaction to the Minion characters and felt that this is now a part of their lives and I want to do justice to this dedication from the audience resulting him to score for Minions The score was fully orchestrated and dramatic to give a feel of classic action film As the film was mostly set during the s Pereira recorded the music using vintage microphones which were used by The Beach Boys and Frank Sinatra which he felt as an opportunity to pay homage to the musicians and technicians of that time and also inspired composers such as Henry Mancini Lalo Schifrin and John Barry He had stated on the selection of popular songs from the s saying Those songs represent an era but they also have to have a relationship to the moment in the movie where they appear The directors love music and those were the songs that they felt at the moment represented the storytelling the most like You Really Got Me or My Generation He also featured some of the songs in the film are sung by the Minions themselves He added that it was fun to write music around it and try to make the orchestral music and band music to somehow be holding hands with the music of the period without sounding like somebody that wrote the music then br br Pereira compared the music for the Minions to that of the Three Stooges where the difference is Minions could not speak English He further said that Their language is not language but the cumulative aspect of the repetition of those words is like creating a language in itself In Minions a lot of things go by and then the narrator has left the movie and now they are out there on their own Instead of compensating for their lack of language I decided to back off give them space and let their phonetic sounds be very clear That was a lot of fun because we almost made a dictionary of their sounds and let the music follow the same kind of repetition Pereira took the music from their travel through time and acquired all the personalities through the score br While the Minions had their own themes Pereira wrote a new theme for Scarlet Overkill Sandra Bullock who has stated that Scarlet is not like Lucy in Despicable Me Lucy was helping I tried to make her a little more sweet in a way But with Scarlet I tried to make her sound as hard as possible powerful and mean but with a groove She is a beautiful character and we can use her movements to accent the music For example where she puts all the villains to a test so that the one that captures the diamond is the one that eventually she will chose to be her helper br The score was recorded at Los Angeles in Newman Scoring Stage th Century Fox Studios and EastWest Studios The Los Angeles Orchestra performed the score consisting of violins violas eight cellos five basses five saxophones including a bass sax five trumpets two trombones tuba a choir of nearly members a rhythm section and a drummer In order to create the British jazz sound resembling the music of the United Kingdom in the s Pereira invited a jazz ensemble consisted of woodwinds clarinets piccolos alongside drums and brass in the same room instead of recording each instrumentalists in separate sections He also used percussion instruments for big cues br br br Track listing br br br Reception br The music received positive critical response Filmtracks com wrote don t expect to sit through a soundtrack like Minions without having already recognized some affinity for the film because it is quite challenging to tolerate without any sense of context Those listening to the score cold may find the action cues Minion Mission in particular to be of standalone interest as the orchestra is nicely layered with the solo woodwind and vocal layers in these parts but the rest may yield psychological unrest for the uninitiated Although the album presentation s cues are quite short as expected the entire original score portion clocks in at over minutes a nice treat for fans of Pereira s wild and gregarious approach to the concept Unger the Radar wrote Heitor Pereira has delivered one of the best scores of the year so far and certainly one of the best animated scores of his career With his name firmly cemented in the Remote Control family and a real gift in film scoring he is certainly an artist and a strong name to watch because he certainly knows how to pick projects and provide some very strong music Minions is just another notch in his belt of powerful
