The American Mathematical Society AMS is an association of professional mathematicians dedicated to the interests of mathematical research and scholarship and serves the national and international community through its publications meetings advocacy and other programs br The society is one of the four parts of the Joint Policy Board for Mathematics and a member of the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences br br br History br The AMS was founded in as the New York Mathematical Society the brainchild of Thomas Fiske who was impressed by the London Mathematical Society on a visit to England John Howard Van Amringe became the first president while Fiske became secretary The society soon decided to publish a journal but ran into some resistance over concerns about competing with the American Journal of Mathematics The result was the Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society with Fiske as editor in chief The de facto journal as intended was influential in increasing membership The popularity of the Bulletin soon led to the launches of the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society and Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society which were also de facto journals br In Charlotte Scott of Britain became the first woman to join the AMS then called the New York Mathematical Society The society reorganized under its present name American Mathematical Society and became a national society in and that year Scott became the first woman on the first Council of the society In Anna Pell Wheeler became the first woman to present a lecture at the society s Colloquium br In there was a southeastern sectional meeting of the Mathematical Association of America in Nashville The citation delivered at the MAA awards presentation where Lee Lorch received a standing ovation recorded that br br Lee Lorch the chair of the mathematics department at Fisk University and three Black colleagues Evelyn Boyd now Granville Walter Brown and H M Holloway came to the meeting and were able to attend the scientific sessions However the organizer for the closing banquet refused to honor the reservations of these four mathematicians Letters in Science August pp spell out the details Lorch and his colleagues wrote to the governing bodies of the AMS American Mathematical Society and MAA seeking bylaws against discrimination Bylaws were not changed but non discriminatory policies were established and have been strictly observed since then br Also in the American Mathematical Society s headquarters moved from New York City to Providence Rhode Island The society later added an office in Ann Arbor Michigan in and an office in Washington D C in br In the society called for the creation of a new teaching degree a Doctor of Arts in Mathematics similar to a PhD but without a research thesis br In the s as reported in A Brief History of the Association for Women in Mathematics The Presidents Perspectives by Lenore Blum In those years the AMS was governed by what could only be called an old boys network closed to all but those in the inner circle Mary W Gray challenged that situation by sitting in on the Council meeting in Atlantic City When she was told she had to leave she refused saying she would wait until the police came Mary relates the story somewhat differently When she was told she had to leave she responded she could find no rules in the by laws restricting attendance at Council meetings She was then told it was by gentlemen s agreement Naturally Mary replied Well obviously I m no gentleman After that time Council meetings were open to observers and the process of democratization of the Society had begun Also in the AMS established its Joint Committee on Women in the Mathematical Sciences JCW which later became a joint committee of multiple scholarly societies br Julia Robinson was the first female president of the American Mathematical Society but was unable to complete her term as she was suffering from leukemia br In the Journal of the American Mathematical Society was created with the intent of being the flagship journal of the AMS br br br Meetings br The AMS along with more than a dozen other organizations holds the largest annual research mathematics meeting in the world the Joint Mathematics Meeting in early January The Joint Mathematics Meeting in Baltimore drew approximately attendees Each of the four regional sections of the AMS Central Eastern Southeastern and Western holds meetings in the spring and fall of each year The society also co sponsors meetings with other international mathematical societies br br br Fellows br br The AMS selects an annual class of Fellows who have made outstanding contributions to the advancement of mathematics br br br Publications br The AMS publishes Mathematical Reviews a database of reviews of mathematical publications various journals and books In the AMS acquired the Chelsea Publishing Company which it continues to use as an imprint In the AMS acquired the MAA Press the book publishing program of the Mathematical Association of America The AMS will continue to publish books under the MAA Press imprint br Journals br br General br

br Posters about mathematicians and mathematics br Mathematical Moments posters and interviews about applications of math to science and society br Math in the Media a monthly rundown of news articles that mention math paired with classroom activities on the relevant math concepts br br br Typesetting br The AMS was an early advocate of the typesetting program TeX requiring that contributions be written in it and producing its own packages AMS TeX and AMS LaTeX TeX and LaTeX are now ubiquitous in mathematical publishing br br br Presidents br The AMS is led by the President who is elected for
