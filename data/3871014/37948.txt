Purple is a color similar in appearance to violet light In the RYB color model historically used in the arts purple is a secondary color created by combining red and blue pigments In the CMYK color model used in modern printing purple is made by combining magenta pigment with either cyan pigment black pigment or both In the RGB color model used in computer and television screens purple is created by mixing red and blue light in order to create colors that appear similar to violet light br Purple has long been associated with royalty originally because Tyrian purple dye made from the secretions of sea snails was extremely expensive in antiquity Purple was the color worn by Roman magistrates it became the imperial color worn by the rulers of the Byzantine Empire and the Holy Roman Empire and later by Roman Catholic bishops Similarly in Japan the color is traditionally associated with the emperor and aristocracy br According to contemporary surveys in Europe and the United States purple is the color most often associated with rarity royalty luxury ambition magic mystery piety and spirituality When combined with pink it is associated with eroticism femininity and seduction br br br Etymology and definitions br The modern English word purple comes from the Old English purpul which derives from Latin purpura which in turn derives from the Greek porphura the name of the Tyrian purple dye manufactured in classical antiquity from a mucus secreted by the spiny dye murex snail The first recorded use of the word purple dates to the late s AD br br br In art history and fashion br br br In prehistory and the ancient world Tyrian purple br br Purple first appeared in prehistoric art during the Neolithic era The artists of Pech Merle cave and other Neolithic sites in France used sticks of manganese and hematite powder to draw and paint animals and the outlines of their own hands on the walls of their caves These works have been dated to between and BC br Purple textiles dating back to the early second millennium BCE were found in Syria making them the oldest known purple textiles in the world These findings include textiles from a burial site in Chagar Bazar dating back to the th th centuries BCE as well as preserved textile samples discovered in gypsum at the Royal Palace of Qatna br As early as the th century BC the citizens of Sidon and Tyre two cities on the coast of Ancient Phoenicia present day Lebanon were producing purple dye from a sea snail called the spiny dye murex Clothing colored with the Tyrian dye was mentioned in both the Iliad of Homer and the Aeneid of Virgil The deep rich purple dye made from this snail became known as Tyrian purple br The process of making the dye was long difficult and expensive Thousands of the tiny snails had to be found their shells cracked the snail removed Mountains of empty shells have been found at the ancient sites of Sidon and Tyre The snails were left to soak then a tiny gland was removed and the juice extracted and put in a basin which was placed in the sunlight There a remarkable transformation took place In the sunlight the juice turned white then yellow green then green then violet then a red which turned darker and darker The process had to be stopped at exactly the right time to obtain the desired color which could range from a bright crimson to a dark purple the color of dried blood Then either wool linen or silk would be dyed The exact hue varied between crimson and violet but it was always rich bright and lasting br Tyrian purple became the color of kings nobles priests and magistrates all around the Mediterranean It was mentioned in the Hebrew Bible Old Testament in the Book of Exodus God instructs Moses to have the Israelites bring him an offering including cloth of blue and purple and scarlet to be used in the curtains of the Tabernacle and the garments of priests The term used for purple in the th century Latin Vulgate version of the Bible passage is purpura or Tyrian purple In the Iliad of Homer the belt of Ajax is purple and the tails of the horses of Trojan warriors are dipped in purple In the Odyssey the blankets on the wedding bed of Odysseus are purple In the poems of Sappho th century BC she celebrates the skill of the dyers of the Greek kingdom of Lydia who made purple footwear and in the play of Aeschylus BC Queen Clytemnestra welcomes back her husband Agamemnon by decorating the palace with purple carpets In BC King Solomon was reported to have brought artisans from Tyre to provide purple fabrics to decorate the Temple of Jerusalem br Alexander the Great when giving imperial audiences as the basileus of the Macedonian Empire the basileus of the Seleucid Empire and the kings of Ptolemaic Egypt all wore Tyrian purple br The Roman custom of wearing purple togas may have come from the Etruscans an Etruscan tomb painting from the th century BC shows a nobleman wearing a deep purple and embroidered toga br In Ancient Rome the Toga praetexta was an ordinary white toga with a broad purple stripe on its border It was worn by freeborn Roman boys who had not yet come of age curule magistrates certain categories of priests and a few other categories of citizens br The Toga picta was solid purple embroidered with gold During the Roman Republic it was worn by generals in their triumphs and by the Praetor Urbanus when he rode in the chariot of the gods into the circus at the Ludi Apollinares During the Empire the toga picta was worn by magistrates giving public gladiatorial games and by the consuls as well as by the emperor on special occasions br During the Roman Republic when a triumph was held the general being honored wore an entirely purple toga bordered in gold and Roman Senators wore a toga with a purple stripe However during the Roman Empire purple was more and more associated exclusively with the emperors and their officers Suetonius claims that the early emperor Caligula had the King of Mauretania murdered for the splendour of his purple cloak and that Nero forbade the use of certain purple dyes In the late empire the sale of purple cloth became a state monopoly protected by the death penalty br According to the New Testament Jesus Christ in the hours leading up to his crucifixion was dressed in purple porphura by the Roman garrison to mock his claim to be King of the Jews br The actual color of Tyrian purple seems to have varied from a reddish to a bluish purple According to the Roman writer Vitruvius st century BC the murex shells coming from northern waters probably Bolinus brandaris produced a more bluish color than those of the south probably Hexaplex trunculus The most valued shades were said to be those closer to the color of dried blood as seen in the mosaics of the robes of the Emperor Justinian in Ravenna The chemical composition of the dye from the murex is close to that of the dye from indigo and indigo was sometimes used to make a counterfeit Tyrian purple a crime which was severely punished What seems to have mattered about Tyrian purple was not its color but its luster richness its resistance to weather and light and its high price br In modern times Tyrian purple has been recreated at great expense When the German chemist Paul Friedander tried to recreate Tyrian purple in he needed twelve thousand mollusks to create ounces of dye enough to color a handkerchief In the year a gram of Tyrian purple made from ten thousand mollusks according to the original formula cost two thousand euros br br br China br br In ancient China purple was obtained not through the Mediterranean mollusc but purple gromwell The dye obtained did not easily adhere to fabrics making purple fabrics expensive Purple became a fashionable color in the state of Qi BC BC because its ruler Duke Huan of Qi developed a preference for it As a result the price of purple fabric was over five times that of plain fabric His minister Guan Zhong eventually convinced him to relinquish this preference br China was the first culture to develop a synthetic purple color br An old hypothesis suggested links between the Chinese purple and blue and Egyptian blue however molecular structure analysis and evidence such as the absence of lead in Egyptian blue and the lack of examples of Egyptian blue in China argued against the hypothesis The use of quartz barium and lead components in ancient Chinese glass and Han purple and Han blue has been used to suggest a connection between glassmaking and the manufacture of pigments and to prove the independence of the Chinese invention Taoist alchemists may have developed Han purple from their knowledge of glassmaking br Lead is used by the pigment maker to lower the melting point of the barium in Han Purple br Purple was regarded as a secondary color in ancient China In classical times secondary colors were not as highly prized as the five primary colors of the Chinese spectrum and purple was used to allude to impropriety in contrast to crimson which was deemed a primary color and symbolized legitimacy Nevertheless by the th century AD purple was ranked above crimson Several changes to the ranks of colors occurred after that time br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Purple in the Byzantine Empire and Carolingian Europe br Through the early Christian era the rulers of the Byzantine Empire continued the use of purple as the imperial color for diplomatic gifts and even for imperial documents and the pages of the Bible Gospel manuscripts were written in gold lettering on parchment that was colored Tyrian purple Empresses gave birth in the Purple Chamber and the emperors born there were known as born to the purple to separate them from emperors who won or seized the title through political intrigue or military force Bishops of the Byzantine church wore white robes with stripes of purple while government officials wore squares of purple fabric to show their rank br In western Europe the Emperor Charlemagne was crowned in wearing a mantle of Tyrian purple and was buried in in a shroud of the same color which still exists see below However after the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in the color lost its imperial status The great dye works of Constantinople were destroyed and gradually scarlet made with dye from the cochineal insect became the royal color in Europe br br br br br br br br br br br br The Middle Ages and Renaissance br In Pope Paul II decreed that cardinals should no longer wear Tyrian purple and instead wear scarlet from kermes and alum since the dye from Byzantium was no longer available Bishops and archbishops of a lower status than cardinals were assigned the color purple but not the rich Tyrian purple They wore cloth dyed first with the less expensive indigo blue then overlaid with red made from kermes dye br While purple was worn less frequently by Medieval and Renaissance kings and princes it was worn by the professors of many of Europe s new universities Their robes were modeled after those of the clergy and they often wore square violet or purple violet caps and robes or black robes with purple violet trim Purple violet robes were particularly worn by students of divinity br Purple and violet also played an important part in the religious paintings of the Renaissance Angels and the Virgin Mary were often portrayed wearing purple or violet robes br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br th and th centuries br In the th century purple was still worn on occasion by Catherine the Great and other rulers by bishops and in lighter shades by members of the aristocracy but rarely by ordinary people because of its high cost But in the th century that changed br In an eighteen year old British chemistry student named William Henry Perkin was trying to make a synthetic quinine His experiments produced instead the first synthetic aniline dye a purple shade called mauveine shortened simply to mauve It took its name from the mallow flower which is the same color The new color quickly became fashionable particularly after Queen Victoria wore a silk gown dyed with mauveine to the Royal Exhibition of Prior to Perkin s discovery mauve was a color which only the aristocracy and rich could afford to wear Perkin developed an industrial process built a factory and produced the dye by the ton so almost anyone could wear mauve It was the first of a series of modern industrial dyes which completely transformed both the chemical industry and fashion br Purple was popular with the pre Raphaelite painters in Britain including Arthur Hughes who loved bright colors and romantic scenes br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br th and st centuries br At the turn of the century purple was a favorite color of the Austrian painter Gustav Klimt who flooded his pictures with sensual purples and violets br In the th century purple retained its historic connection with royalty George VI wore purple in his official portrait and it was prominent in every feature of the coronation of Elizabeth II in from the invitations to the stage design inside Westminster Abbey But at the same time it was becoming associated with social change with the Women s Suffrage movement for the right to vote for women in the early decades of the century with Feminism in the s and with the psychedelic drug culture of the s br In the early th century purple green and white were the colors of the Women s Suffrage movement which fought to win the right to vote for women finally succeeding with the th Amendment to the U S Constitution in Later in the s in a tribute to the Suffragettes it became the color of the women s liberation movement br In the concentration camps of Nazi Germany prisoners who were members of non conformist religious groups such as the Jehovah s Witnesses were required to wear a purple triangle br During the s and early s it was also associated with counterculture psychedelics and musicians like Jimi Hendrix with his song Purple Haze or the English rock band of Deep Purple which formed in Later in the s it was featured in the song and album Purple Rain by the American musician Prince br The Purple Rain Protest was a protest against apartheid that took place in Cape Town South Africa on September in which a police water cannon with purple dye sprayed thousands of demonstrators This led to the slogan The Purple Shall Govern br The violet or purple necktie became very popular at the end of the first decade of the st century particularly among political and business leaders It combined the assertiveness and confidence of a red necktie with the sense of peace and cooperation of a blue necktie and it went well with the blue business suit worn by most national and corporate leaders br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br In science and nature br br br Optics br The meanings of the color terms violet and purple varies even among native speakers of English for example between United Kingdom and United States Optics research on purple and violet contains contributions of authors from different countries and different native languages it is likely to be inconsistent in the use and meaning of the two colors br According to some speakers authors of English purple unlike violet is not one of the colors of the visible spectrum It was not one of the colors of the rainbow identified by Isaac Newton According to some authors purple does not have its own wavelength of light For this reason it is sometimes called a non spectral color It exists in culture and art but not in the same way that violet does in optics According to some speakers of English purple is simply a combination in various proportions of two primary colors red and blue According to other speakers of English the same range of colors is called violet br In some textbooks of color theory and depending on the geographical cultural origin of the author a purple is defined as any non spectral color between violet and red excluding violet and red themselves In that case the spectral colors violet and indigo would not be shades of purple For other speakers of English these colors are shades of purple br In the traditional color wheel long used by painters purple is placed between crimson and violet However also here there is much variation in color terminology depending on cultural background of the painters and authors and sometimes the term violet is used and placed in between red and blue on the traditional color wheel In a slightly different variation on the color wheel purple is placed between magenta and violet This shade is sometimes called electric purple See shades of purple br In the RGB color model named for the colors red green and blue used to create all the colors on a computer screen or television the range of purples is created by mixing red and blue light of different intensities on a black screen The standard HTML color purple is created by red and blue light of equal intensity at a brightness that is halfway between full power and darkness br In color printing purple is sometimes represented by the color magenta or sometimes by mixing magenta with red or blue It can also be created by mixing just red and blue alone but in that case the purple is less bright with lower br saturation or intensity A less bright purple can also be created with light or paint by adding a certain quantity of the third primary color green for light or yellow for pigment br br br Relationship with violet br br Purple is closely associated with violet In common usage both refer to a variety of colors between blue and red in hue Historically purple has tended to be used for redder hues and violet for bluer hues In optics violet is a spectral color it refers to the color of any different single wavelength of light on the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum between approximately and nanometers whereas purple is the color of various combinations of red blue and violet light some of which humans perceive as similar to violet br On a chromaticity diagram the straight line connecting the extreme spectral colors red and violet is known as the line of purples or purple boundary it represents one limit of human color perception The color magenta used in the CMYK printing process is near the center of the line of purples but most people associate the term purple with a somewhat bluer tone such as is displayed by the color electric purple a color also directly on the line of purples shown below br On the CIE xy chromaticity diagram violet is on the curved edge in the lower left while purples are on the straight line connecting the extreme colors red and violet this line is known as the line of purples or the purple line br br br br br br br br br br br br Pigments br Hematite and manganese are the oldest pigments used for the color purple They were used by Neolithic artists in the form of sticks like charcoal or ground and powdered and mixed with fat and used as a paint Hematite is a reddish iron oxide which when ground coarsely makes a purple pigment One such pigment is caput mortuum whose name is also used in reference to mummy brown The latter is another pigment containing hematite and historically produced with the use of mummified corpses Some of its compositions produce a purple color and may be called mummy violet Manganese was also used in Roman times to color glass purple br Han purple was the first synthetic purple pigment invented in China in about BC It was used in wall paintings and pottery and other applications In color it was very close to indigo which had a similar chemical structure Han purple was very unstable and sometimes was the result of the chemical breakdown of Han blue br During the Middle Ages artists usually made purple by combining red and blue pigments most often blue azurite or lapis lazuli with red ochre cinnabar or minium They also combined lake colors made by mixing dye with powder using woad or indigo dye for the blue and dye made from cochineal for the red br br Cobalt violet was the first modern synthetic color in the purple family manufactured in It was found along with cobalt blue in the palette of Claude Monet Paul Signac and Georges Seurat It was stable but had low tinting power and was expensive so quickly went out of use br Manganese violet was a stronger color than cobalt violet and replaced it on the market br Quinacridone violet one of a modern synthetic organic family of colors was discovered in but not marketed until It is sold today under a number of brand names br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Dyes br The most famous purple dye in the ancient world was Tyrian purple made from a type of sea snail called the murex found around the Mediterranean See history section above br In western Polynesia residents of the islands made a purple dye similar to Tyrian purple from the sea urchin In Central America the inhabitants made a dye from a different sea snail the purpura found on the coasts of Costa Rica and Nicaragua The Mayans used this color to dye fabric for religious ceremonies while the Aztecs used it for paintings of ideograms where it symbolized royalty br In the Middle Ages those who worked with blue and black dyes belonged to separate guilds from those who worked with red and yellow dyes and were often forbidden to dye any other colors than those of their own guild Most purple fabric was made by the dyers who worked with red and who used dye from madder or cochineal so Medieval violet colors were inclined toward red br Orcein or purple moss was another common purple dye It was known to the ancient Greeks and Hebrews and was made from a Mediterranean lichen called archil or dyer s moss Roccella tinctoria combined with an ammoniac usually urine Orcein began to achieve popularity again in the th century when violet and purple became the color of demi mourning worn after a widow or widower had worn black for a certain time before he or she returned to wearing ordinary colors br From the Middle Ages onward purple dyes for the clothing of common people were often made from the blackberry or other red fruit of the genus rubus or from the mulberry All of these dyes were more reddish than bluish and faded easily with washing and exposure to sunlight br A popular new dye which arrived in Europe from the New World during the Renaissance was made from the wood of the logwood tree Haematoxylum campechianum which grew in Spanish Mexico Depending on the different minerals added to the dye it produced a blue red black or with the addition of alum a purple color it made a good color but like earlier dyes it did not resist sunlight or washing br In the th century chemists in England France and Germany began to create the first synthetic dyes Two synthetic purple dyes were invented at about the same time Cudbear is a dye extracted from orchil lichens that can be used to dye wool and silk without the use of mordant Cudbear was developed by Dr Cuthbert Gordon of Scotland production began in The lichen is first boiled in a solution of ammonium carbonate The mixture is then cooled and ammonia is added and the mixture is kept damp for weeks Then the lichen is dried and ground to powder The manufacture details were carefully protected with a ten feet high wall being built around the manufacturing facility and staff consisting of Highlanders sworn to secrecy br French purple was developed in France at about the same time The lichen is extracted by urine or ammonia Then the extract is acidified the dissolved dye precipitates and is washed Then it is dissolved in ammonia again the solution is heated in air until it becomes purple then it is precipitated with calcium chloride the resulting dye was more solid and stable than other purples br Cobalt violet is a synthetic pigment that was invented in the second half of the th century and is made by a similar process as cobalt blue cerulean blue and cobalt green It is the violet pigment most commonly used today by artists In spite of its name this pigment produces a purple rather than violet color br Mauveine also known as aniline purple and Perkin s mauve was the first synthetic organic chemical dye discovered serendipitously in br Its chemical name is amino dimethyl phenyl p tolylamino phenazinium acetate br Fuchsine was another synthetic dye made shortly after mauveine It produced a brilliant fuchsia color br In the s a new family of purple and violet synthetic organic pigments called quinacridone came onto the market It had originally been discovered in but were not synthesized until and not manufactured until the s The colors in the group range from deep red to bluish purple in color and have the molecular formula C H N O They have strong resistance to sunlight and washing and are widely used today in oil paints water

called anthocyanins These pigments are found in the leaves roots stems vegetables fruits and flowers of all plants They aid photosynthesis by blocking harmful wavelengths of light that would damage the leaves In flowers the purple anthocyanins help attract insects who pollinate the flowers Not all anthocyanins are purple they vary in color from red to purple to blue green or yellow depending

ocean and shoreline would have been colored purple this is called the Purple Earth hypothesis br br br Astronomy br One of the stars in the Pleiades called Pleione is sometimes called Purple Pleione because being a fast spinning star it has a purple hue caused by its blue white color being obscured by a spinning ring of electrically excited red hydrogen gas br The Purple Forbidden enclosure is a

observed that the greater the distance between a viewers eyes and mountains the lighter and more blue or purple they will appear This phenomenon long recognized by Leonardo da Vinci and other painters is called aerial perspective or atmospheric perspective The more distant the mountains are the less contrast the eye sees between the mountains and the sky br The bluish color is caused by an optical effect called Rayleigh scattering The sunlit sky is blue because air scatters short wavelength light more than longer wavelengths Since blue light is at the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum it is more strongly scattered in the atmosphere than long wavelength red light The result is that the human eye perceives blue when looking toward parts of the sky other than the sun br At sunrise and sunset the light is passing through the atmosphere at a lower angle and traveling a greater distance through a larger volume of air Much of the green and blue is scattered away and more red light comes to the eye creating the colors of the sunrise and sunset and making the mountains look purple br The phenomenon is referenced in the song America the Beautiful where the lyrics refer to purple mountains majesty among other features of the United States landscape A Crayola crayon called Purple Mountain Majesty in reference to the lyric was first formulated in br br br br br br br br br br br br Mythology br Julius Pollux a Greek grammarian who lived in the second century AD attributed the discovery of purple to the Phoenician god and guardian of the city of Tyre Heracles According to his account while walking along the shore with the nymph Tyrus the god s dog bit into a murex shell causing his mouth to turn purple The nymph subsequently requested that Heracles create a garment for her of that same color with Heracles obliging her demands giving birth to Tyrian purple br br br Associations and symbolism br br br Royalty br In Europe since some Roman emperors wore a
