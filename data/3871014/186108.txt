title: Color management
id: 186108
Color management is the process of ensuring consistent and accurate colors across various devices such as monitors printers and cameras It involves the use of color profiles which are standardized descriptions of how colors should be displayed or reproduced br Color management is necessary because different devices have different color capabilities and characteristics For example a monitor may display colors differently than a printer can reproduce them Without color management the same image may appear differently on different devices leading to inconsistencies and inaccuracies br To achieve color management a color profile is created for each device involved in the color workflow This profile describes the device s color capabilities and characteristics such as its color gamut range of colors it can display or reproduce and color temperature These profiles are then used to translate colors between devices ensuring consistent and accurate color reproduction br Color management is particularly important in industries such as graphic design photography and printing where accurate color representation is crucial It helps to maintain color consistency throughout the entire workflow from capturing an image to displaying or printing it br Parts of color management are implemented in the operating system OS helper libraries the application and devices The type of color profile that is typically used is called an ICC profile A cross platform view of color management is the use of an ICC compatible color management system The International Color Consortium ICC is an industry consortium that has defined br br an open standard for a Color Matching Module CMM at the OS level br color profiles for br devices including DeviceLink profiles that transform one device profile color space to another device profile without passing through an intermediate color space such as L A B more accurately preserving color br working spaces the color spaces in which color data is meant to be manipulated br There are other approaches to color management besides using ICC profiles This is partly due to history and partly because of other needs than the ICC standard covers The film and broadcasting industries make use of some of the same concepts but they frequently rely on more limited boutique solutions The film industry for instance often uses D LUTs lookup table to represent a complete color transformation for a specific RGB encoding br At the consumer level system wide color management is available in most of Apple s products macOS iOS iPadOS watchOS Microsoft Windows lacks system wide color management and virtually all applications do not employ color management Windows media player API is not color space aware and if applications want to color manage videos manually they have to incur significant performance and power consumption penalties Android supports system wide color management but most devices ship with color management disabled br br br Overview br Characterize Every color managed device requires a personalized table or color profile which characterizes the color response of that particular device br Standardize Each color profile describes these colors relative to a standardized set of reference colors the Profile Connection Space br Translate Color managed software then uses these standardized profiles to translate color from one device to another This is usually performed by a color management module CMM br br br Hardware br br br Characterization br br To describe the behavior of various output devices they must be compared measured in relation to a standard color space Often a step called linearization is performed first to undo the effect of gamma correction that was done to get the most out of limited bit color paths Instruments used for measuring device colors include colorimeters and spectrophotometers As an intermediate result the device gamut is described in the form of scattered measurement data The transformation of the scattered measurement data into a more regular form usable by the application is called profiling Profiling is a complex process involving mathematics intense computation judgment testing and iteration After the profiling is finished an idealized color description of the device is created This description is called a profile br br br Calibration br br Calibration is like characterization except that it can include the adjustment of the device as opposed to just the measurement of the device Color management is sometimes sidestepped by calibrating devices to a common standard color space such as sRGB when such calibration is done well enough no color translations are needed to get all devices to handle colors consistently This avoidance of the complexity of color management was one of the goals in the development of sRGB br br br Color profiles br br br Embedding br Image formats themselves such as TIFF JPEG PNG EPS PDF and SVG may contain embedded color profiles but are not required to do so by the image format The International Color Consortium standard was created to bring various developers and manufacturers together The ICC standard permits the exchange of output device characteristics and color spaces in the form of metadata This allows the embedding of color profiles into images as well as storing them in a database or a profile directory br br br Working spaces br Working spaces such as sRGB Adobe RGB or ProPhoto are color spaces that facilitate good results while editing For instance pixels with equal values of R G B should appear neutral Using a large gamut working space will lead to posterization while using a small working space will lead to clipping This trade off is a consideration for the critical image editor br br br Color transformation br Color transformation or color space conversion is the transformation of the representation of a color from one color space to another This calculation is required whenever data is exchanged inside a color managed chain and carried out by a Color Matching Module Transforming profiled color information to different output devices is achieved by referencing the profile data into a standard color space It makes it easier to convert colors from one device to a selected standard color space and from that to the colors of another device By ensuring that the reference color space covers the many possible colors that humans can see this concept allows one to exchange colors between many different color output devices Color transformations can be represented by two profiles source profile and target profile or by a devicelink profile In this process there are approximations involved which make sure that the image keeps its important color qualities and also gives an opportunity to control on how the colors are being changed br br br Profile connection space br In the terminology of the International Color Consortium a translation between two color spaces can go through a profile connection space PCS Color Space PCS CIELAB or CIEXYZ Color space conversions into and out of the PCS are each specified by a profile br br br Gamut mapping br In nearly every translation process we have to deal with the fact that the color gamut of different devices vary in range which makes an accurate reproduction impossible They therefore need some rearrangement near the borders of the gamut Some colors must be shifted to the inside of the gamut as they otherwise cannot be represented on the output device and would simply be clipped This so called gamut mismatch occurs for example when we translate from the RGB color space with a wider gamut into the CMYK color space with a narrower gamut range In this example the dark highly saturated purplish blue color of a typical computer monitor s blue primary is impossible to print on paper with a typical CMYK printer The nearest approximation within the printer s gamut will be much less saturated Conversely an inkjet printer s cyan primary a saturated mid brightness blue is outside the gamut of a typical computer monitor The color management system can utilize various methods to achieve desired results and give experienced users control of the gamut mapping behavior br br br Rendering intent br When the gamut of source color space exceeds that of the destination saturated colors are liable to become clipped inaccurately represented or more formally burned The color management module can deal with this problem in several ways The ICC specification includes four different rendering intents listed below Before the actual rendering intent is carried out one can temporarily simulate the rendering by soft proofing It is a useful tool as it predicts the outcome of the colors and is available as an application in many color management systems br br Absolute colorimetric br Absolute colorimetry and relative colorimetry actually use the same table but differ in the adjustment for the white point media If the output device has a much larger gamut than the source profile i e all the colors in the source can be represented in the output using the absolute colorimetry rendering intent would ideally ignoring noise precision etc give an exact output of the specified CIELAB values Perceptually the colors may appear incorrect but instrument measurements of the resulting output would match the source Colors outside of the proof print system s possible color are mapped to the boundary of the color gamut br br Absolute colorimetry is useful to get an exact specified color e g IBM blue or to quantify the accuracy of mapping methods br br Relative colorimetric br The goal in relative colorimetry is to be truthful to the specified color with only a correction for the media Relative colorimetry is useful in proofing applications since it can be used to get an idea of how a print on one device will appear on a different device Media differences are the only thing that one really should adjust for although some gamut mapping also needs to be applied Usually this is done in a way where hue and lightness are maintained at the cost of reduced saturation By default in gamut colors are unchanged while out of gamut colors are clamped br br Relative colorimetric is the default rendering intent on many systems br br Perceptual br The perceptual intent smoothly moves out of gamut colors into gamut preserving gradations but distorts in gamut colors in the process Like the saturation intent the results really depend upon the profile maker This is even how some of the competitors in this market differentiate themselves The profile maker tries to make results pleasing on this intent Perceptual rendering is recommended for color separation br br Saturation br The saturation intent is designed to present eye catching business graphics by preserving the saturation colorfulness It is most useful in charts and diagrams where there is a discrete palette of colors that the designer wants saturated to make them intense but where specific hue is less important br br In practice photographers almost always use relative or perceptual intent as for natural images absolute causes color cast while saturation produces unnatural colors If an entire image is in gamut relative is perfect but when there are out of gamut colors which is preferable depends on a case by case basis CMMs may offer options for BPC and partial chromatic adaptation br A black point correction BPC is not applied for absolute colorimetric or devicelink profiles For ICCv it is always applied to the perceptual intent ICCv sRGB profiles differ among each other in a number of ways one of which being whether BPC is applied br br br Implementation br br br Color management module br Color matching module also method or system is a software algorithm that adjusts the numerical values that get sent to or received from different devices so that the perceived color they produce remains consistent The key issue here is how to deal with a color that cannot be reproduced on a certain device in order to show it through a different device as if it were visually the same color just as when the reproducible color range between color transparencies and printed matters are different There is no common method for this process and the performance depends on the capability of each color matching method br Some well known CMMs are ColorSync Adobe CMM Little CMS and ArgyllCMS br br br Operating system level br br br Apple br Apple s classic Mac OS and macOS operating systems have provided OS level color management APIs since through ColorSync macOS has added automatic color management assuming sRGB for most things automatically in the OS but applications can explicitly target other color spaces if they wish to System wide color management is used in iOS iPadOS and watchOS as well br br br Windows br Since color management in Windows is available through an ICC color management system ICM Image Color Management br Beginning with Windows Vista Microsoft introduced a new color architecture known as WCS Windows Color System WCS supplements the ICM system in Windows and Windows XP originally written by Heidelberg br Windows Photo Viewer from Windows also included in later Windows versions performs proper color management however the newer Windows Photos app in Windows does not perform color management until version v br Unfortunately the vast majority of applications do not use the Windows Color System For applications that do employ color management typically web browsers color management tend to apply for only images and UI but not videos This is because Windows media player API is not color space aware Thus browsers Chrome Firefox Edge are only able to do color management for images but not video For the same reason virtually no video players on Windows support color management including the default Movies TV app and VLC with Media Player Classic Home Cinema being a rare exception br br br Android br On Android system wide color management is introduced in Android Oreo However most Android phones are shipped with color management disabled ex adaptive color profile on Google Pixel vivid color profile on Samsung Galaxy This oversaturates sRGB content to the native display gamut typically DCI P Users need to manually select the natural color profile to enable color management enabling accurate display of sRGB and P wide color content br br br Others br Operating systems that use the X Window System for graphics can use ICC profiles and support for color management on Linux still less mature than on other platforms is coordinated through OpenICC at freedesktop org and makes use of LittleCMS br br br File level br Certain image filetypes TIFF and Photoshop include the notion of color channels for specifying the color mode of the file The most commonly used channels are RGB mainly for display monitors but also for some desktop printing and CMYK for commercial printing An additional alpha channel may specify a transparency mask value Some image software such as Photoshop perform automatic color separation to maintain color information in CMYK mode using a specified ICC profile such as US Web Coated SWOP v br br br Application level br As of most web browsers ignored color profiles Notable exceptions were Safari starting with version and Firefox starting with version Although disabled by default in Firefox ICC v and ICC v color management could be enabled by using an add on or setting a configuration option br As of July Safari Chrome and Firefox fully support color management However it is important to note that most browsers only do color management for images and CSS elements but not video br br Firefox version released in onwards supports ICC v tagged images and version released in adds ICC v profiles support Version released in and above apply color management to all untagged images and page elements by default br Internet Explorer support ICC profiles from version onwards but only converts non sRGB images to the sRGB profile regardless of the actual monitor colorspace br Google Chrome uses the system provided ICC v and v support on macOS and from version released in supports ICC v profiles by default on other platforms macOS versions of Chrome correctly render video br Safari has support starting with version released in Supports v and v ICC profiles and correctly renders video br Opera has support since released in for ICC v br Pale Moon supported ICC v from its first release and v since Pale Moon released in br Regarding mobile browsers Safari on iOS recognizes the device color profile and can displays images accordingly Chrome on Android ignores the display profile simply converting all images to sRGB br As of Chrome Android Browser and Firefox for Android support multiple colorspaces The same is valid for their desktop counterparts Chrome Edge Safari Firefox and Opera br br br See also br Gamma correction br Color chart br Digital printing br ICC profile br International Color Consortium br IT br Adobe
