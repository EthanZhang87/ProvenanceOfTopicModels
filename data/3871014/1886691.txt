Theory of Colours German Zur Farbenlehre is a book by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe about the poet s views on the nature of colours and how they are perceived by humans It was published in German in and in English in The book contains detailed descriptions of phenomena such as coloured shadows refraction and chromatic aberration The book is a successor to two short essays titled Contributions to Optics German Beitr ge zur Optik br The work originated in Goethe s occupation with painting and primarily had its influence in the arts with painters such as Philipp Otto Runge J M W Turner the Pre Raphaelites Hilma af Klint and Wassily Kandinsky br Although Goethe s work was rejected by some physicists a number of philosophers and physicists have concerned themselves with it including Thomas Johann Seebeck Arthur Schopenhauer see On Vision and Colors Hermann von Helmholtz Ludwig Wittgenstein Werner Heisenberg Kurt G del and Mitchell Feigenbaum br Goethe s book provides a catalogue of how colour is perceived in a wide variety of circumstances and considers Isaac Newton s observations to be special cases Unlike Newton Goethe s concern was not so much with the analytic treatment of colour as with the qualities of how phenomena are perceived Philosophers have come to understand the distinction between the optical spectrum as observed by Newton and the phenomenon of human colour perception as presented by Goethe a subject analyzed at length by Wittgenstein in his comments on Goethe s theory in Remarks on Colour and in Jonathan Westphal s Commentary on this work br br br Historical background br br At Goethe s time it was generally acknowledged that as Isaac Newton had shown in his Opticks in colourless white light is split up into its component colours when directed through a prism br br Along with the rest of the world I was convinced that all the colours are contained in the light no one had ever told me anything different and I had never found the least cause to doubt it because I had no further interest in the subject br But how I was astonished as I looked at a white wall through the prism that it stayed white That only where it came upon some darkened area it showed some colour then at last around the window sill all the colours shone It didn t take long before I knew here was something significant about colour to be brought forth and I spoke as through an instinct out loud that the Newtonian teachings were false br br This experience gave him the decisive impetus to develop his own theory of colour and by Goethe had formulated his arguments against Newton in the essay ber Newtons Hypothese der diversen Refrangibilit t On Newton s hypothesis of diverse refrangibility Yet by Goethe had begun to increasingly note the importance of the physiological aspect of colours where it was even more difficult to distinguish between the objective and the subjective br As Goethe notes in the historical section Louis Bertrand Castel had already published a criticism of Newton s spectral description of prismatic colour in in which he observed that the sequence of colours split by a prism depended on the distance from the prism and that Newton was looking at a special case br Whereas Newton observed the colour spectrum cast on a wall at a fixed distance away from the prism Goethe observed the cast spectrum on a white card which was progressively moved away from the prism As the card was moved away the projected image elongated gradually assuming an elliptical shape and the coloured images became larger finally merging at the centre to produce green Moving the card farther led to the increase in the size of the image until finally the spectrum described by Newton in the Opticks was produced The image cast by the refracted beam was not fixed but rather developed with increasing distance from the prism Consequently Goethe saw the particular distance chosen by Newton to prove the second proposition of the Opticks as capriciously imposed Alex Kentsis Between Light and Eye br br The theory we set up against this begins with colourless light and avails itself of outward conditions to produce coloured phenomena but it concedes worth and dignity to these conditions It does not arrogate to itself developing colours from the light but rather seeks to prove by numberless cases that colour is produced by light as well as by what stands against it br Recently experiments by physicist Matthias Rang have demonstrated Goethe s discovery of complementarity as a symmetric property of spectral phenomena also a more recent rexamination of Newton s Experimentum Crucis has br br shown that the commonly accepted analysis contains assumptions in the choice of the spectrum and background which mask the inherent dynamic of the spectrum that apply under specific conditions that have later become standardized in Spectroscopy leading to a consensus regarding the relation of wavelength to colours of one particular spectrum br br br Goethe s theory br Goethe s theory of the constitution of colours of the spectrum has not proved to be an unsatisfactory theory rather it really isn t a theory at all Nothing can be predicted with it It is rather a vague schematic outline of the sort we find in James s psychology Nor is there any experimentum crucis which could decide for or against the theory br It is hard to present Goethe s theory since he refrains from setting up any actual theory he says its intention is to portray rather than explain Scientific Studies Instead of setting up models and explanations Goethe collected specimens he was responsible for the meteorological collections of Jena University By the time of his death he had amassed over minerals in his personal collection the largest in all of Europe He took the same approach to colour instead of narrowing and isolating things to a single experimentum crucis or critical experiment that would prove or disprove his theory he sought to gain as much breadth for his understanding as possible by developing a wide ranging exposition through which is revealed the essential character of colour without having to resort to explanations and theories about perceived phenomena such as wavelengths or particles br The crux of his color theory is its experiential source rather than impose theoretical statements Goethe sought to allow light and color to be displayed in an ordered series of experiments that readers could experience for themselves Seamon According to Goethe Newton s error was trusting math over the sensations of his eye Jonah Lehrer br To stay true to the perception without resort to explanation was the essence of Goethe s method What he provided was really not so much a theory as a rational description of colour For Goethe the highest is to understand that all fact is really theory The blue of the sky reveals to us the basic law of color Search nothing beyond the phenomena they themselves are the theory br br Goethe delivered in full measure what was promised by the title of his excellent work Data for a Theory of Color They are important complete and significant data rich material for a future theory of color He has not however undertaken to furnish the theory itself hence as he himself remarks and admits on page xxxix of the introduction he has not furnished us with a real explanation of the essential nature of color but really postulates it as a phenomenon and merely tells us how it originates not what it is The physiological colors he represents as a phenomenon complete and existing by itself without even attempting to show their relation to the physical colors his principal theme it is really a systematic presentation of facts but it stops short at this br Goethe outlines his method in the essay The experiment as mediator between subject and object It underscores his experiential standpoint The human being himself to the extent that he makes sound use of his senses is the most exact physical apparatus that can exist Goethe Scientific Studies br br I believe that what Goethe was really seeking was not a physiological but a psychological theory of colours br Goethe s chromatic understanding is embedded in a paradigm of polarity In the preface to the Theory of Colours Goethe explains how he tried to apply this principle which is constitutive of his earliest convictions and study of nature br br br Light and darkness br Unlike his contemporaries Goethe did not see darkness as an absence of light but rather as polar to and interacting with light colour resulted from this interaction of light and shadow For Goethe light is the simplest most undivided most homogeneous being that we know Confronting it is the darkness Letter to Jacobi br br they maintained that shade is a part of light It sounds absurd when I express it but so it is for they said that colours which are shadow and the result of shade are light itself br Based on his experiments with turbid media Goethe characterized colour as arising from the dynamic interplay of darkness and light Rudolf Steiner the science editor for the Kurschner edition of Goethe s works gave the following analogy br br Modern natural science sees darkness as a complete nothingness According to this view the light which streams into a dark space has no resistance from the darkness to overcome Goethe pictures to himself that light and darkness relate to each other like the north and south pole of a magnet The darkness can weaken the light in its working power Conversely the light can limit the energy of the darkness In both cases color arises br Goethe expresses this more succinctly br br white that becomes darkened or dimmed inclines to yellow black as it becomes lighter inclines to blue br In other words Yellow is a light which has been dampened by darkness Blue is a darkness weakened by light br br br Experiments with turbid media br The action of turbid media was to Goethe the ultimate fact the Urph nomen of the world of colours br Goethe s studies of colour began with experiments which examined the effects of turbid media such as air dust and moisture on the perception of light and dark The poet observed that light seen through a turbid medium appears yellow and darkness seen through an illuminated medium appears blue br br The highest degree of light such as that of the sun is for the most part colourless This light however seen through a medium but very slightly thickened appears to us yellow If the density of such a medium be increased or if its volume become greater we shall see the light gradually assume a yellow red hue which at last deepens to a ruby colour br If on the other hand darkness is seen through a semi transparent medium which is itself illumined by a light striking on it a blue colour appears this becomes lighter and paler as the density of the medium is increased but on the contrary appears darker and deeper the more transparent the medium becomes in the least degree of dimness short of absolute transparence always supposing a perfectly colourless medium this deep blue approaches the most beautiful violet br He then proceeds with numerous experiments systematically observing the effects of rarefied mediums such as dust air and moisture on the perception of colour br br br Boundary conditions br br When viewed through a prism the orientation of a light dark boundary with respect to the prism s axis is significant With white above a dark boundary we observe the light extending a blue violet edge into the dark area whereas dark above a light boundary results in a red yellow edge extending into the light area br Goethe was intrigued by this difference He felt that this arising of colour at light dark boundaries was fundamental to the creation of the spectrum which he considered to be a compound phenomenon br Varying the experimental conditions by using different shades of grey shows that the intensity of coloured edges increases with boundary contrast br br br Light and dark spectra br br Since the colour phenomenon relies on the adjacency of light and dark there are two ways to produce a spectrum with a light beam in a dark room and with a dark beam i e a shadow in a light room br Goethe recorded the sequence of colours projected at various distances from a prism for both cases see Plate IV Theory of Colours In both cases he found that the yellow and blue edges remain closest to the side which is light and red and violet edges remain closest to the side which is dark At a certain distance these edges overlap and we obtain Newton s spectrum When these edges overlap in a light spectrum green results when they overlap in a dark spectrum magenta results br With a light spectrum i e a shaft of light in a surrounding darkness we find yellow red colours along the top edge and blue violet colours along the bottom edge The spectrum with green in the middle arises only where the blue violet edges overlap the yellow red edges Unfortunately an optical mixture of blue and yellow gives white not green and so Goethe s explanation of Newton s spectrum fails br Goethe also performed an exact reversal of Newton s experiment By placing his prism in full sunlight and placing a black cardboard circle in the middle the same size as Newton s hole a dark spectrum i e a shadow surrounded by light is produced we find there a violet blue along the top edge and red yellow along the bottom edge and where these edges overlap we find extraspectral magenta br Olaf M ller presented the matter in the following way According to Newton all spectral colors are contained in white sunlight according to Goethe the opposite can be said that all colors of the complementary spectrum are contained in the dark br br br Goethe s colour wheel br br When the eye sees a colour it is immediately excited and it is its nature spontaneously and of necessity at once to produce another which with the original colour comprehends the whole chromatic scale br Goethe anticipated Ewald Hering s Opponent process theory by proposing a symmetric colour wheel He writes The chromatic circle is arranged in a general way according to the natural order for the colours diametrically opposed to each other in this diagram are those which reciprocally evoke each other in the eye Thus yellow demands violet orange demands blue purple demands green and vice versa thus all intermediate gradations reciprocally evoke each other the simpler colour demanding the compound and vice versa paragraph br In the same way that light and dark spectra yielded green from the mixture of blue and yellow Goethe completed his colour wheel by recognising the importance of magenta For Newton only spectral colors could count as fundamental By contrast Goethe s more empirical approach led him to recognize the essential role of magenta in a complete color circle a role that it still has in all modern color systems br br br Complementary colours and colours psychology br br Goethe also included aesthetic qualities in his colour wheel under the title of allegorical symbolic mystic use of colour Allegorischer symbolischer mystischer Gebrauch der Farbe establishing a kind of color psychology br He associated red with the beautiful orange with the noble yellow to the good green to the useful blue to the common and violet to the unnecessary br These six qualities were assigned to four categories of human cognition the rational Vernunft to the beautiful and the noble red and orange the intellectual Verstand to the good and the useful yellow and green the sensual Sinnlichkeit to the useful and the common green and blue and closing the circle imagination Phantasie to both the unnecessary and the beautiful purple and red br br br Notes on translation br Magenta appeared as a colour term only in the mid nineteenth century after Goethe Hence references to Goethe s recognition of magenta are fraught with interpretation If one observes the colours coming out of a prism an English person may be more inclined to describe as magenta what in German is called Purpur so one may not lose the intention of the author br However literal translation is more difficult Goethe s work uses two composite words for mixed intermediate hues along with corresponding usual colour terms such as orange and violet br br It is not clear how Goethe s Rot Purpur explicitly named as the complementary to green and Sch n one of the six colour sectors are related between themselves and to the red tip of the visible spectrum The text about interference from the physical chapter does not consider Rot and Purpur synonymous Also Purpur is certainly distinct from Blaurot because Purpur is named as a colour which lies somewhere between Blaurot and Gelbrot paragraph although possibly not adjacent to the latter This article uses the English translations from the above table br br br Newton and Goethe br Ernst Lehrs writes In point of fact the essential difference between Goethe s theory of colour and the theory which has prevailed in science despite all modifications since Newton s day lies in this While the theory of Newton and his successors was based on excluding the colour seeing faculty of the eye Goethe founded his theory on the eye s experience of colour br The renouncing of life and immediacy which was the premise for the progress of natural science since Newton formed the real basis for the bitter struggle which Goethe waged against the physical optics of Newton It would be superficial to dismiss this struggle as unimportant there is much significance in one of the most outstanding men directing all his efforts to fighting against the development of Newtonian optics Werner Heisenberg during a speech celebrating Goethe s birthday br Due to their different approaches to a common subject many misunderstandings have arisen between Newton s mathematical understanding of optics and Goethe s experiential approach br Because Newton understands white light to be composed of individual colours and Goethe sees colour arising from the interaction of light and dark they come to different conclusions on the question is the optical spectrum a primary or a compound phenomenon br For Newton the prism is immaterial to the existence of colour as all the colours already exist in white light and the prism merely fans them out according to their refrangibility Goethe sought to show that as a turbid medium the prism was an integral factor in the arising of colour br Whereas Newton narrowed the beam of light in order to isolate the phenomenon Goethe observed that with a wider aperture there was no spectrum He saw only reddish yellow edges and blue cyan edges with white between them and the spectrum arose only where these edges came close enough to overlap For him the spectrum could be explained by the simpler phenomenon of colour arising from the interaction of light and dark edges br Newton explains the appearance of white with colored edges by saying that due to the differing overall amount of refraction the rays mix together to create a full white towards the centre whereas the edges do not benefit from this full mixture and appear with greater red or blue components For Newton s account of his experiments see his Opticks br br br Table of differences br br Goethe s reification of darkness is rejected by modern physics Both Newton and Huygens defined darkness as an absence of light Young and Fresnel showed that Huygens wave theory in his Treatise on Light could explain that colour is the visible manifestation of light s wavelength Physicists today attribute both a corpuscular and undulatory character to light comprising the wave particle duality br br br History and influence br The first edition of the Farbenlehre was printed at the Cotta schen Verlagsbuchhandlung on May with copies on grey paper and copies on white paper It contained three sections i a didactic section in which Goethe presents his own observations ii a polemic section in which he makes his case against Newton and iii a historical section br From its publication the book was controversial for its stance against Newton So much so that when Charles Eastlake translated the text into English in he omitted the content of Goethe s polemic against Newton br br Significantly and regrettably only the Didactic colour observations appear in Eastlake s translation In his preface Eastlake explains that he deleted the historical and entoptic parts of the book because they lacked scientific interest and censored Goethe s polemic because the violence of his objections against Newton would prevent readers from fairly judging Goethe s color observations br br br Influence on the arts br br Goethe was initially induced to occupy himself with the study of colour by the questions of hue in painting During his first journey to Italy he noticed that artists were able to enunciate rules for virtually all the elements of painting and drawing except color and coloring In the years Goethe began investigating whether one could ascertain rules to govern the artistic use of color br This aim came to some fulfillment when several pictorial artists above all Philipp Otto Runge took an interest in his colour studies After being translated into English by Charles Eastlake in the theory became widely adopted by the art world especially among the Pre Raphaelites J M W Turner studied it comprehensively and referenced it in the titles of several paintings Wassily Kandinsky considered it one of the most important works br br br Influence on Latin American flags br br During a party in Weimar in the winter of Goethe had a late night conversation with the South American revolutionary Francisco de Miranda In a letter written to Count Semyon Romanovich Vorontsov Miranda recounted how Goethe fascinated with his exploits throughout the Americas and Europe told him Your destiny is to create in your land a place where primary colours are not distorted He proceeded to clarify what he meant br br First he explained to me the way the iris transforms the light into the three primary colours then he said Why yellow is the most warm noble and closest to the bright light why Blue is that mix of excitement and serenity so far that it evokes the shadows and why Red is the exaltation of Yellow and Blue the synthesis the vanishing of the bright light into the shadows br br br Influence on philosophers br In the nineteenth century Goethe s Theory was taken up by Schopenhauer in On Vision and Colors who developed it into a kind of arithmetical physiology of the action of the retina much in keeping with his own representative idealism The world is my representation or idea br In the twentieth century the theory was transmitted to philosophy via Wittgenstein who devoted a series of remarks to the subject at the end of his life These remarks are collected as Remarks on Colour Wittgenstein br br Someone who agrees with Goethe finds that Goethe correctly recognized the nature of colour And here nature does not mean a sum of experiences with respect to colours but it is to be found in the concept of colour br Wittgenstein was interested in the fact that some propositions about colour are apparently neither empirical nor exactly a priori but something in between phenomenology according to Goethe However Wittgenstein took the line that There is no such thing as phenomenology though there are phenomenological problems He was content to regard Goethe s observations as a kind of logic or geometry Wittgenstein took his examples from the Runge letter included in the Farbenlehre e g White is the lightest colour There cannot be a transparent white There cannot be a reddish green and so on The logical status of these propositions in Wittgenstein s investigation including their relation to physics has been discussed in Jonathan Westphal s Colour a Philosophical Introduction Westphal br br br Reception by scientists br During Goethe s lifetime that is between and countless scientists and mathematicians commented on Goethe s Newton criticism in color theory namely in reviews books book chapters footnotes and open letters Among these just under half spoke against Goethe especially Thomas Young Louis Malus Pierre Pr vost and Gustav Theodor Fechner One third of the statements from the natural sciences were in favour of Goethe in particular Thomas Johann Seebeck Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger and Johann Friedrich Christian Werneburg and one fifth expressed ambivalence or a draw br As early as in Hermann von Helmholtz s lecture on Goethe s scientific works he says of Goethe s work that he depicts the perceived phenomena circumstantially rigorously true to nature and vividly puts them in an order that is pleasant to survey and proves himself here as everywhere in the realm of the factual to be the great master of exposition Helmholtz Helmholtz ultimately rejects Goethe s theory as the work of a poet but expresses his perplexity at how they can be in such agreement about the facts of the matter but in violent contradiction about their meaning And I for one do not know how anyone regardless of what his views about colours are can deny that the theory in itself is fully consequent that its assumptions once granted explain the facts treated completely and indeed simply Helmholtz br Although the accuracy of Goethe s observations does not admit a great deal of criticism his aesthetic approach did not lend itself to the demands of analytic and mathematical analysis used ubiquitously in modern science br br Goethe s colour theory has in many ways borne fruit in art physiology and aesthetics But victory and hence influence on the research of the following century has been Newton s br One hole Goethe did find in Newton s armour through which he incessantly worried the Englishman with his lance Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible He therefore thought that the object glasses of telescopes must for ever remain imperfect achromatism and refraction being incompatible This inference was proved by Dollond to be wrong Here as elsewhere Goethe proves himself master of the experimental conditions It is the power of interpretation that he lacks br Much controversy stems from two different ways of investigating light and colour Goethe was not interested in Newton s analytic treatment of colour but he presented an excellent rational description of the phenomenon of human colour perception It is as such a collection of colour observations that we must view this book br br Most of Goethe s explanations of color have been thoroughly demolished but no criticism has been leveled at his reports of the facts to be observed nor should any be This book can lead the reader through a demonstration course not only in subjectively produced colors after images light and dark adaptation irradiation colored shadows and pressure phosphenes but also in physical phenomena detectable qualitatively by observation of color absorption scattering refraction diffraction polarization and interference A reader who attempts to follow the logic of Goethe s explanations and who attempts to compare them with the currently accepted views might even with the advantage of sophistication become convinced that Goethe s theory or at least a part of it has been dismissed too quickly br Mitchell Feigenbaum came to believe that Goethe had been right about colour br br As Feigenbaum understood them Goethe s ideas had true science in them They were hard and empirical Over and over again Goethe emphasized the repeatability of his experiments It was the perception of colour to Goethe that was universal and objective What scientific evidence was there for a definable real world quality of redness independent of our perception br br br Current status br Newton believed that with the help of his prism experiments he could prove that sunlight was composed of variously coloured rays of light Goethe showed that this step from observation to theory is more problematic than Newton wanted to admit By insisting that the step to theory is not forced upon us by the phenomena Goethe revealed our own free creative contribution to theory construction And Goethe s insight is surprisingly significant because he correctly claimed that all of the results of Newton s prism experiments fit a theoretical alternative equally well a century before Duhem and Quine s famous arguments for Underdetermination br Goethe s critique of Newton was not an attack on reason or science though it has often been portrayed that way The critique maintained that Newton had mistaken mathematical imagining as the pure evidence of the senses Goethe tried to define the scientific function of imagination to interrelate phenomena once they have been meticulously produced described and organized Newton had introduced dogma into color science by claiming that color could be reduced to a function of rays Dennis L Sepper br br Goethe started out by accepting Newton s physical theory He soon abandoned it finding modification to be more in keeping with his own insights One beneficial consequence of this was that he developed an awareness of the importance of the physiological aspect of colour perception and was therefore able to demonstrate that Newton s theory of light and colours is too simplistic that there is more to colour than variable refrangibility br Although he soon rejected Newton s differential refrangibility Goethe always affirmed Newtonian mechanics It was not an apriori poetic prejudice against mathematical analysis but rather performing the experiments that led him to reject the theory Goethe soon concluded that in order to explain color one needs to know not just about light but also about eye function and relative differences in light across the visual field Sepper br As a catalogue of observations Goethe s experiments probe the complexities of human colour perception Whereas Newton sought to develop a mathematical model for the behaviour of light Goethe focused on exploring how colour is perceived in a wide array of conditions Developments in understanding how the brain interprets colours such as colour constancy and Edwin H Land s retinex theory bear striking similarities to Goethe s theory br Goethe discovered that producing images by passing inverse optical contrasts through a prism always results in isomorphic complementary spectra Against the background of the representation he had found in Newton s Opticks this was an unexpected discovery Experimental developments by physicist Matthias Rang have demonstrated Goethe s discovery of complementarity as a symmetric property of spectral phenomena A re examination of Newton s experimentum crucis by scholar Gopi Krishna Vijaya in reports br br The polarity of light and dark in the treatment of the Newtonian spectrum and the inverse spectrum is studied in relation to Goethe s views In order to clarify the reality of the Darkness Rays Newton s experimentum crucis is re evaluated It is shown that the commonly accepted analysis contains assumptions in the choice of the spectrum and background which mask the inherent dynamic of the spectrum The relation between colour and wavelength is re examined with respect to the immutability and specific refrangibility of colour It is then shown that both these properties are approximations that apply under the specific conditions that have later become standardized in Spectroscopy leading to a consensus regarding the relation of wavelength to colours of one particular spectrum br Gopi Krishna Vijaya Colour Wavelength and Turbidity in the Light of Goethe s Colour Studies Journal for General Philosophy of Science
