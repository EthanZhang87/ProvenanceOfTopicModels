title: RGB color model
id: 25989
The RGB color model is an additive color model in which the red green and blue primary colors of light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors The name of the model comes from the initials of the three additive primary colors red green and blue br The main purpose of the RGB color model is for the sensing representation and display of images in electronic systems such as televisions and computers though it has also been used in conventional photography and colored lighting Before the electronic age the RGB color model already had a solid theory behind it based in human perception of colors br RGB is a device dependent color model different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently since the color elements such as phosphors or dyes and their response to the individual red green and blue levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer or even in the same device over time Thus an RGB value does not define the same color across devices without some kind of color management br Typical RGB input devices are color TV and video cameras image scanners and digital cameras Typical RGB output devices are TV sets of various technologies CRT LCD plasma OLED quantum dots etc computer and mobile phone displays video projectors multicolor LED displays and large screens such as the Jumbotron Color printers on the other hand are not RGB devices but subtractive color devices typically using the CMYK color model br br br Additive colors br br To form a color with RGB three light beams one red one green and one blue must be superimposed for example by emission from a black screen or by reflection from a white screen Each of the three beams is called a component of that color and each of them can have an arbitrary intensity from fully off to fully on in the mixture br The RGB color model is additive in the sense that if light beams of differing color frequency are superposed in space their light spectra adds up wavelength for wavelength to make up a resulting total spectrum This is essentially opposite to the subtractive color model particularly the CMY color model which applies to paints inks dyes and other substances whose color depends on reflecting certain components frequencies of the light under which we see them In the additive model if the resulting spectrum e g of superposing three colors is flat white color is perceived by the human eye upon direct incidence on the retina This is in stark contrast to the subtractive model where the perceived resulting spectrum is what reflecting surfaces such as dyed surfaces emit Simply put a dye filters out all colors but its own two blended dyes filter out all colors but the common color component between them e g green as the common component between yellow and cyan red as the common component between magenta and yellow and blue violet as the common component between magenta and cyan It so happens that there is no color component among magenta cyan and yellow thus rendering a spectrum of zero intensity black br Zero intensity for each component gives the darkest color no light considered the black and full intensity of each gives a white the quality of this white depends on the nature of the primary light sources but if they are properly balanced the result is a neutral white matching the system s white point When the intensities for all the components are the same the result is a shade of gray darker or lighter depending on the intensity When the intensities are different the result is a colorized hue more or less saturated depending on the difference of the strongest and weakest of the intensities of the primary colors employed br When one of the components has the strongest intensity the color is a hue near this primary color red ish green ish or blue ish and when two components have the same strongest intensity then the color is a hue of a secondary color a shade of cyan magenta or yellow A secondary color is formed by the sum of two primary colors of equal intensity cyan is green blue magenta is blue red and yellow is red green Every secondary color is the complement of one primary color cyan complements red magenta complements green and yellow complements blue When all the primary colors are mixed in equal intensities the result is white br The RGB color model itself does not define what is meant by red green and blue colorimetrically and so the results of mixing them are not specified as absolute but relative to the primary colors When the exact chromaticities of the red green and blue primaries are defined the color model then becomes an absolute color space such as sRGB or Adobe RGB see RGB color space for more details br br br Physical principles for the choice of red green and blue br br The choice of primary colors is related to the physiology of the human eye good primaries are stimuli that maximize the difference between the responses of the cone cells of the human retina to light of different wavelengths and that thereby make a large color triangle br The normal three kinds of light sensitive photoreceptor cells in the human eye cone cells respond most to yellow long wavelength or L green medium or M and violet short or S light peak wavelengths near nm nm and nm respectively The difference in the signals received from the three kinds allows the brain to differentiate a wide gamut of different colors while being most sensitive overall to yellowish green light and to differences between hues in the green to orange region br As an example suppose that light in the orange range of wavelengths approximately nm to nm enters the eye and strikes the retina Light of these wavelengths would activate both the medium and long wavelength cones of the retina but not equally the long wavelength cells will respond more The difference in the response can be detected by the brain and this difference is the basis of our perception of orange Thus the orange appearance of an object results from light from the object entering our eye and stimulating the different cones simultaneously but to different degrees br Use of the three primary colors is not sufficient to reproduce all colors only colors within the color triangle defined by the chromaticities of the primaries can be reproduced by additive mixing of non negative amounts of those colors of light br br br History of RGB color model theory and usage br The RGB color model is based on the Young Helmholtz theory of trichromatic color vision developed by Thomas Young and Hermann von Helmholtz in the early to mid nineteenth century and on James Clerk Maxwell s color triangle that elaborated that theory c br br br Photography br The first experiments with RGB in early color photography were made in by Maxwell himself and involved the process of combining three color filtered separate takes To reproduce the color photograph three matching projections over a screen in a dark room were necessary br The additive RGB model and variants such as orange green violet were also used in the Autochrome Lumi re color plates and other screen plate technologies such as the Joly color screen and the Paget process in the early twentieth century Color photography by taking three separate plates was used by other pioneers such as the Russian Sergey Prokudin Gorsky in the period through Such methods lasted until about using the expensive and extremely complex tri color carbro Autotype process br When employed the reproduction of prints from three plate photos was done by dyes or pigments using the complementary CMY model by simply using the negative plates of the filtered takes reverse red gives the cyan plate and so on br br br Television br Before the development of practical electronic TV there were patents on mechanically scanned color systems as early as in Russia The color TV pioneer John Logie Baird demonstrated the world s first RGB color transmission in and also the world s first color broadcast in in London In his experiments scanning and display were done mechanically by spinning colorized wheels br The Columbia Broadcasting System CBS began an experimental RGB field sequential color system in Images were scanned electrically but the system still used a moving part the transparent RGB color wheel rotating at above rpm in synchronism with the vertical scan The camera and the cathode ray tube CRT were both monochromatic Color was provided by color wheels in the camera and the receiver br More recently color wheels have been used in field sequential projection TV receivers based on the Texas Instruments monochrome DLP imager br The modern RGB shadow mask technology for color CRT displays was patented by Werner Flechsig in Germany in br br br Personal computers br Personal computers of the late s and early s such as the Apple II and VIC use composite video The Commodore and the Atari bit computers use S Video derivatives IBM introduced a color scheme four bits one bit each for red green blue and intensity with the Color Graphics Adapter CGA for its IBM PC in later improved with the Enhanced Graphics Adapter EGA in The first manufacturer of a truecolor graphics card for PCs the TARGA was Truevision in but it was not until the arrival of the Video Graphics Array VGA in that RGB became popular mainly due to the analog signals in the connection between the adapter and the monitor which allowed a very wide range of RGB colors Actually it had to wait a few more years because the original VGA cards were palette driven just like EGA although with more freedom than VGA but because the VGA connectors were analog later variants of VGA made by various manufacturers under the informal name Super VGA eventually added true color In magazines heavily advertised true color Super VGA hardware br br br RGB devices br br br RGB and displays br br One common application of the RGB color model is the display of colors on a cathode ray tube CRT liquid crystal display LCD plasma display or organic light emitting diode OLED display such as a television a computer s monitor or a large scale screen Each pixel on the screen is built by driving three small and very close but still separated RGB light sources At common viewing distance the separate sources are indistinguishable which the eye interprets as a given solid color All the pixels together arranged in the rectangular screen surface conforms the color image br During digital image processing each pixel can be represented in the computer memory or interface hardware for example a graphics card as binary values for the red green and blue color components When properly managed these values are converted into intensities or voltages via gamma correction to correct the inherent nonlinearity of some devices such that the intended intensities are reproduced on the display br The Quattron released by Sharp uses RGB color and adds yellow as a sub pixel supposedly allowing an increase in the number of available colors br br br Video electronics br br RGB is also the term referring to a type of component video signal used in the video electronics industry It consists of three signals red green and blue carried on three separate cables pins RGB signal formats are often based on modified versions of the RS and RS standards for monochrome video This type of video signal is widely used in Europe since it is the best quality signal that can be carried on the standard SCART connector This signal is known as RGBS BNC RCA terminated cables exist as well but it is directly compatible with RGBHV used for computer monitors usually carried on pin cables terminated with pin D sub or BNC connectors which carries separate horizontal and vertical sync signals br Outside Europe RGB is not very popular as a video signal format S Video takes that spot in most non European regions However almost all computer monitors around the world use RGB br br br Video framebuffer br A framebuffer is a digital device for computers which stores data in the so called video memory comprising an array of Video RAM or similar chips This data goes either to three digital to analog converters DACs for analog monitors one per primary color or directly to digital monitors Driven by software the CPU or other specialized chips write the appropriate bytes into the video memory to define the image Modern systems encode pixel color values by devoting eight bits to each of the R G and B components RGB information can be either carried directly by the pixel bits themselves or provided by a separate color look up table CLUT if indexed color graphic modes are used br A CLUT is a specialized RAM that stores R G and B values that define specific colors Each color has its own address index consider it as a descriptive reference number that provides that specific color when the image needs it The content of the CLUT is much like a palette of colors Image data that uses indexed color specifies addresses within the CLUT to provide the required R G and B values for each specific pixel one pixel at a time Of course before displaying the CLUT has to be loaded with R G and B values that define the palette of colors required for each image to be rendered Some video applications store such palettes in PAL files Age of Empires game for example uses over half a dozen and can combine CLUTs on screen br br RGB and RGB br This indirect scheme restricts the number of available colors in an image CLUT typically cubed bits in three color channels with values of although each color in the RGB CLUT table has only bits representing codes for each of the R G and B primaries making possible colors However the advantage is that an indexed color image file can be significantly smaller than it would be with only bits per pixel for each primary br Modern storage however is far less costly greatly reducing the need to minimize image file size By using an appropriate combination of red green and blue intensities many colors can be displayed Current typical display adapters use up to bits of information for each pixel bit per component multiplied by three components see the Numeric representations section below bits each primary value of bits with values of With this system or discrete combinations of R G and B values are allowed providing millions of different though not necessarily distinguishable hue saturation and lightness shades Increased shading has been implemented in various ways some formats such as png and tga files among others using a fourth greyscale color channel as a masking layer often called RGB br For images with a modest range of brightnesses from the darkest to the lightest eight bits per primary color provides good quality images but extreme images require more bits per primary color as well as the advanced display technology For more information see High Dynamic Range HDR imaging br br br Nonlinearity br br In classic CRT devices the brightness of a given point over the fluorescent screen due to the impact of accelerated electrons is not proportional to the voltages applied to the electron gun control grids but to an expansive function of that voltage The amount of this deviation is known as its gamma value br br br br br br br displaystyle gamma br br the argument for a power law function which closely describes this behavior A linear response is given by a gamma value of but actual CRT nonlinearities have a gamma value around to br Similarly the intensity of the output on TV and computer display devices is not directly proportional to the R G and B applied electric signals or file data values which drive them through digital to analog converters On a typical standard gamma CRT display an input intensity RGB value of only outputs about of full brightness instead of To obtain the correct response a gamma correction is used in encoding the image data and possibly further corrections as part of the color calibration process of the device Gamma affects black and white TV as well as color In standard color TV broadcast signals are gamma corrected br br br RGB and cameras br br In color television and video cameras manufactured before the s the incoming light was separated by prisms and filters into the three RGB primary colors feeding each color into a separate video camera tube or pickup tube These tubes are a type of cathode ray tube not to be confused with that of CRT displays br With the arrival of commercially viable charge coupled device CCD technology in the s first the pickup tubes were replaced with this kind of sensor Later higher scale integration electronics was applied mainly by Sony simplifying and even removing the intermediate optics thereby reducing the size of home video cameras and eventually leading to the development of full camcorders Current webcams and mobile phones with cameras are the most miniaturized commercial forms of such technology br Photographic digital cameras that use a CMOS or CCD image sensor often operate with some variation of the RGB model In a Bayer filter arrangement green is given twice as many detectors as red and blue ratio in order to achieve higher luminance resolution than chrominance resolution The sensor has a grid of red green and blue detectors arranged so that the first row is RGRGRGRG the next is GBGBGBGB and that sequence is repeated in subsequent rows For every channel missing pixels are obtained by interpolation in the demosaicing process to build up the complete image Also other processes used to be applied in order to map the camera RGB measurements into a standard RGB color space as sRGB br br br RGB and scanners br In computing an image scanner is a device that optically scans images printed text handwriting or an object and converts it to a digital image which is transferred to a computer Among other formats flat drum and film scanners exist and most of them support RGB color They can be considered the successors of early telephotography input devices which were able to send consecutive scan lines as analog amplitude modulation signals through standard telephonic lines to appropriate receivers such systems were in use in press since the s to the mid s Color telephotographs were sent as three separated RGB filtered images consecutively br Currently available scanners typically use CCD or contact image sensor CIS as the image sensor whereas older drum scanners use a photomultiplier tube as the image sensor Early color film scanners used a halogen lamp and a three color filter wheel so three exposures were needed to scan a single color image Due to heating problems the worst of them being the potential destruction of the scanned film this technology was later replaced by non heating light sources such as color LEDs br br br Numeric representations br br A color in the RGB color model is described by indicating how much of each of the red green and blue is included The color is expressed as an RGB triplet r g b each component of which can vary from zero to a defined maximum value If all the components are at zero the result is black if all are at maximum the result is the brightest representable white br These ranges may be quantified in several different ways br br From to with any fractional value in between This representation is used in theoretical analyses and in systems that use floating point representations br Each color component value can also be written as a percentage from to br In computers the component values are often stored as unsigned integer numbers in the range to the range that a single bit byte can offer These are often represented as either decimal or hexadecimal numbers br High end digital image equipment are often able to deal with larger integer ranges for each primary color such as bits bits or even larger by extending the bits three bit values to bit bit or bit units more or less independent from the particular computer s word size br For example brightest saturated red is written in the different RGB notations as br br In many environments the component values within the ranges are not managed as linear that is the numbers are nonlinearly related to the intensities that they represent as in digital cameras and TV broadcasting and receiving due to gamma correction for example Linear and nonlinear transformations are often dealt with via digital image processing Representations with only bits per component are considered sufficient if gamma correction is used br Following is the mathematical relationship between RGB space to HSI space hue saturation and intensity HSI color space br br br br br br br br br I br br br br br br br br R br br G br br B

and several different digital representations are in use The main characteristic of all of them is the quantization of the possible values per component technically a sample by using only integer numbers within some range usually from to some power of two minus one n to fit them into some bit groupings Encodings of and bits per color are commonly found the total number of bits used for an RGB color is typically called the color depth br br br Geometric representation br br Since colors are usually defined by three components not only in the RGB model but also in other color models such as CIELAB and Y UV among others then a three dimensional volume is described by treating the component values as ordinary Cartesian coordinates in a Euclidean space For the RGB model this is represented by a cube using non negative values within a range assigning black to the origin at the vertex and with increasing intensity values running along the three axes up to white at the vertex diagonally opposite black br An RGB triplet r g b represents the three dimensional coordinate of the point of the given color within the cube or its faces or along its edges This approach allows computations of the color similarity of two given RGB colors by simply calculating the distance between them the shorter the distance the higher the similarity Out of gamut computations can also be performed this way br br br Colors in web page design br br Initially the limited color depth of most video hardware led to a limited color palette of RGB colors defined by the Netscape Color Cube The web safe color palette consists of the combinations of red green and blue where each color can take one of six values in hexadecimal CC or FF based on the to range for each value discussed above These hexadecimal values in decimal which in terms of intensity This seems fine for splitting up colors into a cube of dimension However lacking gamma correction the perceived intensity on a standard gamma CRT LCD is only See the actual web safe color palette for a visual confirmation that the majority of the colors produced are very dark br With the predominance of bit displays the use of the full million colors of the HTML RGB color code no longer poses problems for most viewers The sRGB color space a device independent color space for HTML was formally adopted as an Internet standard in HTML though it had been in use for some time before that All images and colors are interpreted as being sRGB unless another color space is specified and all modern displays can display this color space with color management being built in into browsers or operating systems br The syntax in CSS is br br rgb br br where equals the proportion of red green and blue respectively This syntax can be used after such selectors as background color or for text color br Wide gamut color is possible in modern CSS being supported by all major browsers since br For example a color on the DCI P color space can be indicated as br br color display p br br where equals the proportion of red green and blue in to respectively br br br Color management br br Proper reproduction of colors especially in professional environments requires color management of all the devices involved in the production process many of them using RGB Color management results in several transparent conversions between device independent sRGB XYZ L a b and device dependent color spaces RGB and others as CMYK for color printing during a typical production cycle in order to ensure color consistency throughout the process Along with the creative processing such interventions on digital images can damage the color accuracy and image detail especially where the gamut is reduced Professional digital devices and software tools allow for bpp bits per pixel images to be manipulated bits per channel to minimize any such damage br ICC profile compliant applications such as Adobe Photoshop use either the Lab color space or the CIE color space as a Profile Connection Space when translating between color spaces br br br RGB model and luminance chrominance formats relationship br All luminance chrominance formats used in the different TV and video standards such as YIQ for NTSC YUV for PAL YDBDR for SECAM and YPBPR for component video use color difference signals by which RGB color images can be encoded for broadcasting recording and later decoded into RGB again to display them These intermediate formats were needed for compatibility with pre existent black and white TV formats Also those color difference signals need lower data bandwidth compared to full RGB signals br Similarly current high efficiency digital color image data compression schemes such as JPEG and MPEG store RGB color internally in YCBCR format a digital luminance chrominance format based on YPBPR The use of YCBCR also allows computers to perform lossy subsampling with the chrominance channels typically to or ratios which reduces the resultant file size br br br See also br br br br br br External links br br RGB mixer br Demonstrative color conversion applet
