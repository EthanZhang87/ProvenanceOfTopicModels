Roseus is the Latin word meaning rosy or pink Lucretius used the word to describe the dawn in his epic poem On the Nature of Things De rerum natura br Pink was not a common color in the fashion of the Middle Ages nobles usually preferred brighter reds such as crimson However it did appear in women s fashion and religious art In the th and th centuries in works by Cimabue and Duccio the Christ child was sometimes portrayed dressed in pink the color associated with the body of Christ br In the high Renaissance painting the Madonna of the Pinks by Raphael the Christ child is presenting a pink flower to the Virgin Mary The pink was a symbol of marriage showing a spiritual marriage between the mother and child br During the Renaissance pink was mainly used for the flesh color of faces and hands The pigment commonly used for this was called light cinabrese it was a mixture of the red earth pigment called sinopia or Venetian red and a white pigment called Bianco San Genovese or lime white In his famous th century manual on painting Il Libro Dell Arte Cennino Cennini described it this way This pigment is made from the loveliest and lightest sinopia that is found and is mixed and mulled with St John s white as it is called in Florence and this white is made from thoroughly white and thoroughly purified lime And when these two pigments have been thoroughly mulled together that is two parts cinabrese and the third white make little loaves of them like half walnuts and leave them to dry When you need some take however much of it seems appropriate And this pigment does you great credit if you use it for painting faces hands and nudes on walls br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br th century br Pink was particularly championed by Madame de Pompadour the mistress of King Louis XV of France who wore combinations of pale blue and pink and had a particular tint of pink made for her by the Sevres porcelain factory created by adding nuances of blue black and yellow br While pink was quite evidently the color of seduction in the portraits made by George Romney of Emma Lady Hamilton the future mistress of Admiral Horatio Nelson in

the th century was almost always white since before the invention of chemical dyes clothing of any color would quickly fade when washed in boiling water Queen Victoria was painted in with her seventh child and third son Prince Arthur who wore white and pink In late nineteenth century France Impressionist painters working in a pastel color palette sometimes depicted women wearing the color pink

have been a key turning point in the association of pink as a color associated with girls Mamie s strong liking of pink led to the public association with pink being a color that ladylike women wear The American musical Funny Face also played a role in cementing the color s association with women br In the th century pinks became bolder brighter and more assertive partly because of the invention of chemical dyes that did not fade The pioneer in the creation of the new wave of pinks was the Italian designer Elsa Schiaparelli who was aligned with the artists of the surrealist movement including Jean Cocteau In she created a new variety of the color called shocking pink made by mixing magenta with a small amount of white She launched a perfume called Shocking sold in a bottle in the shape of a woman s torso said to be modelled on that of Mae West Her fashions co designed with artists like Cocteau featured the new pinks br In Nazi Germany in the s and s inmates of Nazi concentration camps who were accused of homosexuality were forced to wear a pink triangle Because of this the pink triangle has become a symbol of the modern gay rights movement br The transition to pink as a sexually differentiating color for girls occurred gradually through the selective process of the marketplace in the s and s In the s some groups had described pink as a masculine color an equivalent to red which was considered for men but lighter for boys But stores nonetheless found that people were increasingly choosing to buy pink for girls and blue for boys until this became an accepted norm in the s br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Science and nature br br br Optics br In optics the word pink can refer to any of the pale shades of colors between bluish red to red in hue of medium to high lightness and of low to moderate saturation Although pink is generally considered a tint of red the colors of most tints of pink are slightly bluish and lie between red and magenta A few variations of pink such as salmon color lean toward orange br br br Sunrises and sunsets br As a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and airborne particles This is called Rayleigh scattering Colors with a shorter wavelength such as blue and green scatter more strongly and are removed from the light that finally reaches the eye At sunrise and sunset when the path of the sunlight through the atmosphere to the eye is longest the blue and green components are removed almost completely leaving the longer wavelength orange red and pink light The remaining pinkish sunlight can also be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles which give the sky above the horizon a pink or reddish glow br br br br br br br br br br br br Geology br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br

because the muscles of vertebrate animals such as cows and pigs contain a protein called myoglobin which binds oxygen and iron atoms When beef is cooked the myoglobin proteins undergo oxidation and gradually turn from red to pink to brown that is from rare to medium to well done Pork contains less myoglobin than beef and therefore is less red when heated it changes from pinkish red to less pink to tan or white br Ham though it contains myoglobins like beef undergoes a different transformation Traditional hams such as prosciutto are made by taking the hind leg or thigh of a pig covering it with sea salt which removes the moisture content and then letting it dry or cure for as long as two years The salt sodium nitrate permits the ham to retain its original pink color even when dried out Supermarket hams are made by a different and faster process they are brined or infused with a salt water solution containing sodium nitrite which transfers nitric oxide which bonds with the myoglobin to form the traditional pink cured ham color br The shells and flesh of crustaceans such as crabs lobsters and shrimp contain a pink carotenoid pigment called astaxanthin Their shells naturally blue

using one of two different methods One method is to use neon gas and a blue or purple phosphor which generally produces a warmer more reddish or more intense shade of pink Another method is to use an argon mercury blend and a red phosphor which generally produces a cooler more purplish or softer shade of pink br Pink LEDs can be produced using two methods either with a blue LED using two phosphors yellow for the first phosphor and red orange or pink for the second or by placing a pink dye on top of a white LED Color shifting was a common issue with early pink LEDs where the red orange or pink phosphors or dyes faded over time causing the pink color to eventually shift towards white or blue These issues have been mitigated by the more recent introduction of more fade resistant phosphors br

others assigning pink sometimes to boys and sometimes to girls br Many have noted the contrary association of pink with boys in th century America An article in the trade publication Earnshaw s

boy while blue which is more delicate and dainty is prettier for the girl br One reason for the increased use of pink for girls and blue for boys was the invention of new chemical dyes which meant that children s clothing could be mass produced and washed in hot water without fading Prior to this time most small children of both sexes wore white which could be frequently washed Another factor
