A color wheel or color circle is an abstract illustrative organization of color hues around a circle which shows the relationships between primary colors secondary colors tertiary colors etc br Some sources use the terms color wheel and color circle interchangeably however one term or the other may be more prevalent in certain fields or certain versions as mentioned above For instance some reserve the term color wheel for mechanical rotating devices such as color tops filter wheels or the Newton disc Others classify various color wheels as color disc color chart and color scale varieties br br br History br In his book Opticks Isaac Newton presented a color circle to illustrate the relations between these colors The original color circle of Isaac Newton showed only the spectral hues and was provided to illustrate a rule for the color of mixtures of lights that these could be approximately predicted from the center of gravity of the numbers of rays of each spectral color present represented in his diagram by small circles The divisions of Newton s circle are of unequal size being based on the intervals of a Dorian musical scale Most later color circles include the purples however between red and violet and have equal sized hue divisions Color scientists and psychologists often use the additive primaries red green and blue and often refer to their arrangement around a circle as a color circle as opposed to a color wheel br br Thomas Young postulated that the eye contains receptors that respond to three different primary sensations or spectra of light James Clerk Maxwell showed that all hues and almost all colors can be created from three primary colors such as red green and blue if they are mixed in the right proportions Goethe s Theory of Colours provided the first systematic study of the physiological effects of color His observations on the effect of opposed colors led him to a symmetric arrangement of his color wheel anticipating Ewald Hering s opponent color theory for the colours diametrically opposed to each other are those that reciprocally evoke each other in the eye br br br Colors of the color wheel br br br Trichromatic model br Most color wheels are based on three primary colors three secondary colors and the six intermediates formed by mixing a primary with a secondary known as tertiary colors for a total of main divisions some add more intermediates for named colors They make use of the trichromatic model of color br br br Subtractive br br The typical artists paint or pigment color wheel includes the blue red and yellow primary colors The corresponding secondary colors are green orange and violet or purple The tertiary colors are green yellow yellow orange orange red red violet purple purple violet blue and blue green br Non digital visual artists typically use red yellow and blue primaries RYB color model arranged at three equally spaced points around their color wheel Printers and others who use modern subtractive color methods and terminology use magenta yellow and cyan as subtractive primaries Intermediate and interior points of color wheels and circles represent color mixtures In a paint or subtractive color wheel the center of gravity is usually but not always black representing all colors of light being absorbed br br br Additive br A color wheel based on RGB red green blue additive primaries has cyan magenta and yellow secondaries Alternatively the same arrangement of colors around a circle can be described as based on cyan magenta and yellow subtractive primaries with red green and blue being secondaries Sometimes a RGV red green violet triad is used instead In an additive color circle the center is white or gray indicating a mixture of different wavelengths of light all wavelengths or two complementary colors for example br br The HSL and HSV color spaces are simple geometric transformations of the RGB cube into cylindrical form The outer top circle of the HSV cylinder or the outer middle circle of the HSL cylinder can be thought of as a color wheel There is no authoritative way of labelling the colors in such a color wheel but the six colors which fall at the corners of the RGB cube are given names in the X color list and are named keywords in HTML br br br Opponent process model br Some color wheels are based on the four opponent process colors red yellow blue and green This includes those of the Natural Color System br br br The color circle and color vision br br A color circle based on spectral wavelengths appears with red at one end of the spectrum and is mixable violet at the other A wedge shaped gap represents colors that have no unique spectral frequency These extra spectral colors the purples form from an additive mixture of colors from the ends of the spectrum br In normal human vision wavelengths of between about nm and nm are represented by this incomplete circle with the longer wavelengths equating to the red end of the spectrum Complement colors are located directly opposite each other on this wheel These complement colors are not identical to colors in pigment mixing such as are used in paint but when lights are additively mixed in the correct proportions appear as a neutral grey or white br The color circle is used for among other purposes illustrating additive color mixture Combining two colored lights from different parts of the spectrum will produce a third color that appears like a light from another part of the spectrum even though dissimilar wavelengths are involved This type of color matching is known as metameric matching Thus a combination of green and red light will produce the color yellow in apparent hue The newly formed color lies between the two original colors on the color circle br Objects may be viewed under a variety of different lighting conditions The human visual system is able to adapt to these differences by chromatic adaptation This aspect of the visual system is relatively easy to mislead and optical illusions relating to color are therefore a common phenomenon The color circle is a useful tool for examining these illusions br Arranging spectral colors in a circle to predict admixture of light stems from work by Sir Isaac Newton Newton s calculation of the resulting color involves three steps First mark on the color circle the constituent colors according to their relative weight Second find the barycenter of these differently weighted colors Third interpret the radial distance from the center of the circle to the barycenter as the saturation of the color and the azimuthal position on the circle as the hue of the color Thus Newton s color circle is a predecessor of the modern horseshoe shaped CIE color diagram br The psychophysical theory behind the color circle dates to the early color triangle of Thomas Young whose work was later extended by James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz br br br Color wheels and paint color mixing br br There is no straight line relationship between colors mixed in pigment which vary from medium to medium With a psychophysical color circle however the resulting hue of any mixture of two colored light sources can be determined simply by the relative brightness and wavelength of the two lights A similar calculation cannot be performed with two paints As such a painter s color wheel is indicative rather than predictive being used to compare existing colors rather than calculate exact colors of mixtures Because of differences relating to the medium different color wheels can be created according to the type of paint or other medium used and many artists make their own individual color wheels These often contain only blocks of color rather than the gradation between tones that is characteristic of the color circle br br br Color wheel software br br A number of interactive color wheel applications are available both on the Internet and as desktop applications These programs are used by artists and designers for picking colors for a design br br br Color schemes br br In color theory a color scheme is the choice of colors used in design for a range of media For example the use of a white background with black text is an example of a common default color scheme in web design br Color schemes are logical combinations of colors on the color wheel Color schemes are used to create style and appeal Colors that create an aesthetic feeling together commonly appear together in color schemes A basic color scheme uses two colors that look appealing together More advanced color schemes involve several colors in combination usually based around a single color for example text with such colors as red yellow orange and light blue arranged together on a black background in a magazine article Color schemes can also contain different shades of a single color for example a color scheme that mixes different shades of green ranging from very light almost white to very dark br Complementary colors are two colors directly across from each other for example red and green are complementary colors Tetradic color palettes use four colors a pair of complementary color pairs For example one could use yellow purple red and green Tetrad colors can be found by putting a square or rectangle on the color wheel br An analogous color scheme is made up of colors next to each other on the wheel For example red orange and yellow are analogous colors Monochromatic colors are different shades of the same color For example light blue indigo and cyan blue Complementary colors are colors across from each other on a color wheel For example blue and orange Triadic colors are colors that are evenly across from each other in a triangle over the color wheel For example the primary colors red yellow and blue are triadic colors br br br Gallery br br br See also br Circle of fifths br Color theory br Visual perception br Psychophysics br Color solid
