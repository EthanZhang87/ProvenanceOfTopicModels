A fog bow sometimes called a white rainbow is a similar phenomenon to a rainbow however as its name suggests it appears as a bow in fog rather than rain Because of the very small size of water droplets that cause fog smaller than millimeters in the fog bow has only very weak colors with a red outer edge and bluish inner edge The colors fade due to being smeared out by the diffraction effect of the smaller droplets br In many cases when the droplets are very small fog bows appear white and are therefore sometimes called white rainbows Along with its larger angular size this lack of color is a feature of a fog bow that distinguishes it from a glory which has multiple pale colored rings caused by diffraction When droplets forming it are almost all of the same size the fog bow can have multiple inner rings or supernumeraries which are more strongly colored than the main bow br br A fog bow seen in clouds typically from an aircraft looking downwards is called a cloud bow Mariners sometimes call fog bows sea dogs br br br Direction br A fog bow is seen in the same direction as a rainbow thus the sun would be behind the head of the observer and the direction of view would be into a bank of fog which may not be noticeable in directions away from the bow itself Its outer radius is slightly less than that of a rainbow br When a fog bow appears at night it is called a lunar fog bow br br br See also br Circumhorizontal arc br Circumzenithal arc br Cloud iridescence br Dewbow br Halo br Moonbow br Sun dog br br br br br br External links br br Photos and explanation of fogbows at Atmospheric Optics br Fogbow image gallery at AKM website br Fogbows at Glows Bows and Haloes site
