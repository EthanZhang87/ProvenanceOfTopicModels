winged young woman carrying a caduceus the symbol of the messengers and a pitcher of water for the gods Iris was traditionally seen as the consort of Zephyrus the god of the west wind and one of the four Anemoi by whom she is the mother of Pothos in some versions br br br Etymology br The ancient Greek noun means both the rainbow and the halo of the Moon An inscription from Corinth provides evidence for an original form w ris with a digamma that was eventually dropped The noun seems to be of pre Greek origin A Proto Indo European pre form uh i r i has been suggested although Beekes finds it hard to motivate br br br Family br According to Hesiod s Theogony Iris is the daughter of Thaumas and the Oceanid Electra and the sister of the Harpies Arke and Ocypete During the Titanomachy Iris was the messenger of the Olympian gods while her sister Arke betrayed the Olympians and became the messenger of the gods enemy the Titans She is the goddess of the rainbow She also serves nectar to

goddess Arke swift quick both sisters originally sided with the Olympian gods during the Titanomachy but Arke eventually flew out of the company of Olympians to join the Titans as their own messenger goddess so the two sisters found each other on opposite camps during the battle br After the war was won by the Olympian leader Zeus and his allies Zeus punished Arke by tearing her wings from her and in time gave them as a gift to the Nereid Thetis at her wedding to Peleus who in turn gave them to her son Achilles who wore them on his feet Achilles was sometimes known as podarkes feet like the wings of Arke Podarces was also the original name of Priam the king of Troy Iris on the other hand maintained her position as the messenger of the gods alongside Hermes often Iris served specifically as Hera s personal messenger and servant br br br Messenger of the gods br br Following her daughter Persephone s abduction by Hades the goddess of agriculture Demeter withdrew to her temple in Eleusis and made the earth barren causing a great famine that killed off mortals and as a result sacrifices to the gods ceased Zeus then sent Iris to Demeter calling her to join the other gods and lift her curse but as her daughter was not returned Demeter was not persuaded br In one narrative after Leto and her children pleaded with Zeus to release Prometheus from his torment Zeus relented and sent Iris to order Heracles to free the unfortunate Prometheus br After Ceyx drowned in a shipwreck Hera made Iris convey her orders to Hypnos the god of sleep Iris flew and found him in his cave and informed him that Hera wished for Ceyx s wife Alcyone to be informed of her loved one s death in her dreams After delivering Hera s command Iris left immediately not standing to be near Hypnos for too long for his powers took hold of her and made her dizzy and sleepy br In Aristophanes s comedy The Birds the titular birds build a city in the sky and plan to supplant the Olympian gods Iris as the messenger goes to meet them but she is ridiculed insulted and threatened with rape by their leader Pisetaerus an elderly Athenian man Iris appears confused that Pisetearus does not know who the gods are and that she is one of them Pisetaerus then tells her that the birds are the gods now the deities whom the humans must sacrifice to After Pisetaerus threatens to rape her Iris scolds him for his foul language and leaves warning him that Zeus whom she refers to as her father will deal with him and make him pay br Iris also appears several times in Virgil s Aeneid usually as an agent of Juno In Book Juno dispatches her to pluck a lock of hair from the head of Queen Dido so that she may die and enter Hades In book Iris having taken on the form of a Trojan woman stirs up the other Trojan mothers to set fire to four of Aeneas ships in order to prevent them from leaving Sicily br br According to the Roman poet Ovid after Romulus was deified as the god Quirinus his wife Hersilia pleaded with the gods to let her become immortal as well so that she could be with her husband once again Juno heard her plea and sent Iris down to her With a single finger Iris touched Hersilia and transformed her into an immortal goddess Hersilia flew to Olympus where she became one of the Horae and was permitted to live with her husband forevermore br br br Trojan War br According to the lost epic Cypria by Stasinus it was Iris who informed Menelaus who had sailed off to Crete of what had happened back in Sparta while he was gone namely his wife Helen s elopement with the Trojan Prince Paris as well as the death of Helen s brother Castor br Iris is frequently mentioned as a divine messenger in The Iliad which is attributed to Homer She does not however appear in The Odyssey where her role is instead filled by Hermes Like Hermes Iris carries a caduceus or winged staff By command of Zeus the king of the gods she carries a ewer of water from the River Styx with which she puts to sleep all who perjure themselves In Book XXIII she delivers Achilles s prayer to Boreas and Zephyrus to light the funeral pyre of Patroclus In the last book Zeus sends Iris to King Priam to tell him that he should go to the Achaean camp alone and ransom the body of his slain son Hector from Achilles Iris swiftly delivers the message to Priam and returns to Olympus br br br Other myths br br According to the Homeric Hymn to Apollo when Leto was in labor prior to giving birth to her twin children Apollo and Artemis all the goddesses were in attendance except for two Hera and Eileithyia the goddess of childbirth On the ninth day of her labor Leto told Iris to bribe Eileithyia and ask for her help in giving birth to her children without allowing Hera to find out According to Callimachus Iris along with Ares ordered on Hera s orders all cities and other places to shun the pregnant Leto and deny her shelter where she could bring forth her twins After Asteria now transformed into the island of Delos offered shelter to Leto Iris flew back to Hera to inform her that Leto had been allowed to give birth due to Asteria defying Hera s orders and took her seat beside Hera br According to Apollonius Rhodius Iris turned back the Argonauts Zetes and Calais who had pursued the Harpies to the Strophades Islands of Turning The brothers had driven off the monsters from their torment of the prophet Phineus but did not kill them upon the request of Iris who promised that Phineus would not be bothered by the Harpies again br After King Creon of Thebes forbade the burial of the dead Argive soldiers who had raised their arms against Thebes Hera ordered Iris to moisturize their dead bodies with dew and ambrosia br In a lesser known narrative Iris once came close to being raped by the satyrs after she attempted to disrupt their worship of Dionysus perhaps at the behest of Hera About fifteen black and red figure vase paintings dating from the fifth century BC depict said satyrs either menacingly advancing toward or getting hold of her when she tries to interfere with the sacrifice In another cup Iris is depicted being assaulted by the satyrs who apparently are trying to prevent Iris from stealing sacrificial meat from the altar of Dionysus who is also present in the scene On the other side the satyrs are attacking Hera who stands between Hermes and Heracles The ancient playwright Achaeus wrote Iris a now lost satyr play which might have been the source of those vases subject br In Euripides play Heracles Gone Mad Iris appears alongside Lyssa the goddess of madness and insanity cursing Heracles with the fit of madness in which he kills his three sons and his wife Megara Iris also prepared the bed of Zeus and Hera br br br Worship br br br Cult br br Unlike the other prominent messenger god of the Greeks Hermes Iris did not play a large part in the ancient Greek religion and was rarely worshipped There are no known temples shrines or sanctuaries to Iris or festivals held in her honour While she is frequently depicted on vases and in bas reliefs few statues are known to have been made of Iris during antiquity She was however depicted in sculpture on the west pediment of Parthenon in Athens br Iris does appear to have been the object of at least some minor worship but the only trace preserved of her cult is the note by Athenaeus in Scholars at Dinner that the people of Delos sacrificed to Iris offering her cheesecakes called basyniae a type of cake of wheat flour suet and honey boiled up together br br br Epithets br Iris had numerous poetic titles and epithets including chrysopteros golden winged podas kea swift footed or pod nemos kea wind swift footed roscida dewy Latin and Thaumantias or Thaumantis Daughter of Thaumas

beautiful young maiden with wings on her shoulders As a goddess Iris is associated with communication messages the rainbow and new endeavors This personification of a rainbow was once described as being a link to the heavens and earth br In some texts she is depicted wearing a coat of many colors With this coat she actually creates the rainbows she rides to get from place to place Iris wings were said to be so beautiful that she could even light up a dark cavern a trait observable from the story of her visit to Somnus in order to relay a message to Alcyone br While Iris was principally associated with communication and messages she was also believed to aid in the fulfillment of humans prayers either by fulfilling them herself or by bringing them to the attention of other deities br
