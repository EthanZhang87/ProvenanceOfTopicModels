Chromesthesia or sound to color synesthesia is a type of synesthesia in which sound involuntarily evokes an experience of color shape and movement Individuals with sound color synesthesia are consciously aware of their synesthetic color associations perceptions in daily life Synesthetes that perceive color while listening to music experience the colors in addition to the normal auditory sensations The synesthetic color experience supplements but does not obscure real modality specific perceptions As with other forms of synesthesia individuals with sound color synesthesia perceive it spontaneously without effort and as their normal realm of experience Chromesthesia can be induced by different auditory experiences such as music phonemes speech and or everyday sounds br br br Individual variance br The color associations that is which color is associated to which sound tone pitch or timbre is highly idiosyncratic but in most cases consistent over time Individuals with synesthesia have unique color pairings However studies to date have reported that synesthetes and non synesthetes alike associate high pitched sounds with lighter or brighter colors and low pitched sounds with darker colors indicating that a common mechanism may underlie those associations in normal adult brains There are forms of pseudo chromesthesia that may be explained by associations synesthetes have made and forgotten from childhood br As with other types of synesthesia sound color synesthesia can be divided into groups based on the way the colors are experienced Those that see or perceive the color in external space are called projectors and those that perceive the color in the mind s eye are often called associators but these terms can be misleading to understanding the nature of the experience For most synesthetes the condition is not wholly sensory perceptual br For some individuals chromesthesia is only triggered by speech sounds while others chromesthesia can be triggered by any auditory stimuli In a study investigating variability within categories of synesthesia of subjects with chromesthesia for spoken words reported that voice pitch accent and prosody influenced the synesthetic color whereas few subjects reported that volume or speed of talking had any influence Within these subjects many reported that the speaker s emotional inflection could influence the synesthetic color but only two reported that their own mood had such influence Of participants categorized as having synesthesia for music in this study reported concurrents exclusively when listening to notes being played When asked whether the experience of the concurrent could be voluntarily controlled only of participants indicated an ability to smother ignore or willfully evoke their concurrents without great effort Attention to the inducing stimulus was reported as influential in of participants Other contributing factors included concentration level fatigue sleep habits fever emotions and substances such as caffeine or alcohol br Sound color synesthesia is far more common than color sound synesthesia although there are reported cases where sounds and colors activate bidirectionally One individual sees colors when she hears sounds and also hears sounds when she sees colors This type of synesthesia interferes greatly with daily life This individual s associations were highly consistent over time but the associations were not necessarily the same in either direction Another individual who had absolute pitch as well as Chromesthesia claimed that her absolute pitch was less stable than her Chromesthesia br There may be an effect of semantic mediation in some individuals with sound color synesthesia One subject self triggered notes on a synthesizer and noted the color associations When the synthesizer was transposed without her knowledge she reported identical color associations to the notes that she believed she was hearing rather than the absolute pitch of the tones br br br History br For History of Synesthesia History of synesthesia researchThe terms synesthesia and chromesthesia have developed and evolved considerably throughout history The first documented synesthete was Georg Tobias Ludwig Sachs in Although he did not give a specific name to his experience in a medical dissertation regarding his albinism written in Latin he mentioned obscure ideas and described how colored ideas appeared to him Even earlier than Sachs however Johann Gottfried Herder discussed similar ideas in his Treatise on the Origin of Language in He talked about how people through a sudden onset immediately associate with this sound that color br The first concrete term associated with chromesthesia was given by Charles Auguste douard Cornaz in an eye disease dissertation in Color blindness was a common condition known as chromatodysopsia and since Cornaz saw chromesthesia as the opposite he named it hyperchromatopsia or perception of too many colors br In Eugen Bleuler and Karl Bernhard Lehmann were the first to establish six different types of what they called secondary sensations or secondary imaginations The first which was the most common was sound photisms They described it as light color and form sensations which are elicited through hearing Their book was reviewed by an Austrian newspaper where the term colored hearing still commonly used today to describe chromesthesia first appeared br Research on synesthesia in the United States began in And since the term finally expanded from pure sound to color experiences chromesthesia to a wide range of phenomena including grapheme color synesthesia mirror touch synesthesia and lexical gustatory synesthesia The rise of behaviorism between and resulted in a considerable decline in interest for synesthesia as it was seen as little more than a learned association The number of scientific papers on the topic rebounded around and exponentially increased in the st century where substantial progress has been made to study it empirically and understand the mechanisms at work br br br Mechanisms br Synesthesia is established in early childhood when the brain is most plastic There is a genetic predisposition for the condition but the specific type is determined by environment and learning which explains why mappings differ across individuals but are not strictly random Furthermore it manifests as the dominant process in distributed systems or neural networks which are dynamic auto assemble and self calibrate That is what is understood so far but the specific mechanisms by which synesthesia occurs are still unclear and a general consensus has not yet been reached There are two main hypotheses Cross activation theory and Disinhibited feedback model br br br Cross activation theory br The cross activation theory of synesthesia was formulated by V S Ramachandran and E M Hubard based on converging evidence from studies of synesthesia that sensory areas for processing real and synesthetic information tend to be neighboring brain regions This is most apparent in grapheme color synesthesia because the brain regions for color processing and visual word form processing are adjacent Individuals with chromesthesia show activation of brain areas involved in visual processing such as V immediately after the auditory perception indicating an automatic linking of sounds and colors br Neonates have increased connectivity between different brain areas but these hyper connections are cut back during development The reason for this cross activation is unclear but one hypothesis is that the increased connectivity between adjacent brain regions is due to a reduction in the pruning of neuronal networks during childhood Another hypothesis is that unusual branching of neurons causes more numerous synaptic connections and cross activation These hypotheses align with Daphne Maurer s neonatal hypothesis which states that all newborns are synesthetes but the condition disappears at around the age of three months br Cross activation may occur at the fusiform gyrus in projector synesthetes who perceive photisms in external space and at the angular gyrus in associator synesthetes who perceive photisms which come from learned associations in their mind br One problem with the cross activation theory is that synesthesia should be present from birth but is only evident from mid childhood br br br Disinhibited feedback model br The disinhibited feedback model is an alternative to the cross activation theory The disinhibited feedback model rejects the assumption of increased connectivity in synesthetes and proposes that the cross activation is due to a decrease of inhibition in the networks present in the normal adult brain Disinhibited feedback could account for the fact that chromesthesia can be acquired by damage to the retino cortical pathway or transiently induced through chemical agents sensory deprivation meditation etc br In all brains there are anatomical cross connections where inhibition and excitation are counterbalanced However excitation prevails in synesthetes and this disinhibits other structures to elicit sensory sensations in a second sensory area One theory that explains how this occurs is neurotransmitter mediated inhibition Local inhibitory networks are supposed to confine cortical firing to a specific region but it leads to a spread of cortical firing when these networks are blocked by bicuculline br Forward feeding connections in the brain that receive converging signals from multiple pathways are reciprocated by feedback connections In most people feedback connections are sufficiently inhibited to avoid synesthetic induction of a concurrent perception In synesthetes it is suggested that feedforward signaling in the inducer pathway could activate neurons to which both inducer and concurrent pathways converge and that feedback signaling is capable of propagating down the concurrent pathway to activate the concurrent representation In this mechanism feedforward activity from the inducer leads to feedback activation of the concurrent representation br br br Research br The mechanism by which synesthesia occurs has yet to be identified Given that synesthetes and non synesthetes both match sounds to colors in a non arbitrary way and that the ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs can induce synesthesia in under an hour some researchers suggest that synesthetic experience uses existing pathways in the normal brain The cause of synesthesia is also unclear although evidence points to a genetic predisposition Synesthesia runs in families though the condition may present idiosyncratically within a family Synesthesia may skip a generation However there are cases of monozygotic twins where only one has synesthesia indicating there may be additional factors br Differences between synesthetic and non synesthetic brains may reflect direct hard wired connections between unimodal auditory and visual regions in the brain or they may reflect feedback pathways from multimodal audiovisual regions to unimodal visual regions present in all brains br br br Involvement of specific brain regions br In addition to high interconnectivity in synesthesia there is an apparent contribution from the inferior parietal cortex during synesthetic experiences possibly serving as the mechanism to bind the real and synesthetic perceptions into one experience Parietal lobe activation is most apparent when the synesthete is directing attentional focus to the synesthetic experience br Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies implicate the left superior temporal sulcus for the integration of auditory and visual information This brain region responds most strongly to congruent pairs of visual and auditory information such as congruent lip movements and speech br br br Definitional bias br The literature contains conflicting definitional criteria for synesthesia which could bias selection of research subjects and interpretation of results Synesthesia has long been described as a merging of the senses or as a kind of cross sensory experience however the condition is not purely sensory perceptual in all individuals While this description of synesthesia is useful in describing the condition it should not be interpreted literally and used as selection criteria for scientific exploration br Another common defining characteristic of synesthesia is that synesthetic associations are consistent over time This is generally determined by having individuals report color pairings twice with several months separating the test from the re test Consistency has been described as so fundamental to synesthesia that the test of consistency has become the behavioral gold standard for identifying the genuine condition and selecting subjects for research This creates a circular bias in which virtually all research subjects show consistency over time because they have been selected for it While consistency to some extent may be characteristic of synesthesia there are individuals that fit all other criteria of synesthesia but report that their synesthetic associations are not consistent over time br Another misleading defining characteristic of synesthesia has been that synesthetic concurrents are spatially extended and the individuals should be able to indicate a spatial location in which the concurrent is experienced In the case of sound color synesthesia those who experience colored photisms from listening to music can often describe the direction of movement of these photisms While the majority of synesthetes experience a spatial quality to the synesthetic experience there are still many that report no such quality br In addition to definitional inclusion exclusion criteria for synesthesia research self report bias is also likely relevant to many studies This self report bias if it exists would perpetuate itself because the condition would become defined by those cases that become known and not by those that remain hidden This is significant because many synesthetic individuals may exclude themselves on the basis of not fitting the prescribed definitional criteria This is also significant to the extent that synesthetic individuals have a limited ability to differentiate their experience from that of nonsynesthetic individuals br A possible resolution of these issues would involve defining synesthesia on a neurological basis Such a unifying neurobiological cause has yet to be found but if it exists it would deepen understanding of the phenomenon in ways that the behavioral definition has failed to do br br br Drug induced chromesthesia br br Chromesthesia can be transiently induced with chemical agents through the manipulation of neurotransmitters These substances can also modulate existing synesthesia Psychoactive drugs including LSD mescaline psilocybin and ayahuasca are non selective serotonin agonists that elicit spontaneous synesthesia specially sound to color br The first to report drug induced chromesthesia was Th ophile Gautier in Under the influence of hashish he described My hearing was developed extraordinarily I heard the noise of colors Green red blue yellow sounds reached me in perfectly distinguishable waves Gautier made a sketch of Gustave Moreau playing the piano where he depicted his chromesthetic experiences as lines of color above the instrument br Recent scientific studies with enhanced methodologies suggest that drug induced synesthesia is substantially different from congenital synesthesia Psychoactive substances affect ongoing streams of transmission rather than causing stimulus induced activation The most common type of synesthesia elicited with chemical agents is chromesthesia Still frequent inducers include auditory and visual stimuli especially music which could explain the prevalence of sound to color synesthesia over other types of synesthesia br br Heinrich Kl ver categorized recurring geometric shapes under the influence of peyote in the s He called these the form constants Tunnels Spirals Honeycombs Gratings and Cobwebs These also apply to both drug induced and natural hallucinations which appear in near death experiences sensory deprivation waking up or falling asleep and during migraines According to Kl ver all hallucinations consist of shapes in one of these categories and atypical hallucinations are simply variations The form constants are common in chromesthetic experiences br Psychedelics greatly enhance suggestibility so it is fairly common to mistake hallucinations with chromesthesia especially considering that all measures of color perception including brightness saturation luminance contrast and hue are affected due to chemical agents Drug induced chromesthesia as opposed to congenital chromesthesia is not consistent or automatic Furthermore bottom up processing is responsible for experiences under drug influence so external stimuli and context are not as critical br Several studies both direct intentionally trying to induce synesthesia and indirect participants respond to a set of questions including one about synesthetic experiences suggest that the induction of synesthesia with chemical agents is possible Nevertheless most studies suffer from a large number of limitations including a lack of placebo control double blinds and randomized allocation br br br Music and chromesthesia br Individuals with chromesthesia are more likely to play musical instruments and be artistically inclined Furthermore both the hobbies and occupations of synesthetes are skewed toward the creative industries People with synesthetic propensities are more metaphorical since the same genes cause them to relate concepts and ideas and thus be more creative This could explain the higher incidence of musicians who have synesthesia br However musical experience does not assist the ability to consistently match colors to tones Against natural expectation studies have found that possession of absolute pitch increased local variance in matching ability One possible explanation for this is that because absolute pitch is subject to chance error occasionally incorrectly inferred note names could compete with the pitch induced color on particular trials Another possibility is that people with absolute pitch can label tighter pitch recognition categories than normal introducing a greater number of category boundaries to cross between distinct tones br br br Composers with chromesthesia br Franz Liszt was a composer who was known for asking performers to play with color He was noted telling his orchestra to play the music in a Bluer Fashion since that is what the tone required Synesthesia was not a common term in Liszt s time people thought he was playing a trick on them when he referred to a color instead of a musical term br Leonard Bernstein openly discussed his chromesthesia which he described as a timbre to color Although he does not reference specific songs as being a certain color he does explain the way it should sound to the artist performing There are recordings of him stopping orchestras and singers when they are changing the timbre If someone changes the timbre or tone in a piece it does not necessarily change the sound to the listener but the composer with Chromesthesia will automatically know br Amy Beach was another composer who had synesthesia According to her perspective each key signature was associated with a particular color If an artist changed the key to suit their voice then she would become upset because it would change the intended sound portrayal and emotion of the piece br Tori Amos has described seeing music as structures of light since early childhood an experience consistent with chromesthesia br Olivier Messiaen was influenced by the color of musical keys for his compositions br br br Alexander Scriabin br br Alexander Scriabin was a Russian composer and pianist He is famously regarded as a synesthete but there is a lot of controversy surrounding whether he had chromesthesia or not Scriabin was a major proponent of Theosophy which had a system associating colors to feelings and emotions This influenced the musician who distinguished spiritual tonalities like F sharp major from earthly material ones C major F major Furthermore Alexander Scriabin developed a keyboard with lights or clavier lumi res which directly matched musical notes with colors br Scriabin believed integration of colored light within a symphonic work would act as a powerful psychological resonator for the listener That is why he created the clavier lumi res for his color symphony Prometheus The Poem of Fire This consisted of a color organ which projected colors on a screen The musicologist Sabaneyev first published a table of Scriabin s sound to color mapping in br br Scriabin was friends with composer Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov who was a synesthete and their sound to color associations were not the same Specifically Rimsky Korsakov made a distinction between major and minor scales and his associations had a more neutral spontaneous character Still different individuals respond to some sounds and not others and sound to color associations vary greatly between them br br When the notes are ordered by the circle of fifths the colors are in order of a spectrum which casts doubt on whether Scriabin experienced chromesthesia br br Whether Scriabin had chromesthesia or not his work was greatly influenced by the particularities of this phenomenon He created a system that associated colors to tones and aimed to create holistic sensory experiences with his compositions Not only did he experiment with colors but also with the generation of scents and sensation of touch and taste br br br br br br Works cited br br br External links br Media related
