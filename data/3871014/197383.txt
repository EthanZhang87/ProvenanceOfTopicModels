Dzogchen Tibetan Wylie rdzogs chen Great Perfection or Great Completion also known as atiyoga utmost yoga is a tradition of teachings in Indo Tibetan Buddhism and Bon aimed at discovering and continuing in the ultimate ground of existence The goal of Dzogchen is knowledge of this basis this knowledge is called rigpa Skt vidy There are spiritual practices taught in various Dzogchen systems for awakening rigpa br Dzogchen emerged during the first dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet around the th to th centuries CE While it is considered a Tibetan development by some scholars it draws upon key ideas from Indian sources The earliest Dzogchen texts appeared in the th century attributed to Indian masters These texts known as the Eighteen Great Scriptures form the mind series and are attributed to figures like r Si gha and Vimalamitra Early Dzogchen was marked by a departure from normative Vajrayana practices focusing instead on simple calming contemplations leading to a direct immersion in awareness During the Tibetan renaissance era th to early th century Dzogchen underwent significant development incorporating new practices and teachings from India This period saw the emergence of new Dzogchen traditions like the Instruction Class series and the Seminal Heart br Dzogchen is classified into three series the Semde Mind Series Longd Space Series and Menngagde Instruction Series The Dzogchen path comprises the Base the Path and the Fruit The Base represents the original state of existence characterized by emptiness clarity lhun grub associated with luminous clarity and compassionate energy The Path involves gaining a direct understanding of the mind s pure nature through meditation and specific Dzogchen methods The Fruit is the realization of one s true nature leading to complete non dual awareness and the dissolution of dualities br Dzogchen practitioners aim for self liberation where all experiences are integrated with awareness of one s true nature This process may culminate in the attainment of a rainbow body at the moment of death symbolizing full Buddhahood Critics point to tensions between gradual and simultaneous practice within Dzogchen traditions but practitioners argue these approaches cater to different levels of ability and understanding Overall Dzogchen offers a direct path to realizing the innate wisdom and compassion of the mind br br br History br br Dzogchen arose in the era of the first dissemination of Buddhism in Tibet th to th centuries CE during the Tibetan Empire and continued during the Era of Fragmentation th th centuries American Tibetologist David Germano argues that Dzogchen is likely a Tibetan Buddhist development However numerous ideas key to Dzogchen like emptiness and luminosity can be found in Indian sources like the Buddhist tantras buddha nature literature and other Mahayana sources like the La k vat ra S tra Furthermore scholars like Sam van Schaik see Dzogchen as having arisen out of tantric Buddhist completion stage practices br The earliest Dzogchen sources appeared in the first half of the th century with a series of short texts attributed to Indian saints The most of important of these are the Eighteen Great Scriptures which are today known as the mind series Semde and are attributed to Indian masters like r Si gha Vairotsana and Vimalamitra The later Semde compilation tantra titled the All Creating King Kunjed Gyalpo is one of the most important and widely quoted of all Dzogchen scriptures br Germano sees the early Dzogchen of the Tibetan Empire period as characterized by the rejection of normative Vajrayana practice Germano calls the early Dzogchen traditions pristine Great Perfection since it is marked by the absence of presentations of detailed ritual and contemplative technique as well as a lack of funerary charnel ground and death imagery found in some Buddhist tantras According to Germano instead of tantric deity yoga methods early Dzogchen mainly focused on simple calming shamatha contemplations leading to a technique free immersion in the bare immediacy of one s own deepest levels of awareness Similarly Christopher Hatchell explains that since for early Dzogchen all beings and all appearances are themselves the singular enlightened gnosis of the buddha All Good Samantabhadra Kuntu Zangpo there is nothing to do but to recognize this inherent awakened mind relax and let go br During the Tibetan renaissance era th century to the early th century many new Vajrayana texts teachings and practices were introduced from India At this time the Nyingma school and its Dzogchen traditions reinvented themselves producing many new scriptures and developing new practices influenced by the Sarma traditions These new influences were absorbed into Dzogchen through the practice of finding treasure texts terma that were discovered by treasure revealers tertons These tantric elements included subtle body practices visionary practices like dark retreat and a focus on death motifs and practices such as funerary and relic rituals bardo teachings phowa etc br These new methods and teachings were part of several new traditions such as the Secret Cycle gsang skor Ultra Pith yang tig Brahmin s tradition bram ze i lugs the Space Class Series and especially the Instruction Class series Menngagde which culminated in the Seminal Heart snying thig which emerged in the late th and early th century The most influential texts in this period are Seventeen Tantras rgyud bcu bdun The most important scholarly figure in the systematization of these new traditions was Longchenpa Rabjampa br Later figures who also revealed important treasure text cycles include Karma Lingpa who revealed the bar do thos grol Rigdzin G dem Jigme Lingpa who revealed the influential Longchen Nyingthig and Dudjom Lingpa br br br Etymology and concepts br Dzogchen is composed of two terms br br rdzogs perfection completion br chen great br According to the th Dalai Lama the term dzogchen may be a rendering of the Sanskrit term mah sandhi br The term initially referred to the highest perfection of Vajrayana deity yoga Specifically it refers to the stage after the deity visualisation has been dissolved and one rests in the natural state of the innately luminous and pure mind According to Sam van Schaik in the th century tantra Sarvabuddhasam yoga the term refers to a realization of the nature of reality which arises through the practice of tantric anuyoga practices which produce bliss br In the th and th century when Dzogchen emerged as a separate vehicle to liberation in the Nyingma tradition the term was used synonymously with the Sanskrit term ati yoga primordial yoga br br br Rigpa knowledge and ma rigpa delusion br br Rigpa Sanskrit vidy knowledge is a central concept in Dzogchen According to c rya Malcolm Smith br br A text from the Heart Essence of Vimalamitra called the Lamp Summarizing Vidy Rig pa bsdus pa i sgronma defines vidy in the following way vidy is knowing clear and unchanging In Sanskrit the term vidy and all its cognates imply consciousness knowing knowledge science intelligence and so on Simply put vidy means unconfused knowledge of the basis that is its own state br Ma rigpa avidy is the opposite of rigpa or knowledge Ma rigpa is ignorance delusion or unawareness the failure to recognize the nature of the basis An important theme in Dzogchen texts is explaining how ignorance arises from the basis or Dharmata which is associated with ye shes or pristine consciousness Automatically arising unawareness lhan skyes ma rigpa exists because the basis has a natural cognitive potentiality which gives rise to appearances This is the ground for samsara and nirvana br br br Traditional exegesis br The Mirror of the Heart of Vajrasattva Dorje Sempa Nyinggi Melong a major Dzogchen tantra explains the term Dzog Perfection as follows br br Because rigpa is perfect wisdom in the realm beyond effort it is perfection Because meditation is perfect stainless wisdom in the realm beyond concepts it is perfection Because behavior is perfect universal wisdom in the realm beyond correction it is perfection Because view is perfect non conceptual wisdom in the realm beyond achievement it is perfection Because fruit is the perfect twenty five wisdoms in the realm beyond frame of reference it is perfection br The Mirror of the Heart of Vajrasattva explains that Dzogchen is great because br br It is the pinnacle of all vehicles views meditations behaviors goals br It is never moving from the natural state br It functions without obstacles in the realm beyond change br It manifests beyond concepts in the realm beyond attachment br It manifests without attachment in the realm beyond desire br It manifests in great bliss in the realm beyond speech br It is the source that pervades pure enlightenment br It is non substantial rigpa beyond action and effort br It remains in equality without moving from the realm of total bliss and without moving from the essential meaning br It exists everywhere without being a dimension of grasping br It is the essence of everything without being established with words and syllables br br br Three series br The Three Series of Dzogchen rdzogs chen sde gsum are a traditional Tibetan Buddhist classification which divides the teachings of the Nyingma school s Dzogchen tradition into three series divisions or sections These three are the Semde Mind Series the Longd Space Series and the Menngagde Instruction Series Traditional accounts of the Nyingma school attribute this schema to the Indian master Ma ju r mitra c th century br According to modern Tibetologists this doxographic schema actually developed in the literature of the Instruction Series c th century onwards as a way to distinguish and categorize the various Dzogchen teachings at the time According to Instruction Series texts the Mind Series is based on understanding that one s own mind is the basis of all appearances and that this basis called mind itself is empty and luminous The Space series meanwhile is focused on emptiness Skt nyat T stong pa nyid Finally the Instruction Series itself is seen as the most direct kind of realization without the need to meditate on emptiness or mind Over time the Instruction Series came to dominate the Dzogchen tradition and it remains the series that is most widely practiced and taught while the other two series are rarely practiced today with the exception of a few masters like Namkhai Norbu br According to Namkhai Norbu the three series are three modes of presenting and introducing the state of Dzogchen Norbu states that Mennagde is a more direct form of introduction Longde is closely associated with symbolic forms of introducing Dzogchen and Semde is more focused on oral forms of introduction Germano writes that the Mind Series serves as a classification for the earlier texts and forms of Dzogchen prior to the development of the Seminal Heart movements which focused on meditations based on tantric understandings of bodhicitta byang chub kyi sems This referred to the ultimate nature of the mind which is empty stong pa luminous od gsal ba and pure According to Germano the Space and Instruction Series are associated with later historical developments of Dzogchen which increasingly experimented with re incorporating tantric contemplative techniques centered on the body and vision as well as the consequent philosophical shifts his became interwoven with br br br Base Path and Fruit br br In Dzogchen there are three central aspects the Base the Path and the Fruit The Base represents the original unchanging state of existence characterized by emptiness clarity and compassionate energy br The Path comprises three key elements view practice and conduct The view focuses on gaining a direct understanding of the pure nature of the mind Practice involves meditation techniques and specific Dzogchen methods Conduct means integrating these practices into daily life br The Fruit represents the ultimate goal realizing one s true nature and achieving Buddhahood This involves discovering the inherent state of the base and integrating all experiences with one s awareness of it Ultimately it leads to complete non dual awareness transcending egoic limitations and dissolving dualities br br br The Base or Ground br br A key concept in Dzogchen is the base ground or primordial state Tibetan gzhi Sanskrit raya also called the general ground spyi gzhi or the original ground gdod ma i gzhi The basis is the original state before realization produced buddhas and nonrealization produced sentient beings It is atemporal and unchanging and yet it is noetically potent giving rise to mind sems Skt citta consciousness shes pa Skt vij na delusion marigpa Skt avidy and knowledge rigpa Skt vidy Furthermore Hatchell notes that the Dzogchen tradition portrays ultimate reality as something which is beyond the concepts of one and many br br br Three qualities br According to the Dzogchen teachings the Ground or Buddha nature has three qualities br br ngo bo essence oneness or emptiness Wylie ngo bo stong pa br rang bzhin nature luminosity lucidity or clarity as in the luminous mind of the Five Pure Lights Wylie rang bzhin gsal ba br thugs rje power universal compassionate energy Wylie thugs rje kun khyab unobstructed Wylie ma gags pa br Herbert V Guenther points out that this Ground is both a static potential and a dynamic unfolding They give a process orientated translation to avoid any essentialist associations since br br ngo bo facticity has nothing to do with nor can even be reduced to the essentialist categories of substance and quality rang bzhin actuality remains open dimensional rather than being or turning into a rigid essence despite its being what it is and that thugs rje resonance is an atemporal sensitivity and response rather than a distinct and narrowly circumscribed operation br The th th century Tibetan Buddhist scholar Shechen Gyaltsap Gyurme Pema Namgyal sees the Buddha nature as ultimate truth nirvana which is constituted of profundity primordial peace and radiance br br Buddha nature is immaculate It is profound serene unfabricated suchness an uncompounded expanse of luminosity nonarising unceasing primordial peace spontaneously present nirvana br br br Direct introduction br br Direct introduction is called the Empowerment of Awareness Wylie rig pa i rtsal dbang pronounced rigpay sall wahng a technical term employed within the Dzogchen lineages for a particular lineage of empowerment propagated by Jigme Lingpa This empowerment consists of the direct introduction of the student to the intrinsic nature of their own mind essence rigpa by their empowering master br br br Pointing out instruction br br In Dzogchen tradition pointing out instruction Tibetan Wylie ngo sprod kyi gdams pa THL ngo tr kyi dam pa is also referred to as pointing out the nature of mind Tibetan Wylie sems kyi ngo sprod THL sem kyi ngo tr pointing out transmission or introduction to the nature of mind The pointing out instruction ngo sprod is an introduction to the nature of mind br br br The Path br There are three major divisions of the Dzogchen path known as the Three Dharmas of the Path These are tawa gompa and ch pa Namkhai Norbu translates these three terms as view practice and conduct br br br Garab Dorje s three statements br br Garab Dorje c epitomized the Dzogchen teaching in three principles known as Striking the Vital Point in Three Statements Tsik Sum N Dek said to be his last words They give in short the development a student has to undergo br Garab Dorje s three statements were integrated into the Nyingthig traditions the most popular of which in the Longchen Nyingthig by Jigme Lingpa The statements are br br Introducing directly the face of rigpa itself ngo rang tok tu tr Dudjom Rinpoche states this refers to Introducing directly the face of the naked mind as the rigpa itself the innate primordial wisdom br Deciding upon one thing and one thing only tak chik tok tu ch Dudjom states Because all phenomena whatever manifests whether sa s ra or nirv a are none other than the rigpa s own play there is complete and direct decision that there is nothing other than the abiding of the continual flow of rigpa br Confidence directly in the liberation of rising thoughts deng drol tok tu cha Dudjom comments In the recognition of namtok arising thoughts whatever arises whether gross or subtle there is direct confidence in the simultaneity of the arising and dissolution in the expanse of dharmak ya which is the unity of rigpa and nyat br br br View br br Nyingma Dzogchen texts use unique terminology to describe the Dzogchen view Tib tawa Some of these terms deal with the different elements and features of the mind and are drawn from classic Buddhist thought The generic term for consciousness is shes pa Skt vij na and includes the six sense consciousnesses Worldly impure and dualistic forms of consciousness are generally referred to with terms such as sems citta mind yid m nas and blo buddhi On the other hand nirvanic or liberated forms of consciousness are described with terms such as ye shes j na pristine consciousness and shes rab praj wisdom According to Sam van Schaik two significant terms used in Dzogchen literature is the ground gzhi and gnosis rig pa which represent the ontological and gnoseological aspects of the nirvanic state respectively br Nyingma Dzogchen literature also describes nirvana as the expanse or space klong or dbyings or the expanse of Dharma chos dbyings Sanskrit Dharmadhatu The term Dharmakaya Dharma body is also often associated with these terms in Dzogchen as explained by Tulku Urgyen br br Dharmakaya is like space You cannot say there is any limit to space in any direction No matter how far you go you never reach a point where space stops and that is the end of space Space is infinite in all directions so is dharmakaya Dharmakaya is all pervasive and totally infinite beyond any confines or limitations This is so for the dharmakaya of all buddhas There is no individual dharmakaya for each buddha as there is no individual space for each country br The Dzogchen View of the secret instruction series man ngag sde is classically explained through the eleven vajra topics These can be found in the String of Pearls Tantra Mu tig phreng ba the Great Commentary by Vimalamitra as well as in Longchenpa s Treasury of Word and Meaning Tsik D n Dz br br br Practice br br Dzogchen practice gompa relies on the Dzogchen view which is a direct non dual non conceptual knowledge of the pure nature This is achieved through one s relationship with a guru or lama who introduces one to our own primordial state and provides instruction on how to practice This direct introduction and transmission from a Dzogchen master is considered absolutely essential br The Dzogchen tradition contains numerous systems of practices including various forms of meditation tantric yogas and unique Dzogchen methods The earliest form of Dzogchen practice the Semde Mind series generally emphasized non symbolic formless practices as opposed to tantric deity yoga br Later developments led to the main Dzogchen practices becoming more infused with various preliminary and tantric methods like deity yoga semdzin holding the mind rushen separating samsara and nirvana and vipasyana lhagthong which are all seen as skillful means to achieve the basic state of contemplation of the primordially pure state br The key Dzogchen meditation methods which are unique to the tradition are trekch cutting tension and t gal along with unique Dzogchen teachings on awakening in the bardo intermediate state between death and rebirth In trekch one first identifies the innate pure awareness and then sustains recognition of it in all activities In t gal crossing over a yogi works with various gazes and postures which lead to various forms of visions in dark retreat or through sky gazing br The most comprehensive study of sky gazing meditation known as t gal or thod rgal has been written by Flavio A Geisshuesler Although the term thod rgal is generally translated as Direct Transcendence or Leap Over Geisshuesler argues that the expression really means Skullward Leap as it consists of the Tibetan words thod above over but also head wrapper turban skull and rgal to leap over In the larger Tibetan cultural area it is the most elevated part of the human body the skull or its extension in the form of a turban like headdress that allows the religious practitioner to gain access to the source of vitality located in the heavens Both the head and the headdress have deep resonances with animals particularly deer and sheep which are central for the sky gazing practice because of their ability to ascend and descend vertically to move in between various realms of existence br br br Conduct br br Norbu notes that Tantric practices may be used as secondary practices by the practitioner of Dzogchen alongside the principal practice of contemplation Similarly physical yoga Tib trulkhor may also be used as supporting practices br br br The Fruit br br br Self liberation br According to Namkhai Norbu in Dzogchen to become realized simply means to discover and manifest that which from the very beginning has been our own true condition the Zhi gzhi or Base Since the basis the path of practice and the fruit or result of practice are non dual from the ultimate perspective in Dzogchen understands the path as not separate from the result or fruit of the path i e Buddhahood Once a Dzogchen practitioner has recognized their true nature and do not remain in doubt regarding this the path consists of the integration sewa of all experiences in their life with the state of rigpa All these experiences are self liberated through this integration or mixing br This process is often explained through three liberations or capacities of a Dzogchen practitioner br br Cherdrol one observes and it liberates This is when an ordinary appearance occurs and one sees its true nature which leads to its self liberation It is compared to how a drop of dew evaporates when the sunlight shines on it br Shardrol as soon as it arises it liberates itself This occurs when any sense contact or passion arises self liberates automatically and effortlessly This is compared to how snow melts immediately on falling into the sea br Rangdrol of itself it liberates itself according to Norbu this is completely non dual and all at once instantaneous self liberation Here the illusory separation of subject and object collapses of itself and one s habitual vision the limited cage the trap of ego opens out into the spacious vision of what is The simile used here is a snake effortlessly unwinding its own body br Advanced Dzogchen practitioners are also said to sometimes manifest supranormal knowledge Skt abhij Tib mngon shes such as clairvoyance and telepathy br br br Rainbow body br br T gal practice may lead to full Buddhahood and the self liberation of the human body into a rainbow body at the moment of death when all fixation and grasping has been exhausted Tibetan Buddhism holds that the rainbow body is a nonmaterial body of light with the ability to exist and abide wherever and whenever as pointed by one s compassion It is a manifestation of the sambhogak ya and its attainment is said to be accompanied by the appearance of lights and rainbows br Some exceptional practitioners are held to have realized a higher type of rainbow body without dying these include the B n masters from the oral tradition of Zhang Zhung Tapihritsa Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra Having completed the four visions before death the individual focuses on the lights that surround the fingers His or her physical body self liberates into a nonmaterial body of light with the ability to exist and abide wherever and whenever as pointed by one s compassion br br br Critique br br br Simultaneous and gradual practice br As noted by van Schaik there is a tension in the Longchen Nyingtik tradition of Dzogchen between methods which emphasize gradual practice and attainments and methods which emphasize primordial liberation simultaneous enlightenment and non activity This seeming contradiction is explained by authors of the tradition as being related to the different levels of ability of different practitioners br For example the works of Jigme Lingpa contain criticisms of methods which rely on cause and effect as well as methods that rely on intellectual analysis Since Buddhahood is uncaused and transcendent of the intellect these contrived and conceptual meditations are contrasted with effortless and instantaneous approaches in the works of Jigme Lingpa who writes that as soon as a thought arises it is to be seen nakedly without analysis or examination Similarly a common theme of Dzogchen literature is the elevation of Dzogchen above all other lower og ma vehicles and a criticism of these lower vehicles which are seen as inferior dman pa approaches br In spite of these critiques Dzogchen cycles like Jigme Lingpa s Longchen Nyingthig do contain numerous practices which are not instantaneous or effortless such as tantric Mahayoga practice like deity yoga and preliminary methods such as ngondro which are equated with the path of accumulation Furthermore Jigme Lingpa and Longchenpa also criticize those who teach the simultaneous method to everyone and teach them to dispense with all other methods at once br In response to the idea that the gradualist teachings found in the Longchen Nyingtik texts contradict the Dzogchen view of primordial liberation Jigme Lingpa states br br This is not correct because Vajradhara using his skill in means taught according to the categories of best middling and worst faculties subdivided into the nine levels from sravaka to atiyoga Although the Great Perfection is the path for those of the sharpest faculties entrants are not composed exclusively of those types With this in mind having ascertained the features of the middling and inferior faculties of awareness holders the tradition was established in this way br This division of practices according to level of ability is also found in Longchenpa s Tegch Dz However as van Schaik notes the system should not be taken too literally It is likely that all three types of instruction contained in the threefold structure of YL Yeshe Lama would be given to any one person Therefore though the instructions would be given to all student types the actual capacity of the practitioner would determine how they would attain awakening through Dzogchen meditation in the bardo of death or through transference of consciousness Jigme Lingpa also believed that students of the superior faculties were extremely rare He held that for most people a gradual path of training is what is needed to reach realization br br br See also
