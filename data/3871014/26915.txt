title: Linguistic relativity
id: 26915
The idea of linguistic relativity known also as the Whorf hypothesis the Sapir Whorf hypothesis s PEER WHORF or Whorfianism is a principle suggesting that the structure of a language influences its speakers worldview or cognition and thus individuals languages determine or influence their perceptions of the world br The hypothesis has long been controversial and many different often contradictory variations have existed throughout its history The strong hypothesis of linguistic relativity now referred to as linguistic determinism is that language determines thought and that linguistic categories limit and restrict cognitive categories This was claimed by some of the early linguists before World War II br but it is generally agreed to be false by modern linguists Nevertheless research has produced positive empirical evidence supporting a weaker version of linguistic relativity that a language s structures influence a speaker s perceptions without strictly limiting or obstructing them br Although common the term Sapir Whorf hypothesis is sometimes considered a misnomer for several reasons Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf never co authored any works and never stated their ideas in terms of a hypothesis The distinction between a weak and a strong version of this hypothesis is also a later development Sapir and Whorf never used such a dichotomy although often their writings and their opinions of this relativity principle are phrased in stronger or weaker terms br The principle of linguistic relativity and the relationship between language and thought has also received attention in varying academic topics including philosophy psychology and anthropology and it has also influenced works of fiction and the invention of constructed languages br br br History br The idea was first expressed explicitly by th century thinkers such as Wilhelm von Humboldt and Johann Gottfried Herder who considered language as the expression of the spirit of a nation Members of the early th century school of American anthropology including Franz Boas and Edward Sapir also approved versions of the idea to a certain extent including in a meeting of the Linguistic Society of America but Sapir in particular wrote more often against than in favor of anything like linguistic determinism Sapir s student Benjamin Lee Whorf came to be considered as the primary proponent as a result of his published observations of how he perceived linguistic differences to have consequences for human cognition and behavior Harry Hoijer another of Sapir s students introduced the term Sapir Whorf hypothesis even though the two scholars never formally advanced any such hypothesis A strong version of relativist theory was developed from the late s by the German linguist Leo Weisgerber Whorf s principle of linguistic relativity was reformulated as a testable hypothesis by Roger Brown and Eric Lenneberg who performed experiments designed to determine whether color perception varies between speakers of languages that classified colors differently br As the emphasis of the universal nature of human language and cognition developed during the s the idea of linguistic relativity became disfavored among linguists From the late s a new school of linguistic relativity scholars has examined the effects of differences in linguistic categorization on cognition finding broad support for non deterministic versions of the hypothesis in experimental contexts Some effects of linguistic relativity have been shown in several semantic domains although they are generally weak Currently a nuanced opinion of linguistic relativity is espoused by most linguists holding that language influences certain kinds of cognitive processes in non trivial ways but that other processes are better considered as developing from connectionist factors Research emphasizes exploring the manners and extent to which language influences thought br br br Ancient philosophy to the Enlightenment br The idea that language and thought are intertwined is ancient In his dialogue Cratylus Plato explores the idea that conceptions of reality such as Heraclitean flux are embedded in language But Plato has been read as arguing against sophist thinkers such as Gorgias of Leontini who claimed that the physical world cannot be experienced except through language this made the question of truth dependent on aesthetic preferences or functional consequences Plato may have held instead that the world consisted of eternal ideas and that language should represent these ideas as accurately as possible Nevertheless Plato s Seventh Letter claims that ultimate truth is inexpressible in words br Following Plato St Augustine for example argued that language was merely like labels applied to concepts existing already This opinion remained prevalent throughout the Middle Ages Roger Bacon had the opinion that language was but a veil covering eternal truths hiding them from human experience For Immanuel Kant language was but one of several methods used by humans to experience the world br br br German Romantic philosophers br During the late th and early th centuries the idea of the existence of different national characters or Volksgeister of different ethnic groups was a major motivator for the German romantics school and the beginning ideologies of ethnic nationalism br br br Johann Georg Hamann br Johann Georg Hamann is often suggested to be the first among the actual German Romantics to discuss the concept of the genius of a language In his Essay Concerning an Academic Question Hamann suggests that a people s language affects their worldview br br The lineaments of their language will thus correspond to the direction of their mentality br br br Wilhelm von Humboldt br In Wilhelm von Humboldt associated the study of language with the national romanticist program by proposing that language is the fabric of thought Thoughts are produced as a kind of internal dialog using the same grammar as the thinker s native language This opinion was part of a greater idea in which the assumptions of an ethnic nation their Weltanschauung was considered as being represented by the grammar of their language Von Humboldt argued that languages with an inflectional morphological type such as German English and the other Indo European languages were the most perfect languages and that accordingly this explained the dominance of their speakers with respect to the speakers of less perfect languages Wilhelm von Humboldt declared in br The diversity of languages is not a diversity of signs and sounds but a diversity of views of the world In Humboldt s humanistic understanding of linguistics each language creates the individual s worldview in its particular way through its lexical and grammatical categories conceptual organization and syntactic models br Herder worked alongside Hamann to establish the idea of whether or not language had a human rational or a divine origin Herder added the emotional component of the hypothesis and Humboldt then took this information and applied to various languages to expand on the hypothesis br br br Boas and Sapir br br The idea that some languages are superior to others and that lesser languages maintained their speakers in intellectual poverty was widespread during the early th century American linguist William Dwight Whitney for example actively strove to eradicate Native American languages arguing that their speakers were savages and would be better off learning English and adopting a civilized way of life The first anthropologist and linguist to challenge this opinion was Franz Boas While performing geographical research in northern Canada he became fascinated with the Inuit and decided to become an ethnographer Boas stressed the equal worth of all cultures and languages that there was no such thing as a primitive language and that all languages were capable of expressing the same content albeit by widely differing means Boas saw language as an inseparable part of culture and he was among the first to require of ethnographers to learn the native language of the culture to be studied and to document verbal culture such as myths and legends in the original language br Boas br br It does not seem likely that there is any direct relation between the culture of a tribe and the language they speak except in so far as the form of the language will be moulded by the state of the culture but not in so far as a certain state of the culture is conditioned by the morphological traits of the language br Boas student Edward Sapir referred to the Humboldtian idea that languages were a major factor for understanding the cultural assumptions of peoples He espoused the opinion that because of the differences in the grammatical systems of languages no two languages were similar enough to allow for perfect cross translation Sapir also thought because language represented reality differently it followed that the speakers of different languages would perceive reality differently br Sapir br br No two languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same social reality The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds not merely the same world with different labels attached br However Sapir explicitly rejected strong linguistic determinism by stating It would be na ve to imagine that any analysis of experience is dependent on pattern expressed in language br Sapir was explicit that the associations between language and culture were neither extensive nor particularly profound if they existed at all br br It is easy to show that language and culture are not intrinsically associated Totally unrelated languages share in one culture closely related languages even a single language belong to distinct culture spheres There are many excellent examples in Aboriginal America The Athabaskan languages form as clearly unified as structurally specialized a group as any that I know of The speakers of these languages belong to four distinct culture areas The cultural adaptability of the Athabaskan speaking peoples is in the strangest contrast to the inaccessibility to foreign influences of the languages themselves br Sapir offered similar observations about speakers of so called world or modern languages noting possession of a common language is still and will continue to be a smoother of the way to a mutual understanding between England and America but it is very clear that other factors some of them rapidly cumulative are working powerfully to counteract this leveling influence A common language cannot indefinitely set the seal on a common culture when the geographical physical and economics determinants of the culture are no longer the same throughout the area br While Sapir never made a practice of studying directly how languages affected thought some notion of probably weak linguistic relativity affected his basic understanding of language and would be developed by Whorf br br br Independent developments in Europe br Drawing on influences such as Humboldt and Friedrich Nietzsche some European thinkers developed ideas similar to those of Sapir and Whorf generally working in isolation from each other Prominent in Germany from the late s through the s were the strongly relativist theories of Leo Weisgerber and his concept of a linguistic inter world mediating between external reality and the forms of a given language in ways peculiar to that language Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky read Sapir s work and experimentally studied the ways in which the development of concepts in children was influenced by structures given in language His work Thought and Language has been compared to Whorf s and taken as mutually supportive evidence of language s influence on cognition Drawing on Nietzsche s ideas of perspectivism Alfred Korzybski developed the theory of general semantics that has been compared to Whorf s notions of linguistic relativity Though influential in their own right this work has not been influential in the debate on linguistic relativity which has tended to be based on the American paradigm exemplified by Sapir and Whorf br br br Benjamin Lee Whorf br br More than any linguist Benjamin Lee Whorf has become associated with what he termed the linguistic relativity principle Studying Native American languages he attempted to account for the ways in which grammatical systems and language use differences affected perception Whorf s opinions regarding the nature of the relation between language and thought remain under contention However a version of theory holds some merit for example different words mean different things in different languages not every word in every language has a one to one exact translation in a different language Critics such as Lenneberg Black and Pinker attribute to Whorf a strong linguistic determinism while Lucy Silverstein and Levinson point to Whorf s explicit rejections of determinism and where he contends that translation and commensuration are possible br Detractors such as Lenneberg Chomsky and Pinker criticized him for insufficient clarity of his description of how language influences thought and for not proving his conjectures Most of his arguments were in the form of anecdotes and speculations that served as attempts to show how exotic grammatical traits were associated with what were apparently equally exotic worlds of thought In Whorf s words br br We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language The categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they stare every observer in the face on the contrary the world is presented in a kaleidoscope flux of impressions which has to be organized by our minds and this means largely by the linguistic systems of our minds We cut nature up organize it into concepts and ascribe significances as we do largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language all observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar or can in some way be calibrated br br br Several terms for a single concept br Among Whorf s best known examples of linguistic relativity are instances where a non European language has several terms for a concept that is only described with one word in European languages Whorf used the acronym SAE Standard Average European to allude to the rather similar grammatical structures of the well studied European languages in contrast to the greater diversity of less studied languages br One of Whorf s examples was the supposedly large number of words for snow in the Inuit languages an example which later was contested as a misrepresentation br Another is the Hopi language s words for water one indicating drinking water in a container and another indicating a natural body of water br These examples of polysemy served the double purpose of showing that non European languages sometimes made more specific semantic distinctions than European languages and that direct translation between two languages even of seemingly basic concepts such as snow or water is not always possible br Another example is from Whorf s experience as a chemical engineer working for an insurance company as a fire inspector While inspecting a chemical plant he observed that the plant had two storage rooms for gasoline barrels one for the full barrels and one for the empty ones He further noticed that while no employees smoked cigarettes in the room for full barrels no one minded smoking in the room with empty barrels although this was potentially much more dangerous because of the flammable vapors still in the barrels He concluded that the use of the word empty in association to the barrels had resulted in the workers unconsciously regarding them as harmless although consciously they were probably aware of the risk of explosion This example was later criticized by Lenneberg as not actually demonstrating causality between the use of the word empty and the action of smoking but instead was an example of circular reasoning Pinker in The Language Instinct ridiculed this example claiming that this was a failing of human insight rather than language br br br Time in Hopi br Whorf s most elaborate argument for linguistic relativity regarded what he believed to be a fundamental difference in the understanding of time as a conceptual category among the Hopi He argued that in contrast to English and other SAE languages Hopi does not treat the flow of time as a sequence of distinct countable instances like three days or five years but rather as a single process and that consequently it has no nouns referring to units of time as SAE speakers understand them He proposed that this view of time was fundamental to Hopi culture and explained certain Hopi behavioral patterns br Ekkehart Malotki later claimed that he had found no evidence of Whorf s claims in s era Hopi speakers nor in historical documents dating back to the arrival of Europeans Malotki used evidence from archaeological data calendars historical documents and modern speech he concluded that there was no evidence that Hopi conceptualize time in the way Whorf suggested Many universalist scholars such as Pinker consider Malotki s study as a final refutation of Whorf s claim about Hopi whereas relativist scholars such as John A Lucy and Penny Lee criticized Malotki s study for mischaracterizing Whorf s claims and for forcing Hopi grammar into a model of analysis that does not fit the data br br br Structure centered approach br Whorf s argument about Hopi speakers conceptualization of time is an example of the structure centered method of research into linguistic relativity which Lucy identified as one of three main types of research of the topic The structure centered method starts with a language s structural peculiarity and examines its possible ramifications for thought and behavior The defining example is Whorf s observation of discrepancies between the grammar of time expressions in Hopi and English More recent research in this vein is Lucy s research describing how usage of the categories of grammatical number and of numeral classifiers in the Mayan language Yucatec result in Mayan speakers classifying objects according to material rather than to shape as preferred by English speakers However philosophers including Donald Davidson and Jason Josephson Storm have argued that Whorf s Hopi examples are self refuting as Whorf had to translate Hopi terms into English in order to explain how they are untranslatable br br br Whorf dies br Whorf died in at age leaving multiple unpublished papers His ideas were continued by linguists and anthropologists such as Hoijer and Lee who both continued investigating the effect of language on habitual thought and Trager who prepared a number of Whorf s papers for posthumous publishing The most important event for the dissemination of Whorf s ideas to a larger public was the publication in of his major writings on the topic of linguistic relativity in a single volume titled Language Thought and Reality br br br Brown and Lenneberg br In Eric Lenneberg criticized Whorf s examples from an objectivist philosophy of language claiming that languages are principally meant to represent events in the real world and that even though languages express these ideas in various ways the meanings of such expressions and therefore the thoughts of the speaker are equivalent He argued that Whorf s English descriptions of a Hopi speaker s idea of time were in fact translations of the Hopi concept into English therefore disproving linguistic relativity However Whorf was concerned with how the habitual use of language influences habitual behavior rather than translatability Whorf s point was that while English speakers may be able to understand how a Hopi speaker thinks they do not think in that way br Lenneberg s main criticism of Whorf s works was that he never showed the necessary association between a linguistic phenomenon and a mental phenomenon With Brown Lenneberg proposed that proving such an association required directly matching linguistic phenomena with behavior They assessed linguistic relativity experimentally and published their findings in Since neither Sapir nor Whorf had ever stated a formal hypothesis Brown and Lenneberg formulated their own Their two tenets were i the world is differently experienced and conceived in different linguistic communities and ii language causes a particular cognitive structure Brown later developed them into the so called weak and strong formulation br br Structural differences between language systems will in general be paralleled by nonlinguistic cognitive differences of an unspecified sort in the native speakers of the language br The structure of anyone s native language strongly influences or fully determines the worldview he will acquire as he learns the language br br Brown s formulations became known widely and were retrospectively attributed to Whorf and Sapir although the second formulation verging on linguistic determinism was never advanced by either of them br br br Joshua Fishman s Whorfianism of the third kind br Joshua Fishman argued that Whorf s true assertion was largely overlooked In he suggested that Whorf was a neo Herderian champion and in he proposed Whorfianism of the third kind in an attempt to reemphasize what he claimed was Whorf s real interest namely the intrinsic value of little peoples and little languages Whorf had criticized Ogden s Basic English thus br br But to restrict thinking to the patterns merely of English is to lose a power of thought which once lost can never be regained It is the plainest English which contains the greatest number of unconscious assumptions about nature We handle even our plain English with much greater effect if we direct it from the vantage point of a multilingual awareness br Where Brown s weak version of the linguistic relativity hypothesis proposes that language influences thought and the strong version that language determines thought Fishman s Whorfianism of the third kind proposes that language is a key to culture br br br Leiden School br The Leiden School is a linguistic theory that models languages as parasites Notable proponent Frederik Kortlandt in a paper outlining Leiden School theory advocates for a form of linguistic relativity The observation that in all Yuman languages the word for work is a loan from Spanish should be a major blow to any current economic theory In the next paragraph he quotes directly from Sapir Even in the most primitive cultures the strategic word is likely to be more powerful than the direct blow br br br Rethinking Linguistic Relativity br The publication of the anthology Rethinking Linguistic Relativity edited by Gumperz and Levinson began a new period of linguistic relativity studies that emphasized cognitive and social aspects The book included studies on linguistic relativity and universalist traditions Levinson documented significant linguistic relativity effects in the different linguistic conceptualization of spatial categories in different languages For example men speaking the Guugu Yimithirr language in Queensland gave accurate navigation instructions using a compass like system of north south east and west along with a hand gesture pointing to the starting direction br Lucy defines this method as domain centered because researchers select a semantic domain and compare it across linguistic and cultural groups Space is another semantic domain that has proven fruitful for linguistic relativity studies Spatial categories vary greatly across languages Speakers rely on the linguistic conceptualization of space in performing many ordinary tasks Levinson and others reported three basic spatial categorizations While many languages use combinations of them some languages exhibit only one type and related behaviors For example Yimithirr only uses absolute directions when describing spatial relations the position of everything is described by using the cardinal directions Speakers define a location as north of the house while an English speaker may use relative positions saying in front of the house or to the left of the house br Separate studies by Bowerman and Slobin analyzed the role of language in cognitive processes Bowerman showed that certain cognitive processes did not use language to any significant extent and therefore could not be subject to linguistic relativity Slobin described another kind of cognitive process that he named thinking for speaking the kind of process in which perceptional data and other kinds of prelinguistic cognition are translated into linguistic terms for communication These Slobin argues are the kinds of cognitive process that are the basis of linguistic relativity br br br Colour terminology br br br Brown and Lenneberg br Since Brown and Lenneberg believed that the objective reality denoted by language was the same for speakers of all languages they decided to test how different languages codified the same message differently and whether differences in codification could be proven to affect behavior Brown and Lenneberg designed experiments involving the codification of colors In their first experiment they investigated whether it was easier for speakers of English to remember color shades for which they had a specific name than to remember colors that were not as easily definable by words This allowed them to compare the linguistic categorization directly to a non linguistic task In a later experiment speakers of two languages that categorize colors differently English and Zuni were asked to recognize colors In this manner it could be determined whether the differing color categories of the two speakers would determine their ability to recognize nuances within color categories Brown and Lenneberg found that Zuni speakers who classify green and blue together as a single color did have trouble recognizing and remembering nuances within the green blue category This method which Lucy later classified as domain centered is acknowledged to be sub optimal because color perception unlike other semantic domains is hardwired into the neural system and as such is subject to more universal restrictions than other semantic domains br br br Hugo Magnus br In a similar study done by German ophthalmologist Hugo Magnus during the s he circulated a questionnaire to missionaries and traders with ten standardized color samples and instructions for using them These instructions contained an explicit warning that failure of a language to distinguish lexically between two colors did not necessarily imply that speakers of that language did not distinguish the two colors perceptually Magnus received completed questionnaires on twenty five African fifteen Asian three Australian and two European languages He concluded in part As regards the range of the color sense of the primitive peoples tested with our questionnaire it appears in general to remain within the same bounds as the color sense of the civilized nations At least we could not establish a complete lack of the perception of the so called main colors as a special racial characteristic of any one of the tribes investigated for us We consider red yellow green and blue as the main representatives of the colors of long and short wavelength among the tribes we tested not a one lacks the knowledge of any of these four colors Magnus p as trans in Berlin and Kay p Magnus did find widespread lexical neutralization of green and blue that is a single word covering both these colors as have all subsequent comparative studies of color lexicons br br br Response to Brown and Lenneberg s study br Brown and Lenneberg s study began a tradition of investigation of linguistic relativity through color terminology The studies showed a correlation between color term numbers and ease of recall in both Zuni and English speakers Researchers attributed this to focal colors having greater codability than less focal colors and not with linguistic relativity effects Berlin Kay found universal typological color principles that are determined by biological rather than linguistic factors This study sparked studies into typological universals of color terminology Researchers such as Lucy Saunders and Levinson argued that Berlin and Kay s study does not refute linguistic relativity in color naming because of unsupported assumptions in their study such as whether all cultures in fact have a clearly defined category of color and because of related data problems Researchers such as Maclaury continued investigation into color naming Like Berlin and Kay Maclaury concluded that the domain is governed mostly by physical biological universals br br br Berlin and Kay br Studies by Berlin and Kay continued Lenneberg s color research They studied color terminology formation and showed clear universal trends in color naming For example they found that even though languages have different color terminologies they generally recognize certain hues as more focal than others They showed that in languages with few color terms it is predictable from the number of terms which hues are chosen as focal colors for example languages with only three color terms always have the focal colors black white and red The fact that what had been believed to be random differences between color naming in different languages could be shown to follow universal patterns was seen as a powerful argument against linguistic relativity Berlin and Kay s research has since been criticized by relativists such as Lucy who argued that Berlin and Kay s conclusions were skewed by their insistence that color terms encode only color information This Lucy argues made them unaware of the instances in which color terms provided other information that might be considered examples of linguistic relativity br br br Universalism br Universalist scholars began a period of dissent from ideas about linguistic relativity Lenneberg was one of the first cognitive scientists to begin development of the Universalist theory of language that was formulated by Chomsky as universal grammar effectively arguing that all languages share the same underlying structure The Chomskyan school also includes the belief that linguistic structures are largely innate and that what are perceived as differences between specific languages are surface phenomena that do not affect the brain s universal cognitive processes This theory became the dominant paradigm of American linguistics from the s through the s while linguistic relativity became the object of ridicule br br br Ekkehart Malotki br Other universalist researchers dedicated themselves to dispelling other aspects of linguistic relativity often attacking Whorf s specific examples For example Malotki s monumental study of time expressions in Hopi presented many examples that challenged Whorf s timeless interpretation of Hopi language and culture but seemingly failed to address the linguistic relativist argument actually posed by Whorf i e that the understanding of time by native Hopi speakers differed from that of speakers of European languages due to the differences in the organization and construction of their respective languages Whorf never claimed that Hopi speakers lacked any concept of time Malotki himself acknowledges that the conceptualizations are different but because he ignores Whorf s use of quotes around the word time and the qualifier what we call takes Whorf to be arguing that the Hopi have no concept of time at all br br br Steven Pinker br Currently many believers of the universalist school of thought still oppose linguistic relativity For example Pinker argues in The Language Instinct that thought is independent of language that language is itself meaningless in any fundamental way to human thought and that human beings do not even think in natural language i e any language that we actually communicate in rather we think in a meta language preceding any natural language termed mentalese Pinker attacks what he terms Whorf s radical position declaring the more you examine Whorf s arguments the less sense they make br Pinker and other universalists have been accused by relativists of misrepresenting Whorf s ideas and committing the Strawman fallacy br br br Cognitive linguistics br During the late s and early s advances in cognitive psychology and cognitive linguistics renewed interest in the Sapir Whorf hypothesis One of those who adopted a more Whorfian philosophy was George Lakoff He argued that language is often used metaphorically and that languages use different cultural metaphors that reveal something about how speakers of that language think For example English employs conceptual metaphors likening time to money so that time can be saved and spent and invested whereas other languages do not talk about time in that manner Other such metaphors are common to many languages because they are based on general human experience for example metaphors associating up with good and bad with down Lakoff also argued that metaphor plays an important part in political debates such as the right to life or the right to choose or illegal aliens or undocumented workers br An unpublished study by Boroditsky et al in reported to have found empirical evidence favoring the hypothesis demonstrating that differences in the grammatical gender systems of languages can affect the way speakers of those languages think about objects Speakers of Spanish and German which have different gender systems were asked to use adjectives to describe various objects that were either masculine or feminine in their respective languages They reported that speakers tended to describe objects in ways that were consistent with the gender of the noun in their language indicating that the gender system of a language can influence speakers perceptions of objects Despite numerous citations the experiment was criticised after the reported effects could not be replicated by independent trials Additionally a large scale data analysis using word embeddings of language models found no correlation between adjectives and inanimate noun genders while another study using large text corpora found a slight correlation between the gender of animate and inanimate nouns and their adjectives as well as verbs by measuring their mutual information br br br Parameters br In his book Women Fire and Dangerous Things What Categories Reveal About the Mind Lakoff reappraised linguistic relativity and especially Whorf s ideas about how linguistic categorization represents and or influences mental categories He concluded that the debate had been confused He described four parameters on which researchers differed in their opinions about what constitutes linguistic relativity br br The degree and intensity of linguistic relativity Perhaps a few examples of superficial differences in language and associated behavior are enough to demonstrate the existence of linguistic relativity Alternatively perhaps only great differences that permeate the linguistic and cultural system suffice br Whether conceptual systems are absolute or whether they can evolve br Whether the similarity criterion is translatability or the use of linguistic expressions br Whether the emphasis of linguistic relativity is language or the brain br Lakoff concluded that many of Whorf s critics had criticized him using novel definitions of linguistic relativity rendering their criticisms moot br br br Refinements br Researchers such as Boroditsky Choi Majid Lucy and Levinson believe that language influences thought in more limited ways than the broadest early claims Researchers examine the interface between thought or cognition language and culture and describe the relevant influences They use experimental data to back up their conclusions Kay ultimately concluded that the Whorf hypothesis is supported in the right visual field but not the left His findings show that accounting for brain lateralization offers another perspective br br br Behavior centered research br Recent studies have also used a behavior based method which starts by comparing behavior across linguistic groups and then searches for causes for that behavior in the linguistic system In an early example of this method Whorf attributed the occurrence of fires at a chemical plant to the workers use of the word empty to describe barrels containing only explosive vapors br More recently Bloom noticed that speakers of Chinese had unexpected difficulties answering counterfactual questions posed to them in a questionnaire He concluded that this was related to the way in which counter factuality is marked grammatically in Chinese Other researchers attributed this result to Bloom s flawed translations Str mnes examined why Finnish factories had a greater occurrence of work related accidents than similar Swedish ones He concluded that cognitive differences between the grammatical usage of Swedish prepositions and Finnish cases could have caused Swedish factories to pay more attention to the work process while Finnish factory organizers paid more attention to the individual worker br br br Everett on Pirah br Everett s work on the Pirah language of the Brazilian Amazon found several peculiarities that he interpreted as corresponding to linguistically rare features such as a lack of numbers and color terms in the way those are otherwise defined and the absence of certain types of clauses Everett s conclusions were met with skepticism from universalists who claimed that the linguistic deficit is explained by the lack of need for such concepts br br br Mandarin and Thai br Recent research with non linguistic experiments in languages with different grammatical properties e g languages with and without numeral classifiers or with different gender grammar systems showed that language differences in human categorization are due to such differences Experimental research suggests that this linguistic influence on thought diminishes over time as when speakers of one language are exposed to another br br br Swedish and Spanish br A study published by the American Psychological Association s Journal of Experimental Psychology claimed that language can influence how one estimates time The study considered three groups those who spoke only Swedish those who spoke only Spanish and bilingual speakers who spoke both of those languages Swedish speakers describe time using distance terms like long or short while Spanish speakers do it using quantity related terms like much or little The researchers asked the participants to estimate how much time had passed while watching a line growing across a screen or a container being filled or both The researchers stated that When reproducing duration Swedish speakers were misled by stimulus length and Spanish speakers were misled by stimulus size quantity When the bilinguals were prompted with the word duraci n the Spanish word for duration they based their time estimates of how full the containers were ignoring the growing lines When prompted with the word tid the Swedish word for duration they estimated the time elapsed solely by the distance the lines had traveled br br br Pronoun dropping br Kashima Kashima observed a correlation between the perceived individualism or collectivism in the social norms of a given country with the tendency to neglect the use of pronouns in the country s language They argued that explicit reference to you and I reinforces a distinction between the self and the other in the speaker br br br Future tense br A study found that those who speak futureless languages with no grammatical marking of the future tense save more retire with more wealth smoke less practice safer sex and are less obese than those who do not This effect has come to be termed the linguistic savings hypothesis and has been replicated in several cross cultural and cross country studies However a study of Chinese which can be spoken both with and without the grammatical future marking will found that subjects do not behave more impatiently when will is used repetitively This laboratory based finding of elective variation within a single language does not refute the linguistic savings hypothesis but some have suggested that it shows the effect may be due to culture or other non linguistic factors br br br Psycholinguistic research br Psycholinguistic studies explored motion perception emotion perception object representation and memory The gold standard of psycholinguistic studies on linguistic relativity is now finding non linguistic cognitive differences in speakers of different languages thus rendering inapplicable Pinker s criticism that linguistic relativity is circular br Recent work with bilingual speakers attempts to distinguish the effects of language from those of culture on bilingual cognition including perceptions of time space motion colors and emotion Researchers described differences between bilinguals and monolinguals in perception of color representations of time and other elements of cognition br One experiment found that speakers of languages without numbers greater than two had difficulty counting the number of taps for example making more errors distinguishing between six and seven taps Presumably this is because they could not count the taps using numbers repeated in the phonological loop br br br Other domains br Linguistic relativity inspired others to consider whether thought and emotion could be influenced by manipulating language br br br Science and philosophy br The question bears on philosophical psychological linguistic and anthropological questions br A major question is whether human psychological faculties are mostly innate or whether they are mostly a result of learning and hence subject to cultural and social processes such as language The innate opinion is that humans share the same set of basic faculties and that variability due to cultural differences is less important and that the human mind is a mostly biological construction so that all humans sharing the same neurological configuration can be expected to have similar cognitive patterns br Multiple alternatives have advocates The contrary constructivist position holds that human faculties and concepts are largely influenced by socially constructed and learned categories without many biological restrictions Another variant is idealist which holds that human mental capacities are generally unrestricted by biological material structures Another is essentialist which holds that essential differences may influence the ways individuals or groups experience and conceptualize the world Yet another is relativist cultural relativism which sees different cultural groups as employing different conceptual schemes that are not necessarily compatible or commensurable nor more or less in accord with external reality br Another debate considers whether thought is a type of internal speech or is independent of and prior to language br In the philosophy of language the question addresses the relations between language knowledge and the external world and the concept of truth Philosophers such as Putnam Fodor Davidson and Dennett see language as representing directly entities from the objective world and that categorization reflect that world Other philosophers e g Quine Searle and Foucault argue that categorization and conceptualization is subjective and arbitrary Another view represented by Storm seeks a third way by emphasizing how language changes and imperfectly represents reality without being completely divorced from ontology br Another question is whether language is a tool for representing and referring to objects in the world or whether it is a system used to construct mental representations that can be communicated br br br Therapy and self development br br Sapir Whorf contemporary Alfred Korzybski was independently developing his theory of general semantics which was intended to use language s influence of thinking to maximize human cognitive abilities Korzybski s thinking was influenced by logical philosophy such as Russell and Whitehead s Principia Mathematica and Wittgenstein s Tractatus Logico Philosophicus Although Korzybski was not aware of Sapir and Whorf s writings the philosophy was adopted by Whorf admirer Stuart Chase who fused Whorf s interest in cultural linguistic variation with Korzybski s programme in his popular work The Tyranny of Words S I Hayakawa was a follower and popularizer of Korzybski s work writing Language in Thought and Action The general semantics philosophy influenced the development of neuro linguistic programming NLP another therapeutic technique that seeks to use awareness of language use to influence cognitive patterns br Korzybski independently described a strong version of the hypothesis of linguistic relativity br br We do not realize what tremendous power the structure of an habitual language has It is not an exaggeration to say that it enslaves us through the mechanism of s emantic r eactions and that the structure which a language exhibits and impresses upon us unconsciously is automatically projected upon the world around us br br br Artificial languages br br In their fiction authors such as Ayn Rand and George Orwell explored how linguistic relativity might be exploited for political purposes In Rand s Anthem a fictive communist society removed the possibility of individualism by removing the word I from the language In Orwell s the authoritarian state created the language Newspeak to make it impossible for people to think critically about the government or even to contemplate that they might be impoverished or oppressed by reducing the number of words to reduce the thought of the locutor br Others have been fascinated by the possibilities of creating new languages that could enable new and perhaps better ways of thinking Examples of such languages designed to explore the human mind include Loglan explicitly designed by James Cooke Brown to test the linguistic relativity hypothesis by experimenting whether it would make its speakers think more logically Suzette Haden Elgin who was involved with the early development of neuro linguistic programming invented the language L adan to explore linguistic relativity by making it easier to express what Elgin considered the female worldview as opposed to Standard Average European languages which she considered to convey a male centered worldview John Quijada s language Ithkuil was designed to explore the limits of the number of cognitive categories a language can keep its speakers aware of at once Similarly Sonja Lang s Toki Pona was developed according to a Taoist philosophy for exploring how or if such a language would direct human thought br br br Programming languages br APL programming language originator Kenneth E Iverson believed that the Sapir Whorf hypothesis applied to computer languages without actually mentioning it by name His Turing Award lecture Notation as a Tool of Thought was devoted to this theme arguing that more powerful notations aided thinking about computer algorithms br The essays of Paul Graham explore similar themes such as a conceptual hierarchy of computer languages with more expressive and succinct languages at the top Thus the so called blub paradox after a hypothetical programming language of average complexity called Blub says that anyone preferentially using some particular programming language will know that it is more powerful than some but not that it is less powerful than others The reason is that writing in some language means thinking in that language Hence the paradox because typically programmers are satisfied with whatever language they happen to use because it dictates the way they think about programs br In a presentation at an open source convention Yukihiro Matsumoto creator of the programming language Ruby said that one of his inspirations for developing the language was the science fiction novel Babel based on the Whorf Hypothesis br br br Science fiction br Numerous examples of linguistic relativity have appeared in science fiction br br The totalitarian regime depicted in George Orwell s novel Nineteen Eighty Four in effect acts on the basis of the Whorf hypothesis seeking to replace English with Newspeak a language constructed specifically with the intention that thoughts subversive of the regime cannot be expressed in it and therefore people educated to speak and think in it would not have such thoughts br In his science fiction novel The Languages of Pao the author Jack Vance describes how specialized languages are a major part of a strategy to create specific classes in a society to enable the population to withstand occupation and develop itself br In Samuel R Delany s science fiction novel Babel the author describes an advanced information dense language that can be used as a weapon Learning it turns one into an unwilling traitor as it alters perception and thought br Ted Chiang s short story Story of Your Life developed the concept of the Whorf hypothesis as applied to an alien species which visits Earth The aliens biology contributes to their spoken and written languages which are distinct In the American movie Arrival based on Chiang s short story the Whorf hypothesis is the premise The protagonist explains that the Sapir Whorf hypothesis is the theory that the language you speak determines how you think br Gene Wolfe s four volume science fiction novel The Book of the New Sun describes the North American Ascian people as speaking a language composed entirely of quotations that have been approved by a small ruling class br br br Sociolinguistics and linguistic relativity br The manner in which sociolinguistics plays a role in variables within language like the manner in which words are pronounced word selection in certain dialogue context and tone suggests it may have implications for linguistic relativity br br br
