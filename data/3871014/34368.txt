Yellow is the color between green and orange on the spectrum of light It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly nm It is a primary color in subtractive color systems used in painting or color printing In the RGB color model used to create colors on television and computer screens yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal intensity Carotenoids give the characteristic yellow color to autumn leaves corn canaries daffodils and lemons as well as egg yolks buttercups and bananas They absorb light energy and protect plants from photo damage in some cases Sunlight has a slight yellowish hue when the Sun is near the horizon due to atmospheric scattering of shorter wavelengths green blue and violet br Because it was widely available yellow ochre pigment was one of the first colors used in art the Lascaux cave in France has a painting of a yellow horse years old Ochre and orpiment pigments were used to represent gold and skin color in Egyptian tombs then in the murals in Roman villas In the early Christian church yellow was the color associated with the Pope and the golden keys of the Kingdom but it was also associated with Judas Iscariot and used to mark heretics In the th century Jews in Nazi occupied Europe were forced to wear a yellow star In China bright yellow was the color of the Middle Kingdom and could be worn only by the emperor and his household special guests were welcomed on a yellow carpet br According to surveys in Europe Canada the United States and elsewhere yellow is the color people most often associate with amusement gentleness humor happiness and spontaneity however it can also be associated with duplicity envy jealousy greed justice and in the U S cowardice In Iran it has connotations of pallor sickness but also wisdom and connection In China and many Asian countries it is seen as the color of happiness glory harmony and wisdom br br br Etymology br The word yellow is from the Old English geolu geolwe oblique case meaning yellow and yellowish derived from the Proto Germanic word gelwaz yellow It has the same Indo European base gel as the words gold and yell g el means both bright and gleaming and to cry out br The English term is related to other Germanic words for yellow namely Scots yella East Frisian jeel West Frisian giel Dutch geel German gelb and Swedish and Norwegian gul According to the Oxford English Dictionary the oldest known use of this word in English is from The Epinal Glossary in br br br Science and nature br br br Optics color printing and computer screens br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Yellow is found between green and red on the spectrum of visible light It is the color the human eye sees when it looks at light with a dominant wavelength between and nanometers br In color printing yellow is one of the three subtractive primary colors of ink along with magenta and cyan Together with black they can be overlaid in the right combination to print any full color image See the CMYK color model A particular yellow is used called Process yellow also known as pigment yellow printer s yellow and canary yellow Process yellow is not an RGB color and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB Different formulations are used for printer s ink so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure yellow ink br The yellow on a color television or computer screen is created in a completely different way by combining green and red light at the right level of intensity See RGB color model br br br Complementary colors br br Traditionally the complementary color of yellow is purple the two colors are opposite each other on the color wheel long used by painters Vincent van Gogh an avid student of color theory used combinations of yellow and purple in several of his paintings for the maximum contrast and harmony br Hunt defines that two colors are complementary when it is possible to reproduce the tristimulus values of a specified achromatic stimulus by an additive mixture of these two stimuli That is when two colored lights can be mixed to match a specified white achromatic non colored light the colors of those two lights are complementary This definition however does not constrain what version of white will be specified In the nineteenth century the scientists Grassmann and Helmholtz did experiments in which they concluded that finding a good complement for spectral yellow was difficult but that the result was indigo that is a wavelength that today s color scientists would call violet or purple Helmholtz says Yellow and indigo blue are complements Grassmann reconstructs Newton s category boundaries in terms of wavelengths and says This indigo therefore falls within the limits of color between which according to Helmholtz the complementary colors of yellow lie br Newton s own color circle has yellow directly opposite the boundary between indigo and violet These results that the complement of yellow is a wavelength shorter than nm are derivable from the modern CIE system of colorimetry if it is assumed that the yellow is about nm or shorter wavelength and the specified white is the color of a blackbody radiator of temperature K or lower that is the white of an ordinary incandescent light bulb More typically with a daylight colored or around to K white the complement of yellow will be in the blue wavelength range which is the standard modern answer for the complement of yellow br Because of the characteristics of paint pigments and use of different color wheels painters traditionally regard the complement of yellow as the color indigo or blue violet br br br Lasers br Lasers emitting in the yellow part of the spectrum are less common and more expensive than most other colors In commercial products diode pumped solid state DPSS technology is employed to create the yellow light An infrared laser diode at nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium doped yttrium vanadium oxide Nd YVO or neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet Nd YAG and induces it to emit at two frequencies THz and THz nm and nm wavelengths simultaneously This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium titanium and phosphorus KTP whose non linear properties generate light at a frequency that is the sum of the two incident beams THz in this case corresponding to the wavelength of nm yellow This wavelength is also available though even more rarely from a helium neon laser However this not a true yellow as it exceeds nm A variant of this same DPSS technology using slightly different starting frequencies was made available in producing a wavelength of nm which is considered a true yellow color The use of yellow lasers at nm and nm have recently become more widespread thanks to the field of optogenetics br br br Astronomy br br Stars of spectral classes F and G have color temperatures that make them look yellowish The first astronomer to classify stars according to their color was F G W Struve in One of his classifications was flavae or yellow and this roughly corresponded to stars in the modern spectral range F to K The Str mgren photometric system for stellar classification includes a y or yellow filter that is centered at a wavelength of nm and has a bandwidth of nm br Supergiant stars are rarely yellow supergiants because F and G class supergiants are physically unstable they are most often a transitional phase between blue supergiants and red supergiants Some yellow supergiants the Cepheid variables pulsate with a period proportional to their absolute magnitude hence if their apparent magnitude is known the distance to them can be calculated with great precision Cepheid variables were hence used to determine distances within and beyond the Milky Way galaxy The most famous example is the current North Pole star Polaris br br br Biology br Autumn leaves yellow flowers bananas oranges and other yellow fruits all contain carotenoids yellow and red organic pigments that are found in the chloroplasts and chromoplasts of plants and some other photosynthetic organisms like algae some bacteria and some fungi They serve two key roles in plants and algae they absorb light energy for use in photosynthesis and they protect the green chlorophyll from photodamage br In late summer as daylight hours shorten and temperatures cool the veins that carry fluids into and out of the leaf are gradually closed off The water and mineral intake into the leaf is reduced slowly at first and then more rapidly It is during this time that the chlorophyll begins to decrease br As the chlorophyll diminishes the yellow and red carotenoids become more and more visible creating the classic autumn leaf color br Carotenoids are common in many living things they give the characteristic color to carrots maize daffodils rutabagas buttercups and bananas They are responsible for the red of cooked lobsters the pink of flamingoes and salmon and the yellow of canaries and egg yolks br Xanthophylls are the most common yellow pigments that form one of two major divisions of the carotenoid group The name is from Greek xanthos yellow phyllon leaf Xanthophylls are most commonly found in the leaves of green plants but they also find their way into animals through the food they eat For example the yellow color of chicken egg yolks fat and skin comes from the feed the chickens consume Chicken farmers understand this and often add xanthophylls usually lutein to make the egg yolks more yellow br Bananas are green when they are picked because of the chlorophyll their skin contains Once picked they begin to ripen hormones in the bananas convert amino acids into ethylene gas which stimulates the production of several enzymes These enzymes start to change the color texture and flavor of the banana The green chlorophyll supply is stopped and the yellow color of the carotenoids replaces it eventually as the enzymes continue their work the cell walls break down and the bananas turn brown br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Fish

horse colored with yellow estimated to be years old br br br Ancient history br In Ancient Egypt yellow was associated with gold which was considered to be imperishable eternal and indestructible The skin and bones of the gods were believed to be made of gold The Egyptians used yellow extensively in tomb paintings they usually used either yellow ochre or the brilliant orpiment though it was made of arsenic and was highly toxic A small paintbox with orpiment pigment was found in the tomb of King Tutankhamun Men were always shown with brown faces women with yellow ochre or gold faces br The ancient Romans used yellow in their paintings to represent gold and also in skin tones It is found frequently in the murals of Pompeii br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Post classical history br During the Post Classical period yellow became firmly established as the color of Judas Iscariot the disciple who betrayed Jesus Christ even though the Bible never

Jews with the color yellow In th century Spain those accused of heresy and who refused to renounce their views were compelled to come before the Spanish Inquisition dressed in a yellow cape br The color yellow has been historically associated with moneylenders and finance The National Pawnbrokers Association s logo depicts three golden spheres hanging from a bar referencing the three bags of

of the first in that century to use yellow to create moods and emotions the way romantic composers were using music His painting Rain Steam and Speed the Great Central Railway was dominated by glowing yellow clouds br Georges Seurat used the new synthetic colors in his experimental paintings composed of tiny points of primary colors particularly in his famous Sunday Afternoon on the Isle de la Grand jatte He did not know that the new synthetic yellow pigment zinc yellow or zinc chromate which he used in the light green lawns was highly unstable and would quickly turn brown br The painter Vincent van Gogh was a particular admirer of the color yellow the color of sunshine Writing to his sister from the south of France in he wrote Now we are having beautiful warm windless weather that is very beneficial to me The sun a light that for lack of a better word I can only call yellow bright sulfur yellow pale lemon gold How beautiful yellow is In Arles Van Gogh painted sunflowers inside a small house he rented at Place Lamartine a house painted with a color that Van Gogh described as buttery yellow Van Gogh was one of the first artists to use commercially manufactured paints rather than paints he made himself He used the traditional yellow ochre but also chrome yellow first made in and cadmium yellow first made in br At the end of the th century in a new popular art form began to appear in New York newspapers the color comic strip It took advantage of a new color printing process which used color separation and three different colors of ink magenta cyan and yellow plus black to create all the colors on the page One of the first characters in the new comic strips was a humorous boy of the New York streets named Mickey Dugen more commonly known as the Yellow Kid from the yellow nightshirt he wore He gave his name and color to the whole genre of popular sensational journalism which became known as yellow journalism br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br

geometric shapes The Dutch modernist painter Piet Mondrian made a series of paintings which consisted of a pure white canvas with a grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and rectangles of yellow red and blue br Yellow was particularly valued in the th century because of its high visibility Because of its ability to be seen well from greater distances and at high speeds yellow makes for the ideal color to be viewed from moving automobiles It often replaced red as the color of fire trucks and other emergency vehicles and was popular in neon signs especially in Las Vegas and in China where yellow was the most esteemed color br In the s Pickett Brand developed the Eye Saver Yellow slide rule which was produced with a specific yellow color Angstrom that reflects long wavelength rays and promotes optimum eye ease to help prevent eyestrain and improve visual accuracy br The st century saw the use of unusual materials and technologies to create new ways of experiencing the color yellow One example was The weather project by Danish Icelandic artist Olafur Eliasson which was installed in the open space of the Turbine Hall of London s Tate Modern in br Eliasson used humidifiers to create a fine mist in the air via a mixture of sugar and water as well as a semi circular disc made up of hundreds of monochromatic lamps which radiated yellow light The ceiling of the hall was

spice and food colorant It is made from the dried red stigma of the crocus sativus flower It must be picked by hand and it takes flowers to obtain a single gram of stigma so it is extremely expensive It probably originated in the Mediterranean or Southwest Asia and its use was detailed in a th century BC Assyrian botanical reference compiled under Ashurbanipal It was known in India at the time of the Buddha and after his death his followers decreed that monks should wear robes the color of saffron Saffron was used to dye the robes of the senior Buddhist monks while ordinary monks wore robes dyed with Gamboge or Curcuma longa also known as Turmeric br The color of saffron comes from crocin a red variety of carotenoid natural pigment The color of the dyed fabric varies from deep red to orange to yellow depending upon the type of saffron and the process Most saffron today comes from Iran but it is also grown commercially in Spain Italy and Kashmir in India and as a boutique crop in New Zealand the United Kingdom France Switzerland and other countries In the United States it has been cultivated by the Pennsylvania Dutch community since the early th century Because of the high price of saffron other similar dyes and spices are often sold under the name saffron for instance what is called Indian saffron is often really turmeric br br Reseda luteola also known as dyers weed yellow weed or weld has been used as a yellow dye from neolithic times It grew wild along the roads and walls of Europe and was introduced into North America where it grows as a weed It was used as both as a yellow dye whose color was deep and lasting and to dye fabric green first by dyeing it blue with indigo then dyeing it with reseda luteola to turn it a rich solid and lasting green It was the most common yellow dye in Europe from the Middle Ages until the th century when it was replaced first by the bark of the quercitron tree from North America then by synthetic dyes It was also widely used in North Africa and in the Ottoman Empire br Gamboge is a deep saffron to mustard yellow pigment and dye In Asia it is frequently used to dye Buddhist monks robes Gamboge is most often

colors while black and white are considered feminine After the development of the theory of five elements the Chinese reckoned various correspondences On a five season model late summer was characterized by yellowing leaves Yellow was taken as the color of the fifth direction of the compass the central China is called the Middle Kingdom the palace of the Emperor was considered to be in the exact center of the world The legendary first emperor of China was called the Yellow Emperor and the last Puyi described in his memoirs how every object which surrounded him as a child was yellow

yellow is the color of reason and research br br br Gold and blond br br In ancient Greece and Rome the gods were often depicted with yellow or blonde hair which was described in literature as golden The color yellow was associated with the sun gods Helios and Apollo It was fashionable in ancient Greece for men and women to dye their hair yellow or to spend time in the sun to bleach it In ancient Rome prostitutes were required to bleach their hair to be easily identified but it also became a fashionable hair color for aristocratic women influenced by the exotic blonde hair of many of the newly conquered slaves from Gaul Britain and Germany However in medieval Europe and later the word yellow often had negative connotations associated with betrayal so yellow hair was more poetically called blond light fair or most often golden br br br Visibility and caution br Yellow is the most visible color from a distance so it is often used for objects that need to be seen such as fire engines road maintenance equipment school buses and taxicabs It is also often used for warning signs since yellow traditionally signals caution rather than danger Safety yellow is often used for safety and accident prevention information A yellow light on a traffic signal means slow down but not stop The Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA uses Pantone a yellow hue as their standard color implying general warning while the Federal Highway Administration similarly uses yellow to communicate warning or caution on highway signage A yellow penalty card in a soccer match means warning but

master first appears before the monks of the monastery in his own clothes with his new robe under his arm and asks to enter the order He then takes his vows puts on the robes and with his begging bowl goes out to the world Thereafter he spends his mornings begging and his afternoons in contemplation and study either in a forest garden or in the monastery According to Buddhist scriptures and commentaries the robe dye is allowed to be obtained from six kinds of substances roots and tubers plants bark leaves flowers and fruits The robes should also be boiled in water a long time to get the correctly sober color Saffron and ochre usually made with dye from the curcuma longa plant or the heartwood of the jackfruit tree are the most common colors The so called forest monks usually wear ochre robes and city monks saffron though this is not an official rule The color of robes also varies somewhat among the different vehicles or schools of Buddhism and by country depending on their doctrines and the dyes available The monks of the strict Vajrayana or Tantric Buddhism practiced in Tibet wear the most colorful robes of saffron and red The monks of Mahayana Buddhism practiced mainly in Japan China and Korea wear lighter yellow or saffron often with white or black Monks of Hinayana Buddhism practiced in Southeast Asia usually wear ochre or saffron color Monks of the forest
