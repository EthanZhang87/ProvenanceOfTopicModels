In optics the refractive index or refraction index of an optical medium is a dimensionless number that gives the indication of the light bending ability of that medium br br The refractive index determines how much the path of light is bent or refracted when entering a material This is described by Snell s law of refraction n sin n sin where and are the angle of incidence and angle of refraction respectively of a ray crossing the interface between two media with refractive indices n and n The refractive indices also determine the amount of light that is reflected when reaching the interface as well as the critical angle for total internal reflection their intensity Fresnel equations and Brewster s angle br The refractive index br br br br n br br br displaystyle n br br can be seen as the factor by which the speed and the wavelength of the radiation are reduced with respect to their vacuum values the speed of light in a medium is v c n and similarly the wavelength in that medium is n where is the wavelength of that light in vacuum This implies that vacuum has a refractive index of and assumes that the frequency f v of the wave is not affected by the refractive index br The refractive index may vary with wavelength This causes white light to split into constituent colors when refracted This is called dispersion This effect can be observed in prisms and rainbows and as chromatic aberration in lenses Light propagation in absorbing materials can be described using a complex valued refractive index The imaginary part then handles the attenuation while the real part accounts for refraction For most materials the refractive index changes with wavelength by several percent across the visible spectrum Consequently refractive indices for materials reported using a single value for n must specify the wavelength used in the measurement br The concept of refractive index applies across the full electromagnetic spectrum from X rays to radio waves It can also be applied to wave phenomena such as sound In this case the speed of sound is used instead of that of light and a reference medium other than vacuum must be chosen br For lenses such as eye glasses a lens made from a high refractive index material will be thinner and hence lighter than a conventional lens with a lower refractive index Such lenses are generally more expensive to manufacture than conventional ones br br br Definition br The relative refractive index of an optical medium with respect to another reference medium n is given by the ratio of speed of light in medium to that in medium This can be expressed as follows br br br br br br n br br br br br br br br br v br br br br br br v br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle n frac v v br br br If the reference medium is vacuum then the refractive index of medium is considered with respect to vacuum It is simply represented as n and is called the absolute refractive index of medium br The absolute refractive index n of an optical medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum c m s and the phase velocity v of light in the medium br br br br br n br br br br br c br br v br br br br br br displaystyle n frac mathrm c v br br br Since c is constant n is inversely proportional to v br br br br br n br br br br br v br br br br br br displaystyle n propto frac v br br br The phase velocity is the speed at which the crests or the phase of the wave moves which may be different from the group velocity the speed at which the pulse of light or the envelope of the wave moves Historically air at a standardized pressure and temperature has been common as a reference medium br br br History br br Thomas Young was presumably the person who first used and invented the name index of refraction in br At the same time he changed this value of refractive power into a single number instead of the traditional ratio of two numbers The ratio had the disadvantage of different appearances Newton who called it the proportion of the sines of incidence and refraction wrote it as a ratio of two numbers like to or nearly to for water Hauksbee who called it the ratio of refraction wrote it as a ratio with a fixed numerator like to for urine Hutton wrote it as a ratio with a fixed denominator like to water br Young did not use a symbol for the index of refraction in In the later years others started using different symbols n m and The symbol n gradually prevailed br br br Typical values br br Refractive index also varies with wavelength of the light as given by Cauchy s equation br The most general form of Cauchy s equation is br br br br br n br br br br br A br br br br B br br br br br br br br br br br br C br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle n lambda A frac B lambda frac C lambda cdots br br br where n is the refractive index is the wavelength and A B C etc are coefficients that can be determined for a material by fitting the equation to measured refractive indices at known wavelengths The coefficients are usually quoted for as the vacuum wavelength in micrometres br Usually it is sufficient to use a two term form of the equation br br br br br n br br br br br A br br br br B br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle n lambda A frac B lambda br br br where the coefficients A and B are determined specifically for this form of the equation br br For visible light most transparent media have refractive indices between and A few examples are given in the adjacent table These values are measured at the yellow doublet D line of sodium with a wavelength of nanometers as is conventionally done Gases at atmospheric pressure have refractive indices close to because of their low density Almost all solids and liquids have refractive indices above with aerogel as the clear exception Aerogel is a very low density solid that can be produced with refractive index in the range from to Moissanite lies at the other end of the range with a refractive index as high as Most plastics have refractive indices in the range from to but some high refractive index polymers can have values as high as br For infrared light refractive indices can be considerably higher Germanium is transparent in the wavelength region from to m and has a refractive index of about A type of new materials termed topological insulators was recently found which have high refractive index of up to in the near to mid infrared frequency range Moreover topological insulators are transparent when they have nanoscale thickness These properties are potentially important for applications in infrared optics br br br Refractive index below unity br According to the theory of relativity no information can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum but this does not mean that the refractive index cannot be less than The refractive index measures the phase velocity of light which does not carry information The phase velocity is the speed at which the crests of the wave move and can be faster than the speed of light in vacuum and thereby give a refractive index below This can occur close to resonance frequencies for absorbing media in plasmas and for X rays In the X ray regime the refractive indices are lower than but very close to exceptions close to some resonance frequencies br As an example water has a refractive index of for X ray radiation at a photon energy of keV nm wavelength br An example of a plasma with an index of refraction less than unity is Earth s ionosphere Since the refractive index of the ionosphere a plasma is less than unity electromagnetic waves propagating through the plasma are bent away from the normal see Geometric optics allowing the radio wave to be refracted back toward earth thus enabling long distance radio communications See also Radio Propagation and Skywave br br br Negative refractive index br br Recent research has also demonstrated the existence of materials with a negative refractive index which can occur if permittivity and permeability have simultaneous negative values This can be achieved with periodically constructed metamaterials The resulting negative refraction i e a reversal of Snell s law offers the possibility of the superlens and other new phenomena to be actively developed by means of metamaterials br br br Microscopic explanation br br At the atomic scale an electromagnetic wave s phase velocity is slowed in a material because the electric field creates a disturbance in the charges of each atom primarily the electrons proportional to the electric susceptibility of the medium Similarly the magnetic field creates a disturbance proportional to the magnetic susceptibility As the electromagnetic fields oscillate in the wave the charges in the material will be shaken back and forth at the same frequency The charges thus radiate their own electromagnetic wave that is at the same frequency but usually with a phase delay as the charges may move out of phase with the force driving them see sinusoidally driven harmonic oscillator The light wave traveling in the medium is the macroscopic superposition sum of all such contributions in the material the original wave plus the waves radiated by all the moving charges This wave is typically a wave with the same frequency but shorter wavelength than the original leading to a slowing of the wave s phase velocity Most of the radiation from oscillating material charges will modify the incoming wave changing its velocity However some net energy will be radiated in other directions or even at other frequencies see scattering br Depending on the relative phase of the original driving wave and the waves radiated by the charge motion there are several possibilities br br If the electrons emit a light wave which is out of phase with the light wave shaking them it will cause the total light wave to travel slower This is the normal refraction of transparent materials like glass or water and corresponds to a refractive index which is real and greater than br If the electrons emit a light wave which is out of phase with the light wave shaking them it will cause the wave to travel faster This is called anomalous refraction and is observed close to absorption lines typically in infrared spectra with X rays in ordinary materials and with radio waves in Earth s ionosphere It corresponds to a permittivity less than which causes the refractive index to be also less than unity and the phase velocity of light greater than the speed of light in vacuum c note that the signal velocity is still less than c as discussed above If the response is sufficiently strong and out of phase the result is a negative value of permittivity and imaginary index of refraction as observed in metals or plasma br If the electrons emit a light wave which is out of phase with the light wave shaking them it will destructively interfere with the original light to reduce the total light intensity This is light absorption in opaque materials and corresponds to an imaginary refractive index br If the electrons emit a light wave which is in phase with the light wave shaking them it will amplify the light wave This is rare but occurs in lasers due to stimulated emission It corresponds to an imaginary index of refraction with the opposite sign to that of absorption br For most materials at visible light frequencies the phase is somewhere between and corresponding to a combination of both refraction and absorption br br br Dispersion br br The refractive index of materials varies with the wavelength and frequency of light This is called dispersion and causes prisms and rainbows to divide white light into its constituent spectral colors As the refractive index varies with wavelength so will the refraction angle as light goes from one material to another Dispersion also causes the focal length of lenses to be wavelength dependent This is a type of chromatic aberration which often needs to be corrected for in imaging systems In regions of the spectrum where the material does not absorb light the refractive index tends to decrease with increasing wavelength and thus increase with frequency This is called normal dispersion in contrast to anomalous dispersion where the refractive index increases with wavelength For visible light normal dispersion means that the refractive index is higher for blue light than for red br For optics in the visual range the amount of dispersion of a lens material is often quantified by the Abbe number br br br br br V br br br br br br n br br br y br e br l br l br o br w br br br br br br br br br n br br br b br l br u br e br br br br br br n br br br r br e br d br br br br br br br br

is an empirical formula that works well in describing dispersion Sellmeier coefficients are often quoted instead of the refractive index in tables br br br Principal refractive index wavelength ambiguity br Because of dispersion it is usually important to specify the vacuum wavelength of light for which a refractive index is measured Typically measurements are done at various well defined spectral emission lines br Manufacturers of optical glass in general define principal index of refraction at yellow spectral line of helium nm and alternatively at a green spectral line of mercury nm called d and e lines respectively Abbe number is defined for both and denoted Vd and Ve The spectral data provided by glass manufacturers is also often more precise for these two wavelengths br Both d and e spectral lines are singlets and thus are suitable to perform a very precise measurements such as spectral goniometric method br In practical applications measurements of refractive index are performed on various refractometers such as Abbe refractometer Measurement accuracy of such typical commercial devices is in the order of Refractometers usually measure refractive index nD defined for sodium doublet D nm which is actually a midpoint between two adjacent yellow spectral lines of sodium Yellow spectral lines of helium d and sodium D are nm apart which can be considered negligible for typical refractometers but can cause confusion and lead to errors if accuracy is critical br All three typical principle refractive indices definitions can be found depending on application and region so a proper subscript should be used to avoid ambiguity br br br Complex refractive index br br When light passes through a medium some part of it will always be absorbed This can be conveniently taken into account by defining a complex refractive index br br br br br br br n br br br br br n br br i br br br br br displaystyle underline n n i kappa br br br Here the real part n is the refractive index and indicates the phase velocity while the imaginary part is called the optical extinction coefficient or absorption coefficient although can also refer to the mass attenuation coefficient and indicates the amount of attenuation when the electromagnetic wave propagates through the material br That corresponds to absorption can be seen by inserting this refractive index into the expression for electric field of a plane electromagnetic wave traveling in the x direction This can be done by relating the complex wave number k to the complex refractive index n through k n with being the vacuum wavelength this can be inserted into the plane wave expression for a wave travelling in the x direction as br br br br br br br br br br E br br br x br br t br br br br br br Re br

In special situations especially in the gain medium of lasers it is also possible that corresponding to an amplification of the light br An alternative convention uses n n i instead of n n i but where still corresponds to loss Therefore these two conventions are inconsistent and should not be confused The difference is related to defining sinusoidal time dependence as Re exp i t versus Re exp i t See Mathematical descriptions of opacity br Dielectric loss and non zero DC conductivity in materials cause absorption Good dielectric materials such as glass have extremely low DC conductivity and at low frequencies the dielectric loss is also negligible resulting in almost no absorption However at higher frequencies such as visible light dielectric loss may increase absorption significantly reducing the material s transparency to these frequencies br The real n and imaginary parts of the complex refractive index are related through the Kramers Kronig relations In A R Forouhi and I Bloomer deduced an equation describing as a function of photon energy E applicable to amorphous materials Forouhi and Bloomer then applied the Kramers Kronig relation to derive the corresponding equation for n as a function of E The same formalism was applied to crystalline materials by Forouhi and Bloomer in br The refractive index and extinction coefficient n and are typically measured from quantities that depend on them such as reflectance R or transmittance T or ellipsometric parameters and The determination of n and from such measured quantities will involve developing a theoretical expression for R or T or and in terms of a valid physical model for n and By fitting the theoretical model to the measured R or T or and using regression analysis n and can be deduced br br br X ray and extreme UV br For X ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation the complex refractive index deviates only slightly from unity and usually has a real part smaller than It is therefore normally written

rescaled as either N n or N n the multiplication factors are used because the refractive index for air n deviates from unity by at most a few parts per ten thousand br Molar refractivity on the other

refraction br So far we have assumed that refraction is given by linear equations involving a spatially constant scalar refractive index These assumptions can break down in different ways to be described in the following subsections br br br Birefringence br br In some materials the refractive index depends on the polarization and propagation direction of the light This is called birefringence or optical anisotropy br In the simplest form uniaxial birefringence there is only one special direction in the material This axis is known as the optical axis of the material Light with linear polarization perpendicular to this axis will experience an ordinary refractive index no while light polarized in parallel will experience an extraordinary refractive index ne The birefringence of the material is the difference between these indices of refraction n ne no Light propagating in the direction of the optical axis will not be affected by the birefringence since the refractive index will be no independent of polarization For other propagation directions the light will split into two linearly polarized beams For light traveling perpendicularly to the optical axis the beams will have the same direction This can be used to change the polarization direction of linearly polarized light or to convert between linear circular and elliptical polarizations with waveplates br Many crystals are naturally birefringent but isotropic materials such as plastics and glass can also often be made birefringent by introducing a preferred direction through e g an external force or electric field This effect is called photoelasticity and can be used to reveal stresses in structures The birefringent material is placed between crossed polarizers A change in birefringence alters the polarization and thereby the fraction of light that is transmitted through the second polarizer br In the more general case of trirefringent materials described by the field of crystal optics the dielectric constant is a rank tensor a by matrix In this case the propagation of light cannot simply be described by refractive indices except for polarizations along principal axes br br br Nonlinearity br br The strong electric field of high intensity light such as the output of a laser may cause a medium s refractive index to vary as the light passes through it giving rise to nonlinear optics If the index varies quadratically with the field linearly with the intensity it is called the optical Kerr effect and causes phenomena such as self focusing and self phase modulation If the index varies linearly with the field a nontrivial linear coefficient is only possible in materials that do not possess inversion symmetry it is known as the Pockels effect br br br Inhomogeneity br br If the refractive index of a medium is not constant but varies gradually with the position the material is known as a gradient index GRIN medium and is described by gradient index optics Light traveling through such a medium can be bent or focused and this effect can be exploited to produce lenses some optical fibers and other devices Introducing GRIN elements in the design of an optical system can greatly simplify the system reducing the number of elements by as much as a third while maintaining overall performance The crystalline lens of the human eye is an example of a GRIN lens with a refractive index varying from about in the inner core to approximately at the less dense cortex Some common mirages are caused by a spatially varying refractive index of air br br br Refractive index measurement br br br Homogeneous media br br The refractive index of liquids or solids can be measured with refractometers They typically measure some angle of refraction or the critical angle for total internal reflection The first laboratory refractometers sold commercially were developed by Ernst Abbe in the late th century br The same principles are still used today In this instrument a thin layer of the liquid to be measured is placed between two prisms Light is shone through the liquid at incidence angles all the way up to i e light rays parallel to the surface The second prism should have an index of refraction higher than that of the liquid so that light only enters the prism at angles smaller than the critical angle for total reflection This angle can then be measured either by looking through a telescope or with a digital photodetector placed in the focal plane of a lens The refractive index n of the liquid can then be calculated from the maximum transmission angle as n nG sin where nG is the refractive index of the prism br br This type of device is commonly used in chemical laboratories for identification of substances and for quality control Handheld variants are used in agriculture by e g wine makers to determine sugar content in grape juice and inline process refractometers are used in e g chemical and pharmaceutical industry for process control br In gemology a different type of refractometer is used to measure the index of refraction and birefringence of gemstones The gem is placed on a high refractive index prism and illuminated from below A high refractive index contact liquid is used to achieve optical contact between the gem and the prism At small incidence angles most of the light will be transmitted into the gem but at high angles total internal reflection will occur in the prism The critical angle is normally measured by looking through a telescope br br br Refractive index variations br br Unstained biological structures appear mostly transparent under bright field microscopy as most cellular structures do not attenuate appreciable quantities of light Nevertheless the variation in the materials that constitute these structures also corresponds to a variation in the refractive index The following techniques convert such variation into measurable amplitude differences br To measure the spatial variation of the refractive index in a sample phase contrast imaging methods are used These methods measure the variations in phase of the light wave exiting the sample The phase is proportional to the optical path length the light ray has traversed and thus gives a measure of the integral of the refractive index along the ray path The phase cannot be measured directly at optical or higher frequencies and therefore needs to be converted into intensity by interference with a reference beam In the visual spectrum this is done using Zernike phase contrast microscopy differential interference contrast microscopy DIC or interferometry br Zernike phase contrast microscopy introduces a phase shift to the low spatial frequency components of the image with a phase shifting annulus in the Fourier plane of the sample so that high spatial frequency parts of the image can interfere with the low frequency reference beam In DIC the illumination is split up into two beams that are given different polarizations are phase shifted differently and are shifted transversely with slightly different amounts After the specimen the two parts are made to interfere giving an image of the derivative of the optical path length in the direction of the difference in the transverse shift In interferometry the illumination is split up into two beams by a partially reflective mirror One of the beams is let through the sample before they are combined to interfere and give a direct image of the phase shifts If the optical path length variations are more than a wavelength the image will contain fringes br There exist several phase contrast X ray imaging techniques to determine D or D spatial distribution of refractive index of samples in the X ray regime br br br Applications br br The refractive index is an important property of the components of any optical instrument It determines the focusing power of lenses the dispersive power of prisms the reflectivity of lens coatings and the light guiding nature of optical fiber Since the refractive index is a fundamental physical property of a substance it is often used to identify a particular substance confirm its purity or measure its concentration The refractive index is used to measure solids liquids and gases Most commonly it is used to measure the concentration of a solute in an aqueous solution It can also be used as a useful tool to differentiate between different types of gemstone due to the unique chatoyance each individual stone displays A refractometer is the instrument used to measure the refractive index For a solution of
