Quattron is the brand name of an LCD color display technology produced by Sharp Electronics In addition to the standard RGB Red Green and Blue color subpixels the technology utilizes a yellow fourth color subpixel RGBY which Sharp claims increases the range of displayable colors and which may mimic more closely the way the brain processes color information The screen is a form of multi primary color display other forms of which have been developed in parallel to Sharp s version br The technology is used in Sharp s Aquos LCD TV product line particularly in models with screens inches across and larger It was at first introduced as sub pixel color technology and then later coined into Quattron technology by Linda Lim from Sharp Malaysia The technology distinct from the product line has been advertised featuring George Takei as the spokesperson in the debut commercial in which he uses his catchphrase Oh My Another commercial had Takei advertising the D model with the Minions from the movie br Despicable Me In Malaysia the famous tagline was C has arrived C is over mimicking the attention of G technology trend at that moment but was actually referring to its advanced color technology The later version was known as Quattron Pro with further subdivided pixels applied to its HDTV range br br br Reception br br br Analysis br According to an analysis by Raymond Soneira president of DisplayMate Technologies a video calibration equipment producer the industry standard color spaces used by content providers mean there is no existing source material that contains the fourth color channel He therefore concludes that any extra colors displayed must be created in the television itself through video processing resulting in exaggerated less accurate color br br Color researchers at Queen Mary University of London investigated the Quattron technology and found that although Quattron does have four physical color sub pixels it does not have a fourth primary in the backlight to drive it yellow is approximately nm In other words Quattron has a yellow sub pixel to let light through but the manufacturer has not made any provision to produce the yellow light needed to pass through it The yellow subpixel merely lets through more red and green light On that basis they conclude that it serves no useful function br br br See also br Color depth br Gamut br Opponent process a color theory which considers yellow a primary color in addition to the classic RGB color model br PenTile matrix family RGB reproduction via alternated RG BG RG BW etc br RGBE filter a Bayer filter with emerald as a th color br Hexachrome a system for printing with six colours br Tetrachromacy a different biological system from trichromacy possibly found in some people br Trichromacy scientific description of the RGB model for human vision br br br br br br External links br Aquos LCD TV Sharp website br Sharp LC LE E Review Technical assessment of Quattron TV by David Mackenzie at HDTVtest
