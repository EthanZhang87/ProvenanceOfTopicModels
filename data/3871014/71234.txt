Orange is the colour between yellow and red on the spectrum of visible light Human eyes perceive orange when observing light with a dominant wavelength between roughly and nanometres In traditional colour theory it is a secondary colour of pigments produced by mixing yellow and red In the RGB colour model it is a tertiary colour It is named after the fruit of the same name br The orange colour of many fruits and vegetables such as carrots pumpkins sweet potatoes and oranges comes from carotenes a type of photosynthetic pigment These pigments convert the light energy that the plants absorb from the Sun into chemical energy for the plants growth Similarly the hues of autumn leaves are from the same pigment after chlorophyll is removed br In Europe and the United States surveys show that orange is the colour most associated with amusement the unconventional extroversion warmth fire energy activity danger taste and aroma the autumn and Allhallowtide seasons as well as having long been the national colour of the Netherlands and the House of Orange It also serves as the political colour of the Christian democracy political ideology and most Christian democratic political parties In Asia it is an important symbolic colour in Buddhism and Hinduism br br br In nature and culture br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Etymology br In English the colour orange is named after the appearance of the ripe orange fruit The word comes from the Old French orange from the old term for the fruit pomme d orange The French word in turn comes from the Italian arancia based on Arabic n ranj borrowed from Persian n rang derived from Sanskrit n ra ga which in turn derives from a Dravidian root word compare n randam n ra ja which refers to bitter orange in Tamil and Malayalam The earliest known recorded use of orange as a colour name in English was in in a description of clothing purchased for Margaret Tudor Another early recorded use was in in a will now filed with the Public Record Office By the th century the fruit and its colour were familiar enough that orange coloured shifted in use to orange as an adjective The place name Orange has a separate etymology and is not related to that of the colour br Before this word was introduced to the English speaking world saffron already existed in the English language Crog also referred to the saffron colour so that orange was also referred to as eolur ad yellow red for reddish orange or eolucrog yellow saffron for yellowish orange Alternatively orange things were sometimes described as red which then had a broader meaning such as red deer red hair the Red Planet and robin redbreast When orange was infrequently used in heraldry it was referred to as tawny or brusk br br br History and art br In ancient Egypt and ancient India artists used an orange colour on some of their items In Egypt a mineral pigment called realgar was used for tomb paintings as well as for other purposes Orange carnelians were significantly used during the Indus Valley civilisation which was in turn obtained by the people of Kutch Gujarat India The colour was also used later by medieval artists for the colouring of manuscripts Pigments were also made in ancient times from a mineral known as orpiment Orpiment was an important item of trade in the Roman Empire and was used as a medicine in ancient China although it contains arsenic and is highly toxic It was also used as a fly poison and to poison arrows Because of its yellow orange colour it was also a favourite with alchemists who were searching for a way to make gold both in China and in the West br Before the late th century the colour orange existed in Europe but without the name it was simply called yellow red Portuguese merchants brought the first orange trees to Europe from Asia in the late th and early th century along with the Sanskrit word n ra ga which gradually became part of several European languages naranja in Spanish laranja in Portuguese and orange in English French In mid th century England the colour referred to as orange was a reddish brown matching the deteriorated appearance of the fruit after a long journey from where it was grown in Portugal or Spain Improvements in transportation and the introduction of an orange grove in Surrey allowed the fresh fruit to become more familiar in England and the colour referred to as orange shifted in the s toward its modern understanding br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br House of Orange br The House of Orange Nassau was one of the most influential royal houses in Europe in the th and th centuries It originated in in the tiny Principality of Orange a feudal state of square miles km north of Avignon in southern France The Principality of Orange took its name not from the fruit but from a Roman Celtic settlement on the site which was founded in or BC and was named after the Celtic water god Arausio however the name may have been slightly altered and the town associated with the colour because it was on the route by which quantities of oranges were brought from southern ports such as Marseille to northern France br The family of the Prince of Orange eventually adopted the name and the colour orange in the s The colour came to be associated with Protestantism due to participation by the House of Orange on the Protestant side in the French Wars of Religion One member of the house William I of Orange organised the Eighty Years War comprising resistance against Spain a war that lasted eighty years until the Netherlands won its independence The House s arguably most prominent member William III of Orange became King of England in after the downfall of the Catholic James II in the Glorious Revolution br Due to William III orange became an important political colour in Britain and Europe William was a Protestant and as such he defended the Protestant minority of Ireland against the majority Roman Catholic population As a result the Protestants of Ireland were known as Orangemen Orange eventually became one of the colours of the Irish flag symbolising the Protestant heritage His orange white and blue rebel flag became the forerunner of The Netherlands modern flag br When the Dutch settlers living in the Cape Colony now part of South Africa migrated into the Southern African heartlands in the th century they founded what they called the Orange Free State In the United States the flag of New York City has an orange stripe to remember the Dutch colonists who founded the city William of Orange is also remembered as the founder of the College of William Mary and Nassau County New York is named after the House of Orange Nassau br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br th and th century br In the th century orange was sometimes used to depict the robes of Pomona the goddess of fruitful abundance her name came from the pomon the Latin word for fruit Oranges themselves became more common in northern Europe thanks to the th century invention of the heated greenhouse a building type which became known as an orangerie The French artist Jean Honor Fragonard depicted an allegorical figure of inspiration dressed in orange br In a French scientist Louis Vauquelin discovered the mineral crocoite or lead chromate which led in to the invention of the synthetic pigment chrome orange Other synthetic pigments cobalt red cobalt yellow and cobalt orange the last made from cadmium sulfide plus cadmium selenide soon followed These new pigments plus the invention of the metal paint tube in made it possible for artists to paint outdoors and to capture the colours of natural light br In Britain orange became highly popular with the Pre Raphaelites and with history painters The flowing red orange hair of Elizabeth Siddal a prolific model and the wife of painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti became a symbol of the Pre Raphaelite movement Lord Leighton the president of the Royal Academy produced Flaming June a painting of a sleeping young woman in a bright orange dress which won wide acclaim Albert Joseph Moore painted festive scenes of Romans wearing orange cloaks brighter than any of the Romans ever likely wore In the United States Winslow Homer brightened his palette with vivid oranges br In France painters took orange in an entirely different direction In Claude Monet painted Impression Sunrise a tiny orange sun and some orange light reflected on the clouds and water in the centre of a hazy blue landscape This painting gave its name to the impressionist movement br Orange became an important colour for all the impressionist painters They all had studied the recent books on colour theory and they know that orange placed next to azure blue made both colours much brighter Auguste Renoir painted boats with stripes of chrome orange paint straight from the tube Paul C zanne did not use orange pigment but produced his own oranges with touches of yellow red and ochre against a blue background Toulouse Lautrec often used oranges in the skirts of dancers and gowns of Parisiennes in the cafes and clubs he portrayed For him it was the colour of festivity and amusement br The post impressionists went even further with orange Paul Gauguin used oranges as backgrounds for clothing and skin colour to fill his pictures with light and exoticism But no other painter used orange so often and dramatically as Vincent van Gogh who had shared a house with Gauguin in Arles for a time For Van Gogh orange and yellow were the pure sunlight of Provence He produced his own oranges with mixtures of yellow ochre and red and placed them next to slashes of sienna red and bottle green and below a sky of turbulent blue and violet He put an orange moon and stars in a cobalt blue sky He wrote to his brother Theo of searching for oppositions of blue with orange of red with green of yellow with violet searching for broken colours and neutral colours to harmonize the brutality of extremes trying to make the colours intense and not a harmony of greys br br br br br br br br br br br br br br

st centuries the colour orange had highly varied associations both positive and negative br The high visibility of orange made it a popular colour for certain kinds of clothing and equipment During World War II US Navy pilots in the Pacific began to wear orange inflatable life jackets which could be spotted by search and rescue planes After the war these jackets became common on both civilian and naval vessels of all sizes and on aircraft flown over water Orange is also widely worn to avoid being hit by workers on highways and by cyclists br A herbicide called Agent Orange was widely sprayed from aircraft by the Royal Air Force during the Malayan Emergency and the US Air Force during the Vietnam War to remove the forest and jungle cover beneath which enemy combatants were believed to be hiding and to expose their supply routes The chemical was not actually orange but took its name from the colour of the steel drums in which it was stored Agent Orange was toxic and was later linked to birth defects and other health problems br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Orange also had and continues to have a political dimension Orange serves as the colour of Christian democratic political ideology which is based on Catholic social teaching and Neo Calvinist theology Christian democratic political parties came to prominence in Europe and the Americas after World War II br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br In Ukraine in November December it became the colour of the Orange Revolution a popular movement which

Science br br br Optics br br In optics orange is the colour seen by the eye when looking at light with a wavelength between approximately nm It has a hue of in HSV colour space Isaac Newton s Opticks distinguished between pure orange light and mixtures of red and yellow light by noting that mixtures could be separated using a prism br In the traditional colour wheel used by painters orange is the range of colours between red and yellow and painters can obtain orange simply by mixing red and yellow in various proportions however these colours are never as vivid as a pure orange pigment In the RGB colour model the system used to display colours on a television or computer screen orange is generated by combining high intensity red light with a lower intensity green light with the blue light turned off entirely Orange is a tertiary colour which is numerically halfway between gamma compressed red and yellow as can be seen in the RGB colour wheel br Regarding painting blue is the complementary colour to orange As many painters of the th century discovered blue and orange reinforce each other The painter Vincent van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo that in his paintings he was trying to reveal the oppositions of blue with orange of red with green of yellow with violet trying to make the colours intense and not a harmony of grey In another letter he wrote simply There is no orange without blue Van Gogh Pierre Auguste Renoir and many other impressionist and post impressionist painters frequently placed orange against azure or cobalt blue to make both colours appear brighter br The actual complement of orange is azure a colour that is one quarter of the way between blue and green on the colour spectrum The actual complementary colour of true blue is yellow Orange

the th century by chrome orange and cadmium orange br Cadmium orange is a synthetic pigment made from cadmium sulphide It is a by product of mining for zinc but also occurs rarely in nature in the mineral greenockite It is usually made by replacing some of the sulphur with selenium which results in an expensive but deep and lasting colour Selenium was discovered in but the pigment was not made

plastics and fibres as well as in paints br br br Orange natural objects br The orange colour of carrots pumpkins sweet potatoes oranges and many other fruits and vegetables comes from carotenes a type of photosynthetic pigment These pigments convert the light energy that the plants absorb from the sun into chemical energy for the plants growth The carotenes themselves take their name from the carrot Autumn leaves also get their orange colour from carotenes When the weather turns cold and production of green chlorophyll stops the orange colour remains br Before the th century carrots from Asia were usually purple while those in Europe were either white or red Dutch farmers bred a variety that was orange according to some sources as a tribute to the stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland

takes his vows puts on the robes and with his begging bowl goes out to the world Thereafter he spends his mornings begging and his afternoons in contemplation and study either in a forest garden or in the monastery br According to Buddhist scriptures and commentaries the robe dye is allowed to be obtained from six kinds of substances roots and tubers plants bark leaves flowers and fruits The robes should also be boiled in water a long time to get the correctly sober colour Saffron and ochre usually made with dye from the curcuma longa plant or the heartwood of the jackfruit tree are the most common colours The so called forest monks usually wear ochre robes and city monks saffron though this is not an official rule br The colour of robes also varies somewhat among the different vehicles
