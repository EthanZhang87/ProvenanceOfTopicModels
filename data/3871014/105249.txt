In heraldry argent is the tincture of silver and belongs to the class of light tinctures called metals It is very frequently depicted as white and usually considered interchangeable with it In engravings and line drawings regions to be tinctured argent are either left blank or indicated with the abbreviation ar br The name derives from Latin argentum translated as silver or white metal The word argent had the same meaning in Old French blazon whence it passed into the English language br In some historical depictions of coats of arms a kind of silver leaf was applied to those parts of the device that were argent Over time the silver content of these depictions has tarnished and darkened As a result it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish regions that were intended as argent from those that were sable This leaves a false impression that the rule of tincture has been violated in cases where when applied next to a dark colour argent now appears to be sable due to tarnish br br br Argent versus white br Arthur Charles Fox Davies argued in his book The Art of Heraldry that though extremely rare the colour white existed as an independent tincture in heraldry separate from argent He bases this in part on the white labels used to differentiate the arms of members of the British royal family However it has been argued that these could be regarded as white labels proper thus rendering white not a heraldic tincture br br br Poetic meaning br The different tinctures are traditionally associated with particular heavenly bodies precious stones virtues and flowers although these associations have been mostly disregarded by serious heraldists In addition to the metal silver Argent is associated with br br Of jewels the pearl or sometimes crystal br Of heavenly bodies the Moon br Of virtues innocence br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br
