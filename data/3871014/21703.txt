Noah appears as the last of the Antediluvian patriarchs in the traditions of Abrahamic religions His story appears in the Hebrew Bible Book of Genesis chapters the Quran and Baha i writings Noah is referenced in various other books of the Bible including the New Testament and in associated deuterocanonical books br The Genesis flood narrative is among the best known stories of the Bible In this account Noah labored faithfully to build the Ark at God s command ultimately saving not only his own family but mankind itself and all land animals from extinction during the Flood which God created after regretting that the world was full of sin Afterwards God made a covenant with Noah and promised never again to destroy all the Earth s creatures with a flood Noah is also portrayed as a tiller of the soil and as a drinker of wine After the flood God commands Noah and his sons to be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth br br br Biblical narrative br br Tenth and final of the pre Flood antediluvian Patriarchs son to Lamech and a mother whose name is unmentioned Noah is years old before his sons Shem Ham and Japheth are born br br br Genesis flood narrative br br The Genesis flood narrative is encompassed within chapters in the Book of Genesis in the Bible The narrative indicates that God intended to return the Earth to its pre Creation state of watery chaos by flooding the Earth because of humanity s misdeeds and then remake it using the microcosm of Noah s ark Thus the flood was no ordinary overflow but a reversal of Creation The narrative discusses the evil of mankind that moved God to destroy the world by way of the flood the preparation of the ark for certain animals Noah and his family and God s guarantee the Noahic Covenant for the continued existence of life under the promise that he would never send another flood br br br After the flood br br After the flood Noah offered burnt offerings to God God accepted the sacrifice and made a covenant with Noah and through him with all mankind that he would not waste the earth or destroy man by another deluge br And God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them Be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth As a pledge of this gracious covenant with man and beast the rainbow was set in the clouds ib viii ix Two injunctions were laid upon Noah While the eating of animal food was permitted abstinence from blood was strictly enjoined and the shedding of the blood of man by man was made a crime punishable by death at the hands of man ib ix br Noah as the last of the extremely long lived Antediluvian patriarchs died years after the flood at the age of when Terah was The maximum human lifespan as depicted by the Bible gradually diminishes thereafter from almost years to the years of Moses br br br Noah s drunkenness br br After the flood the Bible says that Noah became a farmer and he planted a vineyard He drank wine made from this vineyard and got drunk and lay uncovered within his tent Noah s son Ham the father of Canaan saw his father naked and told his brothers which led to Ham s son Canaan being cursed by Noah br As early as the Classical era commentators on Genesis have excused Noah s excessive drinking because he was considered to be the first wine drinker the first person to discover the effects of wine John Chrysostom Archbishop of Constantinople and a Church Father wrote in the th century that Noah s behavior is defensible as the first human to taste wine he would not know its effects Through ignorance and inexperience of the proper amount to drink fell into a drunken stupor Philo a Hellenistic Jewish philosopher also excused Noah by noting that one can drink in two different manners to drink wine in excess a peculiar sin to the vicious evil man or to partake of wine as the wise man Noah being the latter In Jewish tradition and rabbinic literature on Noah rabbis blame Satan for the intoxicating properties of the wine br br In the context of Noah s drunkenness relates two facts Noah became drunken and he was uncovered within his tent and Ham saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren without br Because of its brevity and textual inconsistencies it has been suggested that this narrative is a splinter from a more substantial tale A fuller account would explain what exactly Ham had done to his father or why Noah directed a curse at Canaan for Ham s misdeed or how Noah realised what had occurred In the field of psychological biblical criticism J H Ellens and W G Rollins have analysed the unconventional behavior that occurs between Noah and Ham as revolving around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts such as Habakkuk and Lamentations br Other commentaries mention that uncovering someone s nakedness could mean having sexual intercourse with that person or that person s spouse as quoted in Leviticus and From this interpretation comes the speculation that Ham was guilty of engaging in incest and raping Noah or his own mother The latter interpretation would clarify why Canaan as the product of this illicit union was cursed by Noah Alternatively Canaan could be the perpetrator himself as the Bible describes the illicit deed being committed by Noah s youngest son with Ham being consistently described as the middle son in other verses br br br Table of nations br br Genesis sets forth the descendants of Shem Ham and Japheth from whom the nations branched out over the Earth after the flood Among Japheth s descendants were the maritime nations Ham s son Cush had a son named Nimrod who became the first man of might on earth a mighty hunter king in Babylon and the land of Shinar From there Ashur went and built Nineveh Canaan s descendants Sidon Heth the Jebusites the Amorites the Girgashites the Hivites the Arkites the Sinites the Arvadites the Zemarites and the Hamathites spread out from Sidon as far as Gerar near Gaza and as far as Sodom and Gomorrah Among Shem s descendants was Eber br These genealogies differ structurally from those set out in Genesis and It has a segmented or treelike structure going from one father to many offspring It is strange that the table which assumes that the population is distributed about the Earth precedes the account of the Tower of Babel which says that all the population is in one place before it is dispersed br br br Family tree br Genesis transmits a genealogy of the Sethites down to Noah which is taken from the priestly tradition A genealogy of the Canites from the Jawhistic tradition is found in Genesis Biblical scholars see these as variants on one and the same list However if we take the merged text of Genesis as a single account we can construct the following family tree which has come down in this form into the Jewish and Christian traditions br br br Narrative analysis br According to the documentary hypothesis the first five books of the Bible Pentateuch Torah including Genesis were collated during the th century BC from four main sources which themselves date from no earlier than the th century BC Two of these the Jahwist composed in the th century BC and the Priestly source from the late th century BC make up the chapters of Genesis which concern Noah The attempt by the th century editor to accommodate two independent and sometimes conflicting sources accounts for the confusion over such matters as how many of each animal Noah took and how long the flood lasted br The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Books of the Bible notes that this story echoes parts of the Garden of Eden story Noah is the first vintner while Adam is the first farmer both have problems with their produce both stories involve nakedness and both involve a division between brothers leading to a curse However after the flood the stories differ It is Noah not God who plants the vineyard and utters the curse so God is less involved br br br Other accounts br In addition to the main story in Genesis the Hebrew Bible Christian Old Testament also refers to Noah in the First Book of Chronicles Isaiah and Ezekiel References in the deuterocanonical books include the books of Tobit Wisdom Sirach Esdras and Maccabees New Testament references include the gospels of Matthew and Luke and some of the epistles Epistle to the Hebrews Peter and Peter br Noah became the subject of much elaboration in the literature of later Abrahamic religions including Islam Surahs and of the Quran and the Bah Faith Kit b i q n and Gems of Divine Mysteries br br br Pseudepigrapha br The Book of Jubilees refers to Noah and says that he was taught the arts of healing by an angel so that his children could overcome the offspring of the Watchers br In of the Book of Enoch which is part of the Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon and canonical for Beta Israel Uriel was dispatched by the Most High to inform Noah of the approaching deluge br br br Dead Sea scrolls br br There are or so fragments of the Dead Sea scrolls that appear to refer to Noah Lawrence Schiffman writes Among the Dead Sea Scrolls at least three different versions of this legend are preserved In particular The Genesis Apocryphon devotes considerable space to Noah However The material seems to have little in common with Genesis which reports the birth of Noah Also Noah s father is reported as worrying that his son was actually fathered by one of the Watchers br br br Religious views br br br Judaism br br The righteousness of Noah is the subject of much discussion among rabbis The description of Noah as righteous in his generation implied to some that his perfection was only relative In his generation of wicked people he could be considered righteous but in the generation of a tzadik like Abraham he would not be considered so righteous They point out that Noah did not pray to God on behalf of those about to be destroyed as Abraham prayed for the wicked of Sodom and Gomorrah In fact Noah is never seen to speak he simply listens to God and acts on his orders This led some commentators to offer the figure of Noah as the righteous man in a fur coat who ensured his own comfort while ignoring his neighbour Others such as the medieval commentator Rashi held on the contrary that the building of the Ark was stretched over years deliberately in order to give sinners time to repent Rashi interprets his father s statement of the naming of Noah in Hebrew Noa This one will comfort us in Hebrew yeNa amenu in our work and in the toil of our hands which come from the ground that the Lord had cursed by saying Noah heralded a new era of prosperity when there was easing in Hebrew na ah from the curse from the time of Adam when the Earth produced thorns and thistles even where men sowed wheat and that Noah then introduced the plow br According to the Jewish Encyclopedia The Book of Genesis contains two accounts of Noah In the first Noah is the hero of the flood and in the second he is the father of mankind and a husbandman who planted the first vineyard The disparity of character between these two narratives has caused some critics to insist that the subject of the latter account was not the same as the subject of the former br The Encyclopedia Judaica notes that Noah s drunkenness is not presented as reprehensible behavior Rather It is clear that Noah s venture into viticulture provides the setting for the castigation of Israel s Canaanite neighbors It was Ham who committed an offense when he viewed his father s nakedness Yet Noah s curse is strangely aimed at Canaan rather than the disrespectful Ham br br br Mandaeism br In Mandaeism Noah Classical Mandaic is mentioned in Book of the Right Ginza In the text Noah s wife is named as Nuraita Classical Mandaic while his son is named as Shum i e Shem Classical Mandaic br br br Christianity br br Peter refers to Noah as a preacher of righteousness In the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke Jesus compares Noah s flood with the coming Day of Judgement Just as it was in the days of Noah so too it will be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man For in the days before the flood people were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage up to the day Noah entered the ark and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man br The First Epistle of Peter compares the power of baptism with the Ark saving those who were in it In later Christian thought the Ark came to be compared to the Church salvation was to be found only within Christ and his Lordship as in Noah s time it had been found only within the Ark St Augustine of Hippo demonstrated in The City of God that the dimensions of the Ark corresponded to the dimensions of the human body which corresponds to the body of Christ the equation of Ark and Church is still found in the Anglican rite of baptism which asks God who of thy great mercy didst save Noah to receive into the Church the infant about to be baptised br In medieval Christianity Noah s three sons were generally considered as the founders of the populations of the three known continents Japheth Europe Shem Asia and Ham Africa although a rarer variation held that they represented the three classes of medieval society the priests Shem the warriors Japheth and the peasants Ham In medieval Christian thought Ham was considered to be the ancestor of the people of black Africa So in racialist arguments the curse of Ham became a justification for the slavery of the black races br Isaac Newton in his religious works on the development of religion wrote about Noah and his offspring In Newton s view while Noah was a monotheist the gods of pagan antiquity are identified with Noah and his descendants br br br Gnosticism br An important Gnostic text the Apocryphon of John reports that the chief archon caused the flood because he desired to destroy the world he had made but the First Thought informed Noah of the chief archon s plans and Noah informed the remainder of humanity Unlike the account of Genesis not only are Noah s family saved but many others also heed Noah s call There is no ark in this account According to Elaine Pagels Rather they hid in a particular place not only Noah but also many other people from the unshakable race They entered that place and hid in a bright cloud br br br Druze faith br The Druze regard Noah as the second spokesman natiq after Adam who helped transmit the foundational teachings of monotheism tawhid intended for the larger audience He is considered an important prophet of God among Druze being among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history br br br Islam br br Noah is a highly important figure in Islam and he is seen as one of the most significant of all prophets The Quran contains references to Noah or Nu in chapters and the seventy first chapter S rah N Arabic is named after him His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends br Noah s narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the Deluge Noah s narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment br Noah has several titles in Islam based primarily on praise for him in the Quran including Trustworthy Messenger of God and Grateful Servant of God br The Quran focuses on several instances from Noah s life more than others and one of the most significant events is the Flood God makes a covenant with Noah just as he did with Abraham Moses Jesus and Muhammad later on Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel Moreover the people mock Noah s words and call him a liar and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach Only the lowest in the community join Noah in believing in God s message and Noah s narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public The Quran narrates that Noah received a revelation to build an Ark after his people refused to believe in his message and hear the warning The narrative goes on to describe that waters poured forth from both the earth and the Heavens destroying all the sinners Even one of his sons disbelieved him stayed behind and was drowned After the Flood ended the Ark rested atop Mount Judi Quran br br Also Islamic beliefs deny the idea of Noah being the first person to drink wine and experience the aftereffects of doing so br Quran states that Noah had been living among the people who he was sent to for years when the flood started br br Indeed We sent Noah to his people and he remained among them for a thousand years less fifty Then the Flood overtook them while they persisted in wrongdoing br br br Bah Faith br The Bah Faith regards the Ark and the Flood as symbolic In Bah belief only Noah s followers were spiritually alive preserved in the ark of his teachings as others were spiritually dead The Bah scripture Kit b i q n endorses the Islamic belief that Noah had a large number of companions either or besides his family on the Ark and that he taught for symbolic years before the flood br br br Ahmadiyya br According to the Ahmadiyya understanding of the Quran the period described in the Quran is the age of his dispensation which extended until the time of Ibrahim Abraham years The first years were the years of spiritual progress which were followed by years of spiritual deterioration of the people of Noah br br br Comparative mythology br br Indian and Greek flood myths also exist although there is little evidence that they were derived from the Mesopotamian flood myth that underlies the biblical account br br br Mesopotamian br br The Noah story of the Pentateuch is quite similar to a flood story contained in the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh composed c BCE In the Gilgamesh version the Mesopotamian gods decide to send a great flood to destroy mankind Various correlations between the stories of Noah and Gilgamesh the flood the construction of the ark the salvation of animals and the release of birds following the flood have led to this story being seen as the source for the story of Noah The few variations include the number of days of the deluge the order of the birds and the name of the mountain on which the ark rests The flood story in Genesis matches the Gilgamesh flood myth so closely that few doubt that it derives from a Mesopotamian account What is particularly noticeable is the way the Genesis flood story follows the Gilgamesh flood tale point by point and in the same order even when the story permits other alternatives br The earliest written flood myth is found in the Mesopotamian Epic of Atrahasis and Epic of Gilgamesh texts The Encyclop dia Britannica says These mythologies are the source of such features of the biblical Flood story as the building and provisioning of the ark its flotation and the subsidence of the waters as well as the part played by the human protagonist The Encyclopedia Judaica adds that there is a strong suggestion that an intermediate agent was active The people most likely to have fulfilled this role are the Hurrians whose territory included the city of Harran where the Patriarch Abraham had his roots The Hurrians inherited the Flood story from Babylonia br The encyclopedia mentions another similarity between the stories Noah is the tenth patriarch and Berossus notes that the hero of the great flood was Babylonia s tenth antediluvian king However there is a discrepancy in the ages of the heroes For the Mesopotamian antecedents the reigns of the antediluvian kings range from to nearly years In the Bible the lifespans fall far short of the briefest reign mentioned in the related Mesopotamian texts Also the name of the hero differs between the traditions The earliest Mesopotamian flood account written in the Sumerian language calls the deluge hero Ziusudra br However Yi Samuel Chen writes that the oldest versions of the Epic of Gilgamesh never mentioned the flood just mentioning that he went to talk to Utnapishtim to find the secret of immortality Starting with the Old Babylonian Period there were attempts to syncretize Utnapishtim with Ziusudra even though they were previously seen as different figures Gilgamesh meeting the flood hero was first alluded to in the Old Babylonian Period in The Death of Gilgamesh and eventually was imported and standardized in the Epic of Gilgamesh probably in the Middle Babylonian Period br Gilgamesh s historical reign is believed to have been approximately BC shortly before the earliest known written stories The discovery of artifacts associated with Aga and Enmebaragesi of Kish two other kings named in the stories has lent credibility to the historical existence of Gilgamesh br The earliest Sumerian Gilgamesh poems date from as early as the Third dynasty of Ur BC One of these poems mentions Gilgamesh s journey to meet the flood hero as well as a short version of the flood story although Chen writes that his was included in texts written during the Old Babylonian Period The earliest Akkadian versions of the unified epic are dated to c BC Due to the fragmentary nature of these Old Babylonian versions it is unclear whether they included an expanded account of the flood myth although one fragment definitely includes the story of Gilgamesh s journey to meet Utnapishtim The standard Akkadian version included a long version of the flood story and was edited by Sin liqe unninni sometime between and BC br Yi Samuel Chen analyzing various texts from the Early Dynastic III Period to the Old Babylonian Period argues that the flood narrative was only added in texts written during the latter Old Babylonian Period Observations by experts indicate that the portions of the Sumerian King List which mention the time before the flood are stylistically different from the King List Proper Chen writes that Old Babylonian copies tend to show a separate pre flood tradition which is apart from the King List Further the Ur III copy of the King List as well as similar documents indicate that the King List Proper once existed independent of a flood narrative or a pre flood tradition Chen provides evidence that the sections of the Sumerian King List that mention references to the flood were all later additions added during the Old Babylonian Period through later updates and edits The Flood as a watershed in early history of the world was probably a new historiographical concept emerging in the Mesopotamian literary traditions during the Old Babylonian Period as evident by the fact that the flood motif didn t show up in the Ur III copy and that the earliest chronographical sources related to the flood show up in the Old Babylonian Period Chen concludes that the name of Ziusudra as a flood hero as well as any hinted references of a flood in the Old Babylonian Version of the Instructions of Shuruppak were later developments during the Old Babylonian Period originating from updated information added to the text from the burgeoning Antediluvian Tradition br br br Ancient Greek br Noah has often been compared to Deucalion the son of Prometheus and Pronoia in Greek mythology Like Noah Deucalion is warned of the flood by Zeus and Poseidon he builds an ark and staffs it with creatures and when he completes his voyage gives thanks and takes advice from the gods on how to repopulate the Earth Deucalion also sends a pigeon to find out about the situation of the world and the bird returns with an olive branch Deucalion in some versions of the myth also becomes the inventor of wine like Noah Philo and Justin equate Deucalion with Noah and Josephus used the story of Deucalion as evidence that the flood actually occurred and that therefore Noah existed br The motif of a weather deity who headed the pantheon causing the great flood and then the trickster who created men from clay saving man is also present in Sumerian Mythology as Enlil instead of Zeus causes the flood and Enki rather than Prometheus saves man Stephanie West has written that this is perhaps due to the Greeks borrowing
