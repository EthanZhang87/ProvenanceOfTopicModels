A color chart or color reference card is a flat physical object that has many different color samples present They can be available as a single page chart or in the form of swatchbooks or color matching fans br Typically there are two different types of color charts br br Color reference charts are intended for color comparisons and measurements Typical tasks for such charts are checking the color reproduction of an imaging system aiding in color management or visually determining the hue of color Examples are the IT and ColorChecker charts br Color selection charts present a palette of available colors to aid the selection of spot colors process colors paints pens crayons and so on usually the colors are from a manufacturers product range Examples are the Pantone and RAL systems br br br Color reference charts br Color reference charts are used for color comparisons and measurements such as checking the color reproduction of an imaging system and calibration and or profiling of digital input devices such as digital cameras and scanners and output display systems like printers monitors and projectors They are also used by traditional photographers and cinematographers to calibrate cameras that use film and to check the color temperature of the lighting br Color reference cards can also be used to assess light quality as in the color rendering index where reflectance from a set of Munsell samples are evaluated br br br Shirley cards br Shirley cards are color reference cards that are used to perform skin color balance in still photography printing The industry standard for these cards in North American photography labs in the s and s depicted a solitary Caucasian female dressed in brightly colored clothes Very few of these color reference cards showed an adult male as the reference image Light skin tones therefore served as the recognized skin ideal standard Stock color film chemistry for still cameras was designed originally with a positive bias toward Caucasian skin tones because of its high level of reflectivity br By the mid s Japanese companies redesigned their Shirley cards using data from their own color preference tests The new reference card featured Japanese women with light yellow skin br In Kodak designed a multiracial norm reference card This card showed three women Caucasian Asian African with different skin colors and brightly contrasted clothing br A similar cinematic calibration technique is known as the China Girl br br br ColorChecker charts br br The ColorChecker first produced as the Macbeth ColorChecker in is a cardboard framed arrangement of twenty four squares of painted samples based on Munsell colors Its previous maker Gretag Macbeth was acquired in by X Rite br A ColorChecker chart can be used to manually adjust color parameters e g color temperature to achieve a desired color rendition ColorChecker charts are available in different sizes and forms br br br IT charts br br Standardized IT charts also called IT targets are made by several companies including Coloraid de FujiFilm Kodak LaserSoft Imaging Unlike ColorChecker charts IT charts are supplied with measurement values and can be used to create ICC color profiles by software e g for digital cameras to create reproducible color management br br br Other br br Pier Andrea Saccardo proposed this chromotaxy scale in to standardize the naming of colors of plant specimens br Color charts can take custom forms as for example the calibration target used by the Curiosity rover for its Mars Hand Lens Imager MAHLI br The European Pharmacopoeia monograph is a method to determine the degree of coloration in liquids applied to pharmacological compounds drug substances and finished product It consist in stock solutions yellow red and blue These are prepared by dissolving in hydrochloride acid ferric chloride cobalt chloride or copper sulfate respectively The stock solutions are then used in different proportions to prepare five standard solutions termed B brown BY brownish yellow Y yellow GY greenish yellow and R red Results are given by observation of the test material against the standard solutions and expressed as less intensely colored as the next color standard for example color of solution colorless to slightly brown yellow liquid BY This method has been updated in Ph Eur release version to include a digital method that eliminates the errors inherent in visual methods due to differences in human perception while providing a quantitative color value br br br Color selection charts br br Because paints and inks depend for their color on pigments and dyes a reference is needed to match specific combinations of coloring substances in a given matrix against the resulting color One of the earliest attempts to achieve this goal was the manuscript Klaer Lightende Spiegel der Verfkonst It presented a range of watercolor mixtures but remained relatively unknown because only one manuscript was produced Due to the development of the paint and ink industry the requirement for this kind of chart intensified and a number of systems are now available including br br DIC Color System Guide and Toyo Color Finder commonly used for spot color matching mostly in Japan br NCS Palette Natural Color System br Pantone used for printing and sometimes for paint fabric and plastics br RAL Reichsausschu f r
