title: Light-on-dark color scheme

A light on dark colour scheme better known as dark mode dark theme or night mode is a colour scheme that uses light coloured text icons and graphical user interface elements on a dark background It is often discussed in terms of computer user interface design and web design Many modern websites and operating systems offer the user an optional light on dark display mode br Some users find dark mode displays more visually appealing and claim that it can reduce eye strain Displaying white at full brightness uses roughly six times as much power as pure black on a Google Pixel which has an OLED display However conventional LED displays cannot benefit from reduced power consumption Most modern operating systems support an optional light on dark colour scheme br br br History br br Predecessors of modern computer screens such as cathode ray oscillographs oscilloscopes etc tended to plot graphs and introduce other content as glowing traces on a black background br With the introduction of computer screens originally user interfaces were formed on cathode ray tubes CRTs like those used for oscillographs or oscilloscopes The phosphor was normally a very dark colour and lit up brightly when the electron beam hit it appearing to be white green blue or amber on a black background depending on phosphors applied on a monochrome screen RGB screens continued to operate similarly using all the beams set to on to form white br With the advent of teletext research was done into which primary and secondary light colours and combinations worked best for this new medium Cyan or yellow on black was typically found to be optimal from a palette of black red green yellow blue magenta cyan and white br The opposite colour set a dark on light colour scheme was originally introduced in WYSIWYG word processors to simulate ink on paper and became the norm br Microsoft introduced a dark theme in the Anniversary Update of Windows in In Apple followed in macOS Mojave In September iOS and Android both introduced dark modes br Firefox and Chromium have optional dark theme for all internal screens It will also be possible for third party developers to implement their own dark themes br In a prefers colour scheme option was created for front end web developers being a CSS property that signals a user s choice for their system to use a light or dark colour theme br br br Energy usage br Light on dark colour schemes require less energy to display on OLED displays This positively impacts battery life and reduces energy consumption br While an OLED will consume around of the power of an LCD displaying an image that is primarily black it can use more than three times as much power to display an image with a white background such as a document or web site This can lead to reduced battery life and energy usage unless a light on dark colour scheme is used The long term reduced power usage may also prolong battery life or the useful life of the display and battery br The energy savings that can be achieved using a light on dark colour scheme are because of how OLED screens work in an OLED screen each subpixel generates its own light and it only consumes power when generating light This is in contrast to how an LCD works in an LCD subpixels either block or allow light from an always on lit LED backlight to pass through br AMOLED Black colour schemes that use pure black instead of dark gray do not necessarily save more energy than other light on dark colour schemes that use dark gray instead of black as the power consumption on an AMOLED screen decreases proportionately to the average brightness of the displayed pixels Although it is true that AMOLED black does save more energy than dark gray the additional energy savings are often negligible AMOLED black will only give an additional energy saving of less than for instance over the dark gray that s used in the dark theme for Google s official Android apps In November Google confirmed that dark mode on Android saved battery life br br br Issues with the web br Some argue that a colour scheme with light text on a dark background is easier to read on the screen because the lower overall brightness causes less eyestrain Others argue to the contrary Some pages on the web are designed for white backgrounds Image assets GIF PNG SVG WOFF etc can be used improperly causing visual artifacts if dark mode is forced instead of designed for with a plugin like darkreader br There is a prefers colour scheme media feature on CSS to detect if the user has requested light or dark colour scheme and serve the requested colour scheme It can be indicated from the user s operating system preference or a user agent br CSS example br br JavaScript example br br br See also br AMOLED br Blackle br Night Shift software br OLED br Solarised colour scheme br br br
