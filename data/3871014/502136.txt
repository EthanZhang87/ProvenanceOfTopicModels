title: Color term
id: 502136
A color term or color name is a word or phrase that refers to a specific color The color term may refer to human perception of that color which is affected by visual context which is usually defined according to the Munsell color system or to an underlying physical property such as a specific wavelength of visible light There are also numerical systems of color specification referred to as color spaces br An important distinction must be established between color and shape as these two attributes usually are used in conjunction with one another when describing in language For example they are labeled as alternative parts of speech terms color term and shape term br Psychological conditions for recognition of colors exist such as those who cannot discern colors in general or those who see colors as sound a variety of synesthesia br br br Color dimensions br Typical human color vision is trichromatic meaning it is based on a three dimensional color gamut These three dimensions can be defined in different ways but often the most intuitive definition are the dimensions of the HSL HSV color space br br Hue representing the different colors of the rainbow or color wheel e g red orange yellow etc roughly analogous to the color s wavelength or frequency br Saturation the colorfulness of the color i e a measure of vibrant vs pale br Luminosity a measurement of intensity or brightness br br br In natural languages br br br Lexicology br Monolexemic color words are composed of individual lexemes or root words such as red brown fuchsia or olive The root words generally describe the hue of the color but some root words namely brown can also describe the other dimensions Compound color words make use of prefix adjectives e g light brown sea green that generally describe the saturation or luminosity or compounded basic color words e g yellow green which refine the hue of the color relative to root words Vaaleanpunainen the Finnish word for pink is a clear agglutination of the language s words for pale vaalea and red punainen br br br Basic color terms br Basic color terms meet the following criteria br br monolexemic green but not light green or forest green br high frequency and br agreed upon by speakers of that language br English has basic color terms black white red green yellow blue brown orange pink purple and gray other languages have between and All other colors are considered by most speakers of that language to be variants of these basic color terms A useful litmus test involves replacing each of these basic terms with an approximation of other basic terms e g replacing orange with red yellow If the approximation is jarring the replaced term likely meets the requirement for being a basic color term br An example of a color that comes close to being a basic color term in English is turquoise It is monolexemic but is not very high frequency especially compared to alternatives teal or cyan It also generally fails the above litmus test in that most people do not find the use of the approximation of other basic color terms blue green to be jarring br br br Color term hierarchy br In the classic study of Brent Berlin and Paul Kay Basic Color Terms Their Universality and Evolution the researchers argued that the differences in number of basic color terms in languages follow a repeatable pattern Color terms can be organized into a coherent hierarchy and there are a limited number of universal basic color terms which begin to be used by individual cultures in a relatively fixed order This order is defined in stages I to VII Berlin and Kay originally based their analysis on a comparison of color words in languages from around the world The model is presented below broken into stages with stage I on the left and stage VII on the right br br br br br br br br br br br white br br br br br br br black br br br br br br br br br br red br br br br br br br br br br green br br br br br br br yellow br br br br br br br br

Berlin and Kay s study identified seven stages of color distinction systems Each progressive stage features a color term that the previous stages do not br br br Stage I dark and light br br Stage I contains two terms white and black light and dark these terms are referenced broadly to describe other undefined color terms For example the Yali highland group in New Guinea identify the color of blood as black This is because blood as a relatively dark liquid is grouped into the same color classification as black br In the Bassa language there are two terms for classifying colors ziza white yellow orange and red and hui black violet blue and green br In the Pirah language there appear to be no color terms beyond describing lightness and darkness br The Dani language of western New Guinea differentiates only two basic colors mili for cool dark shades such as blue green and black and mola for warm light colors such as red yellow and white br br br Stage II red br br Stage II implements a third term for red Objects begin to rely less on their brightness for classification and in this stage we instead see each term cover a larger scope of colors Specifically blue and other darker shades continue to be described as black yellow and orange colors are classified with red and other bright colors continue to be classified with white br In the Bambara language there are three color terms dyema white beige blema reddish brownish and fima dark green indigo and black br br br Stage III IV yellow green br br Stage III identifies a third term referring either to green IIIa or yellow IIIb Most languages in the study with this system identify yellow over green such as the Komi language where green is considered a shade of yellow vizh called turun vizh grass yellow However the Nigerian Ibibio language and the Philippine Hanunoo language both identify green instead of yellow br The Ovahimba use four color names zuzu stands for dark shades of blue red green and purple vapa is white and some shades of yellow buru is some shades of green and blue and dambu is some other shades of green red and brown It is thought that this may increase the time it takes for the Ovahimba to distinguish between two colors that fall under the same Herero color category compared to people whose language separates the colors into two different color categories br br Stage IV incorporates green or yellow which ever was not already present i e stage IIIa languages will adopt yellow and stage IIIb languages will adopt green Most stage IV languages continue to colexify blue and green as listed in Blue green distinction in language br The Chinese character pronounced q ng in Mandarin and ao in Japanese has a meaning that covers both blue and green In more contemporary terms they are l n in Mandarin and l in Mandarin respectively Japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green midori derived from the classical Japanese descriptive verb midoru to be in leaf to flourish in reference to trees and guriin which is derived from the English word green br br br Stage V blue br br Stage V introduces blue as its own color term differentiating from black or from green br br br Stage VI brown br The seventh basic color term is likely to be brown br In English this is the first basic color term other than black and white that is not differentiated on hue but rather on lightness English splits some hues into several distinct colors according to lightness such as red and pink or orange and brown To English speakers these pairs of colors which are objectively no more different from one another than light green and dark green are conceived of as belonging to different categories br br br Stage VII br Stage VII adds additional terms for orange pink purple or gray but these do not exhibit the same hierarchy as the previous seven colors br English contains eleven basic color terms black white red green yellow blue brown orange pink purple and gray br br br Stage VII br br Languages with further color distinction use relativistic light dark terms like light blue dark blue in comparison to blue sky blue ocean or pale red deep red br Italian Russian and Hebrew have twelve basic color terms each distinguishing blue and light blue A Russian will make the same red pink and orange brown distinctions but will also make a further distinction between sinii and goluboi which English speakers would call dark and light blue To Russian speakers sinii and goluboi are as separate as red and pink or orange and brown br Hungarian and Turkish distinguish multiple words for red piros and v r s Hungarian v r s is a darker red and k rm z al and k z l Turkish k rm z now includes all reds but originally referred to crimson to which it is cognate while k z l mainly refers to scarlet and other orange tinted or brownish reds Two words for red are also found in Irish and Scottish Gaelic dearg for light bright red and rua or ruadh respectively for dark brownish red Turkish also has two words for white beyaz and ak and black siyah and kara Ak and beyaz have the same meaning while kara is a broader term than siyah and also includes dark browns which word is used also depends on the kind of object being described Both ak and kara are of Turkic origin while siyah is borrowed from Persian and beyaz from Arabic bay br In Serbian Croatian language there are differences in dark brown mrk brown sme and kestenjast red crven pink ru i ast and orange narand ast as well as in blue hues navy blue teget dark blue modar blue plav and ash blue sinj br An interesting case that deviates from this pattern is Irish s two words for green br br glas denotes the green color of plants br uaine denotes artificial greens of dyes paints etc br This distinction is made even if two shades are identical Glas is also used for natural grays such as the gray squirrel iora glas br br br Linguistic relativity br br These colors roughly correspond to the sensitivities of the retinal ganglion cells leading Berlin and Kay to argue that color naming is not merely a cultural phenomenon but is one that is also constrained by biology that is language is shaped by perception A study suggested that the origin of this hierarchy may be tied to human vision and the time ordering in which these color names get accepted or agreed upon in a population perfectly matches the order predicted by the hierarchy br br br Non hue terms br This article mostly describes the color terms that define the hue of a color since hue is considered the most innate dimension of the three However other terms are often used to describe the other two dimensions which can be seen as common prefixes to the root terms that generally describe hue Adding prefixes to root color terms generates multilexemic colors Examples of common prefix adjectives can be seen in a list of color names and are described br br Brightness can describe either high luminosity or high saturation according to the Helmholtz Kohlrausch effect and or Hunt effect br Lightness describes both a high luminosity and low saturation br Darkness the opposite of lightness or low luminosity br Paleness dullness a measure of desaturation br Deep Royal may refer to darkness and or high saturation unrelated to color depth br Pure Bold Vivid Rich all referring to high saturation br Pastel refers to colors with high luminosity and low saturation br Neon bright in either of the word s connotations alluding to the bright glow of neon lighting br Fluorescent very bright sometimes also highly saturated Named after the fluorescence effect of pigments and dyes which can produce a luminous glow when viewed under UV light thereby appearing significantly brighter than their surroundings br br br Non dimensional terms br Other terms sometimes used to describe color are related to physical phenomenon that do not describe a single color but describe the dynamic nature of an object s color These include br br Glossy whether the surface reflects diffusely or specularly sharply br Metallic distinguishing gold and silver from shades of yellow and gray respectively br Iridescent dependence of color on viewing angle innate to structural coloration br Opacity opaque solid vs translucent transparent or see through br br br Abstract and descriptive color terms br Color terms can be classified as abstract or descriptive though the distinction is often unclear br Abstract color terms refer only to the color they represent and any etymological link to an object of that color is lost In English white black red yellow green blue brown and gray are abstract color terms These terms are also basic color terms as described above though other abstract terms like maroon and magenta are not considered basic color terms br Descriptive color terms are secondarily used to describe a color but primarily refer to an object or phenomenon Salmon rose saffron and lilac are descriptive color terms in English because their use as color terms is derived in reference to natural colors of salmon flesh rose flowers infusions of saffron pistils and lilac blossoms respectively br Abstract color terms in one may be represented by descriptive color terms in another for example in Japanese pink is momoiro lit peach color and gray is either haiiro or nezumiiro lit ash color for light grays and mouse color for dark grays respectively Nevertheless as languages evolve they may adopt or invent new abstract color terms as Japanese has adopted pinku for pink and gur for gray from English br While most of the basic color terms in English are decidedly abstract three of them all stage VII so understandably the youngest basic color terms are arguably still descriptive br br Pink was originally a descriptive color term derived from the name of a flower called a pink However because the word pink is rarely used to refer to the flower anymore relative to its common usage as a color it is often regarded as an abstract color term br Purple is another example of this shift as it was originally a word that referred to the dye named Tyrian purple which took its name from the Latin purpura which referred to both the dye and the sea snail from which the dye was derived However this etymological link has been lost in translation br Orange is difficult to categorize as abstract or descriptive because both its uses as a color term and as a word for an object are very common and it is difficult to distinguish which of the two is primary As a basic color term it became established in the early to mid th century before that time artist s palettes called it yellow red In English the use of the word orange for a fruit predates its use as a color term The word comes from French orenge which derives via Arabic narand and Sanskrit narang from a Dravidian language such as Tamil or Tulu The derived form orangish as a color is attested from the late th century by reference to the fruit br br br Struggle in linguistics br br Research on color terms is often conducted without reference to common uses of the term or its significance within the context of its original language In John A Lucy s article The linguistics of colour he identifies two key categories One of these is characteristic referential range or the use of a color term to identify or differentiate a referent over a wide context br br br Standardized systems br In contrast with the color terms of natural language systematized color terms also exist Some examples of color naming systems are CNS and ISCC NBS lexicon of color terms The disadvantage of these systems however is that they specify only specific color samples so while it is possible to by interpolating convert any color to or from one of these systems a lookup table is required In other words no simple invertible equation can convert between CIE XYZ and one of these systems br Philatelists traditionally use names to identify postage stamp colors While the names are largely standardized within each country there is no broader agreement and so for instance the US published Scott catalogue will use different names than the British Stanley Gibbons catalogue br On modern computer systems a standard set of basic color terms is now used across the web color names SVG CSS HTML color names X color names and the NET Framework color names with only a few minor differences br The Crayola company is famous for its many crayon colors often creatively named br Heraldry has standardized names
