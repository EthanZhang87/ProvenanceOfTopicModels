A sun dog or sundog or mock sun also called a parhelion plural parhelia in meteorology is an atmospheric optical phenomenon that consists of a bright spot to one or both sides of the Sun Two sun dogs often flank the Sun within a halo br The sun dog is a member of the family of halos caused by the refraction of sunlight by ice crystals in the atmosphere Sun dogs typically appear as a pair of subtly colored patches of light around to the left and right of the Sun and at the same altitude above the horizon as the Sun They can be seen anywhere in the world during any season but are not always obvious or bright Sun dogs are best seen and most conspicuous when the Sun is near the horizon br br br Formation and characteristics br br Sun dogs are commonly caused by the refraction and scattering of light from horizontally oriented plate shaped hexagonal ice crystals either suspended in high and cold cirrus or cirrostratus clouds or drifting in freezing moist air at low levels as diamond dust The crystals act as prisms bending the light rays passing through them with a minimum deflection of As the crystals gently float downwards with their large hexagonal faces almost horizontal sunlight is refracted horizontally and sun dogs are seen to the left and right of the Sun Larger plates wobble more and thus produce taller sun dogs br Sun dogs are red colored at the side nearest the Sun farther out the colors grade through oranges to blue The colors overlap considerably and are muted never pure or saturated The colors of the sun dog finally merge into the white of the parhelic circle if the latter is visible br The same plate shaped ice crystals that cause sun dogs are also responsible for the colorful circumzenithal arc meaning that these two types of halo tend to co occur The latter is often missed by viewers since it is located more or less directly overhead Another halo variety often seen together with sun dogs is the halo which forms a ring at roughly the same angular distance from the sun as the sun dogs thus appearing to interconnect them As the Sun rises higher the rays passing through the plate crystals are increasingly skewed from the horizontal plane causing their angle of deviation to increase and the sun dogs to move farther from the halo while staying at the same elevation br It is possible to predict the forms of sun dogs as would be seen on other planets and moons Mars might have sun dogs formed by both water ice and CO ice On the giant planets Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune other crystals form clouds of ammonia methane and other substances that can produce halos with four or more sun dogs br A related phenomenon the Crown flash is also known as a leaping Sundog br br br Terminology br A somewhat common misconception among the general public is to refer to any member of the ice halo family as a sun dog especially the halo being one of the most common varieties However sun dogs represent just one of many different types of halos For referring to the atmospheric phenomenon in general the term ice crystal halo s is more appropriate br br br Etymology br The exact etymology of sun dog largely remains a mystery The Oxford English Dictionary says it is of obscure origin br In Abram Palmer s book Folk etymology A Dictionary of Verbal Corruptions Or Words Perverted in Form Or Meaning by False Derivation Or Mistaken Analogy sun dogs are defined br br The phenomena sic of false suns which sometimes attend or dog the true when seen through the mist parhelions In Norfolk a sun dog is a light spot near the sun and water dogs are the light watery clouds dog here is no doubt the same word as dag dew or mist as a little dag of rain Philolog Soc Trans p Cf Icel dogg Dan and Swed dug Eng dew br Dog in English as a verb can mean hunt track or follow so Dog the true sun has meant track the true sun since the s br Alternatively Jonas Persson suggested that out of Norse mythology and archaic names Danish solhunde sun dog Norwegian solhund sun dog Swedish solvarg sun wolf in the Scandinavian languages constellations of two wolves hunting the Sun and the Moon one after and one before may be a possible origin for the term br Parhelion plural parhelia comes from Ancient Greek par lion beside the sun from para beside and helios sun br In the Anglo Cornish dialect of Cornwall United Kingdom sun dogs are known as weather dogs described as a short segment of a rainbow seen on the horizon foreshowing foul weather It is also known as a lagas in the sky which comes from the Cornish language term for the sun dog lagas awel meaning weather s eye lagas eye and awel weather wind This is in turn related to the Anglo Cornish term cock s eye for a halo round the Sun or the Moon also a portent of bad weather br br br History br br br Antiquity br Aristotle Meteorology III a notes that two mock suns rose with the sun and followed it all through the day until sunset He says that mock suns are always to the side never above or below most commonly at sunrise or sunset more rarely in the middle of the day br The poet Aratus Phaenomena lines mentions parhelia as part of his catalogue of Weather Signs according to him they can indicate rain wind or an approaching storm br Artemidorus in his Oneirocritica On the Interpretation of Dreams included the mock suns amongst a list of celestial deities br A passage in Cicero s On the Republic BC is one of many Roman authors who refer to sun dogs and similar phenomena br br Be it so said Tubero and since you invite me to discussion and present the opportunity let us first examine before any one else arrives what can be the nature of the parhelion or double sun which was mentioned in the senate Those that affirm they witnessed this prodigy are neither few nor unworthy of credit so that there is more reason for investigation than incredulity br Seneca makes an incidental reference to sun dogs in the first book of his Naturales Quaestiones br The nd century Roman writer and philosopher Apuleius in his Apologia says What is the cause of the prismatic colours of the rainbow or of the appearance in heaven of two rival images of the sun with sundry other phenomena treated in a monumental volume by Archimedes of Syracuse br Fulcher of Chartres writing in Jerusalem in the early twelfth century notes in his Historia Hierosolymitana that on February br br from the third hour am until midday we saw left and right from the Sun what looked like two other Suns they did not shine like the big one but smaller in appearance and radiance they reddened moderately Above their circle a halo appeared shining very brightly extending in its breadth as if it were some kind of city Inside this circle a half circle appeared similar to a rainbow distinct in its fourfold color in the higher part curved towards the two aforementioned Suns touching them in an embrace of the Sun br br br Wars of the Roses br br The prelude to the Battle of Mortimer s Cross in Herefordshire England in is supposed to have involved the appearance of a halo display with three suns The Yorkist commander later Edward IV of England convinced his initially frightened troops that it represented the three sons of the Duke of York and Edward s troops won a decisive victory The event was dramatized by William Shakespeare in King Henry VI Part and by Sharon Kay Penman in The Sunne In Splendour br br br Early modern era br Another early clear description of sun dogs is by Jacob Hutter who wrote in his Brotherly Faithfulness Epistles from a Time of Persecution br br My beloved children I want to tell you that on the day after the departure of our brothers Kuntz and Michel on a Friday we saw three suns in the sky for a good long time about an hour as well as two rainbows These had their backs turned toward each other almost touching in the middle and their ends pointed away from each other And this I Jakob saw with my own eyes and many brothers and sisters saw it with me After a while the two suns and rainbows disappeared and only the one sun remained Even though the other two suns were not as bright as the one they were clearly visible I feel this was no small miracle br The observation most likely occurred in Auspitz Hustope e Moravia on October The original was written in German and is from a letter originally sent in November from Auspitz in Moravia to the Adige Valley in South Tyrol The Kuntz Maurer and Michel Schuster mentioned in the letter left Hutter on the Thursday after the feast day of Simon and Jude which is October The Thursday after was October It is likely that the two rainbows with their backs turned toward each other almost touching involved two further halo phenomena possibly a circumzenithal arc prone to co occur with sun dogs together with a partial halo or supralateral arc br br While mostly known and often quoted for being the oldest color depiction of the city of Stockholm V dersolstavlan Swedish The Sundog Painting literally The Weather Sun Painting is arguably also one of the oldest known depictions of a halo display including a pair of sun dogs For two hours in the morning of April the skies over the city were filled with white circles and arcs crossing the sky while additional suns i e sun dogs appeared around the sun The phenomenon quickly resulted in rumours of an omen of God s forthcoming revenge on King Gustav Vasa for having introduced Protestantism during the s and for being heavy handed with his enemies allied with the Danish king br Hoping to end speculations the Chancellor Olaus Petri a Lutheran scholar ordered a painting to be produced documenting the event When confronted with the painting the King however interpreted it as a conspiracy the real sun of course being himself threatened by competing fake suns one being Olaus Petri and the other the clergyman and scholar Laurentius Andreae Both were thus accused of treachery but eventually escaped capital punishment The original painting is lost but a copy from the s survives and can still be seen in the church Storkyrkan in central Stockholm br A series of complex parhelia displays in Rome in and again in were described by Christoph Scheiner in his book Parhelia one of the earliest works on the subject It had a profound effect causing Ren Descartes to interrupt his metaphysical studies and led to his work of natural philosophy called The World br On February the people of Gda sk witnessed a complex halo display described by Georg Fehlau in a pamphlet the Sevenfold Sun Miracle and again the following year by Johannes Hevelius in his book Mercurius in Sole visus Gedani br On June Johann Tobias Lowitz in Saint Petersburg Russia observed a complex display of haloes and parhelia which included his Lowitz arcs br br br Late modern era to current day br In winter in the British Colony of Newfoundland was referred to as the Winter of Three Suns and was unusually cold with days of temperatures between degrees below zero br Part of the time we marched in the teeth of a biting storm of snow and at every hour of the day the sun could be discerned sulking behind soft grey mists in company with rivals known in the language of the plains as Sun dogs whose parahelic splendors warned the traveler of the approach of the ever to be dreaded blizzard br On February the people of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region witnessed a different complex halo display called the Five fold sun miracle in which all five sun halos were linked to each other by rays forming a circle among them br br br See
