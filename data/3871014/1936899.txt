title: Blueâ€“green distinction in language
id: 1936899
In many languages the colors described in English as blue and green are colexified i e expressed using a single umbrella term To render this ambiguous notion in English linguists use the blend word grue from green and blue a term coined by the philosopher Nelson Goodman with an unrelated meaning in his Fact Fiction and Forecast to illustrate his new riddle of induction br The exact definition of blue and green may be complicated by the speakers not primarily distinguishing the hue but using terms that describe other color components such as saturation and luminosity or other properties of the object being described For example blue and green might be distinguished but a single term might be used for both if the color is dark Furthermore green might be associated with yellow and blue with either black or gray br According to Brent Berlin and Paul Kay s study Basic Color Terms Their Universality and Evolution distinct terms for brown purple pink orange and gray will not emerge in a language until the language has made a distinction between green and blue In their account of the development of color terms the first terms to emerge are those for white black or light dark red and green yellow br br br Afro Asiatic br br br Amazigh br The word for blue in the Amazigh Berber language is azerwal In some dialects of Amazigh like Shilha or Kabyle the word azegzaw is used for both green and blue It is likely cognate with the English word azure which represents the colour between blue and cyan br br br Arabic br The color of the sky is sometimes referred to as the green in some dialects of Classical Arabic poetry in which it is al kha r In Arabic the word for blue is azraq The Arabic word for green is akh ar br In Moroccan Arabic the word for light blue is bi whereas zraq

Egyptian word wadjet covered the range of blue blue green and green It was the name of a goddess the patroness of Lower Egypt represented as a cobra called Wadjet the green one or as the Eye of Horus also called by the same name At the same time wedjet was the word used for Egyptian blue in faience ceramics br br br Hebrew br In Hebrew the word pronounced ka ol means blue while pronounced ja ok means green and has the same root j r q as the word for vegetables je a kot However in classical Hebrew can mean both green and yellow giving rise to such expressions as pronounced ja ok kri a leek green to specify green to the exclusion of yellow Like Russian and Italian Hebrew has a separate name for light blue t khelet the color of the sky and of fringes tzitzit on the ritual garment tallit This color has special symbolic significance in both Judaism and Jewish culture br br br American languages br br br Chahta br The Choctaw language has two words okch ko and okch mali which have different meanings depending on the source In okchakko is translated variously as pale blue or pale green okchakko chohmi somewhat okchakko is given as swarthy and okchamali is defined as deep blue gray green or sky blue In okchakko and okch mali are both given as blue and green is not specifically listed as a color In an dictionary okchamali is deep blue or green okchakko is pale blue or bright green and a third word kili koba is bright green resembling a kili kki a species of parrot By the authoritative Byington dictionary gives okchako as blue and okchamali as green blue gray verdant A coursebook from differentiates based on brightness giving okch ko as bright blue green and okch mali as pale or dull blue green Modern usage in the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma language school is to use okch ko for blue and okch mali for green with no distinction for brightness br br br Kanien k ha br The language of the Kanien keh ka Nation at Akwesasne is at Stage VII on the Berlin Kay Scale and possesses distinct terms for a broad range of spectral and nonspectral colors such as oru a blue hute green kah ji black kar kA white and atakAr kwa gray According to one researcher the Kanien keh ka term for purple arihwawakun ha which translates to bishop s color a recent post Christianization coinage The way in which purple was categorized and referenced prior to the addition of the latter term is not clear br br br Lakota br In the Lakota language the word t is used for both blue and green though the word t zi a mixture of the words t blue green and z yellow has become common z t o can also be used This is in line with common practice of using z a zi for orange meaning red and t o t a for purple violet br br br Mapudungun br Mapudungun spoken by indigenous peoples of Chile and Argentina distinguishes between kur black kallf blue and kar green raw immature The word payne was formerly used to refer to a sky blue and also refers to the bluish color of stones br br br Mayan br Single words for blue green are also found in Mayan languages for example in the Yucatec Maya language yax is blue green br br br Tupian br Tupian languages did not originally differ between the two colors though they may now as a result of interference of Spanish in the case of Guaran or Portuguese in the case of Nheengatu The Tupi word obycode tpw is deprecated meant both as does the Guaran hovy h In modern Tupi Nheengatu the word suikiri can be used for green and iakira akira for blue However iakira akira also means immature as in pakua akira green banana immature banana and suikiri can also mean blue In modern Guarani the word hovy is used for blue and hovy which literally means dark green blue is used for green The word aky which is cognate with Nheengatu akira also means green immature br br br Yebamasa br The Yebamasa of the Rio Piraparana region in Vaup s Department southeastern Colombia use the term sumese for both blue and green in the Barasana Eduria language The letter u is pronounced like the German br br br Austronesian languages br br br Filipino Tagalog br Speakers of Tagalog most commonly use the Spanish loanwords for blue and green asul from Spanish azul and berde from Spanish verde respectively Although these words are much more common in spoken use Tagalog has native terms bugh w for blue and lunti n for green which are seen as archaic and more flowery These are mostly confined to formal and academic writings alongside artistic fields such literature music and poetry br In Cebuano another major Philippine language the native words for blue and green end in the same syllable pughaw and lunhaw respectively Pughaw means sky blue while lunhaw is fresh leaf green i e neither brownish nor yellowish br Humor and jokes of a sexual or derogatory nature that would otherwise be described as blue in English e g blue comedy blue joke are called green in Philippine English This is a calque of the Hispanic term chiste verde br br br Javanese br Modern Javanese has distinct words for blue biru and green ijo These words are derived from Old Javanese bir and hijo However in Old Javanese bir could mean pale blue grayish blue greenish blue or even turquoise while hijo which means green could also mean the blue green color of clear water Biru and ijo in Modern Javanese are cognates of Malay Indonesian biru and hijau which both have the same meaning br br br Dravidian br br br Kannada br The Kannada language distinguishes between blue neeli green hasiru and yellow haladi The prefix kadu would indicate darker colors while the prefix tili would indicate light colors Thus kaduneeli would mean dark deep blue while tilineeli would mean light blue br br br Tamil br The Tamil language distinguishes between the colors paccai green n lam blue and karuppu black The prefix karu would indicate dark colors while the suffix i am would indicate light colors Thus karumpaccai would be dark green br br br Telugu br The Telugu language uses a single word pacca for green and yellow To differentiate between the two shades another word is prefixed in some cases For example green will be called kupacca leaf pacca and yellow pasupupacca turmeric pacca br br br Malayalam br In Malayalam there are distinct words for blue n la green pacca and yellow ma a br br br East Asian languages br br br Chinese br The modern Chinese language has the blue green distinction l n for blue and l for green however another word that predates the modern vernacular q ng is also used in many contexts The character depicts the budding of a young plant and it could be understood as verdant but the word is used to describe colors ranging from light and yellowish green through deep blue all the way to black as in xu nq ng For example the flag of the Republic of China is referred to as q ng ti n b i r m n d h ng A Blue Sky White Sun and Wholly Red Earth whereas q ngc i is the Chinese word for green vegetable referring to bok choy and the opposing sides of the game liubo were known as q ng and white in antiquity despite using black and white pieces Q ng was the traditional designation of both blue and green for much of the history of the Chinese language while l n originally referred to the dye of the indigo plant However l as a particular shade of q ng applied to cloth and clothing has been attested since the Book of Odes BC as in the title of Ode Green Upper Garment in the Airs of Bei section After the discarding of Classical Chinese in favor of modern vernacular Chinese the modern terms for blue and green are now more commonly used than q ng as standalone color terms although q ng is still part of many common noun phrases The two forms can also be encountered combined as and with q ng being used as an intensifier In modern scientific contexts q ng refers to cyan as distinguished from both blue and green br br br Japanese br br The Japanese words ao n and aoi adj the same kanji character as the Chinese q ng can refer to either blue or green depending on the situation Modern Japanese has a word for green midori but it is a relatively recent usage Ancient Japanese did not have this distinction the word midori came into use only in the Heian period and at that time and for a long time thereafter midori was still considered a shade of ao Educational materials distinguishing green and blue came into use only after World War II thus even though most Japanese consider them to be green the word ao is still used to describe certain vegetables apples and vegetation Ao is also the word used to refer to the color on a traffic light that signals drivers to go However most other objects a green car a green sweater etc will generally be called midori Japanese people also sometimes use the word gur n based on the English word green for colors The language also has several other words meaning specific shades of green and blue br br br Korean br The native Korean word pureu da may mean either blue or green or bluish green These adjectives are used for blue as in pureu n haneul blue sky or for green as in pureu n sup green forest pureu n is a noun modifying form Another word para ta usually means blue but sometimes it also means green as in para n bul green light of a traffic light There are Sino Korean expressions that refer to green and blue chorok adj n choroksaek n or for short noksaek n is used for green Cheong another expression borrowed from Chinese is mostly used for blue as in cheong baji blue jeans and Cheong Wa Dae the Blue House which is the former executive office and official residence of the President of the Republic of Korea but is also used for green as well as in cheong gwamul fruits and vegetables and cheong podo green grape br br br Tibetan br In Tibetan Wylie sngon po is the term traditionally given for the color of the sky and of grass This term also falls into the general pattern of naming colors by appending the suffix po as in mar po red ser po yellow nag po black and dkar po white Conspicuously the term for green is ljang khu likely related to ljang bu and defined as the grue sngon po sprout of wheat or barley br br br Vietnamese br Vietnamese used to colexify green and blue with the word xanh This is a colloquial rendering of thanh as with Chinese and Japanese In modern usage blue and green are dislexified Shades of blue are specifically described as xanh da tr i blue skin of sky or xanh d ng xanh n c bi n blue of ocean Green is described as xanh l c y green of leaves br Vietnamese occasionally employs the terms xanh lam blue and xanh l c green in which the second syllables is derived from the Chinese and respectively sometimes skipping the syllable xanh for blue and green respectively in formal or scientific speech Xanh can also be used singularly for any color that is the shade in between blue and green inclusively br br br Mongolian br Modern Mongolian makes a distinction between green nogoon and blue which is divided into distinct colors covering light blue tsenher and dark blue h h Historically however the blue distinction was made with the color h h inclusive of greens such as fresh grass Nogoon then became a more common term in the modern era br br br Indo European br br br Albanian br Albanian has two major words for blue kalt r refers to a light blue such as that of the sky but it is derived from Vulgar Latin calthinus itself derived from caltha a loan from Ancient Greek that meant marigold a small and in fact yellow flower The other word blu refers to a darker shade of blue and like many similar words across many European languages derives ultimately from Germanic see also Italian blu There is a separate word for green gjelb r which derives from the Latin galbinus which originally meant yellow cf German gelb the original Latin word for green on the other hand viridis is the source of the Albanian word for yellow verdh Albanian also has a borrowed word for green jeshil from Turkish ye il it tends to be used for non natural greens such as traffic signals in contrast to gjelb r br br br Baltic br br Latvian has separate words for green za and blue zils Both zils and za stem from the same Proto Indo European word for yellow ghel Several other words in Latvian have been derived from these colors namely grass is called z le from za while the name for iris is z l te from zils br The now archaic word m was used to describe both dark blue and black probably indicating that previously zils was used only for lighter shades of blue For instance blueberries are called mellenes br In Latvian black is melns in some local dialects mells br In Lithuanian alias is green m lynas is blue and ilas is gray hair or grizzled br br br Slavic br Bulgarian a South Slavic language makes a clear distinction between blue sinyo green zeleno and black cherno br In the Polish language blue niebieski from niebo sky and green zielony are treated as separate colors The word for sky blue or azure b kitny might be considered either a basic color or a shade of blue by different speakers Similarly dark blue or navy blue granatowy deriving from the name of pomegranate granat some cultivars of which are dark purplish blue in color can be considered by some speakers as a separate basic color Black czarny is completely distinguished from blue As in English Polish distinguishes pink r owy from red czerwony br The word siwy means blue gray in Polish literally color of gray hair The word siny refers to violet blue and is used to describe the color of bruises siniaki hematoma and the blue skin discoloration that can result from moderate hypothermia br Russian does not have a single word referring to the whole range of colors denoted by the English term blue Instead it traditionally treats light blue goluboy as a separate color independent from plain or dark blue siniy with all seven basic colors of the spectrum red orange yellow green goluboy sky blue light azure but does not equal cyan siniy true deep blue like synthetic ultramarine violet while in English the light blues like azure and cyan are considered mere shades of blue and not different colors The Russian word for green is zielioniy To better understand this consider that English makes a similar distinction between red and light red pink which is considered a different color and not merely a kind of red but such a distinction is unknown in several other languages for example both red h ng traditionally called and pink f n h ng lit powder red have traditionally been considered varieties of a single color in Chinese The Russian language also distinguishes between red krasniy and pink rozoviy br Similarly English language descriptions of rainbows have often distinguished between blue or turquoise and indigo the latter of which is often described as dark blue or ultramarine br The Serbo Croatian color system makes a distinction between blue green and black br br Blue plava indicates any blue and modra in the eastern speaking areas modra indicates dark blue in some of the western areas it may indicate any blue br Navy blue teget mainly in the eastern speaking areas br Ash blue sinje espetially in Dalmatia to describe sea in stormy weather sinje more br Green zelena br Black crna br Modra may also mean dark blue and dark purple that are used to describe colours of a bruise modrica Native speakers cannot pinpoint a color on the spectrum which would correspond to modra br Sinje cognate to Bulgarian sinyo and Russian siniy is archaic and denotes blue gray usually used to describe dark seas br Turquoise is usually described as tirkizna and similarly azure will use a loan word azurna There is no specific word for cyan Blond hair is called plava blue reflecting likely the archaic use of plav for any bright white blue colors like the sky br Mrko dusky can refer either dark brown less often dark gray or even black It is etymologically derived from the word for darkness mrak but is distinct from dark tamna For instance it is used to describe the brown bear mrki medved medvjed Sme e and kestenjasto refer to brown crveno means red ru i asto is for pink and naran asto designates orange br Shades are defined with a prefix e g tamno for dark or svetlo svijetlo for light for example dark blue is tamnoplavo br The Slovene language distinguishes among blue green and black br br Blue moder officially or plav vernacular is used for any blue Sometimes sinj adj sinje is also used to describe azure The word akvamarin is sometimes used for navy blue br Green zelen is related to the word zel which is derived from Proto Slavic word for herb which in turn is believed to be derived from Proto Indo European word for to shine which also described light shades of colors gold yellow and green br Black rn br Although the blue and green color are not strictly defined so Slovene speakers cannot point to a certain shade of blue or green but rather the whole spectrum of blue and green shades there is a distinction between light and dark hues of these colors which is described with prefixes svetlo light and temno dark br Transient hues between blue and green are mostly described as zeleno moder or modro zelen sometimes as turkizen turquoise Transient hues between green and yellow rumena are described as rumeno zelen or zeleno rumen br br br Celtic br The Welsh Cornish and Breton word glas is usually translated as blue however it can also refer variously to the color of the sea of grass or of silver cf Ancient Greek The word gwyrdd a borrowing from Latin viridis is the standard translation for green In traditional Welsh and related languages glas could refer to certain shades of green and gray as well as blue and llwyd could refer to various shades of gray and brown Perhaps under the influence of English Modern Welsh is trending toward the color Western scheme restricting glas to blue and using gwyrdd for green llwyd for gray and brown for brown respectively However the more traditional usage is still heard today in the Welsh word for grass glaswellt or gwelltglas and in fossilized expressions such as caseg las gray mare tir glas green land papur llwyd brown paper and even red for brown in siwgwr coch brown sugar br In Modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic the word for blue is gorm whence the name Cairngorm mountains derives a borrowing from the now obsolete Early Welsh word gwrm dark blue dusky A relic of the original meaning dusky dark brown survives in the Irish term daoine gorma Black people br br In Old and Middle Irish like in Welsh glas was a blanket term for colors ranging from green to blue to various shades of gray e g the glas of a sword the glas of stone In Modern Irish it has come to mean both various shades of green with specific reference to plant hues and gray like the sea respectively other shades of green would be referred to in Modern Irish as uaine or uaithne while liath is gray proper like a stone br Scottish Gaelic uses the term uaine for green However the dividing line between it and gorm is somewhat different than between the English green and blue with uaine signifying a light green or yellow green and gorm extending from dark blue what in English might be navy blue to include the dark green or blue green of vegetation Grass for instance is gorm rather than uaine In addition liath covers a range from light blue to light gray However the term for a green apple such as a Granny Smith would be ubhal glas br The boundary between colors varies much more than the focal point e g an island known in Breton as Enez c hlas the blue island is l le Verte the green island in French in both cases referring to the grayish green color of its bushes even though both languages distinguish green from blue br br br Romance br The Romance terms for green Catalan verd French vert Galician Italian Portuguese Romanian and Spanish verde are all from Latin viridis The terms for blue on the other hand vary Catalan blau Occitan blau French bleu and Italian blu come from a Germanic root whereas the Spanish Galician and Portuguese azul is likely to come from Arabic French bleu was in turn loaned into many other languages including English Latin itself did not have a word covering all shades of blue which may help explain these borrowings It did however recognise caeruleus dark blue sometimes greenish and lividus grayish blue like lead br French as most Romance languages makes roughly the same distinctions as English and has a specific term for each of blue bleu green vert and gray gris For all three different shades can be indicated with different compound terms none of them being considered as basic color terms bleu clair light blue bleu ciel sky blue bleu marine Navy blue bleu roi royal blue vert clair light green vert pomme literally apple green gris anthracite deep gray gris souris literally mouse gray French also uses azur for the lighter shade of blue of the sunny sky that was in turn loaned to English as azure br Catalan distinguishes blue blau from green verd and gray gris Other basic or common colors by its own right are porpra purple groc yellow carbassa or taronja orange vermell red rosa pink marr brown gris gray negre black and blanc white For all these colors except black and white it is possible to indicate different shades using clar light and fosc dark for blue though it generally is blau cel sky blue and blau mar sea blue Other words and compounds are common to indicate more elaborated shades verd llimona lemon green rosa p l lid pale pink lila lilac granat carmine ocre ocher verd oliva olive green etc Catalan actually distinguishes two reds with different and common words while vermell refers to the color of blood roig is a red tending towards yellow or the color of clay br Italian distinguishes blue blu green verde and gray grigio There are also common words for light blue e g the color of the cloudless sky azzurro and celeste and other for darker shades e g indaco indigo Azzurro the equivalent of the English azure is usually considered a separate basic color rather than a shade of blu similar to the distinction in English between red and pink Some sources even go to the point of defining blu as a darker shade of azzurro Celeste literally means the color of the sky and can be used as synonym of azzurro although it will more often be considered a less saturated hue acquamarina aquamarine literally sea water indicates an even lighter almost transparent shade of blue To indicate a mix of green and blue Italians might say verde acqua literally water green The term glauco not common in standard Italian and perceived as a literary term is used in scientific contexts esp botany to indicate a mix of blue green and gray Other similar terms are ceruleo and turchese turquoise teal they are more saturated hues especially turchese and differ in context of use the first is a literary or bureaucratic term used for example to indicate light green eyes in identity cards the second is more common in any informal speech along with the variant turchino for instance the fairy of The Adventures of Pinocchio is called fata turchina br In Portuguese the word azul means blue and the word verde means green Furthermore azul claro means light blue and azul escuro means dark blue More distinctions can be made between several hues of blue For instance azul celeste means sky blue azul marinho means navy blue and azul turquesa means turquoise blue One can also make the distinction between verde claro and verde escuro meaning light and dark green respectively and more distinctions between several qualities of green for instance verde oliva means olive green and verde esmeralda means emerald green Cyan is usually called azul celeste sky blue and verde gua meaning water green br Romanian clearly distinguishes between the colors green verde and blue albastru It also uses separate words for different hues of the same color e g light blue bleu blue albastru dark blue bleu marin or bleomarin along with a word for turquoise turcoaz and azure azur or azuriu br Similarly to French Romanian Italian and Portuguese Spanish distinguishes blue azul and green verde and has an additional term for the tone of blue visible in the sky namely celeste which is nonetheless considered a shade of blue br br br Germanic br In Old Norse the word bl r blue from proto Germanic bl waz was also used to describe black and the common word for people of African descent was thus bl menn blue black men In Swedish bl the modern word for blue was used this way until the early th century and it still is to a limited extent in modern Faroese br German and Dutch distinguish blue respectively blau and blauw and green gr n and groen very similarly to English There are compound terms for light blue hellblau and lichtblauw and darker shades of blue dunkelblau and donkerblauw In addition adjective forms of most traditional color names are inflected to match the corresponding noun s case and gender br br br Greek br The words for blue and green completely changed in the transition from Ancient Greek to Modern Greek br Ancient Greek had glauk s clear light blue contrasting with khl r s bright green for darker shades of both colors and were replaced by kuan s meaning either a dark blue or green The words had more than one modern meaning in addition to clear light blue also meant turquoise and teal green it was the typical description of the color of the goddess Athena s eyes portrayed as either gray or light blue As well as bright green was also used for acid yellow compare chlorophyll Furthermore not only meant turquoise and teal green but could mean either a dark blue or dark green or just blue adopted into English as cyan for light sky blue br Those terms changed in Byzantine Greek as seen from the insignia colors of two of Constantinople s rival popular factions Prasinoi the Greens and B Venetoi the Blues It is not known if those groups names influenced the word change or if they were named using the new color terms but whichever way it went pr sinos is a Modern Greek word for green br The ancient term for blue has become an archaic term in Modern Greek replaced by gal zios or thalass s sea colored for light blue sea blue and the recent indeclinable loan word ble from French bleu b is used for blue br In the Modern Greek language there are names for light and dark blues and greens in addition to those discussed above br br As a rule the first two words of the list are accepted as shades of blue and the rest as shades of green Also viol violet for violet blue which is however usually considered as a shade of purple rather than blue br br br Iranian br Ossetian has only one word for blue light blue and green ts h which also means gray and glaucous but it also has a separate word for green k rd ghu z literally grassy from grass The latter derives from k rd n to mow like in German Heu hau hauen to mow br Ossetian also has separate words for the following colors br br light blue rvhu z from sky br glaucous b lonhu z from pigeon a calque from Russian cf light blue pigeon also f zd ghu z from

nykhu z from f nyk ashes originating from Persian pa s nu ka or Russian cognate pesok sand br Pashto uses the word sh n to denote blue as well as green Shinkay a word derived from sh n means greenery but sh n sm n means blue sky One way to disambiguate is to ask Sh n like the sky Or sh n like plants Blue and green are however distinguished using different words in the eastern parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan due to contact with other languages br Persian words for blue include bi literally the color of water from b water for blue generally nili from nil indigo dye for deeper shades of blue such as the color of rain clouds fayruzeh turquoise stone used to describe the color of blue eyes l jvardi or l zhvardi lapis lazuli color source of the words lazuli and azure nilufari water lily color and kabud an old literary word for blue br The Persian word for green is sabz As in Sudan dark skinned people may be described as green br The color of the sky is variously described in Persian poetry using the words sabz fayruzeh nil l jvardi or nilufari literally green indigo turquoise azure or the color of water lilies For example sabz khor green stable sabz shy neh green ceiling sabz ayv n green balcony and sabz t us green peacock are poetic epithets for the sky in addition to similar compounds using the words for blue e g l jvardi saqf lapis lazuli colored roof or fayruzeh tasht turquoise bowl Moreover the words for green of Arabic origin akhzar and khazr are used for epithets of the sky or heaven such as charkh e akhzar green wheel br br br Indo Aryan br Chinalbashe an unclassified Indo Aryan language Chambyali a Western Pahari language have the same term for blue green i e Takri ISO n l br Other Indo Aryan languages distinguish blue from green In Urdu blue is n l

is sabuj br br br Niger Congo A br In Yoruba there are only three fundamental terms for colors one of them the word d d is used for the word black and colors such as blue green purple and grey In modern times unique terms for the colors are formed based on descriptive markers or English loan words w ew color of the leaves is used for green while b l from English blue or w ar color of dye is used for blue br br br Niger Congo B Bantu br br br isiZulu and isiXhosa br Zulu and Xhosa use the word luhlaza the prefix changes according to the class of the noun for blue green Speakers of the two mutually intelligible languages can add a descriptive word after the colour term to differentiate between the two colours i e lu hlaza okwesibhakabhaka meaning like the sky or lu hlaza okwotshani meaning like grass br br br Kiswahili br The Swahili word for blue is buluu which is derived directly from English and has been in the language for a relatively short time For other colors Swahili uses either rangi ya the color of or a shortened version a For example green is rangi ya kijani or rangi ya majani the color of grass leaves Sky blue is rangi ya samawati the color of the sky from the Arabic word for sky sam plural sam w t These examples can be written as a kijani a majani a samwati br br br OtjiHimba br The Himba people use a single word for shades of green and blue buru They curiously have only three other color names thus their limited color perception has both aroused interest in anthropologists who have studied this phenomenon br br br Setswana br Tswana uses the same word tala to refer to both blue and green One has to deduce from the context and prior knowledge of what is being talked about to be able to pinpoint exactly the color in question br br br Northern Caucasus languages br In the language Tsakhur not only are blue and green distinguished but also turquoise br br br Pama Nyungan languages br br br Eastern Arrernte br In Eastern Arrernte the words atherrke and atherrke atherrke both can be used to refer to the colour green including some shades of blue and yellow Additionally atherrke can also be used as a noun to refer to grass and other small plants br br br Other European languages br br br Basque br The Basque language has three native color words derived from ur water Urdin is nowadays used in most cases for blue Ubel originally meant flash flood and with respect to colors refers to bruises Begi ubela would be translated into English by a black and blue eye But in Basque unlike English ubel remains in use after the hit skin has lost its purple color and become pale why this word is used for both purple in particular and pale hue in general Uher originally meant dirty still water or rusty it is used for gray or sienna tones and more generally for dark colors Green is usually expressed with the loan word berde from Spanish verde French vert The authenticity of the less common Basque terms for green h orlegi and musker is disputed br br br Uralic br Finnish makes a distinction between vihre green and sininen blue Turquoise or teal turkoosi or sinivihre is considered to be a separate intermediate color between green and blue and musta black is also differentiated from blue br The name for blue sininen is shared with other Finnic languages Cognates of the root are also found in the Mordvinic languages and it is thus dated even beyond the era of the Proto Finnic language c years old It appears similar to a word found in the Slavic languages Russian siniy but there is no consensus that there would be a relationship see Proto Finnic sini Proto Slavic si The word vihre viher archaic viheri viheri inen is related to vehre verdant and vihanta green and viha hate originally poison It is not shared with Estonian in which it is roheline probably related with the Estonian word rohi grass However the form viha does have correspondences in related languages as far as Permic languages where it means not only poison but bile or green or yellow It has been originally loaned from an Indo Iranian protolanguage and is related to Latin virus poison Furthermore the word musta black is also of Finnic origin br The differentiation of several colors by hue is at least Finnic a major subgroup of Uralic in origin Before this only red punainen was clearly distinguished by hue with other colors described in terms of brightness valkea vs musta using non color adjectives for further specificity Alternatively it appears that the distinction between valkea and musta was in fact clean shining vs dirty murky The original meaning of sini was possibly either black dark or green Mauno Koski s theory is that dark colors of high saturation both blue and green would be sini while shades of color with low saturation such as dark brown or black would be musta Although it is theorized that originally vihre was not a true color name and was used to describe plants only the occurrence of vihre or viha as a name of a color in several related languages shows that it was probably polysemic meaning both green and verdant already in early Baltic Finnic However whatever the case with these theories differentiation of blue and green must be at least as old as the Baltic Finnic languages br Hungarian makes the distinction between green z ld and blue k k and also distinguishes black fekete Intermediate colors between green and blue are commonly referred to as z ldesk k literally greenish blue or k kesz ld bluish green but names for specific colors in this continuum like turquoise t rkiz also exist Particular shades of a color can also have separate names such as azure az r br br br Turkic br br br Kazakh br The Kazakh language like many Turkic languages distinguishes between k k for blue and jas l for green In Kazakh many adjectival variations can be found referring to perceived gradations in saturation level of blue such as k gildir k kshil and k kboz which respectively denominate the gradual decrease in the intensity k kboz being often used as a color referent in its own right K k is occasionally used to denote green plants e g k k sh p but such usage is mostly confined to poetic utterances or certain localized dialects br br br Tuvan br Before the standardization and mongolization of the Tuvan language many centuries ago Tuvans used the word k k from the Proto Turkic k k blue celestial for both blue and green To distinguish the color green from blue they used to name it sug k k water blue no matter how strange it may sound Although note that k k was used for green primarily they used sug k k only if they needed to Thus blue was k k and green was k k sug k k However the dark hues of both colors can be named similarly as k k even nowadays br Over time due to the diversity of the country Tuva being at the border of different major tribes both Turkic and Mongol the green color was named differently from one area to another In some parts Tuvans used chazhyl green in the majority of the Turkic languages other parts used the Mongol nogoon the rest used the traditional k k sug kok br Under the influence of the Mongol Empire and due to the need to standardize the language at the beginning of the th century the word green became nogoon from the Mongolian green The linguists who were responsible for the standardization had to take into account two factors the Mongolization of the language and the lack of the word for green They decided to use the Mongolian word for green because they wanted to implicate the Mongol legacy in the lexicon br Hence today in the standardized Tuvan language blue and green are named differently but it led to the following controversies br br The problem with nogoon is that it is purely symbolic and not a natural thing br The color was named after a foreign non Turkic word br Not choosing the obvious Turkic chazhyl which was already used in Western parts of Tuva br The new naming of the green color was done in the th century which was subjectively recent Also the realization of the innovation was performed forcibly also touching the previous point by making the people to switch from chazhyl to nogoon br Nowadays the Blue green distinction topic is quite forgotten people are used to the usage of nogoon In general Mongolisms in the lexicon of the Tuvan language are not considered unusual br
