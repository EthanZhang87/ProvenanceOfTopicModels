Color analysis American English colour analysis in Commonwealth English also known as personal color analysis PCA seasonal color analysis or skin tone matching is a term often used within the cosmetics and fashion industry to describe a method of determining the colors of clothing makeup hair style that harmonizes with a person s skin complexion eye color and hair color for use in wardrobe planning and style consulting br The theory was first developed by Bernice Kentner and Carole Jackson br br br Background br In the s a color revolution occurred in the United States with the development of new color industries and the possibility of producing color swatch books used as a marketing tool Personal color analysis reached a height in popularity in the early s with a recent resurgence in the s after further development and promotion of different versions of seasonal analysis by image and color consultants worldwide Seasonal analysis is a technique that attempts to place individual coloring into the tonal groupings of Winter Spring Summer and Autumn and their sub variants However the approach can vary greatly among different schools of thought Some color analysis systems classify an individual s personal combination of hair color eye color and skin tone using labels that refer to a color s temperature cool blue vs warm yellow and the degree to which the hair skin and eye colors contrast Cosmetic colors are often determined by hair or eye color alone br The successful practical application of a color analysis will theoretically allow the individual to coordinate their clothing and accessories with greater ease and avoid costly mistakes by purchasing items that are not within their color palette However color analysis has continued to be controversial due to the lack of standard training or degree required to market oneself as a color analyst This can become costly for the individual both in regard to the fees of professional and less than professional analyses and subsequent clothing and cosmetics purchases br br br History br br br Early history s early s br br br Chevreul br Michel Eug ne Chevreul was a French chemist whose career took a new direction in when he was appointed director of dyeing at the Gobelins Manufactory in Paris where he worked for years After receiving several complaints about the lack of consistency in the dye colors Chevreul determined that the issue was not chemical but optical and focused his attention on exploring optical color mixing He published his groundbreaking findings in The Laws of Contrast of Colour where he discussed the concept of simultaneous contrast the colors of two different objects affect each other successive contrast a negative afterimage effect and mixed contrast br Chevreul s studies in color became the most widely used and influential color manual of the th century with a significant and long lasting impact on the fine and industrial arts As well as being the first to create a hemispherical color model displaying normal tone hue scales his exploration of color harmonies is an underlying principle in personal color analysis In the s Chevreul s ideas were prescribed for an American audience lacking any education in color harmony Godey s Lady s Book and introduced gaudy American women to Chevreul s idea of becoming colors for brunettes and blondes br br br Munsell br Albert Henry Munsell is famous for inventing the Munsell color system one of the first color order systems created An American painter and art teacher at the Massachusetts Normal Art School he had visited the tapestry works of Chevreul and studied color in France With the use of his own unique inventions including the Photometer that measures object luminance Munsell started to determine color spaces and standardize the way color was organized and defined br In Munsell published his first of three books on color A Color Notation where he discussed his color theory referencing three color dimensions hue the discernible shade on the wavelength spectrum value lightness to darkness scale and chroma softness through to brightness Before the Munsell Color Theory the intensity of color was defined as saturation in the art and scientific community Munsell determined that saturation encompassed two different dimensions value and chroma where chroma defines the difference between a pure hue and a pure grey br Munsell paid close attention to the human visual system and human response to color being sensitive to its inclusion in his mapping of three dimensional color space In Munsell founded the Munsell Color Company to improve color communication and education In the s the Munsell Color System was adopted by the USDA as the official color system for soil research and the system The company is now owned by X Rite who is known for color calibration The Munsell Color System still remains the basis of color education today and is the foundation for modern color systems including CIELAB br br br Itten br Johannes Itten was a Swiss born artist and art educator who expounded upon the principles of simultaneous contrast which Chevreul set forth in his treatise He valued individual artistic expression and in while teaching a class assignment on color harmony he noticed his students were choosing colors lines and orientation that showed themselves as they are which led him to formulate the concept of subjective color br In his book The Art of Color Itten examined two different approaches to understanding the art of color Subjective feelings and objective color principles Itten described subjective color as the aura of the person and provided examples or how subjective color might be expressed by an artist A high contrast brunette will choose dark colors and high contrast suggesting a lively and concentrated personality and intense feeling On the other hand for a fair woman of low contrast the fundamental contrast is hue Furthermore Itten linked these subjective colors to the four seasons of Spring Summer Autumn and Winter which became the foundation for seasonal color analysis In his book Itten noted that Every woman should know what colors are becoming to her they will always be her subjective colors and their complements br Itten believed that subjective colors were of a lower artistic value and significance than what he deemed objective colors which were color harmonies of a higher order In his final chapter titled Composition Itten spoke of bringing two or more colors together in such a way that they harmonize to give an expression unambiguous and full of character br br br Dorr br Robert C Dorr was an American artist who in observed the harmonious effects of paint colors when grouping those of either a blue or yellow undertone In Chicago Dorr began working on furniture design using his own color theory of undertones and developed his ideas on color psychology After working on a textile group for a manufacturer he became a professional color consultant for cosmetic companies br Dorr s Color Key System defined an individual s complexion as being either Key I cool blue undertone or Key II warm yellow undertone Each palette in The Color Key Program contain colors per fan Orange and magenta are the color indicants of yellow and blue undertones respectively Dorr s Color Key Program took all races into consideration and no race was limited to any one Key palette br After moving to California in the late s Dorr taught courses and gave lectures on his Color Key Program until his death in The color company Devoe Reynolds developed paint chips using their Key Key color matching system from Robert Dorr br br br Caygill br Suzanne Caygill was an American fashion designer and color theorist who developed the Caygill Method of Color Analysis A milliner poet dress designer and night club singer as a young adult Caygill turned her attention to color in and devoted the rest of her life to creating individual style guides and color palettes for clients and teaching design seminars Caygill may have been influenced by her association with Edith Head wardrobe designer and consultant to Hollywood studios and stars br In the s Caygill starred in a self improvement television program on fashion and relationships Living With Suzanne which aired on CBS in Los Angeles and began to teach seminars in which she described her work on style personality line and color Many devotees attended her classes adapted and popularized her theories of personality style and color analysis in the late s and s br In she published Color The Essence of You and established the Academy of Color In this book Caygill identified a wide range of sub groups within each season and gave them descriptive names such as Early Spring Metallic Autumn or Dynamic Winter each with its own set of special characteristics Caygill believed in the fundamental link between style color and a person s personality The Suzanne Caygill Papers circa are held within the Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections Cornell University Library Cornell University br br br Seasonal skin tone color matching for clothing and cosmetics br Starting in the s the availability of high quality accurate and inexpensive color printing made it possible for the first time to produce books for the mass market in which skin tones and clothing colors could be accurately reproduced Color reproduction technology was still not perfect causing Carole Jackson to warn her readers Because it is difficult to print the color swatches percent accurately verbal descriptions will help you understand the concept of your colors when you shop for clothes The result was the near simultaneous publication by a number of authors of books proposing systems of color analysis designed to allow the reader to discover which shades of color in clothes complement your natural coloring to look healthier sexier and more powerful br The authors of these books all present roughly similar ideas Most agree for example on the following basic points br br Most rely upon a color system in which the colors are divided into four groups of harmonious colors which are said to match with the four seasons of the year The seasons are to some degree arbitrary and it sometimes happens that someone will be on the cusp of two seasons But as Carole Jackson insists with testing one palette will prove to be better more harmonious than the other Jackson also acknowledges however that the reference to the four seasons is nothing more than a convenient artifice We could call your coloring Type A Type B and so on but comparison with the seasons provides a more poetic way to describe your coloring and your best colors br An individual s basic color category or season remains the same over their lifetime and is not affected by tanning because w e still have the same color skin but in a darker hue br Skin color rather than hair or eye color determines a person s season Bernice Kentner warns Remember do not rely on hair coloring to find your Season br br br s br In the s the concept received renewed attention becoming a viral phenomenon and drawing what the New York Times in called views and exasperation on TikTok br br br Color psychology br Color psychology an extension of color analysis is a tool used in conjunction with the analysis of colors br br br Bibliography br Deborah Chase The Medically Based No Nonsense Beauty Book br Bernice Kentner Color Me a Season br Carole
