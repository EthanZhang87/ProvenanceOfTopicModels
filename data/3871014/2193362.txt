title: Chromophore
id: 2193362
A chromophore is a molecule which absorbs light at a particular wavelength and emits color as a result Chromophores are commonly referred to as colored molecules for this reason The word is derived from Ancient Greek chroma color and phoros carrier of Many molecules in nature are chromophores including chlorophyll the molecule responsible for the green colors of leaves br The color that is seen by our eyes is that of the light not absorbed by the reflecting object within a certain wavelength spectrum of visible light The chromophore indicates a region in the molecule where the energy difference between two separate molecular orbitals falls within the range of the visible spectrum or in informal contexts the spectrum under scrutiny Visible light that hits the chromophore can thus be absorbed by exciting an electron from its ground state into an excited state In biological molecules that serve to capture or detect light energy the chromophore is the moiety that causes a conformational change in the molecule when hit by light br br br Conjugated pi bond system chromophores br br Just like how two adjacent p orbitals in a molecule will form a pi bond three or more adjacent p orbitals in a molecule can form a conjugated pi system In a conjugated pi system electrons are able to capture certain photons as the electrons resonate along a certain distance of p orbitals similar to how a radio antenna detects photons along its length Typically the more conjugated longer the pi system is the longer the wavelength of photon can be captured In other words with every added adjacent double bond we see in a molecule diagram we can predict the system will be progressively more likely to appear yellow to our eyes as it is less likely to absorb yellow light and more likely to absorb red light Conjugated systems of fewer than eight conjugated double bonds absorb only in the ultraviolet region and are colorless to the human eye Compounds that are blue or green typically do not rely on conjugated double bonds alone br In the conjugated chromophores the electrons jump between energy levels that are extended pi orbitals created by electron clouds like those in aromatic systems Common examples include retinal used in the eye to detect light various food colorings fabric dyes azo compounds pH indicators lycopene carotene and anthocyanins Various factors in a chromophore s structure go into determining at what wavelength region in a spectrum the chromophore will absorb Lengthening or extending a conjugated system with more unsaturated multiple bonds in a molecule will tend to shift absorption to longer wavelengths Woodward Fieser rules can be used to approximate ultraviolet visible maximum absorption wavelength in organic compounds with conjugated pi bond systems br Some of these are metal complex chromophores which contain a metal in a coordination complex with ligands Examples are chlorophyll which is used by plants for photosynthesis and hemoglobin the oxygen transporter in the blood of vertebrate animals In these two examples a metal is complexed at the center of a tetrapyrrole macrocycle ring the metal being iron in the heme group iron in a porphyrin ring of hemoglobin or magnesium complexed in a chlorin type ring in the case of chlorophyll The highly conjugated pi bonding system of the macrocycle ring absorbs visible light The nature of the central metal can also influence the absorption spectrum of the metal macrocycle complex or properties such as excited state lifetime The tetrapyrrole moiety in organic compounds which is not macrocyclic but still has a conjugated pi bond system still acts as a chromophore Examples of such compounds include bilirubin and urobilin which exhibit a yellow color br br br Auxochrome br An auxochrome is a functional group of atoms attached to the chromophore which modifies the ability of the chromophore to absorb light altering the wavelength or intensity of the absorption br br br Halochromism br br Halochromism occurs when a substance changes color as the pH changes This is a property of pH indicators whose molecular structure changes upon certain changes in the surrounding pH This change in structure affects a chromophore in the pH indicator molecule For example phenolphthalein is a pH indicator whose structure changes as pH changes as shown in the following table br br In a pH range of about the molecule has three aromatic rings all bonded to a tetrahedral sp hybridized carbon atom in the middle which does not make the bonding in the aromatic rings conjugate Because of their limited extent the aromatic rings only absorb light in the ultraviolet region and so the compound appears colorless in the pH range However as the pH increases beyond that central carbon becomes part of a double bond becoming sp hybridized and leaving a p orbital to overlap with the bonding in the rings This makes the three rings conjugate together to form an extended chromophore absorbing longer wavelength visible light to show a fuchsia color At pH ranges outside other molecular structure changes result in other color changes see Phenolphthalein details br br br Common chromophore
