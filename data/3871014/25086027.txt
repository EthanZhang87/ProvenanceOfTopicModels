October br br br Controversies br br br Nottingham Two br br On May Hicham Yezza a member of staff and Rizwaan Sabir a postgraduate student were arrested at the University of Nottingham and were detained for six days under the Terrorism Act The university informed the police after finding an edited version of the al Qaeda training manual the student was using for his research Both were released without charge from terrorism offences In September Rizwaan Sabir was awarded compensation for false imprisonment by Nottinghamshire Police br The university came under criticism after the only professor involved in terrorism studies at the institution Rod Thornton decided that because of the university s lack of guidance to him regarding their position over possession of terrorist publications he was no longer willing to risk possible arrest by teaching terrorism studies at the university although he would continue in his other responsibilities As a result terrorism studies are no longer being taught at the University of Nottingham br For a conference of the British International Studies Association Thornton prepared a paper which alleged the university had engaged in systematic persecution against Yezza Sabir and junior academics in the department One of Thornton s colleagues at Nottingham complained to BISA about alleged defamatory content of Thornton s paper and a spokesman for the university called it highly defamatory of a number of his colleagues The paper was later removed from BISA s website br In early May Thornton was suspended by the university for the breakdown in working relationships caused by the paper In an open letter published in The Guardian international researchers including Noam Chomsky asked for Thornton s reinstatement and an independent examination of the university s actions saying that Thornton s paper carefully details what appear to be examples of serious misconduct from senior university management over the arrest of two university members br In a campaign was launched calling for the reinstatement of Rod Thornton and for a public inquiry into the university s actions In March it was announced that Thornton was leaving his job as a lecturer at Nottingham and that for his part Dr Thornton accepts that the article which he published on the BISA website in April contained a number of inaccuracies Thornton apologized for any offence he might have caused br br br COVID pandemic response br In the academic year students of the University of Nottingham organised large scale campaigning against the university management team and specifically the Vice Chancellor Shearer West for wider academic welfare and financial support for students due to the on going COVID pandemic br As of February the university administration initiated a safety net policy for a variety of assignment types in partial compliance with student demands However demands for a wider university policy to support students with welfare support have yet to be made with further complaints arising due to minimal financial support being provided to home students and additional issues arising for international students resulting in a number of go fund me pages being created to help international students pay their tuition br Student campaigners are yet to comment on the development of this situation br br br Attitudes towards Catholicism br At the start of the academic year Patrick McKinney Bishop of Nottingham appointed Fr David Palmer to position of Catholic Chaplain to the university The university actively blocked his appointment on the basis of his views on abortion and euthanasia This triggered mass international criticism including from Ann Furedi a former chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service with strongly pro choice views who described the decision as stupid and stated I disagree with his views on abortion but as a Catholic priest he s expressing a mainstream Catholic view Universities can t tell chaplains what religious beliefs to express br Fr Palmer s criticism of abortion and euthanasia were entirely in line with the Catholic Church s teaching br The university are yet to comment on the development of this situation or the media coverage which it has generated br br br June stabbings br br On June Grace O Malley Kumar and Barnaby Webber two year old first year students of the university were fatally stabbed in the early hours of the morning The assailant was charged with three murders including Ian Coates a maintenance man aged taking his van which was used to impact three pedestrians resulting in an additional three attempted murder charges The attacker graduated from the University of Nottingham in br In January the attacker plead guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to indefinite detention in a high security hospital Due to pressure from the families of the victims together with the involvement of Caroline Henry the
