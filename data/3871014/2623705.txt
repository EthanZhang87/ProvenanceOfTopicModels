Ireland with many of them settling in New York Irish nationalists in New York soon made efforts to organize a military unit in order to assist in efforts to gain Irish independence from Britain In late Irish Americans in the city organized several independent military companies holding drills at the Center Market By mid an undermanned st Irish Regiment had been formed from the independent companies which the th traces its lineage to Irish nationalist Michael Doheny who had fled to the U S following the failure of the Young Ireland rebellion was instrumental in the establishment of the independent companies and served as a company commander in the st Irish Regiment In Irish American leaders in New York City convinced the state government to establishment a U S Army regiment drawn from the independent companies On December their proposals were adopted by the state government Doheny Richard O Gorman and James Huston all of whom had participated in the Young Ireland rebellion and Michael Phelan who had not all supported Irish Americans enlisting in the New York State Militia with the hopes that this training would be useful in future Irish nationalist activities As a result the original th Regiment established in was disbanded on May and its companies transferred to the th Regiment Two days later on May the st Irish Regiment was mustered into the New York State Militia as the th Regiment with Colonel Benjamin Clinton Ferris as its commander br The nd Irish Regiment was organized on October and mustered into the New York State Militia on November as the th Regiment Doheny left the th and enlisted in the th at the rank of lieutenant colonel In May the nd Regiment was established on Long Island Thomas Francis Meagher another leader of the Young Ireland rebellion escaped to New York in Doheny then began to organize another Irish American regiment with Meagher as the regimental commander Doheny subsequently left the th and became the lieutenant colonel of the new regiment designed as the th Regiment and formed from new and existing independent companies as the Republican Rifles Since Meagher was rarely in New York Doheny served as de facto commander of the th By the summer of the three Irish American regiments had reached maximum strength and their commanders moved between the regiments throughout the s Captain James Huston left the th to join the th as did Doheny Meagher was appointed lieutenant colonel of the th in but declined the position as he was not a U S citizen The three regiments co existed until late when all three were merged into the th the th Regiment ceased to exist until when it was re organized once again br br br Tensions in New York City br br The new Irish Catholic regiments caused uneasiness among the nativist Know Nothing Party whose membership was limited to White Anglo Saxon Protestants In nativists in New York formed a new militia regiment designated the st Regiment the American Guard commanded by Colonel Vosburg until he died in Although the th and the st represented opposite views and had no contact during the s they became close in when both were stationed in Washington D C prior to the First Battle of Bull Run Within the th Regiment Huston led a secret society of Irish revolutionaries known as the SF Academic Patrick D Flaherty claimed that the SF stood for Silent Friends in a book though military historian J C P Stokes claimed it instead stood for Sinn Feins in a letter br The outbreak of the Crimean War in was perceived as an opportunity for Irish nationalists to strike against Britain but disputes between Huston and Doheny led to a lack of action Huston left the th but conflicts continued Although radical Irish societies were formed all attempts to strike a blow for Ireland failed Conflicts between Archbishop Hughes and the Irish Revolutionary leaders further exacerbated the situation In racial religious and political tension was high in New York City In January prominent Bowery Boys gang leader William Poole was killed Two Irishmen were arrested for the crime The Know Nothings tried to stir up anti Catholic sentiment and there were several riots and both the th and the th were called to restore order It was decided that military units would not march in the city s St Patrick s Day Parade due to the ongoing tensions On St Patrick s Day the th th th and th Regiments were held at the parade ground to await orders rather than march in the parade As soon as the th was released they marched with fixed bayonets down Broadway through the park before they were dismissed The other military units did not march Other U S states eliminated ethnic oriented militias in the s because of similar tensions By the only Irish regiment remaining would be the th br A new Irish secret society called the Fenians arose Although not powerful within the th they were extremely so within the th After the consolidation with the th in the th adopted the th name of National Cadets The Fenians were founded as the Irish Revolutionary Brotherhood in by James Stephens a leader of the Revolt Michael Corcoran was second in command At the outbreak of the Civil War Corcoran commanded the th Regiment and was also the head of the Fenians As their leader he advised the Fenian membership not to join the militia br br br The Prince of Wales Parade br In Michael Corcoran was appointed as colonel of the th He gained fame and notoriety when he refused to parade the regiment for the visiting Prince of Wales in protest against British rule in Ireland He was removed from command but a planned court martial against him was dropped when the American Civil War broke out During the Civil War Irish Americans leaders organized fundraising activities for the Union Army Michael Phalen an SF leader within the th and Richard O Gorman raised funds for families of soldiers from the th wounded at Bull Run in Huston was killed at Gettysburg in Meagher returned from Bull Run to form the new Irish Brigade Corcoran captured at Bull Run returned to New York and formed another Irish Brigade called Corcoran s Legion Doheny died in In the early s he had stopped believing that Irish units should be organized within the militia system since it created a conflict of allegiances br br br The Civil War br br The th Infantry Regiment traces its Civil War honors through

Lieutenant Colonel George Patton s st Provisional Tank Brigade later redesignated the th Tank Brigade Many days of marches through the rain brought the th to the jump off point by September but the

while suffering KIA and reached its objective of St Benoit on September br br br Meuse Argonne br Its final exploits came when the nd Division relieved the st Infantry Division during the rd phase of the Meuse Argonne offensive Attacking against a well entrenched enemy in terrible terrain without support from units on its flanks the regiment suffered heavy casualties while moving forward and

battalions were Jews one lieutenant was born in Germany and another lieutenant was a full blooded Choctaw from Oklahoma br During World War I total casualties of the regiment amounted to killed in action and wounded of whom would later die of their wounds during days of front line combat One member of the regiment killed in World War I was Daniel Buckley who survived the sinking of the RMS Titanic in Sixty members earned the Distinguished Service Cross and three of its members were awarded the Medal of Honor including its famed st Battalion and later regimental commander William Joseph Donovan Colonel Donovan went on to organize the Office of Strategic Services OSS in World War II retiring as a major general br It also produced Father Francis Duffy The Fighting Chaplain In France Duffy was always seen in the thick of battle assisting the litter bearers in recovering the wounded administering last rites burying the dead and encouraging the men while unarmed and at great risk to his own life His bravery and inspired leadership were so great that at one point the brigade commander Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur even considered making him the regimental commander an unheard of role for a chaplain br With the New York National Guard federalized during the war a new state force the New York Guard was organized in in order to have militia troops available if needed by the Governor of New York under the New York State Constitution As part of this a replacement th Infantry Regiment was created On January the th Infantry Regiment was consolidated with the th

Oahu in October to begin training for the November landings on Butaritari Island of Makin Atoll part of the Gilbert Islands There it was supplemented with artillery and armor to become the th Regimental Combat Team The regiment s first and third infantry battalions would land on the western Red Beach which was expected to be the most heavily defended and the second battalion would land on the Northern Yellow beach to trap the defenders from behind The Japanese kept their forces near the northern beach so resistance on Red beach was minimal Despite this Col Gardiner Conroy commander of the regiment was killed there as he directed tanks to support the infantrymen The second battalion landings were more difficult due to the enemy presence and the need to wade in from yards out due to the limitations of the Higgins boats in the shallow water but by noon the beach was secure On November the regiment secured Butaritari Village and endured a Banzai charge that night The regiment continued to sweep across the island and by mid morning on November the signal Makin Taken was sent br Writer and Army historian S L A Marshall was attached to the th Infantry Division for the

of Kadena airfield on April with the Marine st and th Divisions sweeping northeast and the Army th Division moving south along the eastern coast and the th Division moving south down the center of the island The Fighting th as part of the th Division again served as a floating reserve The Marines encountered little resistance and the two Army divisions moved rapidly south until they ran headlong into the previously unknown and very strong Manchinato line on April When they were repulsed with heavy casualties the th Division was added to their right flank along the west coast to be part of a coordinated assault that began on April The Fighting th formed the right side of the division and corps line along the western coast and fought its way south br The terrain and defense were formidable Numerous ridges tunnels and prepared pillboxes were used by the enemy in a tenacious defense It took heavy and continuous fighting by the two battalions until April to secure the Manchinato Airfield During this engagement the actions of F Company in overcoming obstacles while extremely outnumbered and cut off resulted in a Distinguished Unit Citation and its being written up as a staff study on small unit effectiveness Sgt then Pfc Alejandro R Ruiz was awarded the Medal of Honor for actions while serving with A Company on the ridge br Following the assault and capture of this key defensive line the exhausted XXIV Army Corps was relieved on May by the two Marine divisions and the th and th Infantry Divisions for the next assault southward The th Division with the Fighting Sixty Ninth then assumed the duties of the two Marine Divisions in securing the relatively calmer north end of the island The enemy fought bitterly on Onnatake Hill from May until June before losing the strong

MacArthur gave the following address to members and veterans of the th at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City via short wave radio from Manila in the Philippines on January br br No greater fighting regiment has ever existed than the One Hundred and Sixty fifth Infantry of the Rainbow Division formed from the old Sixty ninth Regiment of New York I cannot tell you how real and how sincere a pleasure I feel tonight in once more addressing the members of that famous unit You need no eulogy from me or from any other man You have written your own history and written it in red on your enemies breast but when I think of your patience under adversity your courage under fire and your modesty in victory I am filled with an emotion of admiration I cannot express You have carved your own statue upon the hearts of your people you have built your own monument in the memory of your compatriots br One of the most outstanding characteristics of the regiment was its deep sense of religious responsibility inculcated by one of my most beloved friends Father Duffy He gave you a code that embraces the highest moral laws that will stand the test of any ethics or philosophies ever promulgated for the uplift of man Its requirements are for the things that are right and its restraints are from the things that are wrong br The soldier above all men is required to perform the highest act of religious teaching sacrifice However horrible the results of war may be the soldier who is called upon to offer and perchance to give his life for his country is the noblest development of mankind No physical courage and no brute instincts can take the place of the divine annunciation and spiritual uplift which will alone sustain him Father Duffy on those bloody fields of France we all remember so well taught the men of your regiment how to die that a nation might live how to die unquestioning and uncomplaining with faith in their hearts and the hope on their lips that we might go on to victory br Somewhere in your banquet hall tonight his noble spirit looks down to bless and guide you young soldiers on the narrow path marked with West Point s famous motto duty honor country br We ll hope

Irish Parliament on June with a tribute to the gallantry of the Fighting th br br The th day of December will be a day long remembered in American history At Fredericksburg Virginia thousands of men fought and died on one of the bloodiest battlefields of the American Civil War One of the most brilliant stories of that day was written by a band of men who went into battle wearing a green sprig in their hats They bore a proud heritage and a special courage given to those who had long fought for the cause of freedom I am referring of course to the Irish Brigade General Robert E Lee the great military leader of the Southern Confederate Forces said of this group of men after the battle The gallant stand which this bold brigade made on the heights of Fredericksburg is well known Never were men so brave They ennobled their race by their splendid gallantry on that desperate occasion Their brilliant though hopeless assaults on our lines excited the hearty applause of our officers and soldiers br Of the men who took part in that assault survived the battle The Irish Brigade was led into battle on that occasion by Brig Gen Thomas F Meagher who had participated in the unsuccessful Irish uprising of was captured by the British and sent in a prison ship to Australia from whence he finally came to America In the fall of after serving with distinction and gallantry in some of the toughest fighting of this most bloody struggle the Irish Brigade was presented with a new set of flags In the city ceremony the city chamberlain gave them the motto The Union our Country and Ireland forever Their old ones having been torn to shreds in previous battles Capt Richard McGee took possession of these flags on December nd in New York City and arrived with them at the Battle of Fredericksburg and carried them in the battle Today in recognition of what these gallant Irishmen and what millions of other Irish have done for my country and through the generosity of the Fighting th I would like to present one of these flags to the people of Ireland br The flag presented by Kennedy is displayed in Leinster House Dublin br br br Ireland memorial br br Michael Bloomberg the

inscribed with scenes of Corcoran s life Beside the gray stone base is a small chamber set flush with the ground that contains a piece of steel from the World Trade Center donated by the parents of firefighter Michael Lynch who perished in the attack br In his remarks that day Bloomberg said br br Brigadier General Michael Corcoran became one of the Civil War s most revered heroes When he returned to New York City after months of captivity in the South enormous crowds thronged him in a parade up Broadway to New York s City Hall When he died his body lay in state in our City Hall just down the corridor from my desk and people came from far and wide to pay their last respects His successor as commander of the th was a fellow Irishman the legendary Thomas Francis Meagher At Meagher s funeral mass in New York City his eulogist said Never forget this he gave all lost all for the land of his birth He risked all for the land of his adoption was her true and loyal soldier and in the end died in her service br So it could be said for much of the Irish Brigade And although the th suffered terrible casualties in the Civil War its tradition of valor and its connection to Ireland lived on When the Fighting th was re activated for World War I about of the men who joined the regiment were Irish Their chaplain Father Francis Duffy said the rest of the men were Irish by adoption Irish by association or Irish by conviction Today the th is as diverse as New York City itself but Father Duffy s words still hold true br In a follow up to this visit Mayor Bloomberg invited members
