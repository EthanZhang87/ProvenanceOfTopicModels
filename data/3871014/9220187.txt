Lightness is a visual perception of the luminance br br br br br L br br br br displaystyle L br br of an object It is often judged relative to a similarly lit object In colorimetry and color appearance models lightness is a prediction of how an illuminated color will appear to a standard observer While luminance is a linear measurement of light lightness is a linear prediction of the human perception of that light br This distinction is meaningful because human vision s lightness perception is non linear relative to light Doubling the quantity of light does not result in a doubling in perceived lightness only a modest increase br The symbol for perceptual lightness is usually either br br br br J br br br displaystyle J br br as used in CIECAM or br br br br br L br br br br br br br displaystyle L br br as used in CIELAB and CIELUV br br br br br L br br br br br br br displaystyle L br br Lstar is not to be confused with br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br as used for luminance In some color ordering systems such as Munsell Lightness is referenced as value br Chiaroscuro and Tenebrism both take advantage of dramatic contrasts of value to heighten drama in art Artists may also employ shading subtle manipulation of value br br br Lightness in different colorspaces br br In some colorspaces or color systems such as Munsell HCL and CIELAB the lightness value achromatically constrains the maximum and minimum limits and operates independently of the hue and chroma For example Munsell value is pure black and value is pure white Colors with a discernible hue must therefore have values in between these extremes br In a subtractive color model e g paint dye or ink lightness changes to a color through various tints shades or tones can be achieved by adding white black or grey respectively This also reduces saturation br In HSL and HSV the displayed luminance is relative to the hue and chroma for a given lightness value in other words the selected lightness value does not predict the actual displayed luminance nor the perception thereof Both systems use coordinate triples where many triples can map onto the same color br In HSV all triples with value are pure black If the hue and saturation are held constant then increasing the value increases the luminance such that a value of is the lightest color with the given hue and saturation HSL is similar except that all triples with lightness are pure white In both models all pure saturated colors indicate the same lightness or value but this does not relate to the displayed luminance which is determined by the hue I e yellow is higher luminance than blue even if the lightness value is set at a given number br While HSL HSV and similar spaces serve well enough to choose or adjust a single color they are not perceptually uniform They trade off accuracy for computational simplicity as they were created in an era where computer technology was restricted in performance br If we take an image and extract the hue saturation and lightness or value components for a given color space we will see that they may differ substantially from a different color space or model For example examine the following images of a fire breather fig The original is in the sRGB color space CIELAB br br br br br L br br br br br br br displaystyle L br br is a perceptually uniform

non linear lightness br br br br br L br br br br br br br displaystyle L br br HSL br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br and HSV br br br br V br br br displaystyle V br br are neither perceptually uniform nor uniform as to luminance br br br Relationship to value and relative luminance br The Munsell value has long been used as a perceptually uniform lightness scale A question of interest is the relationship between the Munsell value scale and the relative luminance Aware of the Weber Fechner law Albert Munsell remarked Should we use a logarithmic curve or curve of squares Neither option turned out to be quite correct scientists eventually converged on a roughly cube root curve consistent with the Stevens s power law for brightness perception reflecting the fact that lightness is proportional to the number of nerve impulses per nerve fiber per unit time The remainder of this section is a chronology of lightness models leading to CIECAM br Note Munsell s V runs from to while Y typically runs from to often interpreted as a percentage Typically the relative luminance is normalized so that the reference white say magnesium oxide has a tristimulus value of Y Since the reflectance of magnesium oxide MgO relative to the perfect reflecting diffuser is V corresponds to Y if MgO is used as the reference br br br br Irwin Priest Kasson Gibson and Harry McNicholas provide a basic estimate of the Munsell value with Y running from to in this case br br br br br V br br br br br Y br br br br br br displaystyle V sqrt Y br br br br br Alexander Munsell

lightness value of It is called mid grey because its lightness is midway between black and white br br br br As early as in a hyperbolic relationship between light intensity and cone cell responses was discovered in fish in line with the Michaelis Menten kinetics model of biochemical reactions In the s the same relationship was found in a number of other vertebrates and in using microelectrodes to measure cone responses in living rhesus macaques Valeton and Van Norren found the following relationship br br V I br where V is the measured potential I the light intensity and a constant br In Seim and Valberg realised that this relationship might aid in the construction of a more uniform colour space This inspired advances in colour modelling and when the International Commission on Illumination held a symposium in objectives for a new standard colour model were formulated and in CIECAM s International Commission on Illumination colour appearance model simple version was standardised CIECAM s distinguishes between lightness how light something appears compared to a similarly lit white object and brightness how much light appears to shine from something br According to CIECAM s the lightness of a sample is br br J Asample Awhite cz br In this formula for a small sample under bright conditions in a surrounding field with a relative luminance n compared to white c has

Nbb is a fudge factor that is normally it s only of concern when comparing brightness judgements based on slightly different reference whites br Here Y is the relative luminance compared to white on a scale of to and LA is the average luminance of the adapting visual field as a whole measured in cd m The achromatic response follows a kind of S curve ranging from to numbers which follow from the way the cone responses are averaged and which are ultimately based on a rough estimate for the useful range of nerve impulses per second and which has a fairly large intermediate range where it roughly follows a square root curve br The brightness according to CIECAM s is then br br Q c J Awhite br The factor c is a surround factor that reflects that scenes appear brighter in dark surrounding conditions br Suggestions for a more comprehensive model CIECAM C were also formulated to take into account several effects at extremely dark or bright conditions coloured lighting as well as the Helmholtz Kohlrausch effect where highly chromatic samples appear lighter and brighter in comparison to a neutral grey To model the latter effect in CIECAM C the formula for J is adjusted as follows br br JHK J J C sin h br where C is the chroma and h the hue angle br Q is then calculated from JHK instead of from J This formula has the effect of pulling up the lightness and brightness of coloured samples The larger the chroma the stronger the effect for very saturated colours C can be close to or even higher The absolute sine term has a sharp V shaped valley with a zero at yellow and a broad plateau in the deep blues br br br br The achromatic response in CIECAM s is a weighted addition of cone responses minus Since the total noise term adds up to this means that A and consequentially J and Q aren t zero for absolute black To fix this Li Luo Hunt suggested subtracting instead so the scale starts at zero Although CIECAM s was a successful model to spur and direct colorimetric research Fairchild felt that for practical applications some changes were necessary Those relevant for lightness calculations were to rather than use several discrete values for the surround factor c allow for linear interpolation of c and thereby allowing the model to be used under intermediate surround conditions and to simplify z to remove the special case for large stimuli because he felt it was irrelevant for imaging applications Based on experimental results Hunt Li Juan and Luo proposed a number of improvements Relevant for the topic at hand is that they suggested lowering z slightly Li and Luo found that a colour space based on such a modified CIECAM s using lightness as one of the coordinates was more perceptually uniform than CIELAB br Because of the shape of the cone response S curve when the luminance of a colour is reduced even if its spectral composition remains the same the different cone responses do not quite change at the same rate with respect to each other It is plausible therefore that the perceived hue and saturation will change at low luminance levels But CIECAM s predicts much larger deviations than are generally thought likely and therefore Hunt Li and Luo suggested using a cone response curve which approximates a power curve for a much larger range of stimuli so hue and saturation are better preserved br All these proposals as well as others relating to chromaticity resulted in a new colour appearance model CIECAM In this model the formula for lightness remains the same br br J Asample Awhite cz br But all the quantities that feed into this formula change in some way The parameter c is now continuously variable as discussed above and z n Although this is higher than z in CIECAM s the total effective power factor is very similar because the effective power factor of the achromatic response is much lower br br br br br br br A br br br N br br br bb br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br

CIECAM C CIECAM contains no provision for the Helmholtz Kohlrausch effect br br br Other psychological effects br This subjective perception of luminance in a non linear fashion is one thing that makes gamma compression of images worthwhile Beside this phenomenon there are other effects involving perception of lightness Chromaticity can affect perceived lightness as described by the Helmholtz Kohlrausch effect Though the CIELAB space and relatives do not account for this effect on lightness it may be implied in the Munsell color model Light levels may also affect perceived chromaticity as
