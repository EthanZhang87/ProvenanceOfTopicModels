Color vision a proximate adaptation of the vision sensory modality allows for the discrimination of light based on its wavelength components br br br Improved detection sensitivity br The evolutionary process of switching from a single photopigment to two different pigments would have provided early ancestors with a sensitivity advantage in two ways br In one way adding a new pigment would allow them to see a wider range of the electromagnetic spectrum Secondly new random connections would create wavelength opponency and the new wavelength opponent neurons would be much more sensitive than the non wavelength opponent neurons This is the result of some wavelength distributions favouring excitation instead of inhibition Both excitation and inhibition would be features of a neural substrate during the formation of a second pigment Overall the advantage gained from increased sensitivity with wavelength opponency would open up opportunities for future exploitation by mutations and even further improvement br br br Invertebrates br Color vision requires a number of opsin molecules with different absorbance peaks and at least three opsins were present in the ancestor of arthropods chelicerates and pancrustaceans today possess color vision br br br Vertebrates br br Researchers studying the opsin genes responsible for color vision pigments have long known that four photopigment opsins exist in birds reptiles and teleost fish This indicates that the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes million years ago had tetrachromatic vision the ability to see four dimensions of color br br br Mammals br Today most mammals possess dichromatic vision corresponding to protanopia red green color blindness They can thus see violet blue green and yellow light but cannot see ultraviolet and deep red light This was probably a feature of the first mammalian ancestors which were likely small nocturnal and burrowing br At the time of the Cretaceous Paleogene extinction event million years ago the burrowing ability probably helped mammals survive extinction Mammalian species of the time had already started to differentiate but were still generally small comparable in size to shrews this small size would have helped them to find shelter in protected environments br br br Monotremes and marsupials br It is postulated that some early monotremes marsupials and placentals were semiaquatic or burrowing as there are multiple mammalian lineages with such habits today Any burrowing or semiaquatic mammal would have had additional protection from Cretaceous Paleogene boundary environmental stresses However many such species evidently possessed poor color vision in comparison with non mammalian vertebrate species of the time including reptiles birds and amphibians br br br Primates br br Since the beginning of the Paleogene Period surviving mammals enlarged moving away by adaptive radiation from a burrowing existence and into the open although most species kept their relatively poor color vision Exceptions occur for some marsupials which possibly kept their original color vision and some primates including humans Primates as an order of mammals began to emerge around the beginning of the Paleogene Period br Primates have re developed trichromatic color vision since that time by the mechanism of gene duplication being under unusually high evolutionary pressure to develop color vision better than the mammalian standard Ability to perceive red and orange hues allows tree dwelling primates to discern them from green This is particularly important for primates in the detection of red and orange fruit as well as nutrient rich new foliage in which the red and orange carotenoids have not yet been masked by chlorophyll br Another theory is that detecting skin flushing and thereby mood may have influenced the development of primate trichromate vision The color red also has other effects on primate and human behavior as discussed in the color psychology article br Today among simians the catarrhines Old World monkeys and apes including humans are routinely trichromatic meaning that both males and females possess three opsins sensitive to short wave medium wave and long wave light while conversely only a small fraction of platyrrhine primates New World monkeys are trichromats br br br See also br Evolution of color vision in primates br Evolution of the eye br br br br br Gengo Tanaka Andrew R Parker Yoshikazu Hasegawa David J Siveter Ryoichi Yamamoto Kiyoshi Miyashita Yuichi Takahashi Shosuke Ito Kazumasa Wakamatsu Takao Mukuda Marie Matsuura Ko Tomikawa Masumi Furutani Kayo Suzuki Haruyoshi Maeda December Mineralized rods and cones suggest colour vision in a Myr old fossil fish Nature Communications Bibcode NatCo T doi ncomms hdl PMID
