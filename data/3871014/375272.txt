Colorimetry is the science and technology used to quantify and describe physically the human color perception br It is similar to spectrophotometry but is distinguished by its interest in reducing spectra to the physical correlates of color perception most often the CIE XYZ color space tristimulus values and related quantities br br br History br The Duboscq colorimeter was invented by Jules Duboscq in br br br Instruments br Colorimetric equipment is similar to that used in spectrophotometry Some related equipment is also mentioned for completeness br br A tristimulus colorimeter measures the tristimulus values of a color br A spectroradiometer measures the absolute spectral radiance intensity or irradiance of a light source br A spectrophotometer measures the spectral reflectance transmittance or relative irradiance of a color sample br A spectrocolorimeter is a spectrophotometer that can calculate tristimulus values br A densitometer measures the degree of light passing through or reflected by a subject br A color temperature meter measures the color temperature of an incident illuminant br br br Tristimulus colorimeter br br In digital imaging colorimeters are tristimulus devices used for color calibration Accurate color profiles ensure consistency throughout the imaging workflow from acquisition to output br br br Spectroradiometer spectrophotometer spectrocolorimeter br The absolute spectral power distribution of a light source can be measured with a spectroradiometer which works by optically collecting the light then passing it through a monochromator before reading it in narrow bands of wavelength br Reflected color can be measured using a spectrophotometer also called spectroreflectometer or reflectometer which takes measurements in the visible region and a little beyond of a given color sample If the custom of taking readings at nanometer increments is followed the visible light range of nm will yield readings These readings are typically used to draw the sample s spectral reflectance curve how much it reflects as a function of wavelength the most accurate data that can be provided regarding its characteristics br br The readings by themselves are typically not as useful as their tristimulus values which can be converted into chromaticity co ordinates and manipulated through color space transformations For this purpose a spectrocolorimeter may be used A spectrocolorimeter is simply a spectrophotometer that can estimate tristimulus values by numerical integration of the color matching functions inner product with the illuminant s spectral power distribution One benefit of spectrocolorimeters over tristimulus colorimeters is that they do not have optical filters which are subject to manufacturing variance and have a fixed spectral transmittance curve until they age On the other hand tristimulus colorimeters are purpose built cheaper and easier to use br The CIE International Commission on Illumination recommends using measurement intervals under nm even for smooth spectra Sparser measurements fail to accurately characterize spiky emission spectra such as that of the red phosphor of a CRT display depicted aside br br br Color temperature meter br Photographers and cinematographers use information provided by these meters to decide what color balancing should be done to make different light sources appear to have the same color temperature If the user enters the reference color temperature the meter can calculate the mired difference between the measurement and the reference enabling the user to choose a corrective color gel or photographic filter with the closest mired factor br br Internally the meter is typically a silicon photodiode tristimulus colorimeter The correlated color temperature can be calculated from the tristimulus values by first calculating the chromaticity co ordinates in the CIE color space then finding the closest point on the Planckian locus br br br See
