Indigo is a term used for a number of hues in the region of blue The word comes from the ancient dye of the same name The term indigo can refer to the color of the dye various colors of fabric dyed with indigo dye a spectral color one of the seven colors of the rainbow as described by Newton or a region on the color wheel and can include various shades of blue ultramarine and green blue Since the web era the term has also been used for various purple and violet hues identified as indigo based on use of the term indigo in HTML web page specifications br The word indigo comes from the Latin word indicum meaning Indian as the naturally based dye was originally exported to Europe from India br The Early Modern English word indigo referred to the dye not to the color hue itself and indigo is not traditionally part of the basic color naming system br The first known recorded use of indigo as a color name in English was in br Isaac Newton regarded indigo as a color in the visible spectrum as well as one of the seven colors of the rainbow the color between blue and violet however sources differ as to its actual position in the electromagnetic spectrum Later scientists have concluded that what Newton called blue was what is now called cyan or blue green and what Newton called indigo was what is now called blue br In the s programmers produced a somewhat arbitrary list of color names for the X Window computer operating system resulting in the HTML and CSS specifications issued in the s using the term indigo for a dark purple hue This has resulted in violet and purple hues also being associated with the term indigo since that time br Because of the Abney effect pinpointing indigo to a specific hue value in the HSV color wheel is elusive as a higher HSV saturation value shifts the hue towards blue However on the new CIECAM standard the hues values around may be thought of as indigo depending on the observer br br br History br br br Indigo as a dye br br Indigo dye is a blue color obtained from several different types of plants The indigo plant Indigofera tinctoria often called true indigo probably produces the best results although several others are close in color Japanese indigo Polygonum tinctoria Natal indigo Indigofera arrecta Guatemalan indigo Indigofera suffruticosa Chinese indigo Persicaria tinctoria and woad Isatis tinctoria br Indigofera tinctoria and related species were cultivated in East Asia Egypt India Bangladesh and Peru in antiquity The earliest direct evidence for the use of indigo dates to around BC and comes from Huaca Prieta in contemporary Peru Pliny the Elder mentions India as the source of the dye after which it was named It was imported from there in small quantities via the Silk Road br The Ancient Greek term for the dye was indikon pharmakon Indian dye which adopted to Latin as indicum a second declension noun or indico oblique case and via Portuguese gave rise to the modern word indigo br br In early Europe the main source was from the woad plant Isatis tinctoria also known as pastel For a long time woad was the main source of blue dye in Europe Woad was replaced by true indigo as trade routes opened up Plant sources have now been largely replaced by synthetic dyes br Spanish explorers discovered an American species of indigo and began to cultivate the product in Guatemala The English and French subsequently began to encourage indigo cultivation in their colonies in the West Indies br In North America indigo was introduced by Eliza Lucas into colonial South Carolina where it became the colony s second most important cash crop after rice Before the Revolutionary War indigo accounted for more than one third of the value of exports from the American colonies br br br Isaac Newton s classification of indigo as a spectral color br br Isaac Newton introduced indigo as one of the seven base colors of his work In the mid s when Newton bought a pair of prisms at a fair near Cambridge the East India Company had begun importing indigo dye into England supplanting the homegrown woad as source of blue dye In a pivotal experiment in the history of optics the young Newton shone a narrow beam of sunlight through a prism to produce a rainbow like band of colors on the wall In describing this optical spectrum Newton acknowledged that the spectrum had a continuum of colors but named seven The originall or primary colours are Red yellow Green Blew a violet purple together with Orang Indico an indefinite varietie of intermediate gradations He linked the seven prismatic colors to the seven notes of a western major scale as shown in his color wheel with orange and indigo as the semitones Having decided upon seven colors he asked a friend to repeatedly divide up the spectrum that was projected from the prism onto the wall br br I desired a friend to draw with a pencil lines cross the image or pillar of colours where every one of the seven aforenamed colours was most full and brisk and also where he judged the truest confines of them to be whilst I held the paper so that the said image might fall within a certain compass marked on it And this I did partly because my own eyes are not very critical in distinguishing colours partly because another to whom I had not communicated my thoughts about this matter could have nothing but his eyes to determine his fancy in making those marks br br Indigo is therefore counted as one of the traditional colors of the rainbow the order of which is given by the mnemonics Richard of York gave battle in vain and Roy G Biv James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz accepted indigo as an appropriate name for the color flanking violet in the spectrum br Later scientists concluded that Newton named the colors differently from current usage br According to Gary Waldman A careful reading of Newton s work indicates that the color he called indigo we would normally call blue his blue is then what we would name blue green or cyan If this is true Newton s seven spectral colors would have been br br The human eye does not readily differentiate hues in the wavelengths between what are now called blue and violet If this is where Newton meant indigo to lie most individuals would have difficulty distinguishing indigo from its neighbors According to Isaac Asimov It is customary to list indigo as a color lying between blue and violet but it has never seemed to me that indigo is worth the dignity of being considered a separate color To my eyes it seems merely deep blue br br br s br In Abraham Werner published Werner s Nomenclature of Colours where indigo called indigo blue is classified as a blue hue and not listed among the violet hues He writes that the color is composed of Berlin blue a little black and a small portion of apple green and indicating it is the color of blue copper ore with Berlin blue being described as the color of a blue jay s wing a hepatica flower or a blue sapphire br According to an article Definition of the Color Indigo published in Nature magazine in the late s Newton s use of the term indigo referred to a spectral color between blue and violet However the article states that Wilhelm von Bezold in his treatise on color disagreed with Newton s use of the term on the basis that the pigment indigo was a darker hue than the spectral color and furthermore Professor Ogden Rood points out that indigo pigment corresponds to the cyan blue region of the spectrum lying between blue and green although darker in hue Rood considers that artificial ultramarine pigment is closer to the point of the spectrum described as indigo and proposed renaming that spectral point as ultramarine The article goes on to state that comparison of the pigments both dry and wet with Maxwell s discs and with the spectrum that indigo is almost identical to Prussian blue stating that it certainly does not lie on the violet side of blue When scraped a lump of indigo pigment appears more violet and if powdered or dissolved becomes greenish br br br Modern spectral classification br Several modern sources place indigo in the electromagnetic spectrum between and nanometers which lies on the short wave side of color wheel RGB blue towards spectral violet br The correspondence of this definition with colors of actual indigo dyes though is disputed Optical scientists Hardy and Perrin list indigo as between and nm wavelength which occupies a spectrum segment from roughly the color wheel RGB blue extending to the long wave side towards azure br Other modern color scientists such as Bohren and Clothiaux and J W G Hunt divide the spectrum between violet and blue at about nm with no hue specifically named indigo br br br Web era br br br Origin of Indigo as a name for purple in web pages br Towards the end of the th century purple colors also became referred to as indigo In the s computer programmers Jim Gettys Paul Ravelling John C Thomas and Jim Fulton produced a list of colors for the X Window Operating System The color identified as indigo was not the color indigo as generally understood at the time but was actually a dark purple hue the programmers assigned it the hex code B This collection of color names was somewhat arbitrary Thomas used a box of Crayola crayons as a standard whereas Ravelling used color swabs from the now defunct Sinclair Paints company resulting in the color list for version X of the operating system containing fanciful color names such as papaya whip blanched almond and peach puff The database was also criticised for its many inconsistencies such as dark gray being lighter than gray and for the color distribution being uneven tending towards reds and greens at the expense of blues br In the s this list which came with version X became the basis of the HTML and CSS color rendition used in websites and web design This resulted in the name Indigo being associated with purple and violet hues in web page design and graphic design Physics author John Spacey writes on the website Simplicable that the X programmers did not have any background in color theory and that as these names are used by web designers and graphic designers the name indigo has since that time been strongly associated with purple or violet Spacey writes As such a few programmers accidentally repurposed a color name that was known to civilisations for thousands of years br br br Crayola crayon colors br The Crayola company released an indigo crayon in with the Crayola website using the hex code F C to approximate the crayon color The iron indigo crayon is portrayed using hex code FA the indigo crayon color uses D CB the iridescent indigo uses C CD br br br Distinction among tones of indigo br Like many other colors orange rose and violet are the best known indigo gets its name from an object in the natural world the plant named indigo once used for dyeing cloth see also Indigo dye br The color pigment indigo is equivalent to the web color indigo and approximates the color indigo that is usually reproduced in pigments and colored pencils br The color of indigo dye is a different color from either spectrum indigo or pigment indigo This is the actual color of the dye A vat full of this dye is a darker color approximating the web color midnight blue br The color electric indigo is a bright and saturated color between the traditional indigo and violet This is the brightest color indigo that can be approximated on a computer screen it is a color located between the primary blue and the color violet of the RGB color wheel br The web color blue violet or deep indigo is a tone of indigo brighter than pigment indigo but not as bright as electric indigo br Listed below are several indigo hues some of which have included the word indigo with the adoption of HTML color names in the World Wide Web era br br br Indigo dye color br br Indigo dye is a greenish dark blue color obtained from either the leaves of the tropical Indigo plant Indigofera or from woad Isatis tinctoria or the Chinese indigo Persicaria tinctoria Many societies make use of the Indigofera plant for producing different shades of blue Cloth that is repeatedly boiled in an indigo dye bath solution boiled and left to dry boiled and left to dry etc the blue pigment becomes darker on the cloth After dyeing the cloth is hung in the open air to dry br A Native American woman described the process used by the Cherokee Indians when extracting the dye br br We raised our indigo which we cut in the morning while the dew was still on it then we put it in a tub and soaked it overnight and the next day we foamed it up by beating it with a gourd We let it stand overnight again and the next day rubbed tallow on our hands to kill the foam Afterwards we poured the water off and the sediment left in the bottom we would pour into a pitcher or crock to let it get dry and then we would put it into a poke made of cloth i e sack made of coarse cloth and then when we wanted any of it to dye there with we would take the dry indigo br In Sa Pa Vietnam the tropical Indigo Indigo tinctoria leaves are harvested and while still fresh placed inside a tub of room temperature to lukewarm water where they are left to sit for to days and allowed to ferment until the water turns green Afterwards crushed limestone pickling lime is added to the water at which time the water with the leaves are vigorously agitated for to minutes until the water turns blue The blue pigment settles as sediment at the bottom of the tub The sediment is scooped out and stored When dyeing cloth the pigment is then boiled in a vat of water the cloth usually made from yarns of hemp is inserted into the vat for absorbing the dye After hanging out to dry the boiling process is repeated as often as needed to produce a darker color br br br Indigo color wheel br br In a RGB color space Indigo color wheel is composed of red green and blue Whereas in a CMYK color space it is composed of cyan magenta yellow and black It has a hue angle of degrees a saturation of and a lightness of Indigo color wheel could be obtained by blending violet with blue br br br Electric indigo br br Electric indigo is brighter than the pigment indigo reproduced above When plotted on the CIE chromaticity diagram this color is at nanometers in the middle of the portion of the spectrum traditionally considered indigo i e between and nanometers This color is only an approximation of spectral indigo since actual spectral colors are outside the gamut of the sRGB color system br br br Deep indigo web color blue violet br br At right is displayed the web color blue violet a color intermediate in brightness between electric indigo and pigment indigo It is also known as deep indigo br br br Web color indigo br br The color box on the right displays the web color indigo the color indigo as it would be reproduced by artists paints as opposed to the brighter indigo above electric indigo that is possible to reproduce on a computer screen Its hue is closer to violet than to indigo dye for which the color is named Pigment indigo can be obtained by mixing pigment cyan with about pigment magenta br Compare the subtractive colors to the additive colors in the two primary color charts in the article on primary colors to see the distinction between electric colors as reproducible from light on a computer screen additive colors and the pigment colors reproducible with pigments subtractive colors the additive colors are significantly brighter because they are produced from light instead of pigment br Web color indigo represents the way the color indigo was always reproduced in pigments paints or colored pencils in the s By the s because of the advent of psychedelic art artists became accustomed to brighter pigments Pigments called bright indigo or bright blue violet the pigment equivalent of the electric indigo reproduced in the section above became available in artists pigments and colored pencils br br br Tropical indigo br br Tropical Indigo is the color that is called a il in the Gu a de coloraciones
