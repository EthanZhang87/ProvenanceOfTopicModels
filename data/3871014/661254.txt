A Brocken spectre British English American spelling Brocken specter German Brockengespenst also called Brocken bow mountain spectre or spectre of the Brocken is the magnified and apparently enormous shadow of an observer cast in mid air upon any type of cloud opposite a strong light source The figure s head can be surrounded by a bright area called Heiligenschein or halo like rings of rainbow coloured light forming a glory which appear opposite the Sun s direction when uniformly sized water droplets in clouds refract and backscatter sunlight br The phenomenon can appear on any misty mountainside cloud bank or be seen from an aircraft but the frequent fogs and low altitude accessibility of the Brocken the highest peak of the Harz Mountains in Germany have created a local legend from which the phenomenon draws its name The Brocken spectre was observed and described by Johann Silberschlag in and has often been recorded in literature about the region br br br Occurrence br br The spectre appears when the sun shines from behind the observer who is looking down from a ridge or peak into mist or fog br The light projects the observer s shadow through the mist often in a triangular shape due to perspective br The apparent magnification of size of the shadow is an optical illusion that occurs when the observer judges their shadow on relatively nearby clouds to be at the same distance as faraway land objects seen through gaps in the clouds or when there are no reference points by which to judge its size The shadow also falls on water droplets of varying distances from the eye confusing depth perception The ghost can appear to move sometimes suddenly because of the movement of the cloud layer and variations in density within the cloud br br br References in
