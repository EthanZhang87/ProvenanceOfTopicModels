In physics and mathematics the phase symbol or of a wave or other periodic function br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br of some real variable br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br such as time is an angle like quantity representing the fraction of the cycle covered up to br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br It is expressed in such a scale that it varies by one full turn as the variable br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br goes through each period and br br br br F br br t br br br br displaystyle F t br br goes through each complete cycle It may be measured in any angular unit such as degrees or radians thus increasing by or br br br br br br br br displaystyle pi br br as the variable br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br completes a full period br This convention is especially appropriate for a sinusoidal function since its value at any argument br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br then can be expressed as br br br br br br t br br br br displaystyle varphi t br br the sine of the phase multiplied by some factor the amplitude of the sinusoid The cosine may be used instead of sine depending on where one considers each period to start br Usually whole turns are ignored when expressing the phase so that br br br br br br t br br br br displaystyle varphi t br br is also a periodic function with the same period as br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br that repeatedly scans the same range of angles as br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br goes through each period Then br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br is said to be at the same phase at two argument values br br br br br t br br br br br br br displaystyle t br br and br br br br br t br br br br br br br displaystyle t br br that is br br br br br br br t br br br br br br br br br br t br br br br br br br br displaystyle varphi t varphi t br br if the difference between them is a whole number of periods br The numeric value of the phase br br br br br br t br br br br displaystyle varphi t br br depends on the arbitrary choice of the start of each period and on the interval of angles that each period is to be mapped to br The term phase is also used when comparing a periodic function br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br with a shifted version br br br br G br br br displaystyle G br br of it If the shift in br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br is expressed as a fraction of the period and then scaled to an angle br br br br br br br displaystyle varphi br br spanning a whole turn one gets the phase shift phase offset or phase difference of br br br br G br br br displaystyle G br br relative to br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br If br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br is a canonical function for a class of signals like br br br br sin br br br t br br br br displaystyle sin t br br is for all sinusoidal signals then br br br br br br br displaystyle varphi br br is called the initial phase of br br br br G br br br displaystyle G br br br br br Mathematical definition br Let the signal br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br be a periodic function of one real variable and br br br br T br br br displaystyle T br br be its period that is the smallest positive real number such that br br br br F br br t br br T br br br F br br t br br br br displaystyle F t T F t br br for all br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br Then the phase of br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br at any argument br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br is br br Here br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle cdot br br denotes the fractional part of a real number discarding its integer part that is br br br br br br br x br br br br br x br br br br x br br br br br br br displaystyle x x left lfloor x right rfloor br br and br br br br br t br br br br br br br displaystyle t br br is an arbitrary origin value of the argument that one considers to be the beginning of a cycle br This concept can be visualized by imagining a clock with a hand that turns at constant speed making a full turn every br br br br T br br br displaystyle T br br seconds and is pointing straight up at time br br br br br t br br br br br br br displaystyle t br br The phase br br br br br br t br br br br displaystyle varphi t br br is then the angle from the position to the current position of the hand at time br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br measured clockwise br The phase concept is most useful when the origin br br br br br t br br br br br br br displaystyle t br br is chosen based on features of br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br For example for a sinusoid a convenient choice is any br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br where the function s value changes from zero to positive br The formula above gives the phase as an angle in radians between and br br br br br br br br displaystyle pi br br To get the phase as an angle between br br br br br br br br displaystyle pi br br and br br br br br br br br displaystyle pi br br one uses instead br br The phase expressed in degrees from to or from to is defined the same way except with in place of br br br Consequences br With any of the above definitions the phase br br br br br br t br br br br displaystyle varphi t br br of a periodic signal is periodic too with the same period br br br br T br br br displaystyle T br br br br The phase is zero at the start of each period that is br br Moreover for any given choice of the origin br br br br br t br br br br br br br displaystyle t br br the value of the signal br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br for any argument br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br depends only on its phase at br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br Namely one can write br br br br F br br t br br br f br br br br t br br br br br displaystyle F t f varphi t br br where br br br br f br br br displaystyle f br br is a function of an angle defined only for a single full turn that describes the variation of br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br as br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br ranges over a single period br In fact every periodic signal br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br with a specific waveform can be expressed as br br where br br br br w br br br displaystyle w br br is a canonical function of a phase angle in to that describes just one cycle of that waveform and br br br br A br br br displaystyle A br br is a scaling factor for the amplitude This claim assumes that the starting time br br br br br t br br br br br br br displaystyle t br br chosen to compute the phase of br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br corresponds to argument of br br br br w br br br displaystyle w br br br br br Adding and comparing phases br Since phases are angles any whole full turns should usually be ignored when performing arithmetic operations on them That is the sum and difference of two phases in degrees should be computed by the formulas br br respectively Thus for example the sum of phase angles is minus one full turn and subtracting from gives a phase of plus one full turn br Similar formulas hold for radians with br br br br br br br br displaystyle pi br br instead of br br br Phase shift br br The difference br br br br br br t br br br br br br G br br br br t br br br br br br F br br br br t br br br br displaystyle varphi t varphi G t varphi F t br br between the phases of two periodic signals br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br and br br br br G br br br displaystyle G br br is called the phase difference or phase shift of br br br br G br br br displaystyle G br br relative to br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br At values of br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br when the difference is zero the two signals are said to be in phase otherwise they are out of phase with each other br In the clock analogy each signal is represented by a hand or pointer of the same clock both turning at constant but possibly different speeds The phase difference is then the angle between the two hands measured clockwise br The phase difference is particularly important when two signals are added together by a physical process such as two periodic sound waves emitted by two sources and recorded together by a microphone This is usually the case in linear systems when the superposition principle holds br For arguments br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br when the phase difference is zero the two signals will have the same sign and will be reinforcing each other One says that constructive interference is occurring At arguments br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br when the phases are different the value of the sum depends on the waveform br br br For sinusoids br For sinusoidal signals when the phase difference br br br br br br t br br br br displaystyle varphi t br br is br br br br br br br displaystyle pi br br radians one says that the phases are opposite and that the signals are in antiphase Then the signals have opposite signs and destructive interference occurs br Conversely a phase reversal or phase inversion implies a degree phase shift br When the phase difference br br br br br br t br br br br displaystyle varphi t br br is a quarter of turn a right angle or sinusoidal signals are sometimes said to be in quadrature e g in phase and quadrature components of a composite signal or even different signals e g voltage and current br If the frequencies are different the phase difference br br br br br br t br br br br displaystyle varphi t br br increases linearly with the argument br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br The periodic changes from reinforcement and opposition cause a phenomenon called beating br br br For shifted signals br The phase difference is especially important when comparing a periodic signal br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br with a shifted and possibly scaled version br br br br G br br br displaystyle G br br of it That is suppose that br br br br G br br t br br br br br F br br t br br br br br br displaystyle G t alpha F t tau br br for some constants br br br br br br br br br displaystyle alpha tau br br and all br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br Suppose also that the origin for computing the phase of br br br br G br br br displaystyle G br br has been shifted too In that case the phase difference br br br br br br br displaystyle varphi br br is a constant independent of br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br called the phase shift or phase offset of br br br br G br br br displaystyle G br br relative to br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br In the clock analogy this situation corresponds to the two hands turning at the same speed so that the angle between them is constant br In this case the phase shift is simply the argument shift br br br br br br br displaystyle tau br br expressed as a fraction of the common period br br br br T br br br displaystyle T br br in terms of the modulo operation of the two signals and then scaled to a full turn br br If br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br is a canonical representative for a class of signals like br br br br sin br br br t br br br br displaystyle sin t br br is for all sinusoidal signals then the phase shift br br br br br br br displaystyle varphi br br called simply the initial phase of br br br br G br br br displaystyle G br br br Therefore when two periodic signals have the same frequency they are always in phase or always out of phase Physically this situation commonly occurs for many reasons For example the two signals may be a periodic soundwave recorded by two microphones at separate locations Or conversely they may be periodic soundwaves created by two separate speakers from the same electrical signal and recorded by a single microphone They may be a radio signal that reaches the receiving antenna in a straight line and a copy of it that was reflected off a large building nearby br A well known example of phase difference is the length of shadows seen at different points of Earth To a first approximation if br br br br F br br t br br br br displaystyle F t br br is the length seen at time br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br at one spot and br br br br G br br br displaystyle G br br is the length seen at the same time at a longitude west of that point then the phase difference between the two signals will be assuming that in each signal each period starts when the shadow is shortest br br br For sinusoids with same frequency br For sinusoidal signals and a few other waveforms like square or symmetric triangular a phase shift of is equivalent to a phase shift of with negation of the amplitude When two signals with these waveforms same period and opposite phases are added together the sum br br br br F br br G br br br displaystyle F G br br is either identically zero or is a sinusoidal signal with the same period and phase whose amplitude is the difference of the original amplitudes br The phase shift of the co sine function relative to the sine function is It follows that for two sinusoidal signals br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br and br br br br G br br br displaystyle G br br with same frequency and amplitudes br br br br A br br br displaystyle A br br and br br br br B br br br displaystyle B br br and br br br br G br br br displaystyle G br br has phase shift relative to br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br the sum br br br br F br br G br br br displaystyle F G br br is a sinusoidal signal with the same frequency with amplitude br br br br C br br br displaystyle C br br and phase shift br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle circ varphi circ br br from br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br such that br br br A real world example of a sonic phase difference occurs in the warble of a Native American flute The amplitude of different harmonic components of same long held note on the flute come into dominance at different points in the phase cycle The phase difference between the different harmonics can be observed on a spectrogram of the sound of a warbling flute br br br Phase comparison br Phase comparison is a comparison of the phase of two waveforms usually of the same nominal frequency In time and frequency the purpose of a phase comparison is generally to determine the frequency offset difference between signal cycles with respect to a reference br A phase comparison can be made by connecting two signals to a two channel oscilloscope The oscilloscope will display two sine signals as shown in the graphic to the right In the adjacent image the top sine signal is the test frequency and the bottom sine signal represents a signal from the reference br If the two frequencies were exactly the same their phase relationship would not change and both would appear to be stationary on the oscilloscope display Since the two frequencies are not exactly the same the reference appears to be stationary and the test signal moves By measuring the rate of motion of the test signal the offset between frequencies can be determined br Vertical lines have been drawn through the points where each sine signal passes through zero The bottom of the figure shows bars whose width represents the phase difference between the signals In this case the phase difference is increasing indicating that the test signal is lower in frequency than the reference br br br Formula for phase of an oscillation or a periodic signal br The phase of a simple harmonic oscillation or sinusoidal signal is the value of br br br br br br br textstyle varphi br br in the following functions br br where br br br br A br br br textstyle A br br br br br br f br br br textstyle f br br and br br br br br br br textstyle varphi br br are constant parameters called the amplitude frequency and phase of the sinusoid These signals are periodic with period br br br br T br br br br br f br br br br br textstyle T frac f br br and they are identical except for a displacement of br br br br br br T br br br br br br textstyle frac T br br along the br br br br t br br br textstyle t br br axis The term phase can refer to several different things br br It can refer to a specified reference such as br br br br cos br br br br br f br t br br br br textstyle cos pi ft br br in which case we would say the phase of br br br br x br br t br br br br textstyle x t br br is br br br br br br br textstyle varphi br br and the phase of br br br br y br br t br br br br textstyle y t br br is br br br br br br br br br br br br br br textstyle varphi frac pi br br br It can refer to br br br br br br br textstyle varphi br br in which case we would say br br br br x br br t br br br br textstyle x t br br and br br br br y br br t br br br br textstyle y t br br have the same phase but are relative to their own specific references br In the context of communication waveforms the time variant angle br br br br br br f br t br br br br br
