id: 248581
Darkness is defined as a lack of illumination an absence of visible light or a surface that absorbs light such as a black one br Human vision is unable to distinguish colors in conditions of very low luminance because the hue sensitive photoreceptor cells on the retina are inactive when light levels are insufficient in the range of visual perception referred to as scotopic vision br The emotional response to darkness has generated metaphorical usages of the term in many cultures often used to describe an unhappy or foreboding feeling br Darkness may also refer to night which occurs when the Sun is more than below the horizon br br br Scientific br br br Perception br The perception of darkness differs from the mere absence of light due to the effects of after images on perception In perceiving the eye is active and the part of the retina that is unstimulated produces a complementary afterimage br br br Physics br br In terms of physics an object is said to be dark when it absorbs photons causing it to appear dim compared to other objects For example matte black paint does not reflect much visible light and appears dark whereas white paint reflects much light and appears bright For more information see color An object may appear dark but it may be bright at a frequency that humans cannot perceive br A dark area has limited light sources making things hard to see Exposure to alternating light and darkness night and day has caused several evolutionary adaptations to darkness When a vertebrate like a human enters a dark area its pupils dilate allowing more light to enter the eye and improving night vision Also the light detecting cells in the human eye rods and cones will regenerate more unbleached rhodopsin when adapting to darkness br One scientific measure of darkness is the Bortle scale which indicates the night sky s and stars brightness at a particular location and the observability of celestial objects at that location br The material known as Vantablack is one of the darkest substances known absorbing up to of visible light at nm if the light is perpendicular to the material and was developed by Surrey NanoSystems in the United Kingdom The name is a compound of the acronym VANTA vertically aligned nanotube arrays and the color black br br br Technical br The color of a point on a standard bit computer display is defined by three RGB red green blue values each ranging from When the red green and blue components of a pixel are fully illuminated the pixel appears white when all three components are unilluminated the pixel appears black br br br Cultural br br br Artistic br br Artists use darkness to emphasize and contrast the presence of light Darkness can be used as a counterpoint to areas of lightness to create leading lines and voids Such shapes draw the eye around areas of the painting Shadows add depth and perspective to a painting See chiaroscuro for a discussion of the uses of such contrasts in visual media br Color paints are mixed together to create darkness because each color absorbs certain frequencies of light Theoretically mixing together the three primary colors or the three secondary colors will absorb all visible light and create black In practice it is difficult to prevent the mixture from taking on a brown tint br br br Literature br br As a poetic term in the Western world darkness is used to connote the presence of shadows evil and foreboding or in modern parlance to connote that a story is grim heavy and or depressing br br br Religion br The first creation narrative in Judaism and Christianity begins with darkness into which is introduced the creation of light and the separation of this light from the darkness as distinct from the creation of the Sun and Moon on the fourth day of creation Thus although both light and darkness are included in the comprehensive works of God darkness was considered the second to last plague Exodus and the location of weeping and gnashing of teeth Matthew br Erebus was a primordial deity in Greek mythology representing the personification of darkness br br br Philosophy br In Chinese philosophy yin is the complementary feminine part of
