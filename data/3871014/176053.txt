title: Angle of view (photography)
id: 176053
In photography angle of view AOV describes the angular extent of a given scene that is imaged by a camera It is used interchangeably with the more general term field of view br It is important to distinguish the angle of view from the angle of coverage which describes the angle range that a lens can image Typically the image circle produced by a lens is large enough to cover the film or sensor completely possibly including some vignetting toward the edge If the angle of coverage of the lens does not fill the sensor the image circle will be visible typically with strong vignetting toward the edge and the effective angle of view will be limited to the angle of coverage br br A camera s angle of view depends not only on the lens but also on the sensor Digital sensors are usually smaller than mm film and this causes the lens to have a narrower angle of view than with mm film by a constant factor for each sensor called the crop factor In everyday digital cameras the crop factor can range from around professional digital SLRs to consumer SLR to Micro Four Thirds ILC to most compact cameras So a standard mm lens for mm photography acts like a mm standard film lens on a professional digital SLR but would act closer to an mm lens mm on many mid market DSLRs and the degree angle of view of a standard mm lens on a film camera is equivalent to an mm lens on many digital SLRs br br br Calculating a camera s angle of view br For lenses projecting rectilinear non spatially distorted images of distant objects the effective focal length and the image format dimensions completely define the angle of view Calculations for lenses producing non rectilinear images are much more complex and in the end not very useful in most practical applications In the case of a lens with distortion e g a fisheye lens a longer lens with distortion can have a wider angle of view than a shorter lens with low distortion br Angle of view may be measured horizontally from the left to right edge of the frame vertically from the top to bottom of the frame or diagonally from one corner of the frame to its opposite corner br For a lens projecting a rectilinear image focused at infinity see derivation the angle of view can be calculated from the chosen dimension d and effective focal length f as follows br br br br br br br br arctan br br br br d br br br f br br br br br

often used though the measurements are still expressed as angles Optical tests are commonly used for measuring the FOV of UV visible and infrared wavelengths about m in the electromagnetic spectrum sensors and cameras br The purpose of this test is to measure the horizontal and vertical FOV of a lens and sensor used in an imaging system when the lens focal length or sensor size is not known that is when the calculation above is not immediately applicable Although this is one typical method that the optics industry uses to measure the FOV there exist many other possible methods br UV visible light from an integrating sphere and or other source such as a black body is focused onto a square test target at the focal plane of a collimator the mirrors in the diagram such that a virtual image of the test target will be seen infinitely far away by the camera under test The camera under test senses a real image of the virtual image of the target and the sensed image is displayed on a monitor br br The sensed image which includes the target is displayed on a monitor where it can be measured Dimensions of the full image display and of the portion of the image that is the target are

displaystyle d br br dimension of image of target br The collimator s distant virtual image of the target subtends a certain angle referred to as the angular extent of the target that depends on the collimator focal length and the target size Assuming the sensed image includes the whole target the angle seen by the camera its FOV is this angular extent of the target times the ratio of full image size to target image size br The target s angular extent is br br br br br br br br arctan br br br br L br br br br f br br c br br br br br br br br displaystyle alpha arctan frac L f c br br br

calculation could be a horizontal or a vertical FOV depending on how the target and image are measured br br br Lens types and effects br br br Focal length br br Lenses are often referred to by terms that express their angle of view br br Fisheye lenses typical focal lengths are between mm and mm for circular images and mm for full frame images Up to and beyond br A circular fisheye lens as opposed to a full frame fisheye is an example of a lens where the angle of coverage is less than the angle of view The image projected onto the film is circular because the diameter of the image projected is narrower than that needed to cover the widest portion of the film br Ultra wide angle lens is a rectilinear which is less than mm of focal length in mm film format here mm gives and mm gives br Wide angle lenses mm in mm film format cover between and br Normal or Standard lenses mm in mm film format cover between and br Long focus lenses any lens with a focal length greater than the diagonal of the film or sensor used generally have an angle of view of or less Since photographers usually only encounter the telephoto lens sub type they are referred to in common photographic parlance as br Medium telephoto a focal length of mm to mm in mm film format covering between and br Super telephoto over mm in mm film format generally cover between through less than br Zoom lenses are a special case wherein the focal length and hence angle of view of the lens can be altered mechanically without removing the lens from the camera br br br Characteristics br For a given camera subject distance longer lenses magnify the subject more For a given subject magnification and thus different camera subject distances longer lenses appear to compress distance wider lenses appear to expand the distance between objects br Another result of using a wide angle lens is a greater apparent perspective distortion when the camera is not aligned perpendicularly to the subject parallel lines converge at the same rate as with a normal lens but converge more due to the wider total field For example buildings appear to be falling backwards much more severely when the camera is pointed upward from ground level than they would if photographed with a normal lens at the same distance from the subject because more of the subject building is visible in the wide angle shot br Because different lenses generally require a different camera subject distance to preserve the size of a subject changing the angle of view can indirectly distort perspective changing the apparent relative size of the subject and foreground br If the subject image size remains the same then at any given aperture all lenses wide angle and long lenses will give the same depth of field br br br Examples br An example of how lens choice affects angle of view br br br Common lens angles of view br This table shows the diagonal horizontal and vertical angles of view in degrees for lenses producing rectilinear images when used with mm mm format that is film or full frame mm digital using width mm height mm and diagonal mm for d in the formula above Digital compact cameras sometimes state the focal lengths of their lenses in mm equivalents which can be used in this table br For comparison the human visual system perceives an angle of view of about by br br br Sensor size effects crop factor br br As noted above a camera s angle level of view depends not only on the lens but also on the sensor used Digital sensors are usually smaller than mm film causing the lens to usually behave as a longer focal length lens would behave and have a narrower angle of view than with mm film by a constant factor for each sensor called the crop factor In everyday digital cameras the crop factor can range from around professional digital SLRs to mid market SLRs to around to for compact cameras So a standard mm lens for mm photography acts like a mm standard film lens even on a professional digital SLR but would act closer to a mm mm Nikon or mm lens mm Canon on many mid market DSLRs and the degree angle of view of a standard mm lens on a film camera is equivalent to a mm lens on many digital SLRs br The table below shows the horizontal vertical and diagonal angles of view in degrees when used with mm mm format that is Canon s DSLR APS C frame size and a diagonal of mm br br br Cinematography and video gaming br br Modifying the angle of view over time known as zooming is a frequently used cinematic technique often combined with camera movement to produce a dolly zoom effect made famous by the film Vertigo Using a wide angle of view can exaggerate the camera s perceived speed and is a common technique in tracking shots phantom rides and racing video games See also Field
