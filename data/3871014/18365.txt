title: Luminance
id: 18365
Luminance is a photometric measure of the luminous intensity per unit area of light travelling in a given direction It describes the amount of light that passes through is emitted from or is reflected from a particular area and falls within a given solid angle br The procedure for conversion from spectral radiance to luminance is standardized by the CIE and ISO br Brightness is the term for the subjective impression of the objective luminance measurement standard see Objectivity science Objectivity in measurement for the importance of this contrast br The SI unit for luminance is candela per square metre cd m A non SI term for the same unit is the nit The unit in the Centimetre gram second system of units CGS which predated the SI system is the stilb which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or kcd m br br br Description br Luminance is often used to characterize emission or reflection from flat diffuse surfaces Luminance levels indicate how much luminous power could be detected by the human eye looking at a particular surface from a particular angle of view Luminance is thus an indicator of how bright the surface will appear In this case the solid angle of interest is the solid angle subtended by the eye s pupil br Luminance is used in the video industry to characterize the brightness of displays A typical computer display emits between and cd m The sun has a luminance of about cd m at noon br Luminance is invariant in geometric optics This means that for an ideal optical system the luminance at the output is the same as the input luminance br For real passive optical systems the output luminance is at most equal to the input As an example if one uses a lens to form an image that is smaller than the source object the luminous power is concentrated into a smaller area meaning that the illuminance is higher at the image The light at the image plane however fills a larger solid angle so the luminance comes out to be the same assuming there is no loss at the lens The image can never be brighter than the source br br br Health effects br br Retinal damage can occur when the eye is exposed to high luminance Damage can occur because of local heating of the retina Photochemical effects can also cause damage especially at short wavelengths br The IEC series gives guidance on safety relating to exposure of the eye to lasers which are high luminance sources The IEC series gives guidance for evaluating the photobiological safety of lamps and lamp systems including luminaires Specifically it specifies the exposure limits reference measurement technique and classification scheme for the evaluation and control of photobiological hazards from all electrically powered incoherent broadband sources of optical radiation including LEDs but excluding lasers in the wavelength range from nm through nm This standard was prepared as Standard CIE S by the International Commission on Illumination br br br Luminance meter br A luminance meter is a device used in photometry that can measure the luminance in a particular direction and with a particular solid angle The simplest devices measure the luminance in a single direction while imaging luminance meters measure luminance in a way similar to the way a digital camera records color images br br br Formulation br br The luminance of a specified point of a light source in a
