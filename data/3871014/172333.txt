title: Dispersion (optics)
id: 172333
In optics and in wave propagation in general dispersion is the phenomenon in which the phase velocity of a wave depends on its frequency sometimes the term chromatic dispersion is used for specificity to optics in particular br A medium having this common property may be termed a dispersive medium plural dispersive media br Although the term is used in the field of optics to describe light and other electromagnetic waves dispersion in the same sense can apply to any sort of wave motion such as acoustic dispersion in the case of sound and seismic waves and in gravity waves ocean waves Within optics dispersion is a property of telecommunication signals along transmission lines such as microwaves in coaxial cable or the pulses of light in optical fiber br In optics one important and familiar consequence of dispersion is the change in the angle of refraction of different colors of light as seen in the spectrum produced by a dispersive prism and in chromatic aberration of lenses Design of compound achromatic lenses in which chromatic aberration is largely cancelled uses a quantification of a glass s dispersion given by its Abbe number V where lower Abbe numbers correspond to greater dispersion over the visible spectrum In some applications such as telecommunications the absolute phase of a wave is often not important but only the propagation of wave packets or pulses in that case one is interested only in variations of group velocity with frequency so called group velocity dispersion br All common transmission media also vary in attenuation normalized to transmission length as a function of frequency leading to attenuation distortion this is not dispersion although sometimes reflections at closely spaced impedance boundaries e g crimped segments in a cable can produce signal distortion which further aggravates inconsistent transit time as observed across signal bandwidth br br br Examples br The most familiar example of dispersion is probably a rainbow in which dispersion causes the spatial separation of a white light into components of different wavelengths different colors However dispersion also has an effect in many other circumstances for example group velocity dispersion causes pulses to spread in optical fibers degrading signals over long distances also a cancellation between group velocity dispersion and nonlinear effects leads to soliton waves br br br Material and waveguide dispersion br Most often chromatic dispersion refers to bulk material dispersion that is the change in refractive index with optical frequency However in a waveguide there is also the phenomenon of waveguide dispersion in which case a wave s phase velocity in a structure depends on its frequency simply due to the structure s geometry More generally waveguide dispersion can occur for waves propagating through any inhomogeneous structure e g a photonic crystal whether or not the waves are confined to some region In a waveguide both types of dispersion will generally be present although they are not strictly additive For example in fiber optics the material and waveguide dispersion can effectively cancel each other out to produce a zero dispersion wavelength important for fast fiber optic communication br br br Material dispersion in optics br br Material dispersion can be a desirable or undesirable effect in optical applications The dispersion of light by glass prisms is used to construct spectrometers and spectroradiometers However in lenses dispersion causes chromatic aberration an undesired effect that may degrade images in microscopes telescopes and photographic objectives br The phase velocity v of a wave in a given uniform medium is given by br br br br br v br br br br c br n br br br br br br displaystyle v frac c n br br br where c is the speed of light in vacuum and n is the refractive index of the medium br In general the refractive index is some function of the frequency f of the light thus n n f or alternatively with respect to the wave s wavelength n n The wavelength dependence of a material s refractive index is usually quantified by its Abbe number or its coefficients in an empirical formula such as the Cauchy or Sellmeier equations br Because of the Kramers Kronig relations the wavelength dependence of the real part of the refractive index is related to the material absorption described by the imaginary part of the refractive index also called the extinction coefficient In particular for non magnetic materials the susceptibility that appears in the Kramers Kronig relations is the electric susceptibility e n br The most commonly seen consequence of dispersion in optics is the separation of white light into a color spectrum by a prism From Snell s law it can be seen that the angle of refraction of light in a prism depends on the refractive index of the prism material Since that refractive index varies with wavelength it follows that the angle that the light is refracted by will also vary with wavelength causing an angular separation of the colors known as angular dispersion br For visible light refraction indices n of most transparent materials e g air glasses decrease with increasing wavelength br br br br br br br n br br br br br red br br br br br n br br br br br yellow br br br br br n br br br br br blue br br br br br br br displaystyle n lambda text red n lambda text yellow n lambda text blue br br br or generally br br br br br br br br d br n br br br d br br br br br br br br br displaystyle frac dn d lambda br br br In this case the medium is said to have normal dispersion Whereas if the index increases with increasing wavelength which is typically the case in the ultraviolet the medium is said to have anomalous dispersion br At the interface of such a material with air or vacuum index of Snell s law predicts that light incident at an angle to the normal will be refracted at an angle arcsin sin n Thus blue light with a higher refractive index will be bent more strongly than red light resulting in the well known rainbow pattern br br br Group velocity dispersion br br Beyond simply describing a change in the phase velocity over wavelength a more serious consequence of dispersion in many applications is termed group velocity dispersion GVD While phase velocity v is defined as v c n this describes only one frequency component When different frequency components are combined as when considering a signal or a pulse one is often more interested in the group velocity which describes the speed at which a pulse or information superimposed on a wave modulation propagates In the accompanying animation it can be seen that the wave itself orange brown travels at a phase velocity much faster than the speed of the envelope black which corresponds to the group velocity This pulse might be a communications signal for instance and its information only travels at the group velocity rate even though it consists of wavefronts advancing at a faster rate the phase velocity br It is possible to calculate the group velocity from the refractive index curve n or more directly from the wavenumber k n c where is the radian frequency f Whereas one expression for the phase velocity is vp k the group velocity can be expressed using the derivative vg d dk Or in terms of the phase velocity vp br br br br br br v br br

frac v text p dfrac omega v text p dfrac dv text p d omega br br br When dispersion is present not only the group velocity is not equal to the phase velocity but generally it itself varies with wavelength This is known as group velocity dispersion and causes a short pulse of light to be broadened as the different frequency components within the pulse travel at different velocities Group velocity dispersion is quantified as the derivative of the reciprocal of the group velocity with respect to angular frequency which results in group velocity dispersion d k d br If a light pulse is propagated through a material with positive group velocity dispersion then the shorter wavelength components travel slower than the longer wavelength components The pulse therefore becomes positively chirped or up chirped increasing in frequency with time On the other hand if a pulse travels through a material with negative group velocity dispersion shorter wavelength components travel faster than the longer ones and the pulse becomes negatively chirped or down chirped decreasing in frequency with time br An everyday example of a negatively chirped signal in the acoustic domain is that of an approaching train hitting deformities on a welded track The sound caused by the train itself is impulsive and travels much faster in the metal tracks than in air so that the train can be heard well before it arrives However from afar it is not heard as causing impulses but leads to a distinctive descending chirp amidst reverberation caused by the complexity of the vibrational modes of the track Group velocity dispersion can be heard in that the volume of the sounds stays audible for a surprisingly long time up to several seconds br br br Dispersion control br br The result of GVD whether negative or positive is ultimately temporal spreading of the pulse This makes dispersion management extremely important in optical communications systems based on optical fiber since if dispersion is too high a group of pulses representing a bit stream will spread in time and merge rendering the bit stream unintelligible This limits the length of fiber that a signal can be sent down without regeneration One possible answer to this problem is to send signals down the optical fibre at a wavelength where the GVD is zero e g around m in silica fibres so pulses at this wavelength suffer minimal spreading from dispersion In practice however this approach causes more problems than it solves because zero GVD unacceptably amplifies other nonlinear effects such as four wave mixing Another possible option is to use soliton pulses in the regime of negative dispersion a form of optical pulse which uses a nonlinear optical effect to self maintain its shape Solitons have the practical problem however that they require a certain power level to be maintained in the pulse for the nonlinear effect to be of the correct strength Instead the solution that is currently used in practice is to perform dispersion compensation typically by matching the fiber with another fiber of opposite sign dispersion so that the dispersion effects cancel such compensation is ultimately limited by nonlinear effects such as self phase modulation which interact with dispersion to make it very difficult to undo br Dispersion control is also important in lasers that produce short pulses The overall dispersion of the optical resonator is a major factor in determining the duration of the pulses emitted by the laser A pair of prisms can be arranged to produce net negative dispersion which can be used to balance the usually positive dispersion of the laser medium Diffraction gratings can also be used to produce dispersive effects these are often used in high power laser amplifier systems Recently an alternative to prisms and gratings has been developed chirped mirrors These dielectric mirrors are coated so that different wavelengths have different penetration lengths and therefore different group delays The coating layers can be tailored to achieve a net negative dispersion br br br In waveguides br Waveguides are highly dispersive due to their geometry rather than just to their material composition Optical fibers are a sort of waveguide for optical frequencies light widely used in modern telecommunications systems The rate at which data can be transported on a single fiber is limited by pulse broadening due to chromatic dispersion among other phenomena br In general for a waveguide mode with an angular frequency at a propagation constant so that the electromagnetic fields in the propagation direction z oscillate proportional to ei z t the group velocity dispersion parameter D is defined as br br br br br D br br br br br br br br c br br br br br

velocity This formula generalizes the one in the previous section for homogeneous media and includes both waveguide dispersion and material dispersion The reason for defining the dispersion in this way is that D is the asymptotic temporal pulse spreading t per unit bandwidth br per unit distance travelled commonly reported in ps nm km for optical fibers br In the case of multi mode optical fibers so called modal dispersion will also lead to pulse broadening Even in single mode fibers pulse broadening can occur as a result of polarization mode dispersion since there are still two polarization modes These are not examples of chromatic dispersion as they are not dependent on the wavelength or bandwidth of the pulses propagated br br br Higher order dispersion over broad bandwidths br When a broad range of frequencies a broad bandwidth is present in a single wavepacket such as in an ultrashort pulse or a chirped pulse or other forms of spread spectrum transmission it may not be accurate to approximate the dispersion by a constant over the entire bandwidth and more complex calculations are required to compute effects such as pulse spreading br In particular the dispersion parameter D defined above is obtained from only one derivative of the group velocity Higher derivatives are known as higher order dispersion These terms are simply a Taylor series expansion of the dispersion relation of the medium or waveguide around some particular frequency Their effects can be computed via numerical evaluation of Fourier transforms of the waveform via integration of higher order slowly varying envelope approximations by a split step method which can use the exact dispersion relation rather than a Taylor series or by direct simulation of the full Maxwell s equations rather than an approximate envelope equation br br br Generalized formulation of the high orders of dispersion Lah Laguerre optics br The description of the chromatic dispersion in a perturbative manner through Taylor coefficients is advantageous for optimization problems where the dispersion from several different systems needs to be balanced For example in chirp pulse laser amplifiers the pulses are first stretched in time by a stretcher to avoid optical damage Then in the amplification process the pulses accumulate inevitably linear and nonlinear phase passing through materials And lastly the pulses are compressed in various types of compressors To cancel any residual higher orders in the accumulated phase usually individual orders are measured and balanced However for uniform systems such perturbative description is often not needed i e propagation in waveguides br The dispersion orders have been generalized in a computationally friendly manner in the form of

pulses at very regular intervals ranging from milliseconds to seconds Astronomers believe that the pulses are emitted simultaneously over a wide range of frequencies However as observed on Earth the components of each pulse emitted at higher radio frequencies arrive before those emitted at lower frequencies This dispersion occurs because of the ionized component of the interstellar medium mainly
