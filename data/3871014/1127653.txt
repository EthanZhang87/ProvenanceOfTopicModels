The L scher color test is a psychological test invented by Max L scher in Basel Switzerland first published in in German and first translated to English in The simplest form of the test instructs a subject to order a series of colors in order of preference This test claims that the order of preference can reveal characteristics of the subject s personality The simplicity of the test has allowed it to be heavily tested br br br History br L scher developed his color test during his doctoral studies at the University of Basel He first published the idea at the first World Congress of Psychology in Lausanne in and later as his thesis in titled Color as a Psychological Means of Examination After expanding and publishing his ideas throughout the next decades the test gained widespread popularity as it was first translated to English in the editions br br br Methodology br In the simple short or color test as published in a subject is presented with cards each containing a color The colors include basic blue yellow red green and auxiliary violet brown grey and black colors The subject is instructed to select the color that they like best or feel the most sympathy toward This selection is performed iteratively with the remaining colors until all the colors have been ordered by preference The order is recorded with each color corresponding to a numerical value br A series of symbols are applied to the results in pairs to indicate the subject s relationship to the color where br br For each symbol the color pair can then be analyzed individually For example a strong preference for gray and black indicates that the subject br br feels he has been unjustly and undeservedly treated and betrayed in his hopes and is disgruntled and in revolt against his existing circumstances which he considers and affront br Finally a th pair comprising the first and last colors can be analyzed e g Each combination gives a percentage for how often it was chosen in L scher s prior tests of students Stars are also sometimes indicated where a high number of accumulated stars can be interpreted as a potential psychological disorder br The test can then be repeated If the second test run differs from the first it is assumed that the latter is more spontaneous and therefore more authentic br Alternatively the full test can also be used but this was only published by L scher in German and was not included as part of the initial English translations br br br Psychological basis br L scher believed that sensory perception of color is objective and universally shared by all but that color preferences are subjective and that this distinction allows subjective states to be objectively measured by using test colors L scher believed that because the color selections are guided in an unconscious manner they reveal the person as they really are not as they perceive themselves or would like to be perceived br L scher believed that personality traits could be identified based on one s choice of color Therefore subjects who select identical color combinations have similar personalities In order to measure this he conducted a test in which subjects were shown different colored cards and asked to place them in order of preference Colors are divided between basic blue yellow red green and auxiliary violet brown grey and black br br After subjects placed the cards in order from most liked to least liked they were asked to evaluate the extent to which their personalities matched the descriptive statements formed by L scher of each color br The results of the L scher color diagnostic contain indications pertaining to personal assessment and special professional recommendations as to how psychological stress and the resulting physical symptoms can be avoided It also offers additional information for verbal and homeopathic therapy br br br Criticism br The test ranks high on a published list of discredited procedures in psychology It lacks construct validity and is considered as example of the Barnum effect where an ostensible personality analysis actually consisting of vague generalities applicable to the majority of people is reported to be accurate by subjects who had completed a personality test before reviewing their results A comparison of the L scher color test and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory MMPI found little agreement between the two tests prompting the authors to urge cautious use of the former Some still stand up for the L scher color test as providing high accuracy in a non verbal test involving as few as eight colors especially in children even though the majority of the scientific community puts it high on discredited tests lists br Most validation studies do not find the L scher color test to be meaningful but one validation study has recommended it as a possible pre screening for Taylor Johnson Temperament Analysis br The original English translation contains an extensive bibliography supporting the test However an analysis of the references found that many of them do not even exist br br br Applications br br The L scher color test has been applied to the assessment of criminality br br br Footnotes br br br See also br Personality psychology br Rorschach test br br br br br br External links br L scher color test home page multilingual including English br rd
