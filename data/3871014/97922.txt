Digital image processing is the use of a digital computer to process digital images through an algorithm As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build up of noise and distortion during processing Since images are defined over two dimensions perhaps more digital image processing may be modeled in the form of multidimensional systems The generation and development of digital image processing are mainly affected by three factors first the development of computers second the development of mathematics especially the creation and improvement of discrete mathematics theory third the demand for a wide range of applications in environment agriculture military industry and medical science has increased br br br History br br Many of the techniques of digital image processing or digital picture processing as it often was called were developed in the s at Bell Laboratories the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology University of Maryland and a few other research facilities with application to satellite imagery wire photo standards conversion medical imaging videophone character recognition and photograph enhancement The purpose of early image processing was to improve the quality of the image It was aimed for human beings to improve the visual effect of people In image processing the input is a low quality image and the output is an image with improved quality Common image processing include image enhancement restoration encoding and compression The first successful application was the American Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL They used image processing techniques such as geometric correction gradation transformation noise removal etc on the thousands of lunar photos sent back by the Space Detector Ranger in taking into account the position of the Sun and the environment of the Moon The impact of the successful mapping of the Moon s surface map by the computer has been a success Later more complex image processing was performed on the nearly photos sent back by the spacecraft so that the topographic map color map and panoramic mosaic of the Moon were obtained which achieved extraordinary results and laid a solid foundation for human landing on the Moon br The cost of processing was fairly high however with the computing equipment of that era That changed in the s when digital image processing proliferated as cheaper computers and dedicated hardware became available This led to images being processed in real time for some dedicated problems such as television standards conversion As general purpose computers became faster they started to take over the role of dedicated hardware for all but the most specialized and computer intensive operations With the fast computers and signal processors available in the s digital image processing has become the most common form of image processing and is generally used because it is not only the most versatile method but also the cheapest br br br Image sensors br br The basis for modern image sensors is metal oxide semiconductor MOS technology which originates from the invention of the MOSFET MOS field effect transistor by Mohamed M Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in This led to the development of digital semiconductor image sensors including the charge coupled device CCD and later the CMOS sensor br The charge coupled device was invented by Willard S Boyle and George E Smith at Bell Labs in While researching MOS technology they realized that an electric charge was the analogy of the magnetic bubble and that it could be stored on a tiny MOS capacitor As it was fairly straightforward to fabricate a series of MOS capacitors in a row they connected a suitable voltage to them so that the charge could be stepped along from one to the next The CCD is a semiconductor circuit that was later used in the first digital video cameras for television broadcasting br The NMOS active pixel sensor APS was invented by Olympus in Japan during the mid s This was enabled by advances in MOS semiconductor device fabrication with MOSFET scaling reaching smaller micron and then sub micron levels The NMOS APS was fabricated by Tsutomu Nakamura s team at Olympus in The CMOS active pixel sensor CMOS sensor was later developed by Eric Fossum s team at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in By sales of CMOS sensors had surpassed CCD sensors br MOS image sensors are widely used in optical mouse technology The first optical mouse invented by Richard F Lyon at Xerox in used a m NMOS integrated circuit sensor chip Since the first commercial optical mouse the IntelliMouse introduced in most optical mouse devices use CMOS sensors br br br Image compression br br An important development in digital image compression technology was the discrete cosine transform DCT a lossy compression technique first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in DCT compression became the basis for JPEG which was introduced by the Joint Photographic Experts Group in JPEG compresses images down to much smaller file sizes and has become the most widely used image file format on the Internet Its highly efficient DCT compression algorithm was largely responsible for the wide proliferation of digital images and digital photos with several billion JPEG images produced every day as of br Medical imaging techniques produce very large amounts of data especially from CT MRI and PET modalities As a result storage and communications of electronic image data are prohibitive without the use of compression JPEG image compression is used by the DICOM standard for storage and transmission of medical images The cost and feasibility of accessing large image data sets over low or various bandwidths are further addressed by use of another DICOM standard called JPIP to enable efficient streaming of the JPEG compressed image data br br br Digital signal processor DSP br br Electronic signal processing was revolutionized by the wide adoption of MOS technology in the s MOS integrated circuit technology was the basis for the first single chip microprocessors and microcontrollers in the early s and then the first single chip digital signal processor DSP chips in the late s DSP chips have since been widely used in digital image processing br The discrete cosine transform DCT image compression algorithm has been widely implemented in DSP chips with many companies developing DSP chips based on DCT technology DCTs are widely used for encoding decoding video coding audio coding multiplexing control signals signaling analog to digital conversion formatting luminance and color differences and color formats such as YUV and YUV DCTs are also used for encoding operations such as motion estimation motion compensation inter frame prediction quantization perceptual weighting entropy encoding variable encoding and motion vectors and decoding operations such as the inverse operation between different color formats YIQ YUV and RGB for display purposes DCTs are also commonly used for high definition television HDTV encoder decoder chips br br br Medical imaging br br In the engineer from British company EMI Housfield invented the X ray computed tomography device for head diagnosis which is what is usually called CT computer tomography The CT nucleus method is based on the projection of the human head section and is processed by computer to reconstruct the cross sectional image which is called image reconstruction In EMI successfully developed a CT device for the whole body which obtained a clear tomographic image of various parts of the human body In this diagnostic technique won the Nobel Prize Digital image processing technology for medical applications was inducted into the Space Foundation Space Technology Hall of Fame in br As of billion medical imaging studies had been conducted worldwide Radiation exposure from medical imaging in made up about of total ionizing radiation exposure in the United States Medical imaging equipment is manufactured using technology from the semiconductor industry including CMOS integrated circuit chips power semiconductor devices sensors such as image sensors particularly CMOS sensors and biosensors and processors such as microcontrollers microprocessors digital signal processors media processors and system on chip devices As of annual shipments of medical imaging chips amount to million units and billion br br br Tasks br Digital image processing allows the use of much more complex algorithms and hence can offer both more sophisticated performance at simple tasks and the implementation of methods which would be impossible by analogue means br In particular digital image processing is a concrete application of and a practical technology based on br br Classification br Feature extraction br Multi scale signal analysis br Pattern recognition br Projection br Some techniques which are used in digital image processing include br br Anisotropic diffusion br Hidden Markov models br Image editing br Image restoration br Independent component analysis br Linear filtering br Neural networks br Partial differential equations br Pixelation br Point feature matching br Principal components analysis br Self organizing maps br Wavelets br br br Digital image transformations br br br Filtering br Digital filters are used to blur and sharpen digital images Filtering can be performed by br br convolution with specifically designed kernels filter array in the spatial domain br masking specific frequency regions in the frequency Fourier domain br The following examples show both methods br br br Image padding in Fourier domain filtering br Images are typically padded before being transformed to the Fourier space the highpass filtered images below illustrate the consequences of different padding techniques br br Notice that the highpass filter shows extra edges when zero padded compared to the repeated edge padding br br br Filtering code examples br MATLAB example for spatial domain highpass filtering br br br Affine transformations br Affine transformations enable basic image transformations including scale rotate translate mirror and shear as is shown in the following examples br br To apply the affine matrix to an image the image is converted to matrix in which each entry corresponds to the pixel intensity at that location Then each pixel s location can be represented as a vector indicating the coordinates of that pixel in the image x y where x and y are the row and column of a pixel in the image matrix This allows the coordinate to be multiplied by an affine transformation matrix which gives the position that the pixel value will be copied to in the output image br However to allow transformations that require translation transformations dimensional homogeneous coordinates are needed The third dimension is usually set to a non zero constant usually so that the new coordinate is x y This allows the coordinate vector to be multiplied by a by matrix enabling translation shifts So the third dimension which is the constant allows translation br Because matrix multiplication is associative multiple affine transformations can be combined into a single affine transformation by multiplying the matrix of each individual transformation in the order that the transformations are done This results in a single matrix that when applied to a point vector gives the same result as all the individual transformations performed on the vector x y in sequence Thus a sequence of affine transformation matrices can be reduced to a single affine transformation matrix br For example dimensional coordinates only allow rotation about the origin But dimensional homogeneous coordinates can be used to first translate any point to then perform the rotation and lastly translate the origin back to the original point the opposite of the first translation These affine transformations can be combined into a single matrix thus allowing rotation around any point in the image br br br Image denoising with Morphology br Mathematical morphology is suitable for denoising images Structuring element are important in Mathematical morphology br The following examples are about Structuring elements The denoise function image as I and structuring element as B are shown as below and table br e g br br br br br br I br br br br br br br br br

dilation while the closing method is vice versa In reality the D I B and E I B can implemented by Convolution br br br Applications br br br Digital camera images br Digital cameras generally include specialized digital image processing hardware either dedicated chips or added circuitry on other chips to convert the raw data from their image sensor into a color corrected image in a standard image file format Additional post processing techniques increase edge sharpness or color saturation to create more naturally looking images br br br Film br Westworld was the first feature film to use the digital image processing to pixellate photography to simulate an android s point of view Image processing is also vastly used to produce the chroma key effect that replaces the background of actors with natural or artistic scenery br br br Face detection br br Face detection can be implemented with Mathematical morphology Discrete cosine transform which is usually called DCT and horizontal Projection mathematics br General method with feature based method br The feature based method of face detection is using skin tone edge detection face shape and feature of a face like eyes mouth etc to achieve face detection The skin tone face shape and all the unique elements that only the human face have can be described as features br Process explanation br br Given a batch of face images first extract the skin tone range by sampling face images The skin tone range is just a skin filter br Structural similarity index measure SSIM can be applied to compare images in terms of extracting the skin tone br Normally HSV or RGB color spaces are suitable for the skin filter E g HSV mode the skin tone range is br After filtering images with skin tone to get the face edge morphology and DCT are used to remove noise and fill up missing skin areas br Opening method or closing method can be used to achieve filling up missing skin br DCT is to avoid the object with tone like skin Since human faces always have higher texture br Sobel operator or other operators can be applied to detect face edge br To position human features like eyes using the projection and find the peak of the histogram of projection help to get the detail feature like mouth hair and lip br Projection is just projecting the image to see the high frequency which is usually the feature position br br br Improvement of image quality method br Image quality can be influenced by camera vibration over exposure gray level distribution too centralized and noise etc For example noise problem can be solved by Smoothing method while gray level distribution problem can be improved by histogram equalization br Smoothing method br In drawing if there is some dissatisfied color taking some color around dissatisfied color and averaging them This is an easy way to think of Smoothing method br Smoothing method can be implemented with mask and Convolution Take the small image and mask for instance as below br image is br
