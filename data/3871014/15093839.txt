A color triangle is an arrangement of colors within a triangle based on the additive or subtractive combination of three primary colors at its corners br An additive color space defined by three primary colors has a chromaticity gamut that is a color triangle when the amounts of the primaries are constrained to be nonnegative br Before the theory of additive color was proposed by Thomas Young and further developed by James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz triangles were also used to organize colors for example around a system of red yellow and blue primary colors br After the development of the CIE system color triangles were used as chromaticity diagrams including briefly with the trilinear coordinates representing the chromaticity values Since the sum of the three chromaticity values has a fixed value it suffices to depict only two of the three values using Cartesian co ordinates In the modern x y diagram the large triangle bounded by the imaginary primaries X Y and Z has corners and respectively color triangles with real primaries are often shown within this space br br br Maxwell s disc br Maxwell was intrigued by James David Forbes s use of color tops By rapidly spinning the top Forbes created the illusion of a single color that was a mixture of the primaries br br The experiments of Professor J D Forbes which I witnessed in established that blue and yellow do not make green but a pinkish tint when neither prevails in the combination and the result of mixing yellow and blue was I believe not previously known br Maxwell took this a step further by using a circular scale around the rim with which to measure the ratios of the primaries choosing vermilion V emerald EG and ultramarine U br Initially he compared the color he observed on the spinning top with a paper of different color in order to find a match Later he mounted a pair of papers snow white SW and ivory black Bk in an inner circle thereby creating shades of gray By adjusting the ratio of primaries he matched the observed gray of the inner wheel for example br br br br br br V br br br U br br br E br G br br br S br W br br br B br K br br br displaystyle V U EG SW BK br br br To determine the chromaticity of an arbitrary color he replaced one of the primaries with a sample of the test color and adjusted the ratios until he found a match For pale chrome PC he found br br br br br P br C br br br U br br br E br G br br br S br W br br br B br K br br br displaystyle PC U EG SW BK br br Next he rearranged the equation to express the test color PC in this example in terms of the primaries br This would be the precursor to the color matching functions of the CIE color space whose chromaticity diagram is shown above br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br See also br Color wheel br br br
