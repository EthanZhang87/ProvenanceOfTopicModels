An optical prism is a transparent optical element with flat polished surfaces that are designed to refract light At least one surface must be angled elements with two parallel surfaces are not prisms The most familiar type of optical prism is the triangular prism which has a triangular base and rectangular sides Not all optical prisms are geometric prisms and not all geometric prisms would count as an optical prism Prisms can be made from any material that is transparent to the wavelengths for which they are designed Typical materials include glass acrylic and fluorite br A dispersive prism can be used to break white light up into its constituent spectral colors the colors of the rainbow to form a spectrum as described in the following section Other types of prisms noted below can be used to reflect light or to split light into components with different polarizations br br br Types br br br Dispersive br br Dispersive prisms are used to break up light into its constituent spectral colors because the refractive index depends on wavelength the white light entering the prism is a mixture of different wavelengths each of which gets bent slightly differently Blue light is slowed more than red light and will therefore be bent more than red light br br Triangular prism br Amici prism and other types of compound prisms br Littrow prism with mirror on its rear facet br Pellin Broca prism br Abbe prism br Grism a dispersive prism with a diffraction grating on its surface br F ry prism br Spectral dispersion is the best known property of optical prisms although not the most frequent purpose of using optical prisms in practice br br br Reflective br Reflective prisms are used to reflect light in order to flip invert rotate deviate or displace the light beam They are typically used to erect the image in binoculars or single lens reflex cameras without the prisms the image would be upside down for the user br Reflective prisms use total internal reflection to achieve near perfect reflection of light that strikes the facets at a sufficiently oblique angle Prisms are usually made of optical glass which combined with anti reflective coating of input and output facets leads to significantly lower light loss than metallic mirrors br br Odd number of reflections image projects as flipped mirrored br triangular prism reflector projects image sideways chromatic dispersion is zero in case of perpendicular input and output incidence br Roof pentaprism projects image sideways flipped along the other axis br Dove prism projects image forward br Corner cube retroreflector projects image backwards br Even number of reflections image projects upright without change in handedness may or may not be rotated br Porro prism projects image backwards and displaced br Porro Abbe prism projects image forward rotated by and displaced br Perger prism a development based on the Porro Abbe prism projects image forward rotated by and displaced br Abbe Koenig prism projects image forward rotated by and collinear internal reflections reflections are on roof plains br Bauernfeind prism projects image sideways inclined by br Amici roof prism projects image sideways br Pentaprism projects image sideways br Schmidt Pechan prism projects image forward rotated by reflections reflections are on roof plains composed of Bauernfeind part and Schmidt part br Uppendahl prism projects image forward rotated by and collinear reflections reflections are on roof plains composed of prisms cemented together br br br Beam splitting br br Various thin film optical layers can be deposited on the hypotenuse of one right angled prism and cemented to another prism to form a beam splitter cube br Overall optical performance of such a cube is determined by the thin layer br In comparison with a usual glass substrate the glass cube provides protection of the thin film layer from both sides and better mechanical stability The cube can also eliminate etalon effects back side reflection and slight beam deflection br br dichroic color filters form a dichroic prism br Polarizing cube beamsplitters have lower extinction ratio than birefringent ones but less expensive br Partially metallized mirrors provide non polarizing beamsplitters br Air gap When hypotenuses of two triangular prisms are stacked very close to each other with air gap frustrated total internal reflection in one prism makes it possible to couple part of the radiation into a propagating wave in the second prism The transmitted power drops exponentially with the gap width so it can be tuned over many orders of magnitude by a micrometric screw br Biprism or Fresnel biprism two prisms joined at their bases forming a wide vertex angle used in common path interferometry br br br Polarizing br br Another class is formed by polarizing prisms which use birefringence to split a beam of light into components of varying polarization In the visible and UV regions they have very low losses and their extinction ratio typically exceeds br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br which is superior to other types of polarizers They may or may not employ total internal reflection br br One polarization is separated by total internal reflection br Nicol prism br Glan Foucault prism br Glan Taylor prism a high power variant of which is also denoted as Glan laser prism br Glan Thompson prism br One polarization is deviated by different refraction only br Rochon prism br S narmont prism br Both polarizations are deviated by refraction br Wollaston prism br Nomarski prism a variant of the Wollaston prism where p and s components emerge displaced and converging towards each other important for differential interference contrast microscopy br Both polarizations stay parallel but are spatially separated br polarisation beam displacers typically made of thick anisotropic crystal with plan parallel facets br These are typically made of a birefringent crystalline material like calcite but other materials like quartz and BBO may be necessary for UV applications and others MgF YVO and TiO will extend transmission farther into the infrared spectral range br Prisms made of isotropic materials like glass will also alter polarization of light as partial reflection under oblique angles does not maintain the amplitude ratio nor phase of the s and p polarized components of the light leading to general elliptical polarization This is generally an unwanted effect of dispersive prisms In some cases this can be avoided by choosing prism geometry which light enters and exits under perpendicular angle by compensation through non planar light trajectory or by use of p polarized light br Total internal reflection alters only the mutual phase between s and p polarized light Under well chosen angle of incidence this phase is close to br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle pi br br br br Fresnel rhomb uses this effect to achieve conversion between circular and linear polarisation This phase difference is not explicitly dependent on wavelength but only on refractive index so Fresnel rhombs made of low dispersion glasses achieve much broader spectral range than quarter wave plates They displace the beam however br Doubled Fresnel rhomb with quadruple reflection and zero beam displacement substitutes a half wave plate br Similar effect can also be used to make a polarization maintaining optics br br br Depolarizers br br Birefringent crystals can be assembled in a way that leads to apparent depolarization of the light br br Cornu depolarizer br Lyot depolarizer br Depolarization would not be observed for an ideal monochromatic plane wave as actually both devices turn reduced temporal coherence or spatial coherence respectively of the beam into decoherence of its polarization components br br br Other uses br Total internal reflection in prisms finds numerous uses through optics plasmonics and microscopy In particular br br Prisms are used to couple propagating light to surface plasmons Either the hypotenuse of a triangular prism is metallized Kretschmann configuration or evanescent wave is coupled to very close metallic surface Otto configuration br Some laser active media can be formed as a prism where the low quality pump beam enters the front facet while the amplified beam undergoes total internal reflection under grazing incidence from it Such a design suffers less from thermal stress and is easy to be pumped by high power laser diodes br br Other uses of prisms are based on their beam deviating refraction br br Wedge prisms are used to deflect a beam of monochromatic light by a fixed angle A pair of such prisms can be used for beam steering by rotating the prisms the beam can be deflected into any desired angle within a conical field of regard The most commonly found implementation is a Risley prism pair br Transparent windows of e g vacuum chambers or cuvettes can also be slightly wedged While this does not reduce reflection it suppresses Fabry P rot interferences that would otherwise modulate their transmission spectrum br Anamorphic pair of similar but asymmetrically placed prisms can also change the profile of a beam This is often used to make a round beam from the elliptical output of a laser diode With its monochromatic light slight chromatic dispersion arising from different wedge inclination is not a problem br Deck prisms were used on sailing ships to bring daylight below deck since candles and kerosene lamps are a fire hazard on wooden ships br br br In optometry br br By shifting corrective lenses off axis images seen through them can be displaced in the same way that a prism displaces images Eye care professionals use prisms as well as lenses off axis to treat various orthoptics problems br br Diplopia double vision br Positive and negative fusion problems br Prism spectacles with a single prism perform a relative displacement of the two eyes thereby correcting eso exo hyper or hypotropia br In contrast spectacles with prisms of equal power for both eyes called yoked prisms also conjugate prisms ambient lenses or performance glasses shift the visual field of both eyes to the same extent br br br See also br br Minimum deviation br Multiple prism dispersion theory br Prism compressor br Prism
