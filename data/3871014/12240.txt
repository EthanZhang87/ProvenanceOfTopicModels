Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au from the Latin word aurum and the atomic number In its pure form it is a bright slightly orange yellow dense soft malleable and ductile metal Chemically gold is a transition metal a group element and one of the noble metals It is one of the least reactive chemical elements being the second lowest in the reactivity series It is solid under standard conditions br Gold often occurs in free elemental native state as nuggets or grains in rocks veins and alluvial deposits It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver as in electrum naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium and mineral inclusions such as within pyrite Less commonly it occurs in minerals as gold compounds often with tellurium gold tellurides br Gold is resistant to most acids though it does dissolve in aqua regia a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid forming a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion Gold is insoluble in nitric acid alone which dissolves silver and base metals a property long used to refine gold and confirm the presence of gold in metallic substances giving rise to the term acid test Gold dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide which are used in mining and electroplating Gold also dissolves in mercury forming amalgam alloys and as the gold acts simply as a solute this is not a chemical reaction br A relatively rare element gold is a precious metal that has been used for coinage jewelry and other works of art throughout recorded history In the past a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy Gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the s and the world gold standard was abandoned for a fiat currency system after the Nixon shock measures of br In the world s largest gold producer was China followed by Russia and Australia As of a total of around tonnes of gold exist above ground This is equal to a cube with each side measuring roughly meters ft The world s consumption of new gold produced is about in jewelry in investments and in industry Gold s high malleability ductility resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions as well as conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices its chief industrial use Gold is also used in infrared shielding the production of colored glass gold leafing and tooth restoration Certain gold salts are still used as anti inflammatory agents in medicine br br br Characteristics br br Gold is the most malleable of all metals It can be drawn into a wire of single atom width and then stretched considerably before it breaks Such nanowires distort via the formation reorientation and migration of dislocations and crystal twins without noticeable hardening A single gram of gold can be beaten into a sheet of square metre sq ft and an avoirdupois ounce into square metres sq ft Gold leaf can be beaten thin enough to become semi transparent The transmitted light appears greenish blue because gold strongly reflects yellow and red Such semi transparent sheets also strongly reflect infrared light making them useful as infrared radiant heat shields in the visors of heat resistant suits and in sun visors for spacesuits Gold is a good conductor of heat and electricity br Gold has a density of g cm almost identical to that of tungsten at g cm as such tungsten has been used in the counterfeiting of gold bars such as by plating a tungsten bar with gold By comparison the density of lead is g cm and that of the densest element osmium is g cm br br br Color br br Whereas most metals are gray or silvery white gold is slightly reddish yellow This color is determined by the frequency of plasma oscillations among the metal s valence electrons in the ultraviolet range for most metals but in the visible range for gold due to relativistic effects affecting the orbitals around gold atoms Similar effects impart a golden hue to metallic caesium br Common colored gold alloys include the distinctive eighteen karat rose gold created by the addition of copper Alloys containing palladium or nickel are also important in commercial jewelry as these produce white gold alloys Fourteen karat gold copper alloy is nearly identical in color to certain bronze alloys and both may be used to produce police and other badges Fourteen and eighteen karat gold alloys with silver alone appear greenish yellow and are referred to as green gold Blue gold can be made by alloying with iron and purple gold can be made by alloying with aluminium Less commonly addition of manganese indium and other elements can produce more unusual colors of gold for various applications br Colloidal gold used by electron microscopists is red if the particles are small larger particles of colloidal gold are blue br br br Isotopes br br Gold has only one stable isotope Au which is also its only naturally occurring isotope so gold is both a mononuclidic and monoisotopic element Thirty six radioisotopes have been synthesized ranging in atomic mass from to The most stable of these is Au with a half life of days The least stable is Au which decays by proton emission with a half life of s Most of gold s radioisotopes with atomic masses below decay by some combination of proton emission decay and decay The exceptions are Au which decays by electron capture and Au which decays most often by electron capture with a minor decay path All of gold s radioisotopes with atomic masses above decay by decay br At least nuclear isomers have also been characterized ranging in atomic mass from to Within that range only Au Au Au Au and Au do not have isomers Gold s most stable isomer is m Au with a half life of days Gold s least stable isomer is m Au with a half life of only ns m Au has three decay paths decay isomeric transition and alpha decay No other isomer or isotope of gold has three decay paths br br br Synthesis br br The possible production of gold from a more common element such as lead has long been a subject of human inquiry and the ancient and medieval discipline of alchemy often focused on it however the transmutation of the chemical elements did not become possible until the understanding of nuclear physics in the th century The first synthesis of gold was conducted by Japanese physicist Hantaro Nagaoka who synthesized gold from mercury in by neutron bombardment An American team working without knowledge of Nagaoka s prior study conducted the same experiment in achieving the same result and showing that the isotopes of gold produced by it were all radioactive In Glenn Seaborg transmuted several thousand atoms of bismuth into gold at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Gold can be manufactured in a nuclear reactor but doing so is highly impractical and would cost far more than the value of the gold that is produced br br br Chemistry br br Although gold is the most noble of the noble metals it still forms many diverse compounds The oxidation state of gold in its compounds ranges from to but Au I and Au III dominate its chemistry Au I referred to as the aurous ion is the most common oxidation state with soft ligands such as thioethers thiolates and organophosphines Au I compounds are typically linear A good example is Au CN which is the soluble form of gold encountered in mining The binary gold halides such as AuCl form zigzag polymeric chains again featuring linear coordination at Au Most drugs based on gold are Au I derivatives br Au III referred to as auric is a common oxidation state and is illustrated by gold III chloride Au Cl The gold atom centers in Au III complexes like other d compounds are typically square planar with chemical bonds that have both covalent and ionic character Gold I III chloride is also known an example of a mixed valence complex br Gold does not react with oxygen at any temperature and up to C is resistant to attack

react with sulfur directly but gold III sulfide can be made by passing hydrogen sulfide through a dilute solution of gold III chloride or chlorauric acid br Unlike sulfur phosphorus reacts directly with gold at elevated temperatures to produce gold phosphide Au P br Gold readily dissolves in mercury at room temperature to form an amalgam and forms alloys with many other metals at higher temperatures These alloys can be produced to modify the hardness and other metallurgical properties to control melting point or to create exotic colors br Gold is unaffected by most acids It does not react with hydrofluoric hydrochloric hydrobromic hydriodic sulfuric or nitric acid It does react with selenic acid and is dissolved by aqua regia a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid Nitric acid oxidizes the metal to ions but only in minute amounts typically undetectable in the pure acid because of the chemical equilibrium of the reaction However the ions are removed from the equilibrium by hydrochloric acid forming AuCl ions or chloroauric acid thereby enabling further oxidation br br br br br br br br Au br br br br br br br br H br br br br br br br br br SeO br br br br br br br

cyanide under alkaline conditions when oxygen is present to form soluble complexes br Common oxidation states of gold include gold I or aurous compounds and gold III or auric compounds Gold ions in solution are readily reduced and precipitated as metal by adding any other metal as the reducing agent The added metal is oxidized and dissolves allowing the gold to be displaced from solution and be recovered as a solid precipitate br br br Rare oxidation states br Less common oxidation states of gold include and br The oxidation state occurs in aurides compounds containing the Au anion Caesium auride CsAu for example crystallizes in the caesium chloride motif rubidium potassium and tetramethylammonium aurides are also known Gold has the highest electron affinity of any metal at kJ mol making Au a stable species analogous to the halides br Gold also has a oxidation state in covalent complexes with the group transition metals such as in titanium tetraauride and the analogous zirconium and hafnium compounds These chemicals are expected to form gold bridged dimers in a manner similar to titanium IV hydride br Gold II compounds are usually diamagnetic with Au Au bonds such as Au CH P C H Cl The evaporation of a solution of Au OH in concentrated H SO produces red crystals of gold II sulfate Au SO Originally thought to be a mixed valence compound it has been shown to contain Au cations analogous to the better known mercury I ion Hg A gold II complex the tetraxenonogold II cation which contains xenon as a ligand occurs in AuXe Sb F In September a novel type of metal halide perovskite material consisting of Au and Au cations in its crystal structure has been found It has been shown to be unexpectedly stable at normal conditions br Gold pentafluoride along with its derivative anion AuF and its difluorine complex gold heptafluoride is the sole example of gold V the highest verified oxidation state br Some gold compounds exhibit aurophilic bonding which describes the tendency of gold ions to interact at distances that are too long to be a conventional Au Au bond but shorter than van der Waals bonding The interaction is estimated to be comparable in strength to that of a hydrogen bond br Well defined cluster compounds are numerous In some cases gold has a fractional oxidation state A representative example is the octahedral species Au P C H br br br Origin br br br Gold production in the universe br br Gold is thought to have been produced in supernova nucleosynthesis and from the collision of neutron stars and to have been present in the dust from which the Solar System formed br Traditionally gold in the universe is thought to have formed by the r process rapid neutron capture in supernova nucleosynthesis but more recently it has been suggested that gold and other elements heavier than iron may also be produced in quantity by the r process in the collision of neutron stars In both cases satellite spectrometers at first only indirectly detected the resulting gold However in August the spectroscopic signatures of heavy elements including gold were observed by electromagnetic observatories in the GW neutron star merger event after gravitational wave detectors confirmed the event as a neutron star merger Current astrophysical models suggest that this single neutron star merger event generated between and Earth masses of gold This amount along with estimations of the rate of occurrence of these neutron star merger events suggests that such mergers may produce enough gold to account for most of the abundance of this element in the universe br br br Asteroid origin theories br Because the Earth was molten when it was formed almost all of the gold present in the early Earth probably sank into the planetary core Therefore as hypothesized in one model most of the gold in the Earth s crust and mantle is thought to have been delivered to Earth by asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment about billion years ago br Gold which is reachable by humans has in one case been associated with a particular asteroid impact The asteroid that formed Vredefort impact structure billion years ago is often credited with seeding the Witwatersrand basin in South Africa with the richest gold deposits on earth However this scenario is now questioned The gold bearing Witwatersrand rocks were laid down between and million years before the Vredefort impact These gold bearing rocks had furthermore been covered by a thick layer of Ventersdorp lavas and the Transvaal Supergroup of rocks before the meteor struck and thus the gold did not actually arrive in the asteroid meteorite What the Vredefort impact achieved however was to distort the Witwatersrand basin in such a way that the gold bearing rocks were brought to the present erosion surface in Johannesburg on the Witwatersrand just inside the rim of the original km mi diameter crater caused by the meteor strike The discovery of the deposit in launched the Witwatersrand Gold Rush Some of all the gold that is ascertained to exist today on Earth has been extracted from these Witwatersrand rocks br br br Mantle return theories br Much of the rest of the gold on Earth is thought to have been incorporated into the planet since its very beginning as planetesimals formed the mantle In an international group of scientists established that gold came to the Earth s surface from the deepest regions of our planet the mantle as evidenced by their findings at Deseado Massif in the Argentinian Patagonia br br br Occurrence br br On Earth gold is found in ores in rock formed from the Precambrian time onward It most often occurs as a native metal typically in a metal solid solution with silver i e as a gold silver alloy Such alloys usually have a silver content of Electrum is elemental gold with more than silver and is commonly known as white gold Electrum s color runs from golden silvery to silvery dependent upon the silver content The more silver the lower the specific gravity br br Native gold occurs as very small to microscopic particles embedded in rock often together with quartz or sulfide minerals such as fool s gold which is a pyrite These are called lode deposits The metal in a native state is also found in the form of free flakes grains or larger nuggets that have been eroded from rocks and end up in alluvial deposits called placer deposits Such free gold is always richer at the exposed surface of gold bearing veins owing to the oxidation of accompanying minerals followed by weathering and by washing of the dust into streams and rivers where it collects and can be welded by water action to form nuggets br Gold sometimes occurs combined with tellurium as the minerals calaverite krennerite nagyagite petzite and sylvanite see telluride minerals and as the rare bismuthide maldonite Au Bi and antimonide aurostibite AuSb Gold also occurs in rare alloys with copper lead and mercury the minerals auricupride Cu Au novodneprite AuPb and weishanite Au Ag Hg br A research paper suggests that microbes can sometimes play an important role in forming gold deposits transporting and precipitating gold to form grains and nuggets that collect in alluvial deposits br A study has claimed water in faults vaporizes during an earthquake depositing gold When an earthquake strikes it moves along a fault Water often lubricates faults filling in fractures and jogs About kilometres mi below the surface under very high temperatures and pressures the water carries high concentrations of carbon dioxide silica and gold During an earthquake the fault jog suddenly opens wider The water inside the void instantly vaporizes flashing to steam and forcing silica which forms the mineral quartz and gold out of the fluids and onto nearby surfaces br br br Seawater br The world s oceans contain gold Measured concentrations of gold in the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific are femtomol L or parts per quadrillion about g km In general gold concentrations for south Atlantic and central Pacific samples are the same femtomol L but less certain Mediterranean deep waters contain slightly higher concentrations of gold femtomol L attributed to wind blown dust or rivers At parts per quadrillion the Earth s oceans would hold tonnes of gold These figures are three orders of magnitude less than reported in the literature prior to indicating contamination problems with the earlier data br A number of people have claimed to be able to economically recover gold from sea water but they were either mistaken or acted in an intentional deception Prescott Jernegan ran a gold from seawater swindle in the United States in the s as did an English fraudster in the early s Fritz Haber did research on the extraction of gold from sea water in an effort to help pay Germany s reparations following World War I Based on the published values of to ppb of gold in seawater a commercially successful extraction seemed possible After analysis of water samples yielding an average of ppb it became clear that extraction would not be possible and he ended the project br br br History br br The earliest recorded metal employed by humans appears to be gold which can be found free or native Small amounts of natural gold have been found in Spanish caves used during the late Paleolithic period c BC br The oldest gold artifacts in the world are from Bulgaria and are dating back to the th millennium BC BC to BC such as those found in the Varna Necropolis near Lake Varna and the Black Sea coast thought to be the earliest well dated finding of gold artifacts in history Several prehistoric Bulgarian finds are considered no less old the golden treasures of Hotnitsa Durankulak artifacts from the Kurgan settlement of Yunatsite near Pazardzhik the golden treasure Sakar as well as beads and gold jewelry found in the Kurgan settlement of Provadia Solnitsata salt pit However Varna gold is most often called the oldest since this treasure is the largest and most diverse br Gold artifacts probably made their first appearance in Ancient Egypt at the very beginning of the pre dynastic period at the end of the fifth millennium BC and the start of the fourth and smelting was developed during the course of the th millennium gold artifacts appear in the archeology of Lower Mesopotamia during the early th millennium As of gold artifacts found at the Wadi Qana cave cemetery of the th millennium BC in West Bank were the earliest from the Levant Gold artifacts such as the golden hats and the Nebra disk appeared in Central Europe from the nd millennium BC Bronze Age br The oldest known map of a gold mine was drawn in the th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt BC whereas the first written reference to gold was recorded in the th Dynasty around BC Egyptian hieroglyphs from as early as BC describe gold which King Tushratta of the Mitanni claimed was more plentiful than dirt in Egypt Egypt and especially Nubia had the resources to make them major gold producing areas for much of history One of the earliest known maps known as the Turin Papyrus Map shows the plan of a gold mine in Nubia together with indications of the local geology The primitive working methods are described by both Strabo and Diodorus Siculus and included fire setting Large mines were also present across the Red Sea in what is now Saudi Arabia br br Gold is mentioned in the Amarna letters numbered and from around the th century BC br Gold is mentioned frequently in the Old Testament starting with Genesis at Havilah the story of the golden calf and many parts of the temple including the Menorah and the golden altar In the New Testament it is included with the gifts of the magi in the first chapters of Matthew The Book of Revelation describes the city of New Jerusalem as having streets made of pure gold clear as crystal Exploitation of gold in the south east corner of the Black Sea is said to date from the time of Midas and this gold was important in the establishment of what is probably the world s earliest coinage in Lydia around BC The legend of the golden fleece dating from eighth century BCE may refer to the use of fleeces to trap gold dust from placer deposits in the ancient world From the th or th century BC the Chu state circulated the Ying Yuan one kind of square gold coin br In Roman metallurgy new methods for extracting gold on a large scale were developed by introducing hydraulic mining methods especially in Hispania from BC onwards and in Dacia from AD onwards One of their largest mines was at Las Medulas in Le n where seven long aqueducts enabled them to sluice most of a large alluvial deposit The mines at Ro ia Montan in Transylvania were also very large and until very recently still mined by opencast methods They also exploited smaller deposits in Britain such as placer and hard rock deposits at Dolaucothi The various methods they used are well described by Pliny the Elder in his encyclopedia Naturalis Historia written towards the end of the first century AD br During Mansa Musa s ruler of the Mali Empire from to hajj to Mecca in he passed through Cairo in July and was reportedly accompanied by a camel train that included thousands of people and nearly a hundred camels where he gave away so much gold that it depressed the price in Egypt for over a decade causing high inflation A contemporary Arab historian remarked br br Gold was at a high price in Egypt until they came in that year The mithqal did not go below dirhams and was generally above but from that time its value fell and it cheapened in price and has remained cheap till now The mithqal does not exceed dirhams or less This has been the state of affairs for about twelve years until this day by reason of the large amount of gold which they brought into Egypt and spent there br br The European exploration of the Americas was fueled in no small part by reports of the gold ornaments displayed in great profusion by Native American peoples especially in Mesoamerica Peru Ecuador and Colombia The Aztecs regarded gold as the product of the gods calling it literally god excrement teocuitlatl in Nahuatl and after Moctezuma II was killed most of this gold was shipped to Spain However for the indigenous peoples of North America gold was considered useless and they saw much greater value in other minerals which were directly related to their utility such as obsidian flint and slate br El Dorado is applied to a legendary story in which precious stones were found in fabulous abundance along with gold coins The concept of El Dorado underwent several transformations and eventually accounts of the previous myth were also combined with those of a legendary lost city El Dorado was the term used by the Spanish Empire to describe a mythical tribal chief zipa of the Muisca native people in Colombia who as an initiation rite covered himself with gold dust and submerged in Lake Guatavita The legends surrounding El Dorado changed over time as it went from being a man to a city to a kingdom and then finally to an empire br Beginning in the early modern period European exploration and colonization of West Africa was driven in large part by reports of gold deposits in the region which was eventually referred to by Europeans as the Gold Coast From the late th to early th centuries European trade in the region was primarily focused in gold along with ivory and slaves The gold trade in West Africa was dominated by the Ashanti Empire who initially traded with the Portuguese before branching out and trading with British French Spanish and Danish merchants British desires to secure control of West African gold deposits played a role in the Anglo Ashanti wars of the late th century which saw the Ashanti Empire annexed by Britain br Gold played a role in western culture as a cause for desire and of corruption as told in children s fables such as Rumpelstiltskin where Rumpelstiltskin turns hay into gold for the peasant s daughter in return for her child when she becomes a princess and the stealing of the hen that lays golden eggs in Jack and the Beanstalk br The top prize at the Olympic Games and many other sports competitions is the gold medal br of the presently accounted for gold has been extracted since two thirds since br One main goal of the alchemists was to produce gold from other substances such as lead presumably by the interaction with a mythical substance called the philosopher s stone Trying to produce gold led the alchemists to systematically find out what can be done with substances and this laid the foundation for today s chemistry which can produce gold albeit uneconomically by using nuclear transmutation Their symbol for gold was the circle with a point at its center which was also the astrological symbol and the ancient Chinese character for the Sun br The Dome of the Rock is covered with an ultra thin golden glassier The Sikh Golden temple the Harmandir Sahib is a building covered with gold Similarly the Wat Phra Kaew emerald Buddhist temple wat in Thailand has ornamental gold leafed statues and roofs Some European king and queen s crowns were made of gold and gold was used for the bridal crown since antiquity An ancient Talmudic text circa AD describes Rachel wife of Rabbi Akiva

cognate with similar words in many Germanic languages deriving via Proto Germanic gul from Proto Indo European elh to shine to gleam to be yellow or green br The symbol Au is from the Latin aurum gold The Proto Indo European ancestor of aurum was h h us o meaning glow This word is derived from the same root Proto Indo European h u es to dawn as h u s s the ancestor of the Latin word aurora dawn This etymological relationship is presumably behind the frequent claim in scientific publications that aurum meant shining dawn br br br Culture br br In popular culture gold is a high standard of excellence often used in awards Great achievements are frequently rewarded with gold in the form of gold medals gold trophies and other decorations Winners of athletic events and other graded competitions are usually awarded a gold medal Many awards such as the Nobel Prize are made from gold as well Other award statues and prizes are depicted in gold or are gold plated such as the Academy Awards the Golden Globe Awards the Emmy Awards the Palme d Or and the British Academy Film Awards br Aristotle in his ethics used gold symbolism when referring to what is now known as the golden mean Similarly gold is associated with perfect or divine principles such as in the case of the golden ratio and the golden rule Gold is further associated with the wisdom of aging and fruition The fiftieth wedding anniversary is golden A person s most valued or most successful latter years are sometimes considered golden years The height of a civilization is referred to as a golden age br br br Religion br br The first known prehistoric human usages of gold were religious in nature br In some forms of Christianity and Judaism gold has been associated both with the sacred and evil In the Book of Exodus the Golden Calf is a symbol of idolatry while in the Book of Genesis Abraham was said to be rich in gold and silver and Moses was instructed to cover the Mercy Seat of the Ark of the Covenant with pure gold In Byzantine iconography the halos of Christ Virgin Mary and the saints are often golden br In Islam gold along with silk is often cited as being forbidden for men to wear Abu Bakr al Jazaeri quoting a hadith said that t he wearing of silk and gold are forbidden on the males of my nation and they are lawful to their women This however has not been enforced consistently throughout history e g in the Ottoman Empire Further small gold accents on clothing such as in embroidery may be permitted br In ancient Greek religion and mythology Theia was seen as the goddess of gold silver and other gemstones br According to Christopher Columbus those who had something of gold were in possession of something of great value on Earth and a substance to even help souls to paradise br Wedding rings are typically made of gold It is long lasting and unaffected by the passage of time and may aid in the ring symbolism of eternal vows before God and the perfection the marriage signifies In Orthodox Christian wedding ceremonies the wedded couple is adorned with a golden crown though some opt for wreaths instead during the ceremony an amalgamation of symbolic rites br On August Israeli archaeologists discovered a trove of early Islamic gold coins near the central city of Yavne Analysis of the extremely rare collection of gold coins indicated that they were from the late th century Dating to around years back the gold coins were from the Abbasid Caliphate br br br Production br br According to the United States Geological Survey in about troy ounces t of gold has been accounted

accounted is from South Africa Production in accounted for of the world supply about tonnes In China with tonnes overtook South Africa as the world s largest gold producer the first time since that South Africa had not been the largest br In China was the world s leading gold mining country followed in order by Russia Australia the United States Canada and Ghana br br In South America the controversial project Pascua Lama aims at exploitation of rich fields in the high mountains of Atacama Desert at the border between Chile and Argentina br It has been estimated that up to one quarter of the yearly global gold production originates from artisanal or small scale mining br The city of Johannesburg located in South Africa was founded as a result of the Witwatersrand Gold Rush which resulted in the discovery of some of the largest natural gold deposits in recorded history The gold fields are confined to the northern and north western edges of the Witwatersrand basin which is a km mi thick layer of archean rocks located in most places deep under the Free State Gauteng and surrounding provinces These Witwatersrand rocks are exposed at the surface on the Witwatersrand in and around Johannesburg but also in isolated patches to the south east and south west of Johannesburg as well as in an arc around the Vredefort Dome which lies close to the center of the Witwatersrand basin From these surface exposures the basin dips extensively requiring some of the mining to occur at depths of nearly m ft making them especially the Savuka and TauTona mines to the south west of Johannesburg the deepest mines on earth The gold is found only in six areas where archean rivers from the north and north west formed extensive pebbly Braided river deltas before draining into the Witwatersrand sea where the rest of the Witwatersrand sediments were deposited br The Second Boer War of between the British Empire and the Afrikaner Boers was at least partly over the rights of miners and possession of the gold wealth in South Africa br br During the th century gold rushes occurred whenever large gold deposits were discovered The first documented discovery of gold in the United States was at the Reed Gold Mine near Georgeville North Carolina in The first major gold strike in the United States occurred in a small north Georgia town called Dahlonega Further gold rushes occurred in California Colorado the Black Hills Otago in New Zealand a number of locations across Australia Witwatersrand in South Africa and the Klondike in Canada br Grasberg mine located in Papua Indonesia is the largest gold mine in the world br br br Extraction and refining br br Gold extraction is most economical in large easily mined deposits Ore grades as little as parts per million ppm can be economical Typical ore grades in open pit mines are ppm ore grades in underground or hard rock mines are usually at least ppm Because ore grades of ppm are usually needed before gold is visible to the naked eye in most gold mines the gold is invisible br The average gold mining and extraction costs were about per troy ounce in but these can vary widely depending on mining type and ore quality global mine production amounted to tonnes br After initial production gold is often subsequently refined industrially by the Wohlwill process which is based on electrolysis or by the Miller process that is chlorination in the melt The Wohlwill process results in higher purity but is more complex and is only applied in small scale installations Other methods of assaying and purifying smaller amounts of gold include parting and inquartation as well as cupellation or refining methods based on the dissolution of gold in aqua regia br br br Recycling br In recycled gold accounted for approximately of the tons of gold supplied to the market Jewelry companies such as Generation Collection and computer companies including Dell conduct recycling br As of the amount of carbon dioxide CO produced in mining a kilogram of gold is tonnes while recycling a kilogram of gold produces kilograms of CO equivalent Approximately percent of the global gold supply is recycled and not mined as of br br br Consumption br br The consumption of gold produced in the world is about in jewelry in investments and in industry br According to the World Gold Council China was the world s largest single consumer of gold in overtaking India br br br Pollution br br Gold production is associated with contribution to hazardous pollution br Low grade gold ore may contain less than one ppm gold metal such ore is ground and mixed with sodium cyanide to dissolve the gold Cyanide is a highly poisonous chemical which can kill living creatures when exposed in minute quantities Many cyanide spills from gold mines have occurred in both developed and developing countries which killed aquatic life in long stretches of affected rivers Environmentalists consider these events major environmental disasters Up to thirty tons of used ore can be dumped as waste for producing one troy ounce of gold Gold ore dumps are the source of many heavy elements such as cadmium lead zinc copper arsenic selenium and mercury When sulfide bearing minerals in these ore dumps are exposed to air and water the sulfide transforms into sulfuric acid which in turn dissolves these heavy metals facilitating their passage into surface water and ground water This process is called acid mine drainage These gold ore dumps contain long term highly hazardous waste br It was once common to use mercury to recover gold from ore but today the use of mercury is largely limited to small scale individual miners Minute quantities of mercury compounds can reach water bodies causing heavy metal contamination Mercury can then enter into the human food chain in the form of methylmercury Mercury poisoning in humans causes incurable brain function damage and severe retardation br Gold extraction is also a highly energy intensive industry extracting ore from deep mines and grinding the large quantity of ore for further chemical extraction requires nearly kWh of electricity per gram of gold produced br br br Monetary use br br Gold has been widely used throughout the world as money for efficient indirect exchange versus barter and to store wealth in hoards For exchange purposes mints produce standardized gold bullion coins bars and other units of fixed weight and purity br The first known coins containing gold were struck in Lydia Asia Minor around BC The talent coin of gold in use during the periods of Grecian history both before and during the time of the life of Homer weighed between and grams From an earlier preference in using silver European economies re established the minting of gold as coinage during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries br Bills that mature into gold coin and gold certificates convertible into gold coin at the issuing bank added to the circulating stock of gold standard money in most th century industrial economies In preparation for World War I the warring nations moved to fractional gold standards inflating their currencies to finance the war effort Post war the victorious countries most notably Britain gradually restored gold convertibility but international flows of gold via bills of exchange remained embargoed international shipments were made exclusively for bilateral trades or to pay war reparations br After World War II gold was replaced by a system of nominally convertible currencies related by fixed exchange rates following the Bretton Woods system Gold standards and the direct convertibility of currencies to gold have been abandoned by world governments led in by the United States refusal to redeem its dollars in gold Fiat currency now fills most monetary roles Switzerland was the last country to tie its currency to gold this was ended by a referendum in br Central banks continue to keep a portion of their liquid reserves as gold in some form and metals exchanges such as the London Bullion Market Association still clear transactions denominated in gold including future delivery contracts Today gold mining output is declining With the sharp growth of economies in the th century and increasing foreign exchange the world s gold reserves and their trading market have become a small fraction of all markets and fixed exchange rates of currencies to gold have been replaced by floating prices for gold and gold future contract Though the gold stock grows by only or per year very little metal is irretrievably consumed Inventory above ground would satisfy many decades of industrial and even artisan uses at current prices br The gold proportion fineness of alloys is measured by karat k Pure gold commercially termed fine gold is designated as karat abbreviated k English gold coins intended for circulation from into the s were typically a standard k alloy called crown gold for hardness American gold coins for circulation after contain an alloy of fine gold or kt br Although the prices of some platinum group metals can be much higher gold has long been considered the most desirable of precious metals and its value has been used as the standard for many currencies Gold has been used as a symbol for purity value royalty and particularly roles that combine these properties Gold as a sign of wealth and prestige was ridiculed by Thomas More in his treatise Utopia On that imaginary island gold is so abundant that it is used to make chains for slaves tableware and lavatory seats When ambassadors from other countries arrive dressed in ostentatious gold jewels and badges the Utopians mistake them for menial servants paying homage instead to the most modestly dressed of their party br The ISO currency code of gold is XAU Many holders of gold store it in form of bullion coins or bars as a hedge against inflation or other economic disruptions though its efficacy as such has been questioned historically it has not proven itself reliable as a hedging instrument Modern bullion coins for investment or collector purposes do not require good mechanical wear properties they are typically fine gold at k although the American Gold Eagle and the British gold sovereign continue to be minted in k metal in historical tradition and the South African Krugerrand first released in is also k br The special issue Canadian Gold Maple Leaf coin contains the highest purity gold of any bullion coin at or while the popular issue Canadian Gold Maple Leaf coin has a purity of In the United States Mint began producing the American Buffalo gold bullion coin with a purity of The Australian Gold Kangaroos were first coined in as the Australian Gold Nugget but changed the reverse design in Other modern coins include the Austrian Vienna Philharmonic bullion coin and the Chinese Gold Panda br br br Price br br Like other precious metals gold is measured by troy weight and by grams The proportion of gold in the alloy is measured by karat k with karat k being pure gold and lower karat numbers proportionally less k The purity of a gold bar or coin can also be expressed as a decimal figure ranging from to known as the millesimal fineness such as being nearly pure br The price of gold is determined through trading in the gold and derivatives markets but a procedure known as the Gold Fixing in London originating in September provides a daily benchmark price to the industry The afternoon fixing was introduced in to provide a price when US markets are open As of September gold was valued at around per gram per troy ounce br br br History br Historically gold coinage was widely used as currency when paper money was introduced it typically was a receipt redeemable for gold coin or bullion In a monetary system known as the gold standard a certain weight of gold was given the name of a unit of currency For a long period the United States government set the value of the US dollar so that one troy ounce was equal to per gram but in the dollar was devalued to per troy ounce g By it was becoming hard to maintain this price and a pool of US and European banks agreed to manipulate the market to prevent further currency devaluation against increased gold demand br The largest gold depository in the world is that of the U S Federal Reserve Bank in New York which holds about of the gold known to exist and accounted for today as does the similarly laden U S Bullion Depository at Fort Knox In the World Gold Council estimated total global gold supply to be tonnes and demand to be tonnes giving a surplus of tonnes br After August Nixon shock the price began to greatly increase and between and the price of gold ranged widely from a high of per troy ounce g on January to a low of per troy ounce g on June London Gold Fixing Prices increased rapidly from but the high was not exceeded until January when a new maximum of per troy ounce was set Another record price was set on March at per troy ounce g br On December gold reached a new high closing at Gold further rallied hitting new highs in May after the European Union debt crisis prompted further purchase of gold as a safe asset On March gold hit a new all time high of based on investor concerns regarding ongoing unrest in North Africa as well as in the Middle East br From April to August spot gold prices more than quintupled in value against the US dollar hitting a new all time high of on August prompting speculation that the long secular bear market had ended and a bull market had returned However the price then began a slow decline towards per troy ounce in late and br In August the gold price picked up to US per ounce after a total growth of from August to October a period during which it outplaced the Nasdaq total return of br Gold futures are traded on the COMEX exchange These contacts are priced in USD per troy ounce troy ounce grams Below are the CQG contract specifications outlining the futures contracts br br br Other applications br br br Jewelry br br Because of the softness of pure k gold it is usually alloyed with other metals for use in jewelry altering its hardness and ductility melting point color and other properties Alloys with lower karat rating typically k k k or k contain higher percentages of copper silver palladium or other base metals in the alloy Nickel is toxic and its release from nickel white gold is controlled by legislation in Europe Palladium gold alloys are more expensive than those using nickel High karat white gold alloys are more resistant to corrosion than are either pure silver or sterling silver The Japanese craft of Mokume gane exploits the color contrasts between laminated colored gold alloys to produce decorative wood grain effects br By the gold jewelry industry was escalating despite a dip in gold prices Demand in the first quarter of pushed turnover to billion according to a World Gold Council report br Gold solder is used for joining the components of gold jewelry by high temperature hard soldering or brazing If the work is to be of hallmarking quality the gold solder alloy must match the fineness of the work and alloy formulas are manufactured to color match yellow and white gold Gold solder is usually made in at least three melting point ranges referred to as Easy Medium and Hard By using the hard high melting point solder first followed by solders with progressively lower melting points goldsmiths can assemble complex items with several separate soldered joints Gold can also be made into thread and used in embroidery br br br Electronics br Only of the world consumption of new gold produced goes to industry but by far the most important industrial use for new gold is in fabrication of corrosion free electrical connectors in computers and other electrical devices For example according to the World Gold Council a typical cell phone may contain mg of gold worth about dollars cents But since nearly one billion cell phones are produced each year a gold value of US in each phone adds to US billion in gold from just this application Prices updated to November br Though gold is attacked by free chlorine its good conductivity and general resistance to oxidation and corrosion in other environments including resistance to non chlorinated acids has led to its widespread industrial use in the electronic era as a thin layer coating on electrical connectors thereby ensuring good connection For example gold is used in the connectors of the more expensive electronics cables such as audio video and USB cables The benefit of using gold over other connector metals such as tin in these applications has been debated gold connectors are often criticized by audio visual experts as unnecessary for most consumers and seen as simply a marketing ploy However the use of gold in other applications in electronic sliding contacts in highly humid or corrosive atmospheres and in use for contacts with a very high failure cost certain computers communications equipment spacecraft jet aircraft engines remains very common br Besides sliding electrical contacts gold is also used in electrical contacts because of its resistance to corrosion electrical conductivity ductility and lack of toxicity Switch contacts are generally subjected to more intense corrosion stress than are sliding contacts Fine gold wires are used to connect semiconductor devices to their packages through a process known as wire bonding br The concentration of free electrons in gold metal is cm Gold is highly conductive to electricity and has been used for electrical wiring in some high energy applications only silver and copper are more conductive per volume but gold has the advantage of corrosion resistance For example gold electrical wires were used during some of the Manhattan Project s atomic experiments but large high current silver wires were used in the calutron isotope separator magnets in the project br It is estimated that of the world s presently accounted for gold and of the world s silver is contained in electronic technology in Japan br br br Medicine br Metallic and gold compounds have long been used for medicinal purposes Gold usually as the metal is perhaps the most anciently administered medicine apparently by shamanic practitioners and known to Dioscorides In medieval times gold was often seen as beneficial for the health in the belief that something so rare and beautiful could not be anything but healthy Even some modern esotericists and forms of alternative medicine assign metallic gold a healing power br In the th century gold had a reputation as an anxiolytic a therapy for nervous disorders Depression epilepsy migraine and glandular problems such as amenorrhea and impotence were treated and most notably alcoholism Keeley br The apparent paradox of the actual toxicology of the substance suggests the possibility of serious gaps in the understanding of the action of gold in physiology Only salts and radioisotopes of gold are of pharmacological value since elemental metallic gold is inert to all chemicals it encounters inside the body e g ingested gold cannot be attacked by stomach acid Some gold salts do have anti inflammatory properties and at present two are still used as pharmaceuticals in the treatment of arthritis and other similar conditions in the US sodium aurothiomalate and auranofin These drugs have been explored as a means to help to reduce the pain and swelling of rheumatoid arthritis and also historically against tuberculosis and some parasites br Gold alloys are used in restorative dentistry especially in tooth restorations such as crowns and permanent bridges The gold alloys slight malleability facilitates the creation of a superior molar mating surface with other teeth and produces results that are generally more satisfactory than those produced by the creation of porcelain crowns The use of gold crowns in more prominent teeth such as incisors is favored in some cultures and discouraged in others br Colloidal gold preparations suspensions of gold nanoparticles in water are intensely red colored and can be made with tightly controlled particle sizes up to a few tens of nanometers across by reduction of gold chloride with citrate or ascorbate ions Colloidal gold is used in research applications in medicine biology and materials science The technique of immunogold labeling exploits the ability of the gold particles to adsorb protein molecules onto their surfaces Colloidal gold particles coated with specific antibodies can be used as probes for the presence and position of antigens on the surfaces of cells In ultrathin sections of tissues viewed by electron microscopy the immunogold labels appear as extremely dense round spots at the position of the antigen br Gold or alloys of gold and palladium are applied as conductive coating to biological specimens and other non conducting materials such as plastics and glass to be viewed in a scanning electron microscope The coating which is usually applied by sputtering with an argon plasma has a triple role in this application Gold s very high electrical conductivity drains electrical charge to earth and its very high density provides stopping power for electrons in the electron beam helping to limit the depth to which the electron beam penetrates the specimen This improves definition of the position and topography of the specimen surface and increases the spatial resolution of the image Gold also produces a high output of secondary electrons when irradiated by an electron beam and these low energy electrons are the most commonly used signal source used in the scanning electron microscope br The isotope gold half life days is used in nuclear medicine in some cancer treatments and for treating other diseases br br br Cuisine br br Gold can be used in food and has the E number In the European Food Safety Authority published an opinion on the re evaluation of gold as a food additive Concerns included the possible presence of minute amounts of gold nanoparticles in the food additive and that gold nanoparticles have been shown to be genotoxic in mammalian cells in vitro br Gold leaf flake or dust is used on and in some gourmet foods notably sweets and drinks as decorative ingredient Gold flake was used by the nobility in medieval Europe as a decoration in food and drinks br Danziger Goldwasser German Gold water of Danzig or Goldwasser English Goldwater is a traditional German herbal liqueur produced in what is today Gda sk Poland and Schwabach Germany and contains flakes of gold leaf There are also some expensive c cocktails which contain flakes of gold leaf However since metallic gold is inert to all body chemistry it has no taste it provides no nutrition and it leaves the body unaltered br Vark is a foil composed of a pure metal that is sometimes gold and is used for garnishing sweets in South Asian cuisine br br br Miscellanea br br Gold produces a deep intense red color when used as a coloring agent in cranberry glass br In photography gold toners are used to shift the color of silver bromide black and white prints towards brown or blue tones or to increase their stability Used on sepia toned prints gold toners produce red tones Kodak published formulas for several types of gold toners which use gold as the chloride br Gold is a good reflector of electromagnetic radiation such as infrared and visible light as well as radio waves It is used for the protective coatings on many artificial satellites in infrared protective faceplates in thermal protection suits and astronauts helmets and in electronic warfare planes such as the EA B Prowler br Gold is used as the reflective layer on some high end CDs br Automobiles may use gold for heat shielding McLaren uses gold foil in the engine compartment of its F model br Gold can be manufactured so thin that it appears semi transparent It is used in some aircraft cockpit windows for de icing or anti icing by passing electricity through it The heat produced by the resistance of the gold is enough to prevent ice from forming br Gold is attacked by and dissolves in alkaline solutions of potassium or sodium cyanide to form the salt gold cyanide a technique that has been used in extracting metallic gold from ores in the cyanide process Gold cyanide is the electrolyte used in commercial electroplating of gold onto base metals and electroforming br Gold chloride chloroauric acid solutions are used to make colloidal gold by reduction with citrate or ascorbate ions Gold chloride and gold oxide are used to make cranberry or red colored glass which like colloidal gold suspensions contains evenly sized spherical gold nanoparticles br Gold when dispersed in nanoparticles can act as a heterogeneous catalyst of chemical reactions br In recent years gold has been used as a symbol of pride by the autism rights movement as its symbol Au could be seen as similar to the word autism br br br Toxicity br Pure metallic elemental gold is non toxic and non irritating when ingested and is sometimes used as a food decoration in the form of gold leaf Metallic gold is also a component of the alcoholic drinks Goldschl ger Gold Strike and Goldwasser Metallic gold is approved as a food additive in the EU E in the Codex Alimentarius Although the gold ion is toxic the acceptance of metallic gold as a food additive is due to its relative chemical inertness and resistance to being corroded or transformed into soluble salts gold compounds by any known chemical process which would be encountered in the human body br Soluble compounds gold salts such as gold chloride are toxic to the liver and kidneys Common cyanide salts of gold such as potassium gold cyanide used in gold electroplating are toxic by virtue of both their cyanide and gold content There are rare cases of lethal gold poisoning from potassium gold cyanide Gold toxicity can be ameliorated with chelation therapy with an agent such as dimercaprol br Gold metal was voted Allergen of the Year in by the American Contact Dermatitis Society gold contact allergies affect mostly women Despite this gold is a relatively non potent contact allergen in comparison with metals like nickel br A sample of the fungus
