Ren Descartes day KART or UK DAY kart French ne deka t March February was a French philosopher scientist and mathematician widely considered a seminal figure in the emergence of modern philosophy and science Mathematics was paramount to his method of inquiry and he connected the previously separate fields of geometry and algebra into analytic geometry Descartes spent much of his working life in the Dutch Republic initially serving the Dutch States Army and later becoming a central intellectual of the Dutch Golden Age Although he served a Protestant state and was later counted as a deist by critics Descartes was Roman Catholic br Many elements of Descartes philosophy have precedents in late Aristotelianism the revived Stoicism of the th century or in earlier philosophers like Augustine In his natural philosophy he differed from the schools on two major points First he rejected the splitting of corporeal substance into matter and form second he rejected any appeal to final ends divine or natural in explaining natural phenomena In his theology he insists on the absolute freedom of God s act of creation Refusing to accept the authority of previous philosophers Descartes frequently set his views apart from the philosophers who preceded him In the opening section of the Passions of the Soul an early modern treatise on emotions Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic as if no one had written on these matters before His best known philosophical statement is cogito ergo sum I think therefore I am French Je pense donc je suis found in Discourse on the Method in French and Latin and Principles of Philosophy in Latin in French The statement has either been interpreted as a logical syllogism or as an intuitive thought br Descartes has often been called the father of modern philosophy and is largely seen as responsible for the increased attention given to epistemology in the th century He laid the foundation for th century continental rationalism later advocated by Spinoza and Leibniz and was later opposed by the empiricist school of thought consisting of Hobbes Locke Berkeley and Hume The rise of early modern rationalism as a systematic school of philosophy in its own right for the first time in history exerted an influence on modern Western thought in general with the birth of two rationalistic philosophical systems of Descartes Cartesianism and Spinoza Spinozism It was the th century arch rationalists like Descartes Spinoza and Leibniz who have given the Age of Reason its name and place in history Leibniz Spinoza and Descartes were all well versed in mathematics as well as philosophy and Descartes and Leibniz contributed to science as well br Descartes Meditations on First Philosophy continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments Descartes influence in mathematics is equally apparent the Cartesian coordinate system was named after him He is credited as the father of analytic geometry used in the discovery of infinitesimal calculus and analysis Descartes was also one of the key figures in the Scientific Revolution br br br Life br br br Early life br br Ren Descartes was born in La Haye en Touraine Province of Touraine now Descartes Indre et Loire France on March In May his mother Jeanne Brochard died a few days after giving birth to a still born child Descartes father Joachim was a member of the Parlement of Rennes at Rennes Ren lived with his grandmother and with his great uncle Although the Descartes family was Roman Catholic the Poitou region was controlled by the Protestant Huguenots In late because of his fragile health he entered the Jesuit Coll ge Royal Henry Le Grand at La Fl che where he was introduced to mathematics and physics including Galileo s work While there Descartes first encountered hermetic mysticism After graduation in he studied for two years at the University of Poitiers earning a Baccalaur at and Licence in canon and civil law in in accordance with his father s wishes that he should become a lawyer From there he moved to Paris br br In Discourse on the Method Descartes recalls br br I entirely abandoned the study of letters Resolving to seek no knowledge other than that of which could be found in myself or else in the great book of the world I spent the rest of my youth traveling visiting courts and armies mixing with people of diverse temperaments and ranks gathering various experiences testing myself in the situations which fortune offered me and at all times reflecting upon whatever came my way to derive some profit from it br br br Army service br br In accordance with his ambition to become a professional military officer in Descartes joined as a mercenary the Protestant Dutch States Army in Breda under the command of Maurice of Nassau and undertook a formal study of military engineering as established by Simon Stevin Descartes therefore received much encouragement in Breda to advance his knowledge of mathematics In this way he became acquainted with Isaac Beeckman the principal of a Dordrecht school for whom he wrote the Compendium of Music written published br While in the service of the Catholic Duke Maximilian of Bavaria from Descartes was present at the Battle of the White Mountain near Prague in November br According to Adrien Baillet on the night of November St Martin s Day while stationed in Neuburg an der Donau Descartes shut himself in a room with an oven probably a cocklestove to escape the cold While within he had three dreams and believed that a divine spirit revealed to him a new philosophy However it is speculated that what Descartes considered to be his second dream was actually an episode of exploding head syndrome Upon exiting he had formulated analytic geometry and the idea of applying the mathematical method to philosophy He concluded from these visions that the pursuit of science would prove to be for him the pursuit of true wisdom and a central part of his life s work Descartes also saw very clearly that all truths were linked with one another so that finding a fundamental truth and proceeding with logic would open the way to all science Descartes discovered this basic truth quite soon his famous I think therefore I am br br br Career br br br France br In Descartes left the army He visited Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto then visited various countries before returning to France and during the next few years he spent time in Paris It was there that he composed his first essay on method Regulae ad Directionem Ingenii Rules for the Direction of the Mind He arrived in La Haye in selling all of his property to invest in bonds which provided a comfortable income for the rest of his life Descartes was present at the siege of La Rochelle by Cardinal Richelieu in as an observer There he was interested in the physical properties of the great dike that Richelieu was building and studied mathematically everything he saw during the siege He also met French mathematician Girard Desargues In the autumn of that year in the residence of the papal nuncio Guidi di Bagno where he came with Mersenne and many other scholars to listen to a lecture given by the alchemist Nicolas de Villiers Sieur de Chandoux on the principles of a supposed new philosophy Cardinal B rulle urged him to write an exposition of his new philosophy in some location beyond the reach of the Inquisition br br br Netherlands br br Descartes returned to the Dutch Republic in In April he joined the University of Franeker studying under Adriaan Metius either living with a Catholic family or renting the Sjaerdemaslot The next year under the name Poitevin he enrolled at Leiden University which at the time was a Protestant University He studied both mathematics with Jacobus Golius who confronted him with Pappus s hexagon theorem and astronomy with Martin Hortensius In October he had a falling out with Beeckman whom he accused of plagiarizing some of his ideas In Amsterdam he had a relationship with a servant girl Helena Jans van der Strom with whom he had a daughter Francine who was born in in Deventer She was baptized a Protestant and died of scarlet fever at the age of br Unlike many moralists of the time Descartes did not deprecate the passions but rather defended them he wept upon Francine s death in According to a recent biography by Jason Porterfield Descartes said that he did not believe that one must refrain from tears to prove oneself a man Russell Shorto speculates that the experience of fatherhood and losing a child formed a turning point in Descartes work changing its focus from medicine to a quest for universal answers br Despite frequent moves he wrote all of his major work during his plus years in the Netherlands initiating a revolution in mathematics and philosophy In Galileo was condemned by the Italian Inquisition and Descartes abandoned plans to publish Treatise on the World his work of the previous four years Nevertheless in he published parts of this work in three essays Les M t ores The Meteors La Dioptrique Dioptrics and La G om trie Geometry preceded by an introduction his famous Discours de la m thode Discourse on the Method In it Descartes lays out four rules of thought meant to ensure that our knowledge rests upon a firm foundation br br The first was never to accept anything for true which I did not know to be such that is to say carefully to avoid precipitancy and prejudice and to comprise nothing more in my judgment than what was presented to my mind so clearly and distinctly as to exclude all ground of doubt br In La G om trie Descartes exploited the discoveries he made with Pierre de Fermat This later became known as Cartesian Geometry br Descartes continued to publish works concerning both mathematics and philosophy for the rest of his life In he published a metaphysics treatise Meditationes de Prima Philosophia Meditations on First Philosophy written in Latin and thus addressed to the learned It was followed in by Principia Philosophiae Principles of Philosophy a kind of synthesis of the Discourse on the Method and Meditations on First Philosophy In Cartesian philosophy was condemned at the University of Utrecht and Descartes was obliged to flee to the Hague settling in Egmond Binnen br Between and Descartes lived with his girlfriend at Egmond Binnen in an inn Descartes became friendly with Anthony Studler van Zurck lord of Bergen and participated in the design of his mansion and estate He also met Dirck Rembrantsz van Nierop a mathematician and surveyor He was so impressed by Van Nierop s knowledge that he even brought him to the attention of Constantijn Huygens and Frans van Schooten br Christia Mercer suggested that Descartes may have been influenced by Spanish author and Roman Catholic nun Teresa of vila who fifty years earlier published The Interior Castle concerning the role of philosophical reflection in intellectual growth br Descartes began through Alfonso Polloti an Italian general in Dutch service a six year correspondence with Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia devoted mainly to moral and psychological subjects Connected with this correspondence in he published Les Passions de l me The Passions of the Soul which he dedicated to the Princess A French translation of Principia Philosophiae prepared by Abbot Claude Picot was published in This edition was also dedicated to Princess Elisabeth In the preface to the French edition Descartes praised true philosophy as a means to attain wisdom He identifies four ordinary sources to reach wisdom and finally says that there is a fifth better and more secure consisting in the search for first causes br br br Sweden br br By Descartes had become one of Europe s most famous philosophers and scientists That year Queen Christina of Sweden invited him to her court to organize a new scientific academy and tutor her in his ideas about love Descartes accepted and moved to the Swedish Empire in the middle of winter Christina was interested in and stimulated Descartes to publish The Passions of the Soul br He was a guest at the house of Pierre Chanut living on V sterl nggatan less than meters from Castle Tre Kronor in Stockholm There Chanut and Descartes made observations with a Torricellian mercury barometer Challenging Blaise Pascal Descartes took the first set of barometric readings in Stockholm to see if atmospheric pressure could be used in forecasting the weather br br br Death br Descartes arranged to give lessons to Queen Christina after her birthday three times a week at am in her cold and draughty castle However by January the Queen had actually met with Descartes only four or five times It soon became clear they did not like each other she did not care for his mechanical philosophy nor did he share her interest in Ancient Greek language and literature On February he contracted pneumonia and died on February at Chanut br br Yesterday morning about four o clock a m has deceased here at the house of His Excellency Mr Chanut French ambassador Mr Descartes As I have been informed he had been ill for a few days with pleurisy But as he did not want to take or use medicines a hot fever appears to have arisen as well Thereupon he had himself bled three times in one day but without operation of losing much blood Her Majesty much bemoaned his decease because he was such a learned man He has been cast in wax It was not his intention to die here as he had resolved shortly before his death to return to Holland at the first occasion Etc br The cause of death was pneumonia according to Chanut but peripneumonia according to Christina s physician Johann van Wullen who was not allowed to bleed him The winter seems to have been mild except for the second half of January which was harsh as described by Descartes himself however this remark was probably intended to be as much Descartes take on the intellectual climate as it was about the weather br br E Pies has questioned this account based on a letter by the Doctor van Wullen however Descartes had refused his treatment and more arguments against its veracity have been raised since In a book German philosopher Theodor Ebert argues that Descartes was poisoned by Jacques Viogu a Catholic missionary who opposed his religious views As evidence Ebert suggests that Catherine Descartes the niece of Ren Descartes made a veiled reference to the act of poisoning when her uncle was administered communion two days before his death in her Report on the Death of M Descartes the Philosopher br As a Catholic in a Protestant nation he was interred in the churchyard of what was to become Adolf Fredrik Church in Stockholm where mainly orphans had been buried His manuscripts came into the possession of Claude Clerselier Chanut s brother in law and a devout Catholic who has begun the process of turning Descartes into a saint by cutting adding and publishing his letters selectively In the Pope placed Descartes works on the Index of Prohibited Books In sixteen years after his death his remains were taken to France and buried in Saint tienne du Mont In Louis XIV prohibited all lectures in Cartesianism Although the National Convention in had planned to transfer his remains to the Panth on he was reburied in the Abbey of Saint Germain des Pr s in missing a finger and the skull His skull is in the Mus e de l Homme in Paris br br br Philosophical work br br In his Discourse on the Method he attempts to arrive at a fundamental set of principles that one can know as true without any doubt To achieve this he employs a method called hyperbolical metaphysical doubt also sometimes referred to as methodological skepticism or Cartesian doubt he rejects any ideas that can be doubted and then re establishes them in order to acquire a firm foundation for genuine knowledge Descartes built his ideas from scratch which he does in The Meditations on First Philosophy He relates this to architecture the top soil is taken away to create a new building or structure Descartes calls his doubt the soil and new knowledge the buildings To Descartes Aristotle s foundationalism is incomplete and his method of doubt enhances foundationalism br Initially Descartes arrives at only a single first principle he thinks This is expressed in the Latin phrase in the Discourse on Method Cogito ergo sum English I think therefore I am Descartes concluded if he doubted then something or someone must be doing the doubting therefore the very fact that he doubted proved his existence The simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence that is in and of itself proof that he does exist These two first principles I think and I exist were later confirmed by Descartes clear and distinct perception delineated in his Third Meditation from The Meditations as he clearly and distinctly perceives these two principles Descartes reasoned ensures their indubitability br Descartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks But in what form He perceives his body through the use of the senses however these have previously been unreliable So Descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a thinking thing Thinking is what he does and his power must come from his essence Descartes defines thought cogitatio as what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it insofar as I am conscious of it Thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately conscious He gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from dreams and that one s mind cannot have been hijacked by an evil demon placing an illusory external world before one s senses br br And so something that I thought I was seeing with my eyes is grasped solely by the faculty of judgment which is in my mind br In this manner Descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge discarding perception as unreliable and instead admitting only deduction as a method br br br Mind body dualism br br Descartes influenced by the automatons on display at the Ch teau de Saint Germain en Laye near Paris investigated the connection between mind and body and how they interact His main influences for dualism were theology and physics The theory on the dualism of mind and body is Descartes signature doctrine and permeates other theories he advanced Known as Cartesian dualism or mind body dualism his theory on the separation between the mind and the body went on to influence subsequent Western philosophies In Meditations on First Philosophy Descartes attempted to demonstrate the existence of God and the distinction between the human soul and the body Humans are a union of mind and body thus Descartes dualism embraced the idea that mind and body are distinct but closely joined While many contemporary readers of Descartes found the distinction between mind and body difficult to grasp he thought it was entirely straightforward Descartes employed the concept of modes which are the ways in which substances exist In Principles of Philosophy Descartes explained we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it whereas we cannot conversely understand the mode apart from the substance To perceive a mode apart from its substance requires an intellectual abstraction which Descartes explained as follows br br The intellectual abstraction consists in my turning my thought away from one part of the contents of this richer idea the better to apply it to the other part with greater attention Thus when I consider a shape without thinking of the substance or the extension whose shape it is I make a mental abstraction br br According to Descartes two substances are really distinct when each of them can exist apart from the other Thus Descartes reasoned that God is distinct from humans and the body and mind of a human are also distinct from one another He argued that the great differences between body an extended thing and mind an un extended immaterial thing make the two ontologically distinct According to Descartes indivisibility argument the mind is utterly indivisible because when I consider the mind or myself in so far as I am merely a thinking thing I am unable to distinguish any part within myself I understand myself to be something quite single and complete br Moreover in The Meditations Descartes discusses a piece of wax and exposes the single most characteristic doctrine of Cartesian dualism that the universe contained two radically different kinds of substances the mind or soul defined as thinking and the body defined as matter and unthinking The Aristotelian philosophy of Descartes days held that the universe was inherently purposeful or teleological Everything that happened be it the motion of the stars or the growth of a tree was supposedly explainable by a certain purpose goal or end that worked its way out within nature Aristotle called this the final cause and these final causes were indispensable for explaining the ways nature operated Descartes theory of dualism supports the distinction between traditional Aristotelian science and the new science of Kepler and Galileo which denied the role of a divine power and final causes in its attempts to explain nature Descartes dualism provided the philosophical rationale for the latter by expelling the final cause from the physical universe or res extensa in favor of the mind or res cogitans Therefore while Cartesian dualism paved the way for modern physics it also held the door open for religious beliefs about the immortality of the soul br Descartes dualism of mind and matter implied a concept of human beings A human was according to Descartes a composite entity of mind and body Descartes gave priority to the mind and argued that the mind could exist without the body but the body could not exist without the mind In The Meditations Descartes even argues that while the mind is a substance the body is composed only of accidents But he did argue that mind and body are closely joined br br Nature also teaches me by the sensations of pain hunger thirst and so on that I am not merely present in my body as a pilot in his ship but that I am very closely joined and as it were intermingled with it so that I and the body form a unit If this were not so I who am nothing but a thinking thing would not feel pain when the body was hurt but would perceive the damage purely by the intellect just as a sailor perceives by sight if anything in his ship is broken br br Descartes discussion on embodiment raised one of the most perplexing problems of his dualism philosophy What exactly is the relationship of union between the mind and the body of a person Therefore Cartesian dualism set the agenda for philosophical discussion of the mind body problem for many years after Descartes death Descartes was also a rationalist and believed in the power of innate ideas Descartes argued the theory of innate knowledge and that all humans were born with knowledge through the higher power of God It was this theory of innate knowledge that was later combated by philosopher John Locke an empiricist Empiricism holds that all knowledge is acquired through experience br br br Physiology and psychology br In The Passions of the Soul published in Descartes discussed the common contemporary belief that the human body contained animal spirits These animal spirits were believed to be light and roaming fluids circulating rapidly around the nervous system between the brain and the muscles These animal spirits were believed to affect the human soul or passions of the soul Descartes distinguished six basic passions wonder love hatred desire joy and sadness All of these passions he argued represented different combinations of the original spirit and influenced the soul to will or want certain actions He argued for example that fear is a passion that moves the soul to generate a response in the body In line with his dualist teachings on the separation between the soul and the body he hypothesized that some part of the brain served as a connector between the soul and the body and singled out the pineal gland as connector Descartes argued that signals passed from the ear and the eye to the pineal gland through animal spirits Thus different motions in the gland cause various animal spirits He argued that these motions in the pineal gland are based on God s will and that humans are supposed to want and like things that are useful to them But he also argued that the animal spirits that moved around the body could distort the commands from the pineal gland thus humans had to learn how to control their passions br Descartes advanced a theory on automatic bodily reactions to external events which influenced th century reflex theory He argued that external motions such as touch and sound reach the endings of the nerves and affect the animal spirits For example heat from fire affects a spot on the skin and sets in motion a chain of reactions with the animal spirits reaching the brain through the central nervous system and in turn animal spirits are sent back to the muscles to move the hand away from the fire Through this chain of reactions the automatic reactions of the body do not require a thought process br Above all he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation He challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was divine thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous Descartes writings went on to form the basis for theories on emotions and how cognitive evaluations were translated into affective processes Descartes believed the brain resembled a working machine and that mathematics and mechanics could explain complicated processes in it In the th century Alan Turing advanced computer science based on mathematical biology as inspired by Descartes His theories on reflexes also served as the foundation for advanced physiological theories more than years after his death The physiologist Ivan Pavlov was a great admirer of Descartes br br br On animals br Descartes denied that animals had reason or intelligence He argued that animals did not lack sensations or perceptions but these could be explained mechanistically Whereas humans had a soul or mind and were able to feel pain and anxiety animals by virtue of not having a soul could not feel pain or anxiety If animals showed signs of distress then this was to protect the body from damage but the innate state needed for them to suffer was absent Although Descartes s views were not universally accepted they became prominent in Europe and North America allowing humans to treat animals with impunity The view that animals were quite separate from humanity and merely machines allowed for the maltreatment of animals and was sanctioned in law and societal norms until the middle of the th century The publications of Charles Darwin would eventually erode the Cartesian view of animals Darwin argued that the continuity between humans and other species suggested the possibility of animal suffering br br br Moral philosophy br For Descartes ethics was a science the highest and most perfect of them Like the rest of the sciences ethics had its roots in metaphysics In this way he argues for the existence of God investigates the place of man in nature formulates the theory of mind body dualism and defends free will However as he was a convinced rationalist Descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that individuals should seek and virtue consists in the correct reasoning that should guide their actions Nevertheless the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge and mental condition For this reason he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body He discussed this subject in the correspondence with Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia and as a result wrote his work The Passions of the Soul that contains a study of the psychosomatic processes and reactions in man with an emphasis on emotions or passions His works about human passion and emotion would be the basis for the philosophy of his followers see Cartesianism and would have a lasting impact on ideas concerning what literature and art should be specifically how it should invoke emotion br Descartes and Zeno both identified sovereign goods with virtue For Epicurus the sovereign good was pleasure and Descartes says that in fact this is not in contradiction with Zeno s teaching because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure that is better than bodily pleasure Regarding Aristotle s opinion that happiness eudaimonia depends on both moral virtue and also on the goods of fortune such as a moderate degree of wealth Descartes does not deny that fortunes contributes to happiness but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one s own control whereas one s mind is under one s complete control The moral writings of Descartes came at the last part of his life but earlier in his Discourse on the Method he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt Those maxims are known as his Provisional Morals br br br Religion br br In the third and fifth Meditation Descartes offers proofs of a benevolent God the trademark argument and the ontological argument respectively Descartes has faith in the account of reality his senses provide him since he believed that God provided him with a working mind and sensory system and does not desire to deceive him From this supposition however Descartes finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction and perception Regarding epistemology therefore Descartes can be said to have contributed such ideas as a conception of foundationalism and the possibility that reason is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge Descartes however was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories br Descartes invokes his causal adequacy principle to support his trademark argument for the existence of God quoting Lucretius in defence Ex nihilo nihil fit meaning Nothing comes from nothing Lucretius Oxford Reference summarises the argument as follows that our idea of perfection is related to its perfect origin God just as a stamp or trademark is left in an article of workmanship by its maker In the fifth Meditation Descartes presents a version of the ontological argument which is founded on the possibility of thinking the idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite and suggests that of all the ideas that are in me the idea that I have of God is the most true the most clear and distinct br Descartes considered himself to be a devout Catholic and one of the purposes of the Meditations was to defend the Catholic faith His attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time Pascal regarded Descartes views as a rationalist and mechanist and accused him of deism I cannot forgive Descartes in all his philosophy Descartes did his best to dispense with God But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers after that he had no more use for God while a powerful contemporary Martin Schoock accused him of atheist beliefs though Descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his Meditations The Catholic Church prohibited his books in br Descartes also wrote a response to external world skepticism Through this method of skepticism he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information In other words certainty He argues that sensory perceptions come to him involuntarily and are not willed by him They are external to his senses and according to Descartes this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind and thus an external world Descartes goes on to argue that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted and that God has given him the propensity to believe that such ideas are caused by material things Descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist Descartes further explains how only God can be a true substance But minds are substances meaning they need only God for it to function The mind is a thinking substance The means for a thinking substance stem from ideas br Descartes steered clear of theological questions restricting his attention to showing that there is no incompatibility between his metaphysics and theological orthodoxy He avoided trying to demonstrate theological dogmas metaphysically When challenged that he had not established the immortality of the soul merely in showing that the soul and the body are distinct substances he replied I do not take it upon myself to try to use the power of human reason to settle any of those matters which depend on the free will of God br br br Mathematics br br br x for unknown exponential notation br br Descartes invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x y and z also known by a b and c He also pioneered the standard notation that uses superscripts to show the powers or exponents for example the used in x to indicate x squared br br br Analytic geometry br br One of Descartes most enduring legacies was his development of Cartesian or analytic geometry which uses algebra to describe geometry He was first to assign a fundamental place for algebra in the system of knowledge using it as a method to automate or mechanize reasoning particularly about abstract unknown quantities European mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics serving as the foundation of algebra Algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as Pacioli Cardano Tartaglia and Ferrari Equations of degree higher than the third were regarded as unreal because a three dimensional form such as a cube occupied the largest dimension of reality Descartes professed that the abstract quantity a could represent length as well as an area This was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians such as Fran ois Vi te who insisted that a second power must represent an area Although Descartes did not pursue the subject he preceded Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in envisioning a more general science of algebra or universal mathematics as a precursor to symbolic logic that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically and mechanize general reasoning br br br Influence on Newton s mathematics br Current popular opinion holds that Descartes had the most influence of anyone on the young Isaac Newton and this is arguably one of his most important contributions Descartes influence extended not directly from his original French edition of La G om trie however but rather from Frans van Schooten s expanded second Latin edition of the work Newton continued Descartes work on cubic equations which freed the subject from fetters of the Greek perspectives The most important concept was his very modern treatment of single variables br br br The basis of calculus br Descartes work provided the basis for the calculus developed by Leibniz and Newton who applied the infinitesimal calculus to the tangent line problem thus permitting the evolution of that branch of modern mathematics His rule of signs is also a commonly used method to determine the number of positive and negative roots of a polynomial br br br Physics br br br Philosophy metaphysics and physics br Descartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the natural sciences For him philosophy was a thinking system that embodied all knowledge as he related in a letter to a French translator br br Thus all Philosophy is like a tree of which Metaphysics is the root Physics the trunk and all the other sciences the branches that grow out of this trunk which are reduced to three principals namely Medicine Mechanics and Ethics By the science of Morals I understand the highest and most perfect which presupposing an entire knowledge of the other sciences is the last degree of wisdom br br br Mechanics br br br Mechanical philosophy br br The beginning to Descartes interest in physics is accredited to the amateur scientist and mathematician Isaac Beeckman whom he met in and who was at the forefront of a new school of thought known as mechanical philosophy With this foundation of reasoning Descartes formulated many of his theories on mechanical and geometric physics It is said that they met when both were looking at a placard that was set up in the Breda marketplace detailing a mathematical problem to be solved Descartes asked Beeckman to translate the problem from Dutch to French In their following meetings Beeckman interested Descartes in his corpuscularian approach to mechanical theory and convinced him to devote his studies to a mathematical approach to nature In Beeckman also introduced him to many of Galileo s ideas Together they worked on free fall catenaries conic sections and fluid statics Both believed that it was necessary to create a method that thoroughly linked mathematics and physics br br br Anticipating the concept of work br Although the concept of work in physics was not formally used until similar concepts existed before then In Descartes wrote br br Lifting lb one foot twice over is the same as lifting lb one foot or lb two feet br br br Conservation of motion br br In Principles of Philosophy Principia Philosophiae from Descartes outlined his views on the universe In it he describes his three laws of motion Newton s own laws of motion would later be modeled on Descartes exposition Descartes defined quantity of motion Latin quantitas motus as the product of size and speed and claimed that the total quantity of motion in the universe is conserved If x is twice the size of y and is moving half as fast then there s the same amount of motion in each God created matter along with its motion merely by letting things run their course he preserves the same amount of motion as he put there in the beginning Descartes had discovered an early form of the law of conservation of momentum He envisioned quantity of motion as pertaining to motion in a straight line as opposed to perfect circular motion as Galileo had envisioned it Descartes discovery should not be seen as the modern law of conservation of momentum since had no concept of mass as distinct from weight or size and since he believed that it is speed rather than velocity that is conserved br br br Planetary motion br Descartes vortex theory of planetary motion was later rejected by Newton in favor of his law of universal gravitation and most of the second book of Newton s Principia is devoted to his counterargument br br br Optics br Descartes also made contributions to the field of optics He showed by using geometric construction and the law of refraction also known as Descartes law or more commonly Snell s law outside France that the angular radius of a rainbow is degrees i e the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the ray passing from the sun through the rainbow s centre is He also independently discovered the law of reflection and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law br br br Meteorology br Within Discourse on the Method there is an appendix in which Descartes discusses his theories on Meteorology known as Les M t ores He first proposed the idea that the elements were made up of small particles that join together imperfectly thus leaving small spaces in between These spaces were then filled with smaller much quicker subtile matter These particles were different based on what element they constructed for example Descartes believed that particles of water were like little eels which though they join and twist around each other do not for all that ever knot or hook together in such a way that they cannot easily be separated In contrast the particles that made up the more solid material were constructed in a way that generated irregular shapes The size of the particle also matters if the particle was smaller not only was it faster and constantly moving it was more easily agitated by the larger particles which were slow but had more force The different qualities such as combinations and shapes gave rise to different secondary qualities of materials such as temperature This first idea is the basis for the rest of Descartes theory on Meteorology br While rejecting most of Aristotle s theories on Meteorology he still kept some of the terminology that Aristotle used such as vapors and exhalations These vapors would be drawn into the sky by the sun from terrestrial substances and would generate wind Descartes also theorized that falling clouds would displace the air below them also generating wind Falling clouds could also generate thunder He theorized that when a cloud rests above another cloud and the air around the top cloud is hot it condenses the vapor around the top cloud and causes the particles to fall When the particles falling from the top cloud collided with the bottom cloud s particles it would create thunder He compared his theory on thunder to his theory on avalanches Descartes believed that the booming sound that avalanches created was due to snow that was heated and therefore heavier falling onto the snow that was below it This theory was supported by experience It follows that one can understand why it thunders more rarely in winter than in summer for then not enough heat reaches the highest clouds in order to break them up br Another theory that Descartes had was on the production of lightning Descartes believed that lightning was caused by exhalations trapped between the two colliding clouds He believed that in order to make these exhalations viable to produce lightning they had to be made fine and inflammable by hot and dry weather Whenever the clouds would collide it would cause them to ignite creating lightning if the cloud above was heavier than the bottom cloud it would also produce thunder br Descartes also believed that clouds were made up of drops of water and ice and believed that rain would fall whenever the air could no longer support them It would fall as snow if the air was not warm enough to melt the raindrops And hail was when the cloud drops would melt and then freeze again because cold air would refreeze them br Descartes did not use mathematics or instruments as there were not any at the time to back up his theories on Meteorology and instead used qualitative reasoning in order to deduce his hypothesis br br br Historical impact br br br Emancipation from Church doctrine br br Descartes has often been dubbed the father of modern Western philosophy the thinker whose approaches has profoundly changed the course of Western philosophy and set the basis for modernity The first two of his Meditations on First Philosophy those that formulate the famous methodic doubt represent the portion of Descartes writings that most influenced modern thinking It has been argued that Descartes himself did not realize the extent of this revolutionary move In shifting the debate from what is true to of what can I be certain Descartes arguably shifted the authoritative guarantor of truth from God to humanity even though Descartes himself claimed he received his visions from God while the traditional concept of truth implies an external authority certainty instead relies on the judgment of the individual br In an anthropocentric revolution the human being is now raised to the level of a subject an agent an emancipated being equipped with autonomous reason This was a revolutionary step that established the basis of modernity the repercussions of which are still being felt the emancipation of humanity from Christian revelational truth and Church doctrine humanity making its own law and taking its own stand In modernity the guarantor of truth is not God anymore but human beings each of whom is a self conscious shaper and guarantor of their own reality In that way each person is turned into a reasoning adult a subject and agent as opposed to a child obedient to God This change in perspective was characteristic of the shift from the Christian medieval period to the modern period a shift that had been anticipated in other fields and which was now being formulated in the field of philosophy by Descartes br This anthropocentric perspective of Descartes work establishing human reason as autonomous provided the basis for the Enlightenment s emancipation from God and the Church According to Martin Heidegger the perspective of Descartes work also provided the basis for all subsequent anthropology Descartes philosophical revolution is sometimes said to have sparked modern anthropocentrism and subjectivism br br br Contemporary reception br In commercial terms The Discourse appeared during Descartes lifetime in a single edition of copies of which were set aside for the author Sharing a similar fate was the only French edition of The Meditations which had not managed to sell out by the time of Descartes death A concomitant Latin edition of the latter was however eagerly sought out by Europe s scholarly community and proved a commercial success for Descartes xliii xliv br Although Descartes was well known in academic circles towards the end of his life the teaching of his works in schools was controversial Henri de Roy Henricus Regius Professor of Medicine at the University of Utrecht was condemned by the Rector of the university Gijsbert Voet Voetius for teaching Descartes physics br According to philosophy professor John Cottingham Descartes s Meditations on First Philosophy is considered to be one of the key texts of Western philosophy Cottingham said that the Meditations is the most widely studied of all Descartes writings br According to Anthony Gottlieb a former senior editor of The Economist and the author of The Dream of Reason and The Dream of Enlightenment one of the reasons Descartes and Thomas Hobbes continue to be debated in the second decade of the twenty first century is that they still have something to say to us that remains relevant on questions such as What does the advance of science entail for our understanding of ourselves and our ideas of God and How is government to deal with religious diversity br In her interview with Tyler Cowen Agnes Callard described Descartes thought experiment in the Meditations where he encouraged a complete systematic doubting of everything that you believe to see what you come to She said What Descartes comes to is a kind of real truth that he can build upon inside of his own mind She said that Hamlet s monologues meditations on the nature of life and emotion were similar to Descartes thought experiment Hamlet Descartes were apart from the world as if they were trapped in their own heads Cowen asked Callard if Descartes actually found any truths through his thought experiment or was it just an earlier version of the contemporary argument that we re living in a simulation where the evil demon is the simulation rather than Bayesian reasoning Callard agreed that this argument can be traced to Descartes who had said that he had refuted it She clarified that in Descartes reasoning you do end up back in the mind of God in a universe God has created that is the real world The whole question is about being connected to reality as opposed to being a figment If you re living in the world God created God can create real things So you re living in a real world br br br Purported
