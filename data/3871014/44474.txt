id: 44474
Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System after Jupiter It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth It has only one eighth the average density of Earth but is over times more massive Even though Saturn is nearly the size of Jupiter Saturn has less than one third of Jupiter s mass Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of AU million km with an orbital period of years br Saturn s interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium and finally a gaseous outer layer Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn s planetary magnetic field which is weaker than Earth s but which has a magnetic moment times that of Earth due to Saturn s larger size Saturn s magnetic field strength is around one twentieth of Jupiter s The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast although long lived features can appear Wind speeds on Saturn can reach kilometres per hour miles per hour br The planet has a bright and extensive ring system composed mainly of ice particles with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust At least moons are known to orbit the planet of which are officially named this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings Titan Saturn s largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System is larger while less massive than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere br br br Name and symbol br Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture and father of Jupiter Its astronomical symbol has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri where it can be seen to be a Greek kappa rho ligature with a horizontal stroke as an abbreviation for Cronus the Greek name for the planet It later came to look like a lower case Greek eta with the cross added at the top in the th century to Christianize this pagan symbol br The Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday S turni di s Saturn s Day for the planet Saturn br br br Physical characteristics br Saturn is a gas giant composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium It lacks a definite surface though it is likely to have a solid core Saturn s rotation causes it to have the shape of an oblate spheroid that is it is flattened at the poles and bulges at its equator Its equatorial radius is more than larger than its polar radius km versus km mi versus mi Jupiter Uranus and Neptune the other giant planets in the Solar System are also oblate but to a lesser extent The combination of the bulge and rotation rate means that the effective surface gravity along the equator m s is of what it is at the poles and is lower than the surface gravity of Earth However the equatorial escape velocity of nearly km s is much higher than that of Earth br Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water about less Although Saturn s core is considerably denser than water the average specific density of the planet is g cm due to the atmosphere Jupiter has times Earth s mass and Saturn is times Earth s mass Together Jupiter and Saturn hold of the total planetary mass in the Solar System br br br Internal structure br Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium most of Saturn s mass is not in the gas phase because hydrogen becomes a non ideal liquid when the density is above g cm which is reached at a radius containing of Saturn s mass The temperature pressure and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers br Standard planetary models suggest that the interior of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of various volatiles Analysis of the distortion shows that Saturn is substantially more centrally condensed than Jupiter and therefore contains a significantly larger amount of material denser than hydrogen near its centre Saturn s central regions contain about hydrogen by mass while Jupiter s contain approximately hydrogen br This core is similar in composition to Earth but is more dense The examination of Saturn s gravitational moment in combination with physical models of the interior has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn s core In scientists estimated that the core must be times the mass of Earth which corresponds to a diameter of about km mi However measurements of Saturn s rings suggest a much more diffuse core with a mass equal to about Earths and a radius equal to around of Saturn s entire radius This is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer followed by a liquid layer of helium saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing altitude The outermost layer spans about km mi and consists of gas br Saturn has a hot interior reaching C F at its core and radiates times more energy into space than it receives from the Sun Jupiter s thermal energy is generated by the Kelvin Helmholtz mechanism of slow gravitational compression but such a process alone may not be sufficient to explain heat production for Saturn because it is less massive An alternative or additional mechanism may be the generation of heat through the raining out of droplets of helium deep in Saturn s interior As the droplets descend through the lower density hydrogen the process releases heat by friction and leaves Saturn s outer layers depleted of helium These descending droplets may have accumulated into a helium shell surrounding the core Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur within Saturn as well as in Jupiter and ice giants Uranus and Neptune br br br Atmosphere br The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains molecular hydrogen and helium by volume The proportion of helium is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the Sun The quantity of elements heavier than helium metallicity is not known precisely but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from the formation of the Solar System The total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be times the mass of Earth with a significant fraction located in Saturn s core region br Trace amounts of ammonia acetylene ethane propane phosphine and methane have been detected in Saturn s atmosphere The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide NH SH or water Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere leading to a series of hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn s annual seasonal cycle Cassini observed a series of cloud features found in northern latitudes nicknamed the String of Pearls These features are cloud clearings that reside in deeper cloud layers br br br Cloud layers br br Saturn s atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter s but Saturn s bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator The nomenclature used to describe these bands is the same as on Jupiter Saturn s finer cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of the Voyager spacecraft during the s Since then Earth based telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be made br The composition of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure In the upper cloud layers with temperatures in the range of K and pressures extending between bar the clouds consist of ammonia ice Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about bar and extend down to bar where temperatures range from to K Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice lying in the pressure range bar with temperatures of K Finally the lower layers where pressures are between and bar and temperatures are K contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution br Saturn s usually bland atmosphere occasionally exhibits long lived ovals and other features common on Jupiter In the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn s equator that was not present during the Voyager encounters and in another smaller storm was observed The storm was an example of a Great White Spot a short lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year roughly every Earth years around the time of the northern hemisphere s summer solstice Previous Great White Spots were observed in and with the storm being the best observed The latest giant storm was observed in In researchers used Very Large Array telescope to study Saturnian atmosphere and reported that they found long lasting signatures of all mid latitude giant storms a mixture of equatorial storms up to hundreds of years old and potentially an unreported older storm at N br The winds on Saturn are the second fastest among the Solar System s planets after Neptune s Voyager data indicate peak easterly winds of m s km h In images from the Cassini spacecraft during Saturn s northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue similar to Uranus The color was most likely caused by Rayleigh scattering Thermography has shown that Saturn s south pole has a warm polar vortex the only known example of such a phenomenon in the Solar System Whereas temperatures on Saturn are normally C temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as C suspected to be the warmest spot on Saturn br br br Hexagonal cloud patterns br br A persisting hexagonal wave pattern around the north polar vortex in the atmosphere at about N was first noted in the Voyager images The sides of the hexagon are each about km mi long which is longer than the diameter of the Earth The entire structure rotates with a period of h m s the same period as that of the planet s radio emissions which is assumed to be equal to the period of rotation of Saturn s interior The hexagonal feature does not shift in longitude like the other clouds in the visible atmosphere The pattern s origin is a matter of much speculation Most scientists think it is a standing wave pattern in the atmosphere Polygonal shapes have been replicated in the laboratory through differential rotation of fluids br HST imaging of the south polar region indicates the presence of a jet stream but no strong polar vortex nor any hexagonal standing wave NASA reported in November that Cassini had observed a hurricane like storm locked to the south pole that had a clearly defined eyewall Eyewall clouds had not previously been seen on any planet other than Earth For example images from the Galileo spacecraft did not show an eyewall in the Great Red Spot of Jupiter br The south pole storm may have been present for billions of years This vortex is comparable to the size of Earth and it has winds of km h br br br Magnetosphere br br Saturn has an intrinsic magnetic field that has a simple symmetric shape a magnetic dipole Its strength at the equator gauss T is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth s magnetic field As a result Saturn s magnetosphere is much smaller than Jupiter s br When Voyager entered the magnetosphere the solar wind pressure was high and the magnetosphere extended only Saturn radii or million km mi although it enlarged within several hours and remained so for about three days Most probably the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of Jupiter by currents in the liquid metallic hydrogen layer called a metallic hydrogen dynamo This magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the solar wind particles from the Sun The moon Titan orbits within the outer part of Saturn s magnetosphere and contributes plasma from the ionized particles in Titan s outer atmosphere Saturn s magnetosphere like Earth s produces aurorae br br br Orbit and rotation br br The average distance between Saturn and the Sun is over billion kilometers AU With an average orbital speed of km s it takes Saturn Earth days or about years to finish one revolution around the Sun As a consequence it forms a near mean motion resonance with Jupiter The elliptical orbit of Saturn is inclined relative to the orbital plane of the Earth The perihelion and aphelion distances are respectively and AU on average The visible features on Saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions as in Jupiter s case br Astronomers use three different systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn System I has a period of h m s d and encompasses the Equatorial Zone the South Equatorial Belt and the North Equatorial Belt The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to System I All other Saturnian latitudes excluding the north and south polar regions are indicated as System II and have been assigned a rotation period of h m s d System III refers to Saturn s internal rotation rate Based on radio emissions from the planet detected by Voyager and Voyager System III has a rotation period of h m s d System III has largely superseded System II br A precise value for the rotation period of the interior remains elusive While approaching Saturn in Cassini found that the radio rotation period of Saturn had increased appreciably to approximately h m s s An estimate of Saturn s rotation as an indicated rotation rate for Saturn as a whole based on a compilation of various measurements from the Cassini Voyager and Pioneer probes is h m s Studies of the planet s C Ring yield a rotation period of h m s m s m s br In March it was found that the variation in radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn s rotation rate This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn s moon Enceladus The water vapor emitted into Saturn s orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn s magnetic field slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet br An apparent oddity for Saturn is that it does not have any known trojan asteroids These are minor planets that orbit the Sun at the stable Lagrangian points designated L and L located at angles to the planet along its orbit Trojan asteroids have been discovered for Mars Jupiter Uranus and Neptune Orbital resonance mechanisms including secular resonance are believed to be the cause of the missing Saturnian trojans br br br Natural satellites br br Saturn has known moons of which have formal names It is estimated that there are other outer irregular moons larger than km mi in diameter In addition there is evidence of dozens to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of meters in Saturn s rings which are not considered to be true moons Titan the largest moon comprises more than of the mass in orbit around Saturn including the rings Saturn s second largest moon Rhea may have a tenuous ring system of its own along with a tenuous atmosphere br Many of the other moons are small are less than km in diameter Traditionally most of Saturn s moons have been named after Titans of Greek mythology Titan is the only satellite in the Solar System with a major atmosphere in which a complex organic chemistry occurs It is the only satellite with hydrocarbon lakes br On June scientists at the IAA CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan a possible precursor for life On June NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud associated with comets and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times br Saturn s moon Enceladus which seems similar in chemical makeup to comets has often been regarded as a potential habitat for microbial life Evidence of this possibility includes the satellite s salt rich particles having an ocean like composition that indicates most of Enceladus s expelled ice comes from the evaporation of liquid salt water A flyby by Cassini through a plume on Enceladus found most of the ingredients to sustain life forms that live by methanogenesis br In April NASA scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon within the A Ring which was imaged by Cassini on April br br br Planetary rings br br Saturn is probably best known for the system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique The rings extend from to kilometers to mi outward from Saturn s equator and average approximately meters ft in thickness They are composed predominantly of water ice with trace amounts of tholin impurities and a peppered coating of approximately amorphous carbon The particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to m While the other gas giants also have ring systems Saturn s is the largest and most visible br There is a debate on the age of the rings One side supports that they are ancient and were created simultaneously with Saturn from the original nebular material around billion years ago or shortly after the LHB around to billion years ago The other side supports that they are much younger created around million years ago An MIT research team supporting the latter theory proposed that the rings are remnant of a destroyed moon of Saturn named Chrysalis br Beyond the main rings at a distance of million km million mi from the planet is the sparse Phoebe ring It is tilted at an angle of to the other rings and like Phoebe orbits in retrograde fashion br Some of the moons of Saturn including Pandora and Prometheus act as shepherd moons to confine the rings and prevent them from spreading out Pan and Atlas cause weak linear density waves in Saturn s rings that have yielded more reliable calculations of their masses br In September astronomers reported studies suggesting that the rings of Saturn may have resulted from the collision of two moons a few hundred million years ago br br br History of observation and exploration br The observation and exploration of Saturn can be divided into three phases pre modern observations with the naked eye telescopic observations from Earth beginning in the th century and visitation by space probes in orbit or on flyby In the st century telescopic observations continue from Earth including Earth orbiting observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope and until its retirement from the Cassini orbiter around Saturn br br br Pre telescopic observation br br Saturn has been known since prehistoric times and in early recorded history it was a major character in various mythologies Babylonian astronomers systematically observed and recorded the movements of Saturn In ancient Greek the planet was known as Phainon and in Roman times it was known as the star of Saturn In ancient Roman mythology the planet Phainon was sacred to this agricultural god from which the planet takes its modern name The Romans considered the god Saturnus the equivalent of the Greek god Cronus in modern Greek the planet retains the name Cronus Kronos br The Greek scientist Ptolemy based his calculations of Saturn s orbit on observations he made while it was in opposition In Hindu astrology there are nine astrological objects known as Navagrahas Saturn is known as Shani and judges everyone based on the good and bad deeds performed in life Ancient Chinese and Japanese culture designated the planet Saturn as the earth star This was based on Five Elements which were traditionally used to classify natural elements br In Hebrew Saturn is called Shabbathai Its angel is Cassiel Its intelligence or beneficial spirit is Ag l Hebrew romanized Agyal and its darker spirit demon is Z z l Hebrew romanized Zazl Zazel has been described as a great angel invoked in Solomonic magic who is effective in love conjurations In Ottoman Turkish Urdu and Malay the name of Zazel is Zuhal derived from the Arabic language Arabic romanized Zuhal br br br Telescopic pre spaceflight observations br br Saturn s rings require at least a mm diameter telescope to resolve and thus were not known to exist until Christiaan Huygens saw them in and published about this in Galileo with his primitive telescope in incorrectly thought of Saturn s appearing not quite round as two moons on Saturn s sides It was not until Huygens used greater telescopic magnification that this notion was refuted and the rings were truly seen for the first time Huygens also discovered Saturn s moon Titan Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four other moons Iapetus Rhea Tethys and Dione In Cassini discovered the gap now known as the Cassini Division br No further discoveries of significance were made until when William Herschel discovered two further moons Mimas and Enceladus The irregularly shaped satellite Hyperion which has a resonance with Titan was discovered in by a British team br In William Henry Pickering discovered Phoebe a highly irregular satellite that does not rotate synchronously with Saturn as the larger moons do Phoebe was the first such satellite found and it took more than a year to orbit Saturn in a retrograde orbit During the early th century research on Titan led to the confirmation in that it had a thick atmosphere a feature unique among the Solar System s moons br br br Spaceflight missions br br br Pioneer flyby br br Pioneer made the first flyby of Saturn in September when it passed within km mi of the planet s cloud tops Images were taken of the planet and a few of its moons although their resolution was too low to discern surface detail The spacecraft also studied Saturn s rings revealing the thin F ring and the fact that dark gaps in the rings are bright when viewed at a high phase angle towards the Sun meaning that they contain fine light scattering material In addition Pioneer measured the temperature of Titan br br br Voyager flybys br In November the Voyager probe visited the Saturn system It sent back the first high resolution images of the planet its rings and satellites Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time Voyager performed a close flyby of Titan increasing knowledge of the atmosphere of the moon It proved that Titan s atmosphere is impenetrable at visible wavelengths therefore no surface details were seen The flyby changed the spacecraft s trajectory out of the plane of the Solar System br Almost a year later in August Voyager continued the study of the Saturn system More close up images of Saturn s moons were acquired as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings During the flyby the probe s turnable camera platform stuck for a couple of days and some planned imaging was lost Saturn s gravity was used to direct the spacecraft s trajectory towards Uranus br The probes discovered and confirmed several new satellites orbiting near or within the planet s rings as well as the small Maxwell Gap a gap within the C Ring and Keeler gap a km wide gap in the A Ring br br br Cassini Huygens spacecraft br br The Cassini Huygens space probe entered orbit around Saturn on July In June it conducted a close flyby of Phoebe sending back high resolution images and data Cassini s flyby of Saturn s largest moon Titan captured radar images of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands and mountains The orbiter completed two Titan flybys before releasing the Huygens probe on December Huygens descended onto the surface of Titan on January br Starting in early scientists used Cassini to track lightning on Saturn The power of the lightning is approximately times that of lightning on Earth br br In NASA reported that Cassini had found evidence of liquid water reservoirs no more than tens of meters below the surface that erupt in geysers on Saturn s moon Enceladus These jets of icy particles are emitted into orbit around Saturn from vents in the moon s south polar region Over geysers have been identified on Enceladus In May NASA scientists reported that Enceladus is emerging as the most habitable spot beyond Earth in the Solar System for life as we know it br Cassini photographs have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and E rings The source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off Janus and Epimetheus In July images were returned of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan s north pole the presence of which were confirmed in January In March hydrocarbon seas were found near the North pole the largest of which is almost the size of the Caspian Sea In October the probe detected an km mi diameter cyclone like storm with an eyewall at Saturn s south pole br From to November the probe discovered and confirmed eight new satellites In April Cassini sent back images of a hurricane at the planet s north pole times larger than those found on Earth with winds faster than km h mph On September the Cassini Huygens spacecraft performed the Grand Finale of its mission a number of passes through gaps between Saturn and Saturn s inner rings The atmospheric entry of Cassini ended the mission br br br Possible future missions br The continued exploration of Saturn is still considered to be a viable option for NASA as part of their ongoing New Frontiers program of missions NASA previously requested for plans to be put forward for a mission to Saturn that included the Saturn Atmospheric Entry Probe and possible investigations into the habitability and possible discovery of life on Saturn s moons Titan and Enceladus by Dragonfly br br br Observation br br Saturn is the most distant of the five planets easily visible to the naked eye from Earth the other four being Mercury Venus Mars and Jupiter Uranus and occasionally Vesta are visible to the naked eye in dark skies Saturn appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright yellowish point of light The mean apparent magnitude of Saturn is with a standard deviation of Most of the magnitude variation is due to the inclination of the ring system relative to the Sun and Earth The brightest magnitude occurs near the time when the plane of the rings is inclined most highly and the faintest magnitude occurs around the time when they are least inclined It takes approximately years for the planet to complete an entire circuit of the ecliptic against the background constellations of the zodiac Most people will require an optical aid very large binoculars or a small telescope that magnifies at least times to achieve an image of Saturn s rings in which a clear resolution is present When Earth passes through the ring plane which occurs twice every Saturnian year roughly every Earth years the rings briefly disappear from view because they are so thin Such a disappearance will next occur in but Saturn will be too close to the Sun for observations br Saturn and its rings are best seen when the planet is at or near opposition the configuration of a planet when it is at an elongation of and thus appears opposite the Sun in the sky A Saturnian opposition occurs every year approximately every days and results in the planet appearing at its brightest Both the Earth and Saturn orbit the Sun on eccentric orbits which means their distances from the Sun vary over time and therefore so do their distances from each other hence varying the brightness of Saturn from one opposition to the next Saturn also appears brighter when the rings are angled such that they are more visible For example during the opposition of December Saturn appeared at its brightest due to the favorable orientation of its rings relative to the Earth even though Saturn was closer to the Earth and Sun in late br From time to time Saturn is occulted by the Moon that is the Moon covers up Saturn in the sky As with all the planets in the Solar System occultations of Saturn occur in seasons Saturnian occultations will take place monthly for about a month period followed by about a five year period in which no such activity is registered The Moon s orbit is inclined by several degrees relative to Saturn s so occultations will only occur when Saturn is near one of the points in the sky where the two planes intersect both the length of Saturn s year and the Earth year nodal precession period of the Moon s orbit influence the periodicity br br br See also br Statistics of planets in the Solar System br br br Notes br br br br br br Further reading br Alexander Arthur Francis O Donel The Planet Saturn A
