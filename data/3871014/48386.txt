title: Horizontal coordinate system

The horizontal coordinate system is a celestial coordinate system that uses the observer s local horizon as the fundamental plane to define two angles altitude and azimuth br Therefore the horizontal coordinate system is sometimes called the az el system the alt az system or the alt azimuth system among others In an altazimuth mount of a telescope the instrument s two axes follow altitude and azimuth br br br Definition br This celestial coordinate system divides the sky into two hemispheres The upper hemisphere where objects are above the horizon and are visible and the lower hemisphere where objects are below the horizon and cannot be seen since the Earth obstructs views of them The great circle separating the hemispheres is called the celestial horizon which is defined as the great circle on the celestial sphere whose plane is normal to the local gravity vector In practice the horizon can be defined as the plane tangent to a quiet liquid surface such as a pool of mercury The pole of the upper hemisphere is called the zenith The pole of the lower hemisphere is called the nadir br The following are two independent horizontal angular coordinates br br Altitude alt sometimes referred to as elevation el or apparent height is the angle between the object and the observer s local horizon For visible objects it is an angle between and br Azimuth az is the angle of the object around the horizon usually measured from true north and increasing eastward Exceptions are for example ESO s FITS convention where it is measured from the south and increasing westward or the FITS convention of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey where it is measured from the south and increasing eastward br A horizontal coordinate system should not be confused with a topocentric coordinate system Horizontal coordinates define the observer s orientation but not location of the origin while topocentric coordinates define the origin location on the Earth s surface in contrast to a geocentric celestial system br br br General features br The horizontal coordinate system is fixed to a location on Earth not the stars Therefore the altitude and azimuth of an object in the sky changes with time as the object appears to drift across the sky with Earth s rotation In addition since the horizontal system is defined by the observer s local horizon the same object viewed from different locations on Earth at the same time will have different values of altitude and azimuth br The cardinal points on the horizon have specific values of azimuth that are helpful references br br Horizontal coordinates are very useful for determining the rise and set times of an object in the sky When an object s altitude is it is on the horizon If at that moment its altitude is increasing it is rising but if its altitude is decreasing it is setting However all objects on the celestial sphere are subject to diurnal motion which always appears to be westward br A northern observer can determine whether altitude is increasing or decreasing by instead considering the azimuth of the celestial object br br If the azimuth is between and north east south the object is rising br If the azimuth is between and south west north the object is setting br There are the following special cases br br All directions are south when viewed from the North Pole and all directions are north when viewed from the South Pole so the azimuth is undefined in both locations When viewed from either pole a star or any object with fixed equatorial coordinates has constant altitude and thus never rises or sets The Sun Moon and planets can rise or set over the span of a year when viewed from the poles because their declinations are constantly changing br When viewed from the equator objects on the celestial poles stay at fixed points perched on the horizon br br br See also br br br Footnotes br br br br br br External links br explanations of the horizontal co ordinate system video Archived from the original on via YouTube
