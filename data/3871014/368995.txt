title: Tincture (heraldry)
id: 368995
Tincture is the limited palette of colours and patterns used in heraldry The need to define depict and correctly blazon the various tinctures is one of the most important aspects of heraldic art and design br br br Development and history br The use of tinctures dates back to the formative period of European heraldry in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries The range of tinctures and the manner of depicting and describing them has evolved over time as new variations and practices have developed br The basic scheme and rules of applying the heraldic tinctures dates back to the th century The earliest surviving coloured heraldic illustrations from the mid thirteenth century show the standardized usage of two metals five colours and two furs Since that time the great majority of heraldic art has employed these nine tinctures br Over time variations on these basic tinctures were developed particularly with respect to the furs Authorities differ as to whether these variations should be considered separate tinctures or merely varieties of existing ones Two additional colours appeared and were generally accepted by heraldic writers although they remained scarce and were eventually termed stains from the belief that they were used to signify some dishonour on the part of the bearer The practice of depicting certain charges as they appear in nature termed proper was established in the seventeenth century Other colours have appeared occasionally since the eighteenth century especially in continental heraldry but their use is infrequent and they have never been regarded as particularly heraldic or numbered among the tinctures that form the basis of heraldic design br br br Frequency and national variants br The frequency with which different tinctures have been used over time has been much observed but little studied There are some general trends of note both with respect to the passage of time and noted preferences from one region to another br In medieval heraldry gules was by far the most common tincture followed by the metals argent and or at least one of which necessarily appeared on the majority of arms see below Among the colours sable was the second most common followed by azure Vert although present from the formative period of heraldic design was relatively scarce Over time the popularity of azure increased above that of sable while gules still the most common became less dominant A survey of French arms granted during the seventeenth century reveals a distinct split between the trends for the arms granted to nobles and commoners Among nobles gules remained the most common tincture closely followed by or then by argent and azure at nearly equal levels sable was a very distant fifth choice while vert remained scarce Among commoners azure was easily the most common tincture followed by or and only then by gules argent and sable which was used more by commoners than among the nobility vert however was even scarcer in common arms Purpure is so scarce in French heraldry that some authorities do not regard it as a real heraldic tincture br On the whole French heraldry is known for its use of azure and or while English heraldry is characterized by heavy use of gules and argent and unlike French heraldry it has always made regular use of vert and occasional if not extensive use of purpure German heraldry is known for its extensive use of or and sable German and Nordic heraldry rarely make use of purpure or ermine except in mantling pavilions and the lining of crowns and caps In fact furs occur infrequently in German and Nordic heraldry br br br List br br The colours and patterns of the heraldic palette are divided into three groups usually known as metals colours and furs br br br Metals br The metals are or and argent representing gold and silver respectively although in practice they are often depicted as yellow and white br Or Ger Gelb Gold or golden derives its name from the Latin aurum gold It may be depicted using either yellow or metallic gold at the artist s discretion yellow has no separate existence in heraldry and is never used to represent any tincture other than or br Argent Ger Wei Weiss Silber or silbern is similarly derived from the Latin argentum silver Although sometimes depicted as metallic silver or faint grey it is more often represented by white in part because of the tendency for silver paint to oxidize and darken over time and in part because of the pleasing effect of white against a contrasting colour Notwithstanding the widespread use of white for argent some heraldic authorities have suggested the existence of white as a distinct heraldic colour br br br Colours br Five colours have been recognized since the earliest days of heraldry These are gules or red sable or black azure or blue vert or green and purpure or purple br Gules Fr gueules Ger Rot is of uncertain derivation outside of the heraldic context the modern French word refers to the mouth of an animal br Sable Ger Schwarz is named for a type of marten known for its dark luxuriant fur br Azure Fr azur or bleu Ger Blau comes through the Arabic l zaward from the Persian l avard br both referring to the blue mineral lapis lazuli used to produce blue pigments br Vert Fr vert or sinople Ger Gr n is from Latin viridis green The alternative name in French sinople is derived from the ancient city of Sinope in Asia Minor Turkey which was famous for its pigments br Purpure Fr purpure or pourpre Ger Purpur is from Latin purpura in turn from Greek porphyra the dye known as Tyrian purple This expensive dye known from antiquity produced a much redder purple than the modern heraldic colour and in fact earlier depictions of purpure are far redder than recent ones As a heraldic colour purpure may have originated as a variation of gules br br br Stains br Three more tinctures were eventually acknowledged by most heraldic authorities sanguine a venous blood red murrey a dark red or mulberry colour and tenn an orange or dark yellow to brownish colour These were termed stains by some of the more influential heraldic writers and supposed to represent some sort of dishonour on the part of the bearer but in fact there is no evidence that they were ever so employed and they probably originated as mere variations of existing colours Nevertheless the belief that they represented stains upon the honour of an armiger served to prevent them receiving widespread use and it is only in recent times that they have begun to appear on a regular basis br Sanguine from the Latin sanguineus blood red one the so called stains in British armory is a dark blood red between gules and purpure in hue It probably originated as a mere variation of red and may in fact represent the original hue of purpure which is now treated as a much bluer colour than when it first appeared in heraldry Although long shunned in the belief that it represented some dishonour on the part of the bearer br Murrey from the Greek morum mulberry it has found some use in the twentieth and twenty first centuries Murrey is also the official colour of the Order of the Bath ribbon br Tenn or tenny or tawny from Latin tannare to tan is the third of the so called stains It is most often depicted as orange but sometimes as tawny yellow or brown In earlier times it was occasionally used in continental heraldry but in England largely confined to livery br br br Furs br br The use of heraldic furs alongside the metals and colours dates to the beginning of the art In this earliest period there were only two furs ermine and vair Ermine represents the fur of the stoat a type of weasel in its white winter coat when it is called an ermine Vair represents the winter coat of the red squirrel which is blue grey above and white below These furs were commonly used to line the cloaks and robes of the nobility Both ermine and vair give the appearance of being a combination of metal and colour but in heraldic convention they are considered a separate class of tincture that is neither metal nor colour Over time several variations of ermine and vair have appeared together with three additional furs typically encountered in continental heraldry known as plumet papelonn and k rsch the origins of which are more mysterious but which probably began as variations of vair br br br Ermine br br Ermine Fr hermine Ger hermelin is normally depicted as a white field powdered with black spots known as ermine spots representing the ermine s black tail The use of white instead of silver is normal even when silver is available since this is how the fur naturally appears but occasionally silver is used to depict ermine There is considerable variation in the shape of ermine spots in the oldest depictions they were drawn realistically as long tapering points in modern times they are typically drawn as arrowheads usually topped by three small dots br br br Vair br br Vair Ger Feh derives its name from Latin varius variegated It is usually depicted as a series of alternating shapes conventionally known as panes or vair bells of argent and azure arranged in horizontal rows so that the panes of one tincture form the upper part of the row while those of the opposite tincture are on the bottom Succeeding rows are staggered so that the bases of the panes making up each row are opposite those of the other tincture in the rows above and below As with ermine the argent panes may be depicted as either white or silver silver is used more often with vair than with ermine but the natural fur is white br When the pattern of vair is used with other colours the field is termed vair or vairy of the tinctures used Normally vair consists of one metal and one colour although ermine or one of its variants is sometimes used with an ermine spot appearing in each pane of that tincture Vair of four colours Ger Buntfeh gay coloured or checked vair is also known usually consisting of two metals and two colours br Several variant shapes exist of which the most common is known as potent Ger Sturzkr ckenfeh upside down crutch vair In this form the familiar vair bell is replaced by a T shaped figure known as a potent due to its resemblance to a crutch Other furs sometimes encountered in continental heraldry which are thought to be derived from vair include plumet or plumetty and papelonn or papellony In plumet the panes are depicted as feathers in papelonn they are depicted as scales resembling those of a butterfly s wings whence the name is derived These can be modified with the colour arrangement and size variants of vair though those variants are much less common In German heraldry there is also a fur known as K rsch or vair bellies consisting of panes depicted hairy and brown Here the phrase vair bellies may be a misnomer as the belly of the red squirrel is always white although its summer coat is indeed reddish brown br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Other tinctures br Several other tinctures are occasionally encountered usually in continental heraldry br br Cendr e or ash colour br Brun tre Ger Braun or brown occasionally used in German heraldry in place of purpure br Bleu c leste or bleu de ciel a sky blue colour intended to be lighter than azure br Amaranth or columbine a strong violet red found in at least one grant of arms to a Bohemian knight in br Eisen farbe or iron colour found in German heraldry br Carnation often used in French heraldry as the colour of white human skin br The heraldic scholar A C Fox Davies proposed that in some circumstances white should be considered a heraldic colour distinct from argent In a number of instances a label or collar blazoned as white rather than argent appears on a supporter blazoned argent or or The use of white in place of argent would be consistent with the Victorian practice of heraldic blazon that discouraged repeating the name of a tincture in describing a coat of arms but if it were merely intended as a synonym of argent this placement would clearly violate the rule against placing metal on metal or colour on colour see below This difficulty is avoided if white is considered a colour in this particular instance rather than a synonym of argent This interpretation has neither been accepted nor refuted by any heraldic authority but a counter argument is that the labels are not intended to represent a heraldic tincture but are in fact white labels proper br Other exceptional colours have occasionally appeared during the twentieth and twenty first centuries br The arms of the Jewish Autonomous Region in Russia have a field of aquamarine br The Canadian Heraldic Authority granted arms containing rose as a colour in In the Authority granted arms including copper treated as a metal to the municipality of Whitehorse Yukon br Ochre both red and yellow appears in South African heraldry the national coat of arms adopted in includes red ochre while possibly yellow but more likely red ochre appears in the arms of the University of Transkei br In the United States heraldry is not governed by any official authority but the United States Army which makes extensive use of heraldry does have its own authority the United States Army Institute of Heraldry The armorial designs of the Institute of Heraldry include a number of novel tinctures including buff employed variously as either a metal or a colour and horizon blue Silver gray has appeared in the heraldry of both the Army and the Air Force Bronze appears as a colour in the arms of the Special Troops Battalion of the nd Brigade st Cavalry Division There seems to be some confusion about the colour crimson as in some cases it is treated as a separate tincture while in others it is used to specify the shade of gules to be employed by the artist Similar issue exists about a blue green colour referred to as teal or turquoise which is either treated separate or as a specific shade of azure or c leste Differing from most heraldic practice the Institute of Heraldry often specifies the exact shades to be used in depicting various arms br Buff is also used by the Canadian Heraldic Authority who treat it as a colour br br br Proper br A charge that is coloured as it naturally appears is blazoned proper Fr propre or the colour of nature Strictly speaking proper is not a tincture in itself and if as is sometimes the case a charge is meant to be depicted in particular colours that are not apparent from the word proper alone they may be specified in whatever detail is necessary Certain charges are considered proper when portrayed with particular colours even though a range of different colours is found in nature for instance a popinjay proper is green even though wild parrots occur in a variety of colours In some cases a charge depicted in a particular set of colours may be referred to as proper even though it consists entirely of heraldic tinctures a rose proper whether red or white is barbed vert and seeded or br The most extensive use of non heraldic colours is probably associated with landscape heraldry a common feature of British and German armory during the latter part of the eighteenth century and the early part of the nineteenth Although rarely used for the field itself landscapes were often granted as augmentations typically depicting a fortress successfully captured or defended or a particular ship or a battle in which the armiger to whom the augmentation was granted was involved Such landscapes usually appearing on a chief might be blazoned with great particularity as to the things portrayed and the colours used to portray them Officially these landscapes appeared on a field of argent but it was common and perhaps expected for the artist to add further details such as the sky and clouds by which the field might be wholly obscured The use of landscapes in heraldry fell out of fashion during the Victorian era when heraldic scholars and artists began looking to earlier and simpler periods of armorial design for inspiration br br br Terminology br In the English speaking world heraldic terminology is based largely on that of British armory which in turn is based on Norman French With respect to the heraldic tinctures French heraldry which is often cited by heraldic authors uses similar terminology However German heraldry also highly influential uses a different vocabulary it calls the colours by their everyday names br In its original sense tincture refers only to the group conventionally referred to as colours But as the word colour seems inapplicable to the heraldic furs and no other term clearly encompasses all three classes the word tincture has come to be used in this broader sense while colour has acquired the more restricted sense originally given to tincture Thus when consulting various heraldic authorities care must be taken to determine which meaning each term is given br br br Designations br br br Artistic liberties br In most heraldic tradition the various metals and colours have no fixed appearance hue or shade The heraldic artist is free to choose a lighter or darker blue or green a deeper or brighter red to choose between depicting or with yellow or any of various gold paints to depict argent as white or silver Recently the College of Arms explained there are no fixed shades for heraldic colours If the official description of a coat of arms gives its tinctures as Gules red Azure blue and Argent white or silver then as long as the blue is not too light and the red not too orange purple or pink it is up to the artists to decide which particular shades they think are appropriate br br br In blazoning br br Most heraldic authors do not capitalize the names of the various tinctures although a few do sometimes inconsistently and some who do not capitalize the other tinctures recommend capitalizing or in order to avoid confusion with the conjunction However there are relatively few occasions in which the conjunction or would appear in the blazon of a coat of arms and if properly worded which meaning is intended should be readily apparent from the context Another convention has been to capitalize only the first word or the first tincture appearing in the blazon but no other words In the elaborate calligraphy appearing on most grants of arms all of the tinctures are capitalized as indeed are the names of the charges but this is purely a matter of decorative style and in no way does the manner of capitalization used in the original grant affect how the arms may be described on other occasions br A long standing heraldic tradition has been to avoid repeating the names of tinctures multiple times in any given blazon If it is possible to mention multiple charges of the same tincture at once followed by the name of the tincture then this problem is avoided but when it is impossible to combine elements of the same tincture in this manner more creative descriptions may be used For example instead of gules on a fess or between three chess rooks argent a lion passant gules armed and langued argent one might say gules on a fess or between three chess rooks argent a lion passant of the field armed and langued of the third Similar phrases include of the last and of the like Alternately descriptions such as gold and silver might be substituted for or and argent on a subsequent occurrence Another rule of blazon relating to tinctures suggests the placing of a comma after each occurrence of a tincture br In recent years the College of Arms has regularly dispensed with many of these practices believing them to cause confusion and in new grants of arms the names of tinctures are repeated on each instance that they occur The names of all tinctures and charges are capitalized although the word proper indicating the colour of nature is not and internal commas are entirely omitted br br br Rule of tincture br br The first so called rule of heraldry is the rule of tincture metal should not be placed upon metal nor colour upon colour for the sake of contrast br The main duty of a heraldic device is to be recognized and the dark colours or light metals are supposed to be too difficult to distinguish if they are placed on top of other dark or light colours particularly in poor light Though this is the practical genesis of the rule the rule is technical and appearance is not used in determining whether arms conform to the rule Another reason sometimes given to justify this rule is that it was difficult to paint enamel colours over other enamel colours or with metal over metal br This rule has at times been followed so pedantically that arms that violate it were called armes fausses false arms or armes enqu rir arms of enquiry any violation was presumed to be intentional to the point that one was supposed to enquire how it came to pass One of the most famous armes enqu rir was the shield of the Kingdom of Jerusalem which had gold crosses on silver This use of white and gold together is also seen on the arms of the King of Jerusalem the flag and arms of the Vatican and the bishop s mitre in the arms of Andorra These uses of gold on silver indicate the exceptional holy and special status of these coats of arms An example of colour on colour is the arms of Albania with its sable two headed eagle on a gules field br The rule of tincture has had an influence reaching far beyond heraldry It has been applied to the design of flags so that the flag of Saxe Weimar Eisenach was modified to conform to the rule br br br Counterchanging br When a charge or group of charges is placed across a division line variation or ordinary it may be counterchanged Fr contre chang but modern de l un en l autre Ger verwechselte Farben or verschr nkte Farben meaning that the charges are divided the same way as the field upon which they rest with the colours reversed br br In the municipal arms of Behnsdorf Saxony Anhalt seen here the field is divided with the left half white argent and the right half green vert and the counterchanged tree is green where it lies on the white part of the field and white where it lies on the green part br br The flag of Maryland is another example of counterchanging The only U S state flag to be directly based on English heraldry it is the arms of George Calvert st Baron Baltimore who founded the colony of Maryland in In the st and th quarters the field is divided into six vertical bands of gold or and black sable with a diagonal band a bend in which the colours are reversed i e the bend is counterchanged The nd and rd quarters are themselves quartered between white argent and red gules with a counterchanged cross bottony that is red where it lies on the white part of the field and white where it lies on the red part of the field br Counterchanging is rare in early heraldry early examples from German heraldry are found in the late fifteenth century Wernigerode Armorial it becomes more frequently applied from the seventeenth century onward especially with the substantial number of newly created coats of arms of which some notable examples include Baron Baltimore Nightingale baronets Barrett Lennard baronets Verney baronets and Baron Alvingham br In Scottish heraldry charges are sometimes blazoned as counterchanged of different colours from the field for instance per fess gules and azure a sun in splendour counterchanged or and of the first A more typical blazon for this would be per fess gules and azure a sun in splendour per fess or and of the first br The term countercoloured is sometimes used in place of counterchanged The arms of the Fenwick baronets were originally blazoned as silver a chief gules with six martlets countercoloured In this case three martlets argent rest on a chief gules while three martlets gules rest on the argent field Some heraldic authorities regard the use of this term as erroneous br br Examples of counterchanging br br br br br br br br br br br Monochromatic presentation br br br Hatching br br During the first half of the seventeenth century the proliferation of the printing press coupled with the persistence of difficulties in and expense of colour printing prompted the development of a number of systems of hatching for the purpose of depicting heraldic designs without the use of colour Intended chiefly for printing and engraving the system which eventually gained widespread acceptance was that of Silvestro de Petra Sancta a Jesuit priest and heraldic scholar originally published in br In Petra Sancta s method illustrated in the table above a separate hatching represents each metal and colour while the furs are treated as combinations of metal and colour Argent is represented by a plain field while or is represented by a field strewn with dots Gules is represented by vertical lines azure by horizontal lines and sable by a combination of horizontal and vertical lines Diagonal lines running from dexter chief to sinister base represent vert while purpure is the reverse represented by diagonal lines running from sinister chief to dexter base Sanguine is represented by diagonal lines running in each direction while tenn is represented by a combination of horizontal lines and diagonal lines running from sinister chief to dexter base br Nine additional hatchings published by Marcus Vulson de la Colombi re in were intended to represent other colours although none of them correspond with regular heraldic tinctures and they have never been used in British armory A combination of vertical lines with diagonal lines running from dexter chief to sinister base represents brown blood red is represented by vertical lines combined with diagonal lines running from sinister chief to dexter base earth colour by horizontal and vertical lines combined with diagonal lines running from dexter chief to sinister base iron grey by diagonal lines running in each direction the same as sanguine in Petra Sancta s system water colour by broken horizontal lines flesh colour by broken vertical lines ashen grey by a combination of broken horizontal and broken diagonal lines orange by broken vertical lines interspersed with dots and the colour of nature by zig zag lines running from dexter chief to sinister base br br br Tricking br br Before the use of hatching to depict individual heraldic tinctures it was common to label colours in heraldic designs with abbreviations a practice known as tricking when colours were unavailable The arms would be drawn in outline and the tinctures written in abbreviated form O or or for or A ar or arg for argent G or gu for gules S or sa for sable Az or B for azure B for blue being used in older trickings to avoid confusion between ar and az Vt for vert Purp for purpure and Pr for proper Although most records of the College of Arms are in colour the practice of tricking is used in all other cases even after the widespread adoption of hatching for printing and engraving arms br French heraldry also uses tricking to depict heraldic tinctures using O for or A for argent G for gules S for sable B for bleu to avoid confusing azur with argent V for vert to avoid confusing sinople with sable P for purpure or pourpre and Pr for propre br In German heraldry G is used for gelb gold W for weiss white R for rot red S for schwarz black B for blau blue and Gr or a shape like an upright leaf for gr n green German heraldry makes little use of purpure but in its place allows Br for braun brown These abbreviations may be either capitalized or lowercase br br br Poetic representation br br Heraldry has been influenced by allegorical and astrological views including the idea of sympathies and antipathies among stars minerals animals plants and people Some tinctures were considered to represent astrological symbols br The lore of sympathies originated with the Babylonians who saw gems and rare minerals as the concentrates of cosmic powers Later Pliny the Elder s Natural History organized nature according to a system of sympathies and antipathies among species and other elements of the natural world This doctrine influenced medieval medicine pharmacy alchemy and also heraldry During the s the work of Bartolo de Sassoferrato linked Or to the sun Azure to the element air and Gules to the element fire Honor Bonet a heraldist from Provence declared in his work Arbre des Batailles that the metal gold Or is the noblest in the world because due to its very nature it is bright and shining and full of virtues During the late medieval period and Renaissance there was an occasional practice of blazoning tinctures by gemstones or by references to the seven classical planets including the sun and the moon br The work of Bonet influenced the th century Burgundian heraldist Jean Courtois d also known as the Sicily Herald In his work Le Blason des Couleurs Courtois developed a heraldic system consisting of the tinctures planets and carbuncles together with the virtues metals months the zodiac and weekdays His main contribution was the development of a gemstone planetary blazon that related colour to gemstone to planet or topaz the sun argent pearl the moon gules ruby Mars sable diamond Saturn azure sapphire Jupiter vert emerald Venus purpure amethyst Mercury tenn jacinth dragon s head ascending lunar node sanguine murrey sardonyx dragon s tail descending lunar node br The dragon s head also called Anabibazon in astronomy and astrology and dragon s tail also called Catabibazon were in use from ancient times In heraldry the dragon s head symbolizes a light colour tenn and dragon s tail symbolizes a dark colour sanguine In alchemy the dragon s head is the materia prima that is subjected to transmutation to produce the philosopher s stone During the process of transmutation the light coloured starting material is transformed to a darker and more reddish one In astrology the dragon s head is connected to good luck while the dragon s tail is unlucky These links indicate that heraldry in the th century was strongly under the influence of magical views and alchemistic ideas which were in turn connected to the lore of sympathies between colours planets gemstones metals virtues etc br The work of Jean Courtois was distributed in manuscripts and later in one of the first books printed in French During the Tudor and Stuart dynasties in England it appeared in heraldry manuals In his book Trait du blason Cl ment Prinsault deals with the relation of colours to the virtues the seven planets the celestial signs gemstones weekdays the three elements etc This book is among the earliest writings on heraldry available today br The English historian and heraldist Sir Henry Spelman used the symbols of the planets to designate tinctures in his book Aspilogia Sir John Ferne d enumerates different methods of blazon by colours by planets by precious stones by virtues by celestial signs by the months of the year by the days of the week by the ages of man by flowers by the elements by the seasons of the year by the complexions of man by numbers and by metals br As well as the main tinctures tricking abbreviations for other tinctures such as Proper ppr pp Ermine er etc existed in English and some other languages during the Renaissance To designate carnation carnea tinctura the zodiac sign of Leo was used in reverse German heraldry used trefoil to designate colours other than the seven main tinctures qui ultimus color alibi signo trifolii pinguitur Spener p also linked tenn and sanguine to the zodiac sign of Leo Rudolphi also refers to trefoil as a designation of colour vert usually connected with Venus He also assigned specific variants of astrological signs for dragon s head and dragon s tail derived from the sign for Leo to the tinctures orange and carnation respectively br Ultimately a system of nine tinctures was developed with dukes earls and barons having their arms blazoned by gemstones and princes kings and emperors having arms blazoned by the planets The Austrian troubadour and herald Peter Suchenwirt c used gemstones to designate the tinctures even earlier c in the coat of arms of the Hungarian king Louis the Great Konrad von W rzburg c also mentioned coats of arms made of gemstones in his poem Turnier von Nantheiz c for example describing the arms of the king of England as an escutcheon covered with Arabian gold with leopards made of rubies lines br br br Footnotes br br br br br
