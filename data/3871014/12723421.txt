id: 12723421
A colour cast is a tint of a particular colour usually unwanted that evenly affects a photographic image in whole or in part br Certain types of light can cause film and digital cameras to render a colour cast Illuminating a subject with light sources of different colour temperatures will usually cause colour cast problems in the shadows The human eye generally does not notice the unnatural colour because our eyes and brains adjust and compensate for different types of light in ways that cameras cannot br In film colour casts can also be caused by problems in photo development Improper timing or imbalanced chemical mixtures can cause unwanted casts br Colour casts can also occur in old photographs due to fading of dyes particularly under the action of ultraviolet light These may be correctable on a scanned version of the photograph with image editing techniques br br br Solutions br br Most digital cameras try to automatically detect and compensate colour cast and usually have a selection of manually set white balance settings to choose from Otherwise photo editing programs such as Photoshop often have built in colour correction facilities For film blue filters and amber filters are used to counter casts Amber filters are used to reduce the blueish tint caused by daylight Blue filters reduce the orange colour caused by incandescent light br A variety of coloured filters in varying degrees of intensity are available Kodak s amber filters for example vary from palest yellow C to deepest amber B A photographer chooses which filter to use based on the quality of the ambient light Colour temperature meters can read the temperature of the existing lighting conditions and guide the selection of the filter Clouded sky for example requires a paler amber than clear blue sky If a filter is unavailable using a flash is an alternative solution which usually provides enough neutral white light to counter the cast br In the case of film if photographs all contain the same cast it is usually indicative of improper chemical development If the film itself does not contain any cast it can be reused to create another set of photographs in proper chemical conditions If the film contains a cast filters can be used during photo processing to correct it br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br See also br Colour balance br Colour temperature br br br
