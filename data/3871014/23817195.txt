Naturales quaestiones Natural Questions is a Latin work of natural philosophy written by Seneca around AD It is not a systematic encyclopedia like the Naturalis Historia of Pliny the Elder though with Pliny s work it represents one of the few Roman works dedicated to investigating the natural world Seneca s investigation takes place mainly through the consideration of the views of other thinkers both Greek and Roman though it is not without original thought One of the most unusual features of the work is Seneca s articulation of the natural philosophy with moralising episodes that seem to have little to do with the investigation Much of the recent scholarship on the Naturales Quaestiones has been dedicated to explaining this feature of the work It is often suggested that the purpose of this combination of ethics and philosophical physics is to demonstrate the close connection between these two parts of philosophy in line with the thought of Stoicism br br br Date br The earliest date terminus post quem for writing is AD and it is generally thought to have been written around to AD br br br Contents br The Naturales Quaestiones is addressed to Lucilius Junior br br I am not unaware Lucilius excellent man of how great is the enterprise whose foundations I am laying in my old age now that I have decided to traverse the world to seek out its causes and secrets and to present them for others to learn about Book br The work originally had eight books but the book on the Nile book a is missing the second part whereas the book concerning Hail and Snow book b is missing the first half These two books have been joined by tradition to become book br The contents of these seven books are as follows br br meteors halos rainbows mock suns etc br thunder and lightning theory of thunderstorms br water this book also contains the description of the Roman heat exchangers which were called dracones or miliaria and a description of the deluge br the Nile a hail snow and ice b theory of hail br winds br earthquakes and the sources of the Nile br comets br The original order of the books is a matter of scholarly disagreement Several scholars consider an original order as used by Harry M Hine being Book firstly then Book a b Books then Books and finally Book br br br Themes br The work is a study on questions of physics and meteorology It is one of the few Roman works which deals with scientific matters It is not a systematic work but a collection of facts of nature from various writers Greek and Roman many of which are curiosities Moral remarks are scattered through the work and indeed the design of the whole appears to be to find a foundation for ethics in the knowledge of nature There is an incontrovertible intertwinement of an ethical concern with the questions of nature physics in the work br Stoics from early in their history considered the telos goal of their efforts to be kata physin according to nature Thus for Seneca virtue in a human was dependent on behaving in a natural way The highest good or virtue is to live according to one s own nature secundum naturam suam vivere in Ep Ep referring to both nature in general and one s own innate nature br Seneca had been the imperial advisor during the early part of Nero s reign before falling out of favour and Seneca compliments Nero four times in Naturales quaestiones A more indirect allusion to his former role can be found in book when during a discussion of lightning bolts Book Seneca breaks off to urge rulers to always take counsel from their advisors Seneca thought that promoting an active interest in science to Nero would be beneficial to the emperor s morality br br What is most important Not to admit bad intentions into your mind to raise pure hands to heaven to raise your spirits high above chance occurrences for these reasons the study of nature will be helpful we shall leave behind what is sordid separate the mind which needs to be elevated and great from the body when we have exercised our intellect on hidden obscurities it will be no less effective on matters in plain view br Contemplation of nature for Seneca unchains the mind enabling a person to transcend evil and by experiencing the totality totum of nature develop a consciousness and being more compatible with direct experience of God by elevating one s moral nature br God is in all things natural is intramundane for Seneca br br quisquis formator universi fuit sive ille Deus est potens omnium sive incorporalis ratio ingentium operum artifex sive divinus spiritus per omnia maxima minima aequali intentione diffususWhoever was the former of the universe whether God almighty whether incorporeal Reason whether the divine Spirit diffused equally through all things the greatest and the least br Achieving an existence in keeping with the correct manner of living that is being ethical depends on a person fulfilling that existence in accordance with the principles
