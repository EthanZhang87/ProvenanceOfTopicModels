title: Colorfulness
id: 664556
Colorfulness chroma and saturation are attributes of perceived color relating to chromatic intensity As defined formally by the International Commission on Illumination CIE they respectively describe three different aspects of chromatic intensity but the terms are often used loosely and interchangeably in contexts where these aspects are not clearly distinguished The precise meanings of the terms vary by what other functions they are dependent on br br Colorfulness is the attribute of a visual perception according to which the perceived color of an area appears to be more or less chromatic Any color that is absent of white grey or black The colorfulness evoked by an object depends not only on its spectral reflectance but also on the strength of the illumination and increases with the latter unless the brightness is very high Hunt effect br Chroma is the colorfulness of an area judged as a proportion of the brightness of a similarly illuminated area that appears white or highly transmitting As a result chroma is mostly only dependent on the spectral properties and as such is seen to describe the object color It is how different from a grey of the same lightness such an object color appears to be br Saturation is the colorfulness of an area judged in proportion to its brightness which in effect is the perceived freedom from whitishness of the light coming from the area An object with a given spectral reflectance exhibits approximately constant saturation for all levels of illumination unless the brightness is very high br As colorfulness chroma and saturation are defined as attributes of perception they can not be physically measured as such but they can be quantified in relation to psychometric scales intended to be perceptually even for example the chroma scales of the Munsell system While the chroma and lightness of an object are its colorfulness and brightness judged in proportion to the same thing the brightness of a similarly illuminated area that appears white or highly transmitting the saturation of the light coming from that object is in effect the chroma of the object judged in proportion to its lightness On a Munsell hue page lines of uniform saturation thus tend to radiate from near the black point while lines of uniform chroma are vertical br br br Chroma br br The na ve definition of saturation does not specify its response function In the CIE XYZ and RGB color spaces the saturation is defined in terms of additive color mixing and has the property of being proportional to any scaling centered at white or the white point illuminant However both color spaces are non linear in terms of psychovisually perceived color differences It is also possible and sometimes desirable to define a saturation like quantity that is linearized in term of the psychovisual perception br In the CIE LAB and LUV color spaces the unnormalized chroma is the radial component of the cylindrical coordinate CIE LCh lightness chroma hue representation of the LAB and LUV color spaces also denoted as CIE LCh ab or CIE LCh for short and CIE LCh uv The transformation of br br br br br a br br b br br br br displaystyle a b br br to br br br br br br br br C br br a br b br br br br br h br br a br b br br br br br br br br displaystyle left C ab h ab right br br is given by br br and analogously for CIE LCh uv br The chroma in the CIE LCh ab and CIE LCh uv coordinates has the advantage of being more psychovisually linear yet they are non linear in terms of linear component color mixing And therefore chroma in CIE Lab and LUV color spaces is very much different from the traditional sense of saturation br br br In color appearance models br Another psychovisually even more accurate but also more complex method to obtain or specify the saturation is to use a color appearance model like CIECAM Here the chroma color appearance parameter might depending on the color appearance model be intertwined with e g the physical brightness of the illumination or the characteristics of the emitting reflecting surface which is more sensible psychovisually br The CIECAM chroma br br br br C br br br br displaystyle C br br for example is computed from a lightness br br br br J br br br displaystyle J br br in addition to a naively evaluated color magnitude br br br br t br br br br displaystyle t br br In addition a colorfulness br br br br M br br br displaystyle M br br parameter exists alongside the chroma br br br br C br br br br displaystyle C br br It is defined as br br br br M br br C br br F br br B br br br br br br br br br displaystyle M CF B br br where br br br br br F br br L br br br br br displaystyle F L br br is dependent on the viewing condition br br br Saturation br The saturation of a color is determined by a combination of light intensity and how much it is distributed across the spectrum of different wavelengths The purest most saturated color is achieved by using just one wavelength at a high intensity such as in laser light If the intensity drops then as a result the saturation drops To desaturate a color of given intensity in a subtractive system such as watercolor one can add white black gray or the hue s complement br Various correlates of saturation follow br br br CIELUV and CIELAB br In CIELUV saturation is equal to the chroma normalized by the lightness br br where br br br br br br br br u br br n br br br br br v br br n br br br br br br br br displaystyle left u n v n right br br is the chromaticity of the white point and chroma is defined below br By analogy in CIELAB this would yield br br The CIE has not formally recommended this equation since CIELAB has no chromaticity diagram and this definition therefore lacks direct connection with older concepts of saturation Nevertheless this equation provides a reasonable predictor of saturation and demonstrates that adjusting the lightness in CIELAB while holding a b fixed does affect the saturation br But the following verbal definition of Manfred Richter and the corresponding formula proposed by Eva L bbe are in agreement with the human perception of saturation br Saturation is the proportion of pure chromatic color in the total color sensation br br where br br br br br S br br a br b br br br br br displaystyle S ab br br is the saturation br br br br br L br br br br br br br displaystyle L br br the lightness and br br br br br C br br a br b br br br br br br br br displaystyle C ab br br is the chroma of the color br br br CIECAM br In CIECAM saturation equals the square root of the colorfulness divided by the brightness br br This definition is inspired by experimental work done with the intention of remedying CIECAM s s poor performance br br br br M br br br displaystyle M br br is proportional to the chroma br br br br C br br br br displaystyle C br br thus the CIECAM definition bears some similarity to the CIELUV definition br br br HSL and HSV br Saturation is also one of three coordinates in the HSL and HSV color spaces However in the HSL color space saturation exists independently of lightness That is both a very light color and a very dark color can be heavily saturated in HSL whereas in the previous definitions as well as in the HSV color space colors approaching white all feature low saturation br br br Excitation purity br br The excitation purity purity for short of a stimulus is the difference from the illuminant s white point to the furthest point on the chromaticity diagram with the same dominant wavelength using the CIE color space br br where br br br br br br br br x br br n br br br br br y br br n br br br br br br br br displaystyle left x n y n right br br is the chromaticity of the white point and br br br br br br br br x br br I br br br br br y br br I br br br br br br br br displaystyle left x I y I right br br is the point on the perimeter whose line segment to the white point contains the chromaticity of the stimulus Different color spaces such as CIELAB or CIELUV may be used and will yield different results br br br
