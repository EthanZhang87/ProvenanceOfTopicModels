Kamal al Din Hasan ibn Ali ibn Hasan al Farisi or Abu Hasan Muhammad ibn Hasan January long assumed to be Persian was a Persian Muslim scientist He made two major contributions to science one on optics the other on number theory Farisi was a pupil of the astronomer and mathematician Qutb al Din al Shirazi who in turn was a pupil of Nasir al Din Tusi br According to Encyclop dia Iranica Kamal al Din was the most advanced Persian author on optics br br br Optics br br His work on optics was prompted by a question put to him concerning the refraction of light Shirazi advised him to consult the Book of Optics of Ibn al Haytham Alhacen and Farisi made such a deep study of this treatise that Shirazi suggested that he write what is essentially a revision of that major work which came to be called the Tanqih Qutb al Din Al Shirazi himself was writing a commentary on works of Avicenna at the time br Farisi is known for giving the first mathematically satisfactory explanation of the rainbow and an explication of the nature of colours that reformed the theory of Ibn al Haytham Alhazen Farisi also proposed a model where the ray of light from the sun was refracted twice by a water droplet one or more reflections occurring between the two refractions He verified this through extensive experimentation using a transparent sphere filled with water and a camera obscura br His research in this regard was based on theoretical investigations in dioptrics conducted on the so called Burning Sphere al Kura al muhriqa in the tradition of Ibn Sahl d ca and Ibn al Haytham d ca after him As he noted in his Kitab Tanqih al Manazir The Revision of the Optics Farisi used a large clear vessel of glass in the shape of a sphere which was filled with water in order to have an experimental large scale model of a rain drop He then placed this model within a camera obscura that has a controlled aperture for the introduction of light He projected light unto the sphere and ultimately deducted through several trials and detailed observations of reflections and refractions of light that the colors of the rainbow are phenomena of the decomposition of light His research had resonances with the studies of his contemporary Theodoric of Freiberg without any contacts between them even though they both relied on Ibn al Haytham s legacy and later with the experiments of Descartes and Newton in dioptrics for instance Newton conducted a similar experiment at Trinity College though using a prism rather than a sphere br In his Kitab Tanqih al Manazir The Revision of the Optics Farisi also saved the latest advancements in color theory by Nasir al Din al Tusi on color ordering In contrast to Aristotle d BCE who had suggested that all colors can be aligned on a single line from black to white Ibn Sina d had described that there were three paths from black to white one path via grey a second path via red and the third path via green Al Tusi ca elaborated on this by stating that there are no less than five of such paths via lemon yellow blood red pistachio green indigo blue and grey No less than intermediate colors on these paths were explicitly mentioned in this text Fortunately this text was saved since Farisi included it in his Kitab Tanqih al Manazir The Revision of the Optics which was copied numerous times until at least the nineteenth century as part of the textbook Revision of the Optics Tanqih al Manazir Tusi s description of the relations between various colors effectively made color space two dimensional br Robert Grosseteste d proposed an effectively three dimensional model of color space br br br Number theory br Farisi made a number of important contributions to number theory His most impressive work in number theory is on amicable numbers In Tadhkira al ahbab fi bayan al tahabb Memorandum for friends on the proof of amicability introduced a major new approach to a whole area of number theory introducing ideas concerning factorization and combinatorial methods In fact Farisi s approach is based on the unique factorization of an integer into powers of prime numbers While the Greek mathematician Euclid took the first step on the way to the existence of prime factorization al Farisi took the final step and stated for the first time the fundamental theorem of arithmetic br br br Works br Asas al qawa id fi usul al fawa id The base of the rules in the principles of uses which comprises an introduction and five chapters dealing with arithmetic notarial and sales rules and the areas of surfaces and solids while the last two essays are on algebra The book is a commentary on the treatise of Al Baha i uses in the arithmetic rules of Al Khawam al Baghdadi br Tanqih al Manazir Arabic The Revision of Ibn al Haytham s Optics He completed the writing of this book in Ramadan H E Feb Mar A D The autograph manuscript of this work has newly discovered Before the discovery the completion date of the Tanqih had been controversial placed from sometime before M Nazif to after but before Qu b al D n Sh r z s death in Wiedemann br Tadhkira al ahbab fi bayan al tahabb Memorandum for friends on the proof of amicability br Al Basa ir fi ilm al manazir Insights Into the Sciences of Optics a textbook for students of optics presenting the conclusion of the Tanqih without the proofs or experiments He
