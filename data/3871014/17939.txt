Light visible light or visible radiation is electromagnetic radiation that can be perceived by the human eye Visible light spans the visible spectrum and is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of nanometres nm corresponding to frequencies of terahertz The visible band sits adjacent to the infrared with longer wavelengths and lower frequencies and the ultraviolet with shorter wavelengths and higher frequencies called collectively optical radiation br In physics the term light may refer more broadly to electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength whether visible or not In this sense gamma rays X rays microwaves and radio waves are also light The primary properties of light are intensity propagation direction frequency or wavelength spectrum and polarization Its speed in vacuum m s is one of the fundamental constants of nature Like all types of electromagnetic radiation visible light propagates by massless elementary particles called photons that represents the quanta of electromagnetic field and can be analyzed as both waves and particles The study of light known as optics is an important research area in modern physics br The main source of natural light on Earth is the Sun Historically another important source of light for humans has been fire from ancient campfires to modern kerosene lamps With the development of electric lights and power systems electric lighting has effectively replaced firelight br br br Electromagnetic spectrum and visible light br br Generally electromagnetic radiation EMR is classified by wavelength into radio waves microwaves infrared the visible spectrum that we perceive as light ultraviolet X rays and gamma rays The designation radiation excludes static electric magnetic and near fields br The behavior of EMR depends on its wavelength Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths and lower frequencies have longer wavelengths When EMR interacts with single atoms and molecules its behavior depends on the amount of energy per quantum it carries br EMR in the visible light region consists of quanta called photons that are at the lower end of the energies that are capable of causing electronic excitation within molecules which leads to changes in the bonding or chemistry of the molecule At the lower end of the visible light spectrum EMR becomes invisible to humans infrared because its photons no longer have enough individual energy to cause a lasting molecular change a change in conformation in the visual molecule retinal in the human retina which change triggers the sensation of vision br There exist animals that are sensitive to various types of infrared but not by means of quantum absorption Infrared sensing in snakes depends on a kind of natural thermal imaging in which tiny packets of cellular water are raised in temperature by the infrared radiation EMR in this range causes molecular vibration and heating effects which is how these animals detect it br Above the range of visible light ultraviolet light becomes invisible to humans mostly because it is absorbed by the cornea below nm and the internal lens below nm Furthermore the rods and cones located in the retina of the human eye cannot detect the very short below nm ultraviolet wavelengths and are in fact damaged by ultraviolet Many animals with eyes that do not require lenses such as insects and shrimp are able to detect ultraviolet by quantum photon absorption mechanisms in much the same chemical way that humans detect visible light br Various sources define visible light as narrowly as nm to as broadly as nm Under ideal laboratory conditions people can see infrared up to at least nm children and young adults may perceive ultraviolet wavelengths down to about nm br Plant growth is also affected by the colour spectrum of light a process known as photomorphogenesis br br br Speed of light br br The speed of light in vacuum is defined to be exactly m s approx miles per second The fixed value of the speed of light in SI units results from the fact that the metre is now defined in terms of the speed of light All forms of electromagnetic radiation move at exactly this same speed in vacuum br Different physicists have attempted to measure the speed of light throughout history Galileo attempted to measure the speed of light in the seventeenth century An early experiment to measure the speed of light was conducted by Ole R mer a Danish physicist in Using a telescope R mer observed the motions of Jupiter and one of its moons Io Noting discrepancies in the apparent period of Io s orbit he calculated that light takes about minutes to traverse the diameter of Earth s orbit However its size was not known at that time If R mer had known the diameter of the Earth s orbit he would have calculated a speed of m s br Another more accurate measurement of the speed of light was performed in Europe by Hippolyte Fizeau in Fizeau directed a beam of light at a mirror several kilometers away A rotating cog wheel was placed in the path of the light beam as it traveled from the source to the mirror and then returned to its origin Fizeau found that at a certain rate of rotation the beam would pass through one gap in the wheel on the way out and the next gap on the way back Knowing the distance to the mirror the number of teeth on the wheel and the rate of rotation Fizeau was able to calculate the speed of light as m s br L on Foucault carried out an experiment which used rotating mirrors to obtain a value of m s in Albert A Michelson conducted experiments on the speed of light from until his death in He refined Foucault s methods in using improved rotating mirrors to measure the time it took light to make a round trip from Mount Wilson to Mount San Antonio in California The precise measurements yielded a speed of m s br The effective velocity of light in various transparent substances containing ordinary matter is less than in vacuum For example the speed of light in water is about of that in vacuum br Two independent teams of physicists were said to bring light to a complete standstill by passing it through a Bose Einstein condensate of the element rubidium one team at Harvard University and the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge Massachusetts and the other at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics also in Cambridge However the popular description of light being stopped in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms then re emitted at an arbitrary later time as stimulated by a second laser pulse During the time it had stopped it had ceased to be light br br br Optics br br The study of light and the interaction of light and matter is termed optics The observation and study of optical phenomena such as rainbows and the aurora borealis offer many clues as to the nature of light br A transparent object allows light to transmit or pass through Conversely an opaque object does not allow light to transmit through and instead reflecting or absorbing the light it receives Most objects do not reflect or transmit light specularly and to some degree scatters the incoming light which is called glossiness Surface scatterance is caused by the surface roughness of the reflecting surfaces and internal scatterance is caused by the difference of refractive index between the particles and medium inside the object Like transparent objects translucent objects allow light to transmit through but translucent objects also scatter certain wavelength of light via internal scatterance br br br Refraction br br Refraction is the bending of light rays when passing through a surface between one transparent material and another It is described by Snell s Law br br br br br br n br br br br br sin br br br br br br br br br br n br br br br br sin br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle n sin theta n sin theta br br br where is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the first medium is the angle between the ray and the surface normal in the second medium and n and n are the indices of refraction n in a vacuum and n in a transparent substance br When a beam of light crosses the boundary between a vacuum and another medium or between two different media the wavelength of the light changes but the frequency remains constant If the beam of light is not orthogonal or rather normal to the boundary the change in wavelength results in a change in the direction of the beam This change of direction is known as refraction br The refractive quality of lenses is frequently used to manipulate light in order to change the apparent size of images Magnifying glasses spectacles contact lenses microscopes and refracting telescopes are all examples of this manipulation br br br Light sources br br There are many sources of light A body at a given temperature emits a characteristic spectrum of black body radiation A simple thermal source is sunlight the radiation emitted by the chromosphere of the Sun at around K C F Solar radiation peaks in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum when plotted in wavelength units and roughly of the radiation that reaches the ground is visible Another example is incandescent light bulbs which emit only around of their energy as visible light and the remainder as infrared A common thermal light source in history is the glowing solid particles in flames but these also emit most of their radiation in the infrared and only a fraction in the visible spectrum br The peak of the black body spectrum is in the deep infrared at about micrometre wavelength for relatively cool objects like human beings As the temperature increases the peak shifts to shorter wavelengths producing first a red glow then a white one and finally a blue white colour as the peak moves out of the visible part of the spectrum and into the ultraviolet These colours can be seen when metal is heated to red hot or white hot Blue white thermal emission is not often seen except in stars the commonly seen pure blue colour in a gas flame or a welder s torch is in fact due to molecular emission notably by CH radicals emitting a wavelength band around nm and is not seen in stars or pure thermal radiation br Atoms emit and absorb light at characteristic energies This produces emission lines in the spectrum of each atom Emission can be spontaneous as in light emitting diodes gas discharge lamps such as neon lamps and neon signs mercury vapor lamps etc and flames light from the hot gas itself so for example sodium in a gas flame emits characteristic yellow light Emission can also be stimulated as in a laser or a microwave maser br Deceleration of a free charged particle such as an electron can produce visible radiation cyclotron radiation synchrotron radiation and bremsstrahlung radiation are all examples of this Particles moving through a medium faster than the speed of light in that medium can produce visible Cherenkov radiation Certain chemicals produce visible radiation by chemoluminescence In living things this process is called bioluminescence For example fireflies produce light by this means and boats moving through water can disturb plankton which produce a glowing wake br Certain substances produce light when they are illuminated by more energetic radiation a process known as fluorescence Some substances emit light slowly after excitation by more energetic radiation This is known as phosphorescence Phosphorescent materials can also be excited by bombarding them with subatomic particles Cathodoluminescence is one example This mechanism is used in cathode ray tube television sets and computer monitors br br Certain other mechanisms can produce light br br Electroluminescence br Scintillation br Sonoluminescence br Triboluminescence br When the concept of light is intended to include very high energy photons gamma rays additional generation mechanisms include br br Particle antiparticle annihilation br Radioactive decay br br br Measurement br br Light is measured with two main alternative sets of units radiometry consists of measurements of light power at all wavelengths while photometry measures light with wavelength weighted with respect to a standardized model of human brightness perception Photometry is useful for example to quantify Illumination lighting intended for human use br The photometry units are different from most systems of physical units in that they take into account how the human eye responds to light The cone cells in the human eye are of three types which respond differently across the visible spectrum and the cumulative response peaks at a wavelength of around nm Therefore two sources of light which produce the same intensity W m of visible light do not necessarily appear equally bright The photometry units are designed to take this into account and therefore are a better representation of how bright a light appears to be than raw intensity They relate to raw power by a quantity called luminous efficacy and are used for purposes like determining how to best achieve sufficient illumination for various tasks in indoor and outdoor settings The illumination measured by a photocell sensor does not necessarily correspond to what is perceived by the human eye and without filters which may be costly photocells and charge coupled devices CCD tend to respond to some infrared ultraviolet or both br br br Light pressure br br Light exerts physical pressure on objects in its path a phenomenon which can be deduced by Maxwell s equations but can be more easily explained by the particle nature of light photons strike and transfer their momentum Light pressure is equal to the power of the light beam divided by c the speed of light Due to the magnitude of c the effect of light pressure is negligible for everyday objects For example a one milliwatt laser pointer exerts a force of about piconewtons on the object being illuminated thus one could lift a U S penny with laser pointers but doing so would require about billion mW laser pointers However in nanometre scale applications such as nanoelectromechanical systems NEMS the effect of light pressure is more significant and exploiting light pressure to drive NEMS mechanisms and to flip nanometre scale physical switches in integrated circuits is an active area of research At larger scales light pressure can cause asteroids to spin faster acting on their irregular shapes as on the vanes of a windmill The possibility of making solar sails that would accelerate spaceships in space is also under investigation br Although the motion of the Crookes radiometer was originally attributed to light pressure this interpretation is incorrect the characteristic Crookes rotation is the result of a partial vacuum This should not be confused with the Nichols radiometer in which the slight motion caused by torque though not enough for full rotation against friction is directly caused by light pressure br As a consequence of light pressure Einstein in predicted the existence of radiation friction which would oppose the movement of matter He wrote radiation will exert pressure on both sides of the plate The forces of pressure exerted on the two sides are equal if the plate is at rest However if it is in motion more radiation will be reflected on the surface that is ahead during the motion front surface than on the back surface The backwardacting force of pressure exerted on the front surface is thus larger than the force of pressure acting on the back Hence as the resultant of the two forces there remains a force that counteracts the motion of the plate and that increases with the velocity of the plate We will call this resultant radiation friction in brief br Usually light momentum is aligned with its direction of motion However for example in evanescent waves momentum is transverse to direction of propagation br br br Historical theories about light in chronological order br br br Classical Greece and Hellenism br In the fifth century BC Empedocles postulated that everything was composed of four elements fire air earth and water He believed that goddess Aphrodite made the human eye out of the four elements and that she lit the fire in the eye which shone out from the eye making sight possible If this were true then one could see during the night just as well as during the day so Empedocles postulated an interaction between rays from the eyes and rays from a source such as the sun br In about BC Euclid wrote Optica in which he studied the properties of light Euclid postulated that light travelled in straight lines and he described the laws of reflection and studied them mathematically He questioned that sight is the result of a beam from the eye for he asks how one sees the stars immediately if one closes one s eyes then opens them at night If the beam from the eye travels infinitely fast this is not a problem br In BC Lucretius a Roman who carried on the ideas of earlier Greek atomists wrote that The light heat of the sun these are composed of minute atoms which when they are shoved off lose no time in shooting right across the interspace of air in the direction imparted by the shove from On the nature of the Universe Despite being similar to later particle theories Lucretius s views were not generally accepted Ptolemy c second century wrote about the refraction of light in his book Optics br br br Classical India br In ancient India the Hindu schools of Samkhya and Vaisheshika from around the early centuries AD developed theories on light According to the Samkhya school light is one of the five fundamental subtle elements tanmatra out of which emerge the gross elements The atomicity of these elements is not specifically mentioned and it appears that they were actually taken to be continuous br The Vishnu Purana refers to sunlight as the seven rays of the sun br The Indian Buddhists such as Dign ga in the fifth century and Dharmakirti in the seventh century developed a type of atomism that is a philosophy about reality being composed of atomic entities that are momentary flashes of light or energy They viewed light as being an atomic entity equivalent to energy br br br Descartes br Ren Descartes held that light was a mechanical property of the luminous body rejecting the forms of Ibn al Haytham and Witelo as well as the species of Roger Bacon Robert Grosseteste and Johannes Kepler In he published a theory of the refraction of light that assumed incorrectly that light travelled faster in a denser medium than in a less dense medium Descartes arrived at this conclusion by analogy with the behaviour of sound waves Although Descartes was incorrect about the relative speeds he was correct in assuming that light behaved like a wave and in concluding that refraction could be explained by the speed of light in different media br Descartes is not the first to use the mechanical analogies but because he clearly asserts that light is only a mechanical property of the luminous body and the transmitting medium Descartes s theory of light is regarded as the start of modern physical optics br br br Particle theory br br Pierre Gassendi an atomist proposed a particle theory of light which was published posthumously in the s Isaac Newton studied Gassendi s work at an early age and preferred his view to Descartes s theory of the plenum He stated in his Hypothesis of Light of that light was composed of corpuscles particles of matter which were emitted in all directions from a source One of Newton s arguments against the wave nature of light was that waves were known to bend around obstacles while light travelled only in straight lines He did however explain the phenomenon of the diffraction of light which had been observed by Francesco Grimaldi by allowing that a light particle could create a localised wave in the aether br Newton s theory could be used to predict the reflection of light but could only explain refraction by incorrectly assuming that light accelerated upon entering a denser medium because the gravitational pull was greater Newton published the final version of his theory in his Opticks of His reputation helped the particle theory of light to hold sway during the eighteenth century The particle theory of light led Pierre Simon Laplace to argue that a body could be so massive that light could not escape from it In other words it would become what is now called a black hole Laplace withdrew his suggestion later after a wave theory of light became firmly established as the model for light as has been explained neither a particle or wave theory is fully correct A translation of Newton s essay on light appears in The large scale structure of space time by Stephen Hawking and George F R Ellis br The fact that light could be polarized was for the first time qualitatively explained by Newton using the particle theory tienne Louis Malus in created a mathematical particle theory of polarization Jean Baptiste Biot in showed that this theory explained all known phenomena of light polarization At that time the polarization was considered as the proof of the particle theory br br br Wave theory br To explain the origin of colours Robert Hooke developed a pulse theory and compared the spreading of light to that of waves in water in his work Micrographia Observation IX In Hooke suggested that light s vibrations could be perpendicular to the direction of propagation Christiaan Huygens worked out a mathematical wave theory of light in and published it in his Treatise on Light in He proposed that light was emitted in all directions as a series of waves in a medium called the luminiferous aether As waves are not affected by gravity it was assumed that they slowed down upon entering a denser medium br br The wave theory predicted that light waves could interfere with each other like sound waves as noted around by Thomas Young Young showed by means of a diffraction experiment that light behaved as waves He also proposed that different colours were caused by different wavelengths of light and explained colour vision in terms of three coloured receptors in the eye Another supporter of the wave theory was Leonhard Euler He argued in Nova theoria lucis et colorum that diffraction could more easily be explained by a wave theory In Andr Marie Amp re gave Augustin Jean Fresnel an idea that the polarization of light can be explained by the wave theory if light were a transverse wave br Later Fresnel independently worked out his own wave theory of light and presented it to the Acad mie des Sciences in Sim on Denis Poisson added to Fresnel s mathematical work to produce a convincing argument in favor of the wave theory helping to overturn Newton s corpuscular theory By the year Fresnel was able to show via mathematical methods that polarization could be explained by the wave theory of light if and only if light was entirely transverse with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever br The weakness of the wave theory was that light waves like sound waves would need a medium for transmission The existence of the hypothetical substance luminiferous aether proposed by Huygens in was cast into strong doubt in the late nineteenth century by the Michelson Morley experiment br Newton s corpuscular theory implied that light would travel faster in a denser medium while the wave theory of Huygens and others implied the opposite At that time the speed of light could not be measured accurately enough to decide which theory was correct The first to make a sufficiently accurate measurement was L on Foucault in His result supported the wave theory and the classical particle theory was finally abandoned only to partly re emerge in the twentieth century br br br Electromagnetic theory br br In Michael Faraday discovered that the plane of polarization of linearly polarized light is rotated when the light rays travel along the magnetic field direction in the presence of a transparent dielectric an effect now known as Faraday rotation This was the first evidence that light was related to electromagnetism In he speculated that light might be some form of disturbance propagating along magnetic field lines Faraday proposed in that light was a high frequency electromagnetic vibration which could propagate even in the absence of a medium such as the ether br Faraday s work inspired James Clerk Maxwell to study electromagnetic radiation and light Maxwell discovered that self propagating electromagnetic waves would travel through space at a constant speed which happened to be equal to the previously measured speed of light From this Maxwell concluded that light was a form of electromagnetic radiation he first stated this result in in On Physical Lines of Force In he published A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism which contained a full mathematical description of the behavior of electric and magnetic fields still known as Maxwell s equations Soon after Heinrich Hertz confirmed Maxwell s theory experimentally by generating and detecting radio waves in the laboratory and demonstrating that these waves behaved exactly like visible light exhibiting properties such as reflection refraction diffraction and interference Maxwell s theory and Hertz s experiments led directly to the development of modern radio radar television electromagnetic imaging and wireless communications br In the quantum theory photons are seen as wave packets of the waves described in the classical theory of Maxwell The quantum theory was needed to explain effects even with visual light that Maxwell s classical theory could not such as spectral lines br br br Quantum theory br In Max Planck attempting to explain black body radiation suggested that although light was a wave these waves could gain or lose energy only in finite amounts related to their frequency Planck called these lumps of light energy quanta from a Latin word for how much In Albert Einstein used the idea of light quanta to explain the photoelectric effect and suggested that these light quanta had a real existence In Arthur Holly Compton showed that the wavelength shift seen when low intensity X rays scattered from electrons so called Compton scattering could be explained by a particle theory of X rays but not a wave theory In Gilbert N Lewis named these light quanta particles photons br Eventually quantum mechanics came to picture light as in some sense both a particle and a wave and in another sense as a phenomenon which is neither a particle nor a wave which actually are macroscopic phenomena such as baseballs or ocean waves Instead under some approximations light can be described sometimes with mathematics appropriate to one type of macroscopic metaphor particles and sometimes another macroscopic metaphor waves br As in the case for radio waves and the X rays involved in Compton scattering physicists have noted that electromagnetic radiation tends to behave more like a classical wave at lower frequencies but more like a classical particle at higher frequencies but never completely loses all qualities of one or the other Visible light which occupies a middle ground in frequency can easily be shown in experiments to be describable using either a wave or particle model or sometimes both br In Satyendra Nath Bose showed that light followed different statistics from that of classical particles With Einstein they generalized this result for a whole set of integer spin particles called bosons after Bose that follow Bose Einstein statistics The photon is a massless boson of spin br Im Paul Dirac quantized the electromagnetic field Pascual Jordan and Vladimir Fock generalized this process to treat many body systems as excitations of quantum fields a process with the misnomer of second quantization And at the end of the s a full theory of quantum electrodynamics was developed using quantum fields based on the works of Julian Schwinger Richard Feynman Freeman Dyson and Shinichiro Tomonaga br br br Quantum optics br br John R Klauder George Sudarshan Roy J Glauber and Leonard Mandel applied quantum theory to the electromagnetic field in the s and s to gain a more detailed understanding of photodetection and the statistics of light see degree of coherence This led to the introduction of the coherent state as a concept which addressed variations between laser light thermal light exotic squeezed states etc as it became understood that light cannot be fully described just referring to the electromagnetic fields describing the waves in the classical picture In H Jeff Kimble et al demonstrated a single atom emitting one photon at a time further compelling evidence that light consists of photons Previously unknown quantum states of light with characteristics unlike classical states such as squeezed light were subsequently discovered br Development of short and ultrashort laser pulses created by Q switching and modelocking techniques opened the way to the study of what became known as ultrafast processes Applications for solid state research e g Raman spectroscopy were found and mechanical forces of light on matter were studied The latter led to levitating and positioning clouds of atoms or even small biological samples in an optical trap or optical tweezers by laser beam This along with Doppler cooling and Sisyphus cooling was the crucial technology needed to achieve the celebrated Bose Einstein condensation br Other remarkable results are the demonstration of quantum entanglement quantum teleportation and quantum logic gates The latter are of much interest in quantum information theory a subject which partly emerged from quantum optics partly from theoretical computer science br br br Use for light on Earth br Sunlight provides the energy that green plants use to create sugars mostly in the form of starches which release energy into the living things that digest them This process of photosynthesis provides virtually all the energy used by living things Some species of animals generate their own light a process called bioluminescence For example fireflies use light to locate mates and vampire squid use it to hide themselves from prey br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Media related to Light at Wikimedia Commons br The dictionary
