Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Younger SEN ik c BC AD usually known mononymously as Seneca was a Stoic philosopher of Ancient Rome a statesman dramatist and in one work satirist from the post Augustan age of Latin literature br Seneca was born in Colonia Patricia Corduba in Hispania and was trained in rhetoric and philosophy in Rome His father was Seneca the Elder his elder brother was Lucius Junius Gallio Annaeanus and his nephew was the poet Lucan In AD Seneca was exiled to the island of Corsica under emperor Claudius but was allowed to return in to become a tutor to Nero When Nero became emperor in Seneca became his advisor and together with the praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus provided competent government for the first five years of Nero s reign Seneca s influence over Nero declined with time and in Seneca was forced to take his own life for alleged complicity in the Pisonian conspiracy to assassinate Nero of which he was probably innocent His stoic and calm suicide has become the subject of numerous paintings br As a writer Seneca is known for his philosophical works and for his plays which are all tragedies His prose works include essays and letters dealing with moral issues These writings constitute one of the most important bodies of primary material for ancient Stoicism As a tragedian he is best known for plays such as his Medea Thyestes and Phaedra Seneca had an immense influence on later generations during the Renaissance he was a sage admired and venerated as an oracle of moral even of Christian edification a master of literary style and a model for dramatic art br br br Life br br br Early life family and adulthood br Seneca was born in C rdoba in the Roman province of Baetica in Hispania His branch of the Annaea gens consisted of Italic colonists of Umbrian or Paelignian origins His father was Lucius Annaeus Seneca the Elder a Spanish born Roman knight who had gained fame as a writer and teacher of rhetoric in Rome Seneca s mother Helvia was from a prominent Baetician family Seneca was the second of three brothers the others were Lucius Annaeus Novatus later known as Junius Gallio and Annaeus Mela the father of the poet Lucan Miriam Griffin says in her biography of Seneca that the evidence for Seneca s life before his exile in is so slight and the potential interest of these years for social history as well as for biography is so great that few writers on Seneca have resisted the temptation to eke out knowledge with imagination Griffin also infers from the ancient sources that Seneca was born in either or BC She thinks he was born between and BC and was resident in Rome by AD br br Seneca is said to have been taken to Rome in the arms of his aunt his mother s stepsister at a young age probably when he was about five years old His father resided for much of his life in the city Seneca was taught the usual subjects of literature grammar and rhetoric as part of the standard education of high born Romans While still young he received philosophical training from Attalus the Stoic and from Sotion and Papirius Fabianus both of whom belonged to the short lived School of the Sextii which combined Stoicism with Pythagoreanism Sotion persuaded Seneca when he was a young man in his early twenties to become a vegetarian which he practiced for around a year before his father urged him to desist because the practice was associated with some foreign rites Seneca often had breathing difficulties throughout his life probably asthma and at some point in his mid twenties c AD he appears to have been struck down with tuberculosis He was sent to Egypt to live with his aunt the same aunt who had brought him to Rome whose husband Gaius Galerius had become Prefect of Egypt She nursed him through a period of ill health that lasted up to ten years In AD he returned to Rome with his aunt his uncle dying en route in a shipwreck His aunt s influence helped Seneca be elected quaestor probably after AD which also earned him the right to sit in the Roman Senate br br br Politics and exile br Seneca s early career as a senator seems to have been successful and he was praised for his oratory In his writings Seneca has nothing good to say about Caligula and frequently depicts him as a monster Cassius Dio relates a story that Caligula was so offended by Seneca s oratorical success in the Senate that he ordered him to commit suicide Seneca survived only because he was seriously ill and Caligula was told that he would soon die anyway Seneca explains his own survival as due to his patience and his devotion to his friends I wanted to avoid the impression that all I could do for loyalty was die br In AD Claudius became emperor and Seneca was accused by the new empress Messalina of adultery with Julia Livilla sister to Caligula and Agrippina The affair has been doubted by some historians since Messalina had clear political motives for getting rid of Julia Livilla and her supporters The Senate pronounced a death sentence on Seneca which Claudius commuted to exile and Seneca spent the next eight years on the island of Corsica Two of Seneca s earliest surviving works date from the period of his exile both consolations In his Consolation to Helvia his mother Seneca comforts her as a bereaved mother for losing her son to exile Seneca incidentally mentions the death of his only son a few weeks before his exile Later in life Seneca was married to a woman younger than himself Pompeia Paulina It has been thought that the infant son may have been from an earlier marriage but the evidence is tenuous Seneca s other work of this period his Consolation to Polybius one of Claudius freedmen focused on consoling Polybius on the death of his brother It is noted for its flattery of Claudius and Seneca expresses his hope that the emperor will recall him from exile In AD Agrippina married her uncle Claudius and through her influence Seneca was recalled to Rome Agrippina gained the praetorship for Seneca and appointed him tutor to her son the future emperor Nero br br br Imperial advisor br br From AD to Seneca acted as Nero s advisor together with the praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus Early in Nero s reign his mother Agrippina exercised his authority to make decisions Seneca and Burrus opposed this authoritarian matriarchy which had become the cause of irresponsibility of the emperor One by product of his new position was that Seneca was appointed suffect consul in Seneca s influence was said to have been especially strong in the first year Seneca composed Nero s accession speeches in which he promised to restore proper legal procedure and authority to the Senate He also composed the eulogy for Claudius that Nero delivered at the funeral Seneca s satirical skit Apocolocyntosis which lampoons the deification of Claudius and praises Nero dates from the earliest period of Nero s reign In AD Seneca wrote On Clemency following Nero s murder of Britannicus perhaps to assure the citizenry that the murder was the end not the beginning of bloodshed On Clemency is a work which although it flatters Nero was intended to show the correct Stoic path of virtue for a ruler Tacitus and Dio suggest that Nero s early rule during which he listened to Seneca and Burrus was quite competent However the ancient sources suggest that over time Seneca and Burrus lost their influence over the emperor In they had reluctantly agreed to Agrippina s murder and afterward Tacitus reports that Seneca had to write a letter justifying the murder to the Senate br In AD the senator Publius Suillius Rufus made a series of public attacks on Seneca These attacks reported by Tacitus and Cassius Dio included charges that in a mere four years of service to Nero Seneca had acquired a vast personal fortune of three hundred million sestertii by charging high interest on loans throughout Italy and the provinces Suillius attacks included claims of sexual corruption with a suggestion that Seneca had slept with Agrippina Tacitus though reports that Suillius was highly prejudiced he had been a favorite of Claudius and had been an embezzler and informant In response Seneca brought a series of prosecutions for corruption against Suillius half of his estate was confiscated and he was sent into exile However the attacks reflect a criticism of Seneca that was made at the time and continued through later ages Seneca was undoubtedly extremely rich he had properties at Baiae and Nomentum an Alban villa and Egyptian estates Cassius Dio even reports that the Boudica uprising in Britannia was caused by Seneca forcing large loans on the indigenous British aristocracy in the aftermath of Claudius s conquest of Britain and then calling them in suddenly and aggressively Seneca was sensitive to such accusations his De Vita Beata On the Happy Life dates from around this time and includes a defense of wealth along Stoic lines arguing that properly gaining and spending wealth is appropriate behavior for a philosopher br br br Retirement br After Burrus s death in Seneca s influence declined rapidly as Tacitus puts it Ann mors Burri infregit Senecae potentiam the death of Burrus broke Seneca s power Tacitus reports that Seneca tried to retire twice in and AD but Nero refused him on both occasions Nevertheless Seneca was increasingly absent from the court He adopted a quiet lifestyle on his country estates concentrating on his studies and seldom visiting Rome It was during these final few years that he composed two of his greatest works Naturales quaestiones an encyclopedia of the natural world and his Letters to Lucilius which document his philosophical thoughts br br br Death br In AD Seneca was caught up in the aftermath of the Pisonian conspiracy a plot to kill Nero Although it is unlikely that Seneca was part of the conspiracy Nero ordered him to kill himself Seneca followed tradition by severing several veins in order to bleed to death and his wife Pompeia Paulina attempted to share his fate Cassius Dio who wished to emphasize the relentlessness of Nero focused on how Seneca had attended to his last minute letters and how his death was hastened by soldiers A generation after the Julio Claudian emperors Tacitus wrote an account of the suicide which in view of his republican sympathies is perhaps somewhat romanticized According to this account Nero ordered Seneca s wife saved Her wounds were bound up and she made no further attempt to kill herself As for Seneca himself his age and diet were blamed for slow loss of blood and extended pain rather than a quick death He also took poison which was not fatal br br After dictating his last words to a scribe and with a circle of friends attending him in his home he immersed himself in a warm bath which he expected would speed blood flow and ease his pain Tacitus wrote He was then carried into a bath with the steam of which he was suffocated and he was burnt without any of the usual funeral rites So he had directed in a codicil of his will even when in the height of his wealth and power he was thinking of life s close This may give the impression of a favorable portrait of Seneca but Tacitus s treatment of him is at best ambivalent Alongside Seneca s apparent fortitude in the face of death for example one can also view his actions as rather histrionic and performative and when Tacitus tells us that he left his family an imago suae vitae Annales an image of his life he is possibly being ambiguous in Roman culture the imago was a kind of mask that commemorated the great ancestors of noble families but at the same time it may also suggest duplicity superficiality and pretense br br br Philosophy br br As a major philosophical figure of the Roman Imperial Period Seneca s lasting contribution to philosophy has been to the school of Stoicism His writing is highly accessible and was the subject of attention from the Renaissance onwards by writers such as Michel de Montaigne He has been described as a towering and controversial figure of antiquity and the world s most interesting Stoic br Seneca wrote a number of books on Stoicism mostly on ethics with one work Naturales Quaestiones on the physical world Seneca built on the writings of many of the earlier Stoics he often mentions Zeno Cleanthes and Chrysippus and frequently cites Posidonius with whom Seneca shared an interest in natural phenomena He frequently quotes Epicurus especially in his Letters His interest in Epicurus is mainly limited to using him as a source of ethical maxims Likewise Seneca shows some interest in Platonist metaphysics but never with any clear commitment His moral essays are based on Stoic doctrines Stoicism was a popular philosophy in this period and many upper class Romans found in it a guiding ethical framework for political involvement It was once popular to regard Seneca as being very eclectic in his Stoicism but modern scholarship views him as a fairly orthodox Stoic albeit a free minded one br His works discuss both ethical theory and practical advice and Seneca stresses that both parts are distinct but interdependent His Letters to Lucilius showcase Seneca s search for ethical perfection and represent a sort of philosophical testament for posterity Seneca regards philosophy as a balm for the wounds of life The destructive passions especially anger and grief must be uprooted or moderated according to reason He discusses the relative merits of the contemplative life and the active life and he considers it important to confront one s own mortality and be able to face death One must be willing to practice poverty and use wealth properly and he writes about favours clemency the importance of friendship and the need to benefit others The universe is governed for the best by a rational providence and this must be reconciled with acceptance of adversity br br br Drama br br Ten plays are attributed to Seneca of which most likely eight were written by him The plays stand in stark contrast to his philosophical works With their intense emotions and grim overall tone the plays seem to represent the antithesis of Seneca s Stoic beliefs Up to the th century it was normal to distinguish between Seneca the moral philosopher and Seneca the dramatist as two separate people Scholars have tried to spot certain Stoic themes it is the uncontrolled passions that generate madness ruination and self destruction This has a cosmic as well as an ethical aspect and fate is a powerful albeit rather oppressive force br Many scholars have thought following the ideas of the th century German scholar Friedrich Leo that Seneca s tragedies were written for recitation only Other scholars think that they were written for performance and that it is possible that actual performance took place in Seneca s lifetime Ultimately this issue cannot be resolved on the basis of our existing knowledge The tragedies of Seneca have been successfully staged in modern times br The dating of the tragedies is highly problematic in the absence of any ancient references A parody of a lament from Hercules Furens appears in the Apocolocyntosis which implies a date before AD for that play A relative chronology has been proposed on metrical grounds The plays are not all based on the Greek pattern they have a five act form and differ in many respects from extant Attic drama and while the influence of Euripides on some of these works is considerable so is the influence of Virgil and Ovid br Seneca s plays were widely read in medieval and Renaissance European universities and strongly influenced tragic drama in that time such as Elizabethan England William Shakespeare and other playwrights France Corneille and Racine and the Netherlands Joost van den Vondel English translations of Seneca s tragedies appeared in print in the mid th century with all ten published collectively in He is regarded as the source and inspiration for what is known as Revenge Tragedy starting with Thomas Kyd s The Spanish Tragedy and continuing well into the Jacobean era Thyestes is considered Seneca s masterpiece and has been described by scholar Dana Gioia as one of the most influential plays ever written Medea is also highly regarded and was praised along with Phaedra by T S Eliot br br br Works br Works

resembles Seneca s plays in style but was probably written some time after Seneca s death perhaps under Vespasian by someone influenced by Seneca and aware of the events of his lifetime Though

br br br As a proto Christian saint br br Seneca s writings were well known in the later Roman period and Quintilian writing thirty years after Seneca s death remarked on the popularity of his works amongst the youth While he found much to admire Quintillian criticized Seneca for what he regarded as a degenerate literary style a criticism echoed by Aulus Gellius in the middle of the nd century br The early Christian Church was very favourably disposed towards Seneca and his writings and the church leader Tertullian possessively referred to him as our Seneca By the th century an apocryphal correspondence with Paul the Apostle had been created linking Seneca into the Christian tradition The letters are mentioned by Jerome who also included Seneca among a list of Christian writers and Seneca is similarly mentioned by Augustine In the th century Martin of Braga synthesized Seneca s thought into a couple of treatises that became popular in their own right Otherwise Seneca was mainly known through a large number of quotes and extracts in the florilegia which were popular throughout the medieval period When his writings were read in the later Middle Ages it was mostly his Letters to Lucilius the longer essays and plays being relatively unknown br Medieval writers and works continued to link him to Christianity because of his alleged association with Paul The Golden Legend a th century hagiographical account of famous saints that was widely read included an account of Seneca s death scene and erroneously presented Nero as a witness to Seneca s suicide Dante placed Seneca alongside Cicero among the great spirits in the First Circle of Hell or Limbo Boccaccio who in came across the works of Tacitus whilst browsing the library at Montecassino wrote an account of Seneca s suicide hinting that it was a kind of disguised baptism or a de facto baptism in spirit Some such as Albertino Mussato and Giovanni Colonna went even further and concluded that Seneca must have been a Christian convert br br br Disputed quotations br Various other antique and medieval texts purport to be by Seneca e g De remediis fortuitorum but with unconfirmed authorship they have sometimes been referred to as Pseudo Seneca At least some of these seem to preserve and adapt genuine Senecan content for example Saint Martin of Braga s d c Formula vitae honestae or De differentiis quatuor virtutum vitae honestae Rules for an Honest Life or On the Four Cardinal Virtues Early manuscripts preserve Martin s preface where he makes it clear that this was his adaptation but in later copies this was omitted and the work was later thought fully Seneca s work Seneca is also often quoted as the author of the aphorism Religion is regarded by the common people as true by the wise as false and by the rulers as useful However this quote is similar to a statement by Edward Gibbon The various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true by the philosophers as equally false and by the magistrate as equally useful so it is disputed br br br An improving reputation br br Seneca remains one of the few popular Roman philosophers from the period He appears not only in Dante but also in Chaucer and to a large degree in Petrarch who adopted his style in his own essays and who quotes him more than any other authority except Virgil In the Renaissance printed editions and translations of his works became common including an edition by Erasmus and a commentary by John Calvin John of Salisbury Erasmus and others celebrated his works French essayist Montaigne who gave a spirited defense of Seneca and Plutarch in his Essays was himself considered by Pasquier a French Seneca Similarly Thomas Fuller praised Joseph Hall as our English Seneca Many who considered his ideas not particularly original still argued that he was important in making the Greek philosophers presentable and intelligible His suicide has also been a popular subject in art from Jacques Louis David s painting The Death of Seneca to the film Quo Vadis br Even with the admiration of an earlier group of intellectual stalwarts Seneca has never been without his detractors In his own time he was accused of hypocrisy or at least a less than Stoic lifestyle While banished to Corsica he wrote a plea for restoration rather incompatible with his advocacy of a simple life and the acceptance of fate In his Apocolocyntosis he ridiculed the behaviors and policies of Claudius and flattered Nero such as proclaiming that Nero would live longer and be wiser than the legendary Nestor The claims of Publius Suillius Rufus that Seneca acquired some three hundred million sesterces through Nero s favor are highly partisan but they reflect the reality that Seneca was both powerful and wealthy Robin Campbell a translator of Seneca s letters writes that the stock criticism of Seneca right down the centuries has been the apparent contrast between his philosophical teachings and his practice br In Gerolamo Cardano wrote an apology praising Nero in his Encomium Neronis printed in Basel This was likely intended as a mock encomium inverting the portrayal of Nero and Seneca that appears in Tacitus In this work Cardano portrayed Seneca as a crook of the worst kind an empty rhetorician who was only thinking to grab money and power after having poisoned the mind of the young emperor Cardano stated that Seneca well deserved death br br Among the historians who have sought to reappraise Seneca is the scholar Anna Lydia Motto who in argued that the negative image has been based almost entirely on Suillius s account while many others who might have lauded him have been lost br br We are therefore left with no contemporary record of Seneca s life save for the desperate opinion of Publius Suillius Think of the barren image we should have of Socrates had the works of Plato and Xenophon not come down to us and were we wholly dependent upon Aristophanes description of this Athenian philosopher To be sure we should have a highly distorted misconstrued view Such is the view left to us of Seneca if we were to rely upon Suillius alone br More recent work is changing the dominant perception of Seneca as a mere conduit for pre existing ideas showing originality in Seneca s contribution to the history of ideas Examination of Seneca s life and thought in relation to contemporary education and to the psychology of emotions is revealing the relevance of his thought For example Martha Nussbaum in her discussion of desire and emotion includes Seneca among the Stoics who offered important insights and perspectives on emotions and their role in our lives Specifically devoting a chapter to his treatment of anger and its management she shows Seneca s appreciation of the damaging role of uncontrolled anger and its pathological connections Nussbaum later extended her examination to Seneca s contribution to political philosophy showing considerable subtlety and richness in his thoughts about politics education and notions of global citizenship and finding a basis for reform minded education in Seneca s ideas she used to propose a mode of modern education that avoids both narrow traditionalism and total rejection of tradition Elsewhere Seneca has been noted as the first great Western thinker on the complex nature and role of gratitude in human relationships br br br In popular culture br br The movie Seneca was released in narrating his life br br br Notable fictional portrayals br br Seneca is a character in Monteverdi s opera L incoronazione di Poppea The Coronation of Poppea which is based on the pseudo Senecan play Octavia br br In Nathaniel Lee s play Nero Emperor of Rome Seneca attempts to dissuade Nero from his egomaniacal plans but is dragged off to prison dying off stage br Seneca appears in Robert Bridges verse drama Nero the second part of which published culminates in Seneca s death br Seneca also appears in a fairly minor role in Henryk Sienkiewicz s novel Quo Vadis and was played by Nicholas Hannen in the film br In Robert Graves s book Claudius the God the sequel novel to I Claudius Seneca is portrayed as an unbearable sycophant He is shown as a flatterer who converts to Stoicism solely to appease Claudius s own ideology The Pumpkinification Apocolocyntosis to Graves thus becomes an unbearable work of flattery to the loathsome Nero mocking a man that Seneca groveled to for years br The historical novel Chariot of the Soul by Linda Proud features Seneca as tutor of the young Togidubnus son of King Verica of the Atrebates during his ten year stay in Rome br The film Seneca On the Creation of Earthquakes focuses on the final days of Seneca portrayed by John
