Achromatopsia also known as Rod monochromacy is a medical syndrome that exhibits symptoms relating to five conditions most notably monochromacy Historically the name referred to monochromacy in general but now typically refers only to an autosomal recessive congenital color vision condition The term is also used to describe cerebral achromatopsia though monochromacy is usually the only common symptom The conditions include monochromatic color blindness poor visual acuity and day blindness The syndrome is also present in an incomplete form that exhibits milder symptoms including residual color vision Achromatopsia is estimated to affect in live births worldwide br br br Signs and symptoms br The five symptoms associated with achromatopsia are br br Color blindness usually monochromacy br Reduced visual acuity uncorrectable with lenses br Hemeralopia with the subject exhibiting photophobia br Nystagmus br Iris operating abnormalities br The syndrome is typically first noticed in children around six months of age due to their photophobia or their nystagmus The nystagmus becomes less noticeable with age but the other symptoms of the syndrome become more relevant as school age approaches Visual acuity and stability of the eye motions generally improve during the first six to seven years of life but remain near Otherwise the syndrome is considered stationary and does not worsen with age br If the light level during testing is optimized achromats may achieve corrected visual acuity of to at lower light levels regardless of the absence of color The fundus of the eye appears completely normal br Achromatopsia can be classified as complete or incomplete In general symptoms of incomplete achromatopsia are attenuated versions of those of complete achromatopsia Individuals with incomplete achromatopsia have reduced visual acuity with or without nystagmus or photophobia Incomplete achromats show only partial impairment of cone cell function br br br Cause br Achromatopsia is sometimes called rod monochromacy as opposed to blue cone monochromacy as achromats exhibit a complete absence of cone cell activity via electroretinography in photopic lighting There are at least four genetic causes of achromatopsia two of which involve cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels ACHM ACHM a third involves the cone photoreceptor transducin GNAT ACHM and the last remains unknown br Known genetic causes of this include mutations in the cone cell cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels CNGA ACHM and CNGB ACHM the cone cell transducin GNAT ACHM subunits of cone phosphodiesterase PDE C ACHM OMIM and PDEH ACHM OMIM and ATF ACHM OMIM br br br Pathophysiology br br The hemeralopic aspect of achromatopsia can be diagnosed non invasively using electroretinography The response at low scotopic and median mesopic light levels will be normal but the response under high light level photopic conditions will be absent The mesopic level is approximately a hundred times lower than the clinical level used for the typical high level electroretinogram When as described the condition is due to a saturation in the neural portion of the retina and not due to the absence of the photoreceptors per se br In general the molecular pathomechanism of achromatopsia is either the inability to properly control or respond to altered levels of cGMP particularly important in visual perception as its level controls the opening of cyclic nucleotide gated ion channels CNGs Decreasing the concentration of cGMP results in closure of CNGs and resulting hyperpolarization and cessation of glutamate release Native retinal CNGs are composed of and subunits which are CNGA and CNGB respectively in cone cells When expressed alone CNGB cannot produce functional channels whereas this is not the case for CNGA Coassembly of CNGA and CNGB produces channels with altered membrane expression ion permeability Na vs K and Ca relative efficacy of cAMP cGMP activation decreased outward rectification current flickering and sensitivity to block by L cis diltiazem br Mutations tend to result in the loss of CNGB function or gain of function often increased affinity for cGMP of CNGA cGMP levels are controlled by the activity of the cone cell transducin GNAT Mutations in GNAT tend to result in a truncated and presumably non functional protein thereby preventing alteration of cGMP levels by photons There is a positive correlation between the severity of mutations in these proteins and the completeness of the achromatopsia phenotype br Molecular diagnosis can be established by identification of biallelic variants in the causative genes Molecular genetic testing approaches used in achromatopsia can include targeted analysis for the common CNGB variant c delC p Thr IlefsTer use of a multigenerational panel or comprehensive genomic testing br br br ACHM br While some mutations in CNGA result in truncated and presumably non functional channels this is largely not the case While few mutations have received in depth study at least one mutation does result in functional channels Curiously this mutation T S produces profound alterations when expressed without CNGB One such alteration is decreased affinity for Cyclic guanosine monophosphate Others include the introduction of a sub conductance altered single channel gating kinetics and increased calcium permeability br When mutant T S channels coassemble with CNGB however the only remaining aberration is increased calcium permeability While it is not immediately clear how this increase in Ca leads to achromatopsia one hypothesis is that this increased current decreases the signal to noise ratio Other characterized mutations such as Y C and the other S region mutations result in decreased current density due to an inability of the channel to traffic to the surface Such loss of function will undoubtedly negate the cone cell s ability to respond to visual input and produce achromatopsia At least one other missense mutation outside of the S region T R also leads to loss of function br br br ACHM br While very few mutations in CNGB have been characterized the vast majority of them result in truncated channels that are presumably non functional This will largely result in haploinsufficiency though in some cases the truncated proteins may be able to coassemble with wild type channels in a dominant negative fashion The most prevalent ACHM mutation T IfsX results in a non functional truncated protein that does not properly traffic to the cell membrane br The three missense mutations that have received further study show a number of aberrant properties with one underlying theme The R Q mutation which lies in the pore region of the channel results in an increase in outward current rectification versus the largely linear current voltage relationship of wild type channels concomitant with an increase in cGMP affinity The other mutations show either increased S F or decreased F N surface expression but also with increased affinity for cAMP and cGMP It is the increased affinity for cGMP and cAMP in these mutants that is likely the disorder causing change Such increased affinity will result in channels that are insensitive to the slight concentration changes of cGMP due to light input into the retina br br br ACHM br Upon activation by light cone opsin causes the exchange of GDP for GTP in the guanine nucleotide binding protein G protein transducing activity polypeptide GNAT This causes the release of the activated subunit from the inhibitory subunits This subunit then activates a phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the conversion of cGMP to GMP thereby reducing current through CNG channels As this process is absolutely vital for proper color processing it is not surprising that mutations in GNAT lead to achromatopsia The known mutations in this gene all result in truncated proteins Presumably then these proteins are non functional and consequently cone opsin that has been activated by light does not lead to altered cGMP levels or photoreceptor membrane hyperpolarization br br br Management br br br Gene therapy br br As achromatopsia is linked to only a few single gene mutations it is a good candidate for gene therapy Gene therapy is a technique for injecting functional genes into the cells that need them replacing or overruling the original alleles linked to achromatopsia thereby curing it at least in part Achromatopsia has been a focus of gene therapy since when achromatopsia in dogs was partially cured Several clinical trials on humans are ongoing with mixed results In July a study found positive but limited improvements on congenital CNGA achromatopsia br br br Eyeborg br br Since a cybernetic device called the eyeborg has allowed people to perceive color through sound waves This form of Sensory substitution maps the hue perceived by a camera worn on the head to a pitch experienced through bone conduction according to a sonochromatic scale This allows achromats or even the totally blind to perceive or estimate the color of an object Achromat and artist Neil Harbisson was the first to use the eyeborg in early which allowed him to start painting in color He has since acted as a spokesperson for the technology namely in a TED Talk A study suggests that achromats who use the Eyeborg for several years exhibit neural plasticity which indicates the sensory substitution has become intuitive for them br br br Other accommodations br While gene therapy and the Eyeborg may currently have low uptake with achromats there are several more practical ways for achromats to manage their condition br br Some colors can be estimated through the use of colored filters By comparing the luminosity of a color with and without a filter or between two different filters the color can be estimated This is the premise of monocular lenses and the SeeKey In some US states achromats can use a red filter while driving to determine the color of a traffic light br To alleviate photophobia stemming from hemeralopia dark red or plum colored filters as either sunglasses or tinted contacts are very helpful at decreasing light sensitivity br To manage the low visual acuity that is typical of achromatopsia achromats may use telescopic systems specifically when driving to increase the resolution of an object of interest br br br Epidemiology br Achromatopsia is a relatively uncommon disorder with a prevalence of in people br However on the small Micronesian atoll of Pingelap approximately five percent of the atoll s inhabitants are affected This is the result of a population bottleneck caused by a typhoon and ensuing famine in the s which killed all but about twenty islanders including one who was heterozygous for achromatopsia br The people of this region have termed achromatopsia maskun which literally means not see in Pingelapese This unusual population drew neurologist Oliver Sacks to the island for which he wrote his book The Island of the Colorblind br br br Blue cone monochromacy br br Blue cone monochromacy BCM is another genetic condition causing monochromacy It mimics many of the symptoms of incomplete achromatopsia and before the discovery of its molecular biological basis was commonly referred to as x linked achromatopsia sex linked achromatopsia or atypical achromatopsia BCM stems from mutations or deletions of the OPN LW and OPN MW genes both on the X chromosome As a recessive x linked condition BCM disproportionately affects males unlike typical achromatopsia br br br Cerebral achromatopsia br br Cerebral achromatopsia is a form of acquired color blindness that is caused by damage to the cerebral cortex Damage is most commonly localized to visual area V of the visual cortex the major part of the colour center which receives information from the parvocellular pathway involved in color processing It is most frequently caused by physical trauma hemorrhage or tumor tissue growth If there is unilateral damage a loss of color perception in only half of the visual field may result this is known as hemiachromatopsia Cerebral achromats usually do not experience the other major symptoms of congenital achromatopsia since photopic vision is still functions br Color agnosia involves having difficulty recognizing colors while still being able to perceive them as measured by a color matching or categorizing task br br br Terminology br Monochromacy br Complete lack of the perception of color in a
