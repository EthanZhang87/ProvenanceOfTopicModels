In mathematics a curve also called a curved line in older texts is an object similar to a line but that does not have to be straight br Intuitively a curve may be thought of as the trace left by a moving point This is the definition that appeared more than years ago in Euclid s Elements The curved line is the first species of quantity which has only one dimension namely length without any width nor depth and is nothing else than the flow or run of the point which will leave from its imaginary moving some vestige in length exempt of any width br This definition of a curve has been formalized in modern mathematics as A curve is the image of an interval to a topological space by a continuous function In some contexts the function that defines the curve is called a parametrization and the curve is a parametric curve In this article these curves are sometimes called topological curves to distinguish them from more constrained curves such as differentiable curves This definition encompasses most curves that are studied in mathematics notable exceptions are level curves which are unions of curves and isolated points and algebraic curves see below Level curves and algebraic curves are sometimes called implicit curves since they are generally defined by implicit equations br Nevertheless the class of topological curves is very broad and contains some curves that do not look as one may expect for a curve or even cannot be drawn This is the case of space filling curves and fractal curves For ensuring more regularity the function that defines a curve is often supposed to be differentiable and the curve is then said to be a differentiable curve br A plane algebraic curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two indeterminates More generally an algebraic curve is the zero set of a finite set of polynomials which satisfies the further condition of being an algebraic variety of dimension one If the coefficients of the polynomials belong to a field k the curve is said to be defined over k In the common case of a real algebraic curve where k is the field of real numbers an algebraic curve is a finite union of topological curves When complex zeros are considered one has a complex algebraic curve which from the topological point of view is not a curve but a surface and is often called a Riemann surface Although not being curves in the common sense algebraic curves defined over other fields have been widely studied In particular algebraic curves over a finite field are widely used in modern cryptography br br br History br br Interest in curves began long before they were the subject of mathematical study This can be seen in numerous examples of their decorative use in art and on everyday objects dating back to prehistoric br times Curves or at least their graphical representations are simple to create for example with a stick on the sand on a beach br Historically the term line was used in place of the more modern term curve Hence the terms straight line and right line were used to distinguish what are today called lines from curved lines For example in Book I of Euclid s Elements a line is defined as a breadthless length Def while a straight line is defined as a line that lies evenly with the points on itself Def Euclid s idea of a line is perhaps clarified by the statement The extremities of a line are points Def Later commentators further classified lines according to various schemes For example br br Composite lines lines forming an angle br Incomposite lines br Determinate lines that do not extend indefinitely such as the circle br Indeterminate lines that extend indefinitely such as the straight line and the parabola br br The Greek geometers had studied many other kinds of curves One reason was their interest in solving geometrical problems that could not be solved using standard compass and straightedge construction br These curves include br br The conic sections studied in depth by Apollonius of Perga br The cissoid of Diocles studied by Diocles and used as a method to double the cube br The conchoid of Nicomedes studied by Nicomedes as a method to both double the cube and to trisect an angle br The Archimedean spiral studied by Archimedes as a method to trisect an angle and square the circle br The spiric sections sections of tori studied by Perseus as sections of cones had been studied by Apollonius br br A fundamental advance in the theory of curves was the introduction of analytic geometry by Ren Descartes in the seventeenth century This enabled a curve to be described using an equation rather than an elaborate geometrical construction This not only allowed new curves to be defined and studied but it enabled a formal distinction to be made between algebraic curves that can be defined using polynomial equations and transcendental curves that cannot Previously curves had been described as geometrical or mechanical according to how they were or supposedly could be generated br Conic sections were applied in astronomy by Kepler br Newton also worked on an early example in the calculus of variations Solutions to variational problems such as the brachistochrone and tautochrone questions introduced properties of curves in new ways in this case the cycloid The catenary gets its name as the solution to the problem of a hanging chain the sort of question that became routinely accessible by means of differential calculus br In the eighteenth century came the beginnings of the theory of plane algebraic curves in general Newton had studied the cubic curves in the general description of the real points into ovals The statement of B zout s theorem showed a number of aspects which were not directly accessible to the geometry of the time to do with singular points and complex solutions br Since the nineteenth century curve theory is viewed as the special case of dimension one of the theory of manifolds and algebraic varieties Nevertheless many questions remain specific to curves such as space filling curves Jordan curve theorem and Hilbert s sixteenth problem br br br Topological curve br A topological curve can be specified by a continuous function br br br br br br I br br X br br br displaystyle gamma colon I rightarrow X br br from an interval I of the real numbers into a topological space X Properly speaking the curve is the image of br br br br br br br br displaystyle gamma br br However in some contexts br br br br br br br displaystyle gamma br br itself is called a curve especially when the image does not look like what is generally called a curve and does not characterize sufficiently br br br br br br br br displaystyle gamma br br br For example the image of the Peano curve or more generally a space filling curve completely fills a square and therefore does not give any information on how br br br br br br br displaystyle gamma br br is defined br A curve br br br br br br br displaystyle gamma br br is closed or is a loop if br br br br I br br br a br br b br br br br displaystyle I a b br br and br br br br br br a br br br br br b br br br br displaystyle gamma a gamma b br br A closed curve is thus the image of a continuous mapping of a circle A non closed curve may also be called an open curve br If the domain of a topological curve is a closed and bounded interval br br br br I br br br a br br b br br br br displaystyle I a b br br the curve is called a path also known as topological arc or just arc br A curve is simple if it is the image of an interval or a circle by an injective continuous function In other words if a curve is defined by a continuous function br br br br br br br displaystyle gamma br br with an interval as a domain the curve is simple if and only if any two different points of the interval have different images except possibly if the points are the endpoints of the interval Intuitively a simple curve is a curve that does not cross itself and has no missing points a continuous non self intersecting curve br A plane curve is a curve for which br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br is the Euclidean plane these are the examples first encountered or in some cases the projective plane A space curve is a curve for which br br br br X br br br displaystyle X br br is at least three dimensional a skew curve is a space curve which lies in no plane These definitions of plane space and skew curves apply also to real algebraic curves although the above definition of a curve does not apply a real algebraic curve may be disconnected br br A plane simple closed curve is also called a Jordan curve It is also defined as a non self intersecting continuous loop in the plane The Jordan curve theorem states that the set complement in a plane of a Jordan curve consists of two connected components that is the curve divides the plane in two non intersecting regions that are both connected The bounded region inside a Jordan curve is known as Jordan domain br The definition of a curve includes figures that can hardly be called curves in common usage For example the image of a curve can cover a square in the plane space filling curve and a simple curve may have a positive area Fractal curves can have properties that are strange for the common sense For example a fractal curve can have a Hausdorff dimension bigger than one see Koch snowflake and even a positive area An example is the dragon curve which has many other unusual properties br br br Differentiable curve br br Roughly speaking a differentiable curve is a curve that is defined as being locally the image of an injective differentiable function br br br br br br I br br X br br br displaystyle gamma colon I rightarrow X br br from an interval I of the real numbers into a

neighborhood U such that br br br br C br br U br br br displaystyle C cap U br br is diffeomorphic to an interval of the real numbers In other words a differentiable curve is a differentiable manifold of dimension one br br br Differentiable arc br br In Euclidean geometry an arc symbol is a connected subset of a differentiable curve br Arcs of lines are called segments rays or lines depending on how they are bounded br A common curved example is an arc of a circle called a circular arc br In a sphere or a spheroid an arc of a great circle or a great ellipse is called a great arc

that is in everyday words curved lines in two dimensional space there are obvious examples such as the helix which exist naturally in three dimensions The needs of geometry and also for example

curve is the set of the points of coordinates x y such that f x y where f is a polynomial in two variables defined over some field F One says that the curve is defined over F Algebraic geometry normally considers not only points with coordinates in F but all the points with coordinates in an algebraically closed field K br If C is a curve defined by a polynomial f with coefficients in F the curve is said to be defined over F br In the case of a curve defined over the real numbers one normally considers points with complex coordinates In this case a point with real coordinates is a real point and the set of all real points is the real part of the curve It is therefore only the real part of an algebraic curve that can be a topological curve this is not always the case as the real part of an algebraic curve may be disconnected and contain isolated points The whole curve that is the set of its complex point is from the topological point of view a surface In particular the nonsingular complex projective algebraic curves are called Riemann surfaces br The points of a curve C with coordinates in a field G are said to be rational over G and can be denoted C G When G is the field of the rational numbers one simply talks of rational points For example Fermat s Last Theorem may be restated as For n every rational point of the Fermat curve of degree n has a zero coordinate br Algebraic curves can also be space curves or curves in a space of higher dimension say n They are defined as algebraic varieties of dimension one They may be obtained as the common solutions of at least n polynomial equations in n variables If n polynomials are sufficient to define a curve in a space of dimension n the curve is said to be a complete intersection By eliminating variables by any tool of elimination theory an algebraic curve may be projected onto a plane algebraic curve which however may introduce new singularities such as cusps or double points br A plane curve may also be completed to a curve in the projective plane if a curve is defined by a polynomial f of total degree d then wdf u w v w simplifies to a homogeneous polynomial g u v w of degree d The values of u v w such that g u v w are the homogeneous coordinates of the points of the completion of the curve in the projective plane and the points of the initial curve are those such that w is not zero An example is the Fermat curve un vn wn which has an affine form xn yn A similar process of homogenization may be defined for curves in higher dimensional spaces br Except for lines the simplest examples of algebraic curves are the conics which are nonsingular curves of degree two and genus zero Elliptic curves which are nonsingular curves of genus one are studied in number theory and have important
