The Muisca also called Chibcha are an indigenous people and culture of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense Colombia that formed the Muisca Confederation before the Spanish conquest The people spoke Muysccubun a language of the Chibchan language family also called Muysca and Mosca They were encountered by conquistadors dispatched by the Spanish Empire in at the time of the conquest Subgroupings of the Muisca were mostly identified by their allegiances to three great rulers the hoa centered in Hunza ruling a territory roughly covering modern southern and northeastern Boyac and southern Santander the psihipqua centered in Muyquyt and encompassing most of modern Cundinamarca the western Llanos and the iraca religious ruler of Suamox and modern northeastern Boyac and southwestern Santander br The territory of the Muisca spanned an area of around km sq mi from the north of Boyac to the Sumapaz P ramo and from the summits to the western portion of the Eastern Ranges Their territory bordered the lands of the Panche in the west the Muzo in the northwest the Guane in the north the Lache in the northeast the Achagua in the east and the Sutagao in the south br At the time of the Spaniard invasion the area had a large population although the precise number of inhabitants is not known Estimates vary from million to over million inhabitants Their economy was based on agriculture salt mining trading metalworking and manufacturing br Due to Spanish colonization the population of the Muisca has drastically decreased and assimilated into the general population The descendants of the Muisca are often found in rural municipalities including Cota Ch a Tenjo Suba Engativ Tocancip Gachancip and Ubat A census by the Ministry of Interior Affairs in reports a total of Muisca people in Colombia br Much of our knowledge about the Muisca comes from the testimonies of their conquistadors Gonzalo Jim nez de Quesada Spanish poet soldier and priest Juan de Castellanos th century bishop Lucas Fern ndez de Piedrahita and Franciscan Pedro Sim n th century br More recently Javier Ocampo L pez and Gonzalo Correal Urrego have contributed notable scholarship br br br History of the Muisca br br Knowledge of events up until is mainly derived from mythological contexts but thanks to the Chronicles of the West Indies we do have descriptions of the final period of Muisca history prior to Spanish arrival br br br Background br Excavations in the Altiplano Cundiboyacense the highlands of Cundinamarca and Boyac departments show evidence of human activity since the Archaic stage at the beginning of the Holocene era Colombia has one of the most ancient archaeological sites of the Americas El Abra which is estimated to be approximately years old Other archaeological traces in the region of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense have led scholars to talk about an El Abra Culture In Tibit tools and other lithic artifacts date to BCE on the Bogot savanna especially at Tequendama Falls other lithic tools dated a millennium later were found that belonged to specialized hunters Human skeletons were found that date to BCE Analysis demonstrated that the people were members of the El Abra Culture br br br Muisca era br Scholars agree that the group identified as Muisca migrated to the Altiplano Cundiboyacense in the Formative era between BCE and CE as shown by evidence found at Aguazuque and Soacha Like the other formative era cultures of America the Muiscas were transitioning between being hunter gatherers and becoming sedentary farmers Around BCE groups of agrarians with ceramic traditions came to the region from the lowlands They had permanent housing and stationary camps and worked the salty water to extract salt In Zipac n there is evidence of agriculture and ceramics The oldest settlement of the highlands dates to BCE Between BCE and BCE a second wave of migrants came to the highlands Their presence is identified by multicolor ceramics housing and farms These groups were still in residence upon the arrival of the Spanish invaders They left abundant traces of their occupation that have been studied since the th century and allow scientists to reconstruct their way of life It is possible that the Muisca integrated with more ancient inhabitants but the Muisca were the ones who molded the cultural profile and the social and political organization Their language a dialect of Chibcha was very similar to those peoples of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta Kogui Ijka Wiwa and Kankuamo and the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy U wa br br br Wars br br Zipa Saguamanchica ruled to was in a constant war against aggressive tribes such as the Sutagao and especially the Panche who would also make difficulties for his successors Nemequene and Tisquesusa The Caribs were also a permanent threat as rivals of the zaque of Hunza especially for the possession of the salt mines of Zipaquir Nemoc n and Tausa br br br Timeline of inhabitation of the Muisca area br br br Political and administrative organization br br The Muisca people were organized in a confederation that was a loose union of states that each retained sovereignty The confederation was not a kingdom as there was no absolute monarch nor was it an empire because it did not dominate other ethnic groups or peoples It is hard to compare the Muisca Confederation with other American civilizations such as the Aztec or the Inca empires as it was more similar to a confederation of states such as the Achaean League The Muisca Confederation was one of the biggest and best organized confederations of tribes on the South American continent br Every tribe within the confederation was ruled by a chief or a cacique Most of the tribes were part of the Muisca ethnic group sharing the same language and culture and forming relations through trade They united in the face of a common enemy The army was the responsibility of the zipa or zaque The army was made up of the g eches the traditional ancient warriors of the Muisca br The Muisca Confederation existed as the union of two lesser confederations The southern confederation headed by the zipa had its capital at Bacat now Bogot This southern polity included the majority of the Muisca population and held greater economic power br The northern territory was ruled by the zaque and had its capital in Hunza known today as Tunja Although both areas had common political relations and affinities and belonged to the same tribal nation there were still rivalries between them Among the territories there were four chiefdoms Bacat Hunza Duitama and Sogamoso The chiefdom was composed by localities The tribes were divided into Capitan as ruled by a capitan There were two kinds Great Capitania sybyn and Minor Capitania uta The status of Capitan was inherited by maternal lineage br br Confederation zipa or zaque br Priests Iraca br Chiefdoms Cacique br Capitan a Capitan br Sybyn br Uta br Territories of the

Chipat Tinjac Saboy Tacasquir br The Muisca legislation was consuetudinary that is to say their rule of law was determined by long extant customs with the approval of the zipa or zaque This kind of legislation was suitable to a confederation system and it was a well organized one The natural resources could not be privatized woods lakes plateaus rivers and other natural resources were common goods br br br Language br br Chibcha also known as muysca mosca or muysca cubun belongs to the Chibchan languages It was spoken across several regions of Central America and the north of South America The Tairona culture and the U wa related to the Muisca culture speak similar languages which encouraged trade The Muisca used a form of hieroglyphs for numbers br Many Chibcha words were absorbed or loaned into Colombian Spanish br br Geography Many names of localities and regions were kept In some cases the Spanish named cities with a combination of Chibcha and Spanish words such as Santa Fe de Bogot Chibcha Bacat Most of the municipalities of the Boyac and Cundinamarca departments are derived from Chibcha names Chocont Sogamoso Zipaquir and many others br Fruits such as curuba and uchuva br Relations the youngest child is called cuba or china for a girl muysca means people br br br Economy br br The Muisca had an economy and society considered to have been one of the most powerful of the American Post Classic stage mainly because of the precious resources of the area gold and emeralds When the Spaniards arrived in Muisca territory they found a rich state with the Muisca Confederation controlling mining of the following products br br emeralds Colombia is the primary producer of emeralds in the world br copper br coal the coal mines still operate today at Zipaquir and other sites Colombia has some of the world s most significant coal reserves br salt there were mines in production at Nemoc n Zipaquir and Tausa br gold gold was imported from other regions but it was so abundant that it became a preferred material for Muisca handicrafts The many handicraft works in gold and the zipa tradition of offering gold to the goddess Guatavita contributed to the legend of El Dorado br The Muisca traded their goods at local and regional markets with a system of barter Items traded ranged from those of basic necessity through to luxury goods The abundance of salt emeralds and coal brought these commodities to de facto currency status br Having developed an agrarian society the people used terrace farming and irrigation in the highlands Main products were fruits coca quinoa yuca and potatoes br Another major economic activity was weaving The people made a wide variety of complex textiles The scholar Paul Bahn said the Andean cultures mastered almost every method of textile weaving or decoration now known and their products were often finer than those of today br br br Culture br br The Muisca were an agrarian and ceramic society of the Andes of the north of South America Their political and administrative organization enabled them to form a compact cultural unity with great discipline In Spanish it is called cultura muisca br The contributions of the Muisca culture to the Colombian national identity have been many br br br Heraldry br Pre Columbian Muisca patterns appear in various seals of modern municipalities located on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense for instance Sop and Guatavita Cundinamarca The remaining Muisca people in central Colombia also have their own seal br br br Sports br The Muisca culture had certain sports which were part of their rituals The turmequ game also known as tejo has survived and became a popular sport of Colombia Also important were matches of wrestling The winner received a finely woven cotton blanket from the chief and was qualified as a guecha warrior br br br Religion br br Muisca priests were educated from childhood and led the main religious ceremonies Only the priests could enter the temples Besides the religious activities the priests had much influence in the lives of the people giving counsel in matters of farming or war The religion originally included human sacrifice but the practice may have been extinct by the time of the Spanish conquest as there are no first hand Spanish accounts br Oral tradition suggests that every family gave up a child for sacrifice that the children were regarded as sacred and cared for until the age of when their lives were then offered to the Sun god Su br br br Deities br Su Su Zuh or Xu The Sun god he is the father of the Muisca His temple was in Suamox the sacred city of the Sun He was the most venerated god especially by the Confederation of the zaque who was considered his descendant br Ch a The Moon goddess her temple was in what is today the municipality of Ch a She was widely worshipped by the Confederation of the zipa who was considered her son br Bochica though not properly a god he enjoyed the same status as one He was a chief or hero eternized in the oral tradition The land was flooded by a goddess a beautiful and sometimes mean woman or by Chibchacum protector of the farmers Bochica listened to the complaints of the Muisca about floods With his stick he broke two rocks at the edge of the Tequendama Falls and all the water came out forming a waterfall Bochica punished Huitaca and Chibchacum He made Huitaca an owl and made her hold up the sky Chibchacum was tasked with holding up the Earth br Bachu the mother of the Muisca people It was said that a beautiful woman with a baby came out of Lake Iguaque Bachu sat down at the bank of the lake and waited for the child to grow up When he was old enough they married and had many children who were the Muisca Bachu taught them to hunt to farm to respect the laws and to worship the gods Bachu was so good and loved that the Muisca referred to her as Furachoque Good woman in Chibcha When they became old Bachu and her husband decided to go back to the deep of the lagoon That day the Muisca were so sad but at the same time very happy because they knew their mother was very happy Other versions of the legend say that after stepping into the lagoon of Iguaque Bachu ascended to the sky and became Ch a in other versions Chia and Bachu are two different figures br br br Astronomy br br The cult of the Muisca centered on two main deities Su for the Sun and Ch a for the Moon They developed a vigesimal based on calendar and knew exactly the timing of the summer solstice June which they considered the Day of Su the Sun god The Su temple was in Sogamoso the sacred city of the Sun and the seat of the Iraca priest The Muisca name of the city Suamox or Sugamuxi means City of the Sun On the solstice the zaque went to Suamox for a major festival where ritual offerings were made It was the only day of the year when the zaque showed his face as he was considered a descendant of the Sun god br br br Mythology br br The Muisca mythology is well documented Many of the writers who contributed to the Chronicles of the West Indies were based in Bogot They recorded many of the myths as they were interested in the traditions and culture of the conquered people The Muisca territory became the seat of the colonial administration for the New Kingdom of Granada Spanish Nuevo Reino de Granada br br br El Dorado br br The origin of the legend of El Dorado Spanish for The Golden One in the early th century may be located in the Muisca Confederation The zipa offered gold and other treasures to the Guatavita goddess To do so the zipa covered himself with gold dust and washed it off in the lake while tossing gold trinkets into the waters This tradition was well known outside the Confederation as far as the Caribbean Sea the Spaniards were attracted by stories of a city of gold that did not exist Indigenous people sometimes got rid of the avaricious Spaniards in that way pointing them in the direction of other peoples Lake Guatavita was explored by conquistadors who were looking for gold offerings from the zipa to the goddess The legend grew until the term became a metaphor for any place where great wealth may be found or made br br br Architecture br br The Muisca did not construct large stone structures They didn t use the abundant rock to leave monumental ruins as has happened with other American cultures Their houses were built with materials such as clay canes and wood The houses had a conical form most of them to the point that Gonzalo Jim nez de Quesada founder of Bogot gave the area the name Valle de los Alc zares Valley of the Palaces The houses had small doors and windows and the dwellings of the higher rank citizens were different The Muisca used little furniture as they would typically sit on the floor br br br The Spanish conquest br br Rivalries between the zaque and the zipa were taken advantage of by the Spaniards as they conquered the heart of what would be Colombia Some of them such as Sebasti n de Belalc zar Gonzalo Jim nez de Quesada and Nicol s de Federman interested in locating El Dorado discovered the rich plains of Cundinamarca and Boyac The presence of the Spaniards gave hope to both sovereigns that were they to make one Confederation they could prevail in a war against the Spaniards But the Spaniards prevailed br The reaction of the chief leaders and the people did little to change the destiny of the Confederations The Spanish executed the last Muisca sovereigns Sagipa and Aquiminzaque in and respectively In Gonzalo Su rez Rend n finally put down the last resistance and the territories of the Confederations were shared by Belalcazar Federmann and De Quesada Later the Spanish Crown would elect De Quesada as the man in charge with the title adelantado de los cabildos de Santa Fe y Tunja br br br Last Muisca sovereigns br br br Under the colonial regime br br When the Muisca structure disappeared under the Spanish Conquest the territory of the Confederations of the zaque and zipa were included in a new political division within the Spanish colonies in America The territory of the Muisca located in a fertile plain of the Colombian Andes that contributed to make one of the most advanced South American civilizations became part of the colonial region named Nuevo Reino de Granada Much information about the Muisca culture was gathered by the Spanish administration and by authors such as Pedro de Aguado and Lucas Fern ndez de Piedrahita The viceregal era contributed to the importance of Bogot and people from the area would play an important role in the fights for independence and republican consolidation br br br Independent Colombia br br br th century br After independence in the new state dissolved many of the indigenous reservations The one in Tocancip was dissolved in The one in Sesquil was reduced to of its original size Tenjo was reduced to of its original size after and the indigenous lands in Suba a northern region in modern day Bogot which had been recognized and protected by the crown were taken away by the republican governments following a strategy of supression of the native culture and ethnic presence in the country s largest urban centres The Reservation of Cota was re established on land bought by the community in and then recognized by the constitution the recognition was withdrawn in by the state and restored in br In the state forbade the production of chicha a corn based alcoholic drink This was a blow to the culture and economy of the Muisca The ban remained until Since then the Festival of the chicha maize life and joy is celebrated every year in Barrio La Perseverancia a neighborhood in Bogot where most of the chicha is produced br br br st century br br Since there has been a process of reconstruction of the indigenous councils by the surviving members of the Muisca Culture Muisca Councils currently working are Suba Bosa Cota Ch a and Sesquil The councils had an Assembly in Bosa on September called the First General Congress of the Muisca People In that congress they founded the Cabildo Mayor del Pueblo Muisca affiliated to the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia ONIC They proposed linguistic and cultural recuperation defense of the territories nowadays occupied by others and proposed urban and tourist plans They support the communities of Ubat Tocancip Soacha R quira and Tenjo in their efforts to recover their organizational and human rights br The Muisca people of Suba opposed the drying up of the Tibabuyes wetland and wanted to recover the Juan Amarillo wetland They defended the natural reserves like La Conejera part of the Suba Hills that is considered by the Shelter s Council to be communal land Suati Magazine The Song of the Sun is a publication of poetry literature and essays about Muisca culture br The community of Bosa made important achievements in its project of natural medicine in association with the Paul VI Hospital and the District Secretary of Health of Bogot The community of Cota has reintroduced the growing of quinua and regularly barter their products at market br Toward the end of there was a report on the Muisca population br br Three Muisca councils Cota Ch a and Sesquil with a population of persons br in the Capital District people are registered as belonging to the Muisca ethnic group br in the localities of Suba and Bosa people are registered br the report does not include the number of people of the Muisca ethnic group in the entire territory of the ancient Muisca Confederation or outside that territory It does not include Muisca Creole persons it is to say those of mixed Muisca ancestry br br br Muisca research br br Studies of Muisca culture are abundant and have a long tradition The first sources come from the Chronicles of the West Indies which work lasted for three centuries during the existence of the colonial New Kingdom of Granada br After the independence wars in there was a surge of interest in the study of the Muisca culture Indigenous Colombians established the capital of their republic in Bogot the former viceroyal city which was the capital of the confederation of the zipa and was known as Bacat Research shows that this site was the cradle of an advanced society whose process of consolidation was cut short by the Spanish conquest br This search for an identity resulted in giving emphasis to the Muisca culture and overlooking other native nations which were seen as wild people Researchers wrongly concluded that the Muisca culture inhabited a previously empty land and that all archeological finds could be attributed solely to the Muisca In president Tom s Cipriano de Mosquera invited Italian cartographer Agust n Codazzi who led the Geography Commission with Manuel Anc zar and did descriptive studies of the national territory and an inventory of the archaeological sites The result of the expedition was published in Bogot in as Peregrinaci n Alfa Arg ello Garc a pointed out that the goal of that expedition in the context of the new nation was to underline the pre Hispanic societies and in that sense they centered on the Muisca culture as the main model A similar tendency can be found in the works of Ezequiel Uricoechea An objection to that point of view came from Vicente Restrepo his work Los chibchas antes de la conquista espa ola showed them as barbarians br Miguel Triana in his work La Civilizaci n Chibcha suggested that the rock art symbols were writing Wenceslao Cabrera Ort z was the one who concluded that the Muisca were migrants to the highlands in he published on this and reported about excavations at the El Abra archaeological site Those publications opened a new era in the studies of the pre Hispanic cultures in Colombia br Recent archaeological work has also concentrated on the creation and composition of Muisca goldwork with this data being made available for wider research br br br
