A night vision device NVD also known as a night optical observation device NOD or night vision goggle NVG is an optoelectronic device that allows visualization of images in low levels of light improving the user s night vision br The device enhances ambient visible light and converts near infrared light into visible light which can then be seen by humans this is known as I image intensification By comparison viewing of infrared thermal radiation is referred to as thermal imaging and operates in a different section of the infrared spectrum br A night vision device usually consists of an image intensifier tube a protective housing and an optional mounting system Many NVDs also include a protective sacrificial lens mounted over the front objective lens to prevent damage by environmental hazards while some incorporate telescopic lenses An NVD image is typically monochrome green as green was considered to be the easiest color to see for prolonged periods in the dark Night vision devices may be passive relying solely on ambient light or may be active using an IR infrared illuminator br Night vision devices may be handheld or attach to helmets When used with firearms an IR laser sight is often mounted to the weapon The laser sight produces an infrared beam that is visible only through an NVD and aids with aiming Some night vision devices are made to be mounted to firearms These can be used in conjunction with weapon sights or standalone some thermal weapon sights have been designed to provide similar capabilities br These devices were first used for night combat in World War II and came into wide use during the Vietnam War The technology has evolved since then involving generations of night vision equipment with performance increases and price reductions Consequently though they are commonly used by military and law enforcement agencies night vision devices are available to civilian users for applications including aviation driving and demining br br br History br br In Hungarian physicist K lm n Tihanyi invented an infrared sensitive electronic television camera for anti aircraft defense in the UK Night vision technology prior to the end of World War II was later described as Generation br Night vision devices were introduced in the German Army as early as and were used in World War II AEG started developing its first devices in In mid the German Army began testing infrared night vision devices and telescopic rangefinders mounted on Panther tanks Two arrangements were constructed The Sperber FG Sparrow Hawk with a range of up to m had a cm infrared searchlight and an image converter operated by the tank commander br From late to March the German military conducted successful tests of FG sets mounted on Panther Ausf G tanks and other variants During the war approximately or Panthers were equipped with the FG and saw combat on both the Eastern and Western Fronts The Vampir man portable system for infantry was used with StG assault rifles br Parallel development occurred in the US The M and M infrared night sighting devices also known as the sniperscope or snooperscope saw limited service with the US Army in World War II and in the Korean War to assist snipers These were active devices using an infrared light source to illuminate targets Their image intensifier tubes used an anode and an S photocathode made primarily of silver cesium and oxygen and electrostatic inversion with electron acceleration produced gain br An experimental Soviet device called the PAU was field tested in br In the British Admiralty assumed responsibility for British military infra red research They worked first with Philips until the fall of the Netherlands then with Philips UK subsidiary Radio Transmission Equipment Ltd and finally with EMI who in early provided compact lightweight image converter tubes By July the British had produced a binocular apparatus called Design E This was bulky needing an external power pack generating volts but saw limited use with amphibious vehicles of th Armoured Division in the crossing of the Rhine Between May and June rd Wessex Infantry Division trialled man portable night vision sets and the British later experimented with mounting the devices to Mark III and Mark II S Sten submachine guns However by January the British had only made seven infra red receiver sets Although some were sent to India and Australia for trials before the end of by the Korean War and Malayan Emergency the British were using night vision equipment supplied by the United States br Early examples include br br FG Sperber br ZG Vampir br PAU br PNV A tanker goggles br SU PAS br T Sniperscope st model World War II br M Sniperscope nd model World War II br M Sniperscope th model Korean War br AN PAS early Vietnam War br After World War II Vladimir K Zworykin developed the first practical commercial night vision device at Radio Corporation of America intended for civilian use Zworykin s idea came from a former radio guided missile At that time infrared was commonly called black light a term later restricted to ultraviolet Zworykin s invention was not a success due to its large size and high cost br br br United States br br br Generation br br First generation passive devices developed by the US Army in the s were introduced during the Vietnam War They were an adaptation of earlier active technology and relied on ambient light instead of using an extra infrared light source Using an S photocathode their image intensifiers amplified light around fold but they were quite bulky and required moonlight to function properly br Examples br br AN PVS Starlight scope br AN PVS Starlight scope br AN PAS Varo Metascope br br br Generation br br s second generation devices featured an improved image intensifier tube using a micro channel plate MCP with an S photocathode This produced a much brighter image especially around the edges of the lens This led to increased clarity in low ambient light environments such as moonless nights Light amplification was around Image resolution and reliability improved br Examples br br AN PVS Miniaturized night vision sight br AN PVS br AN PVS br SUPERGEN br Later advances brought GEN II devices equipped with better optics SUPERGEN tubes improved resolution and better signal to noise ratios though the label is not formally recognized by the NVESD br br br Generation br br Third generation night vision systems developed in the late s maintained the MCP from Gen II but used a gallium arsenide photocathode with improved resolution GA photocathodes are primarily manufactured by L Harris Technologies and Elbit Systems of America and imaged light from nm In addition the MCP was coated with an ion barrier film to increase tube life However the ion barrier allowed fewer electrons to pass through The ion barrier increased the halo effect around bright spots or light sources Light amplification and power consumption with these devices improved to around br Examples br br AN PVS br AN NVS br AN PVS br AN PVS br AN PNVS br AN PVS br CNVS br PN K br br br Auto gating br Autogating ATG rapidly switches the power supply s voltage to the photocathode on and off These switches are rapid enough that they are not detectable to the human eye and peak voltage supplied to the night vision device is maintained This reduces the duty cycle ie the amount of time that the tube has power running through it which increases the device s lifespan Autogating also enhances the Bright Source Protection BSP which reduces the voltage supplied to the photocathode in response to ambient light levels Automatic Brightness Control ABC modulates the amount of voltage supplied to the microchannel plate rather than the photocathode in response to ambient light Together BSP and ABC alongside autogating serves to prevent temporary blindness for the user and prevent damage to the tube when the night vision device is exposed to sudden bright sources of light like a muzzle flash or artificial lighting These modulation systems also help maintain a steady illumination level in the user s view that improves the ability to keep eyes on target in spite of temporary light flashes These functions are especially useful for pilots soldiers in urban environments and special operations forces who may be exposed to rapidly changing light levels br br br Generation GEN III OMNI I IX br br OMNI or OMNIBUS refers to a series of contracts through which the US Army purchased GEN III night vision devices This started with OMNI I which procured AN PVS A and AN PVS B devices then continued with OMNI II OMNI III OMNI IV OMNI V OMNI VI OMNI VII OMNI VIII and OMNI IX br However OMNI is not a specification The performance of a particular device generally depends upon the tube which is used For example a GEN III OMNI III MX A AVS tube performs similarly to a GEN III OMNI VII MX A AVS tube even though the former was manufactured in and the latter br One particular technology PINNACLE is a proprietary thin film microchannel plate technology created by ITT that was included in the OMNI VII contract The thin film improves performance br GEN III OMNI V IX devices developed in the s and onward can differ from earlier devices in important ways br br An automatic gated power supply system regulates the photocathode voltage allowing the NVD to instantaneously adapt to changing light conditions br A removed or greatly thinned ion barrier that decreases the number of electrons that are rejected by GEN III MCP hence resulting in less image noise The disadvantage to a thin or removed ion barrier is the overall decrease in tube life from a theoretical h mean time to failure MTTF for standard Gen III type to h MTTF for thin film types This loss is largely negated by the low number of image intensifier tubes that reach h of operation before requiring replacement br The consumer market sometimes classifies such systems as Generation the United States military describes these systems as Generation autogated tubes GEN III OMNI V IX Moreover as autogating power supplies can be added to any previous generation of night vision devices autogating capability does not automatically put the devices in a particular OMNI classification Any postnominals appearing after a generation type i e Gen II Gen III indicate improvement s over the original specification s requirements br Examples br br AN PVS br NVS br Binocular Night Vision Device BNVD AN PVS AN PVS AN PVS AN PVS A AN PVS D br Ground Panoramic Night Vision Goggle GPNVG br br br Figure of merit br Figure of merit FoM is a quantitative measure of a NVD s effectiveness and clarity It is calculated using the number of line pairs per millimeter that a user can detect multiplied by the image intensifier s signal to noise SNR ratio br In the late s innovations in photocathode technology significantly increased the SNR with new tubes surpassing Gen performance br By the United States federal government concluded that a tube s generation was not a determinant performance factor obsoleting the term as a basis of export regulations br The US government has recognized the fact that the technology itself makes little difference as long as an operator can see clearly at night Consequently the United States bases export regulations directly on the figure of merit br ITAR regulations specify that US made tubes with a FOM greater than are not exportable however the Defense Technology Security Administration DTSA can waive that policy on a case by case basis br br br Fusion night vision br br Fusion night vision combines I image intensification with thermal imaging which functions in the medium MWIR m and or long LWIR m wavelength range Initial models appeared in the s Dedicated fusion devices and clip on imagers that add a thermal overlay to standard I night vision devices are available Fusion combines excellent navigation and fine details I with easy heat signature detection imaging br Fusion modes include night vision with thermal overlay night vision only thermal only and others such as outline which outlines objects that have thermal signatures or decamouflage which highlights all objects that are of near human temperature Fusion devices are heavier and more power hungry than I only devices br One alternative is to use an I device over one eye and a thermal device over the other eye relying on the human visual system to provide a binocular combined view br br br Examples br AN PSQ ENVG

frequency range This is possible with dedicated image intensifier tubes or with clip on devices br br br Advantages br OOB device might see more on a starlit night because OOB devicee intensify any ambient UV or SWIR light br OOB devices image nm light which can help JTACs and other FACs when marking targets with a laser designator which typically use nm light which is barely visible to Gen III br OOB light is not visible to most commercial devices Despite ITAR restrictions night vision proliferated among peer and near peer countries and into terrorist hands such as the Taliban Red Unit Friendly forces using night vision equipment such as IR illuminators IR strobes or IR lasers can be spotted OOB tech are much more difficult to spot with Gen III depending on wavelength and intensity

Illuminator Designator nm nm br Optics CTAM Coded Target Acquisition Marker nm br br br Wide field of view br br Night vision devices typically have a limited field of view FoV the commonly used AN PVS has a FoV of less than the monocular horizontal FoV and humans binocular horizontal FoV This forces users to turn their heads to compensate This is particularly evident when flying driving or CQB which involves split second decisions These limitations led many SF SOF operators to prefer white light rather than night vision when conducting CQB As a result much time and effort has gone into research to develop a wider FoV solution br br br Panoramic night vision goggles br Panoramic night vision goggles PNVG increase FoV by increasing the number of sensor tubes This solution adds size weight power requirements and complexity An example is GPNVG Ground Peripheral Night Vision Goggle These goggles and the aviation AN AVS PNVG from which they were derived offer a FoV br Examples br br GPNVG br AN AVS br br br Foveated night vision br Foveated night vision F NVG uses specialized WFoV optics to increase the field of view through an intensifier tube The fovea refers to the part of the retina which is responsible for central vision These devices have users look straight through the tubes so light passing through the center of the tube falls on the foveal retina as is the case with traditional binocular NVGs The increased FoV comes at the price of image quality and edge distortions br Examples br br WFoV F NVG retrofit AN PVS goggles br WFoV BNVD combined F NVG and DIT NVG variant of AN PVS A br br br Diverging image tube br Diverging image tube DIT night vision increases FoV by angle the tubes slightly outward This increases peripheral FoV but causes distortion and reduced image quality With DIT users are no longer looking through the center of the tubes which provides the clearest images and light passing through the center of the tubes no longer falls on the fovea br Examples br br AN PVS s br WFoV BNVD variant of the AN PVS A which incorporates both F NVG and DIT NVG The foveal WFoV optics increase the FoV of each tube from to while the angulation of the tubes positions them so there is a overlap of binocular vision in the center and a total FoV It offers a FoM of better than the FoM in either the GPNVG and the standard AN PVS A br Noise Fighters Panobridge binocular bridge mount which combines two AN PVS monoculars and allows them to be angled outward or positioned parallel br br br Digital br Some night vision devices including several of the ENVG AN PSQ models are digital Introduced in the late s these allow transmission of the image at the cost of increased size weight power usage br High sensitivity digital camera technology enables NVGs that combine a camera and a display instead of an image intensifier These devices can offer Gen equivalent quality at a lower cost At the higher end SiOnyx has produced digital color NVGs The Opsin of has a form factor and helmet weight similar to an AN PVS but requires a separate battery pack It offers a shorter battery life and lower sensitivity It can however tolerate bright light and process a wider range of wavelengths br br br Other technologies br Ceramic Optical Ruggedized Engine CORE produces higher performance Gen tubes by replacing the glass plate with a ceramic plate This plate is produced from specially formulated ceramic and metal alloys Edge distortion is improved photo sensitivity is increased and the resolution can be as high as lp mm CORE is still considered Gen as it does not utilize a microchannel plate br A night vision contact lens prototype places a thin strip of graphene between layers of glass that reacts to photons to brighten dark images Prototypes absorb only of light which is not enough for practical use br The Sensor and Electron Devices Directorate SEDD of the US Army Research Laboratory developed quantum well infrared detector QWID This technology s epitaxial layers use a gallium arsenide GaAs or aluminum gallium arsenide system AlGaAs It is particularly sensitive to that are mid length infrared waves The Corrugated QWIP CQWIP broadens detection capacity by using a resonance superstructure to orient more of the electric field parallel so that it can be absorbed Although cryogenic cooling between K and K is required QWID technology may be appropriate for continuous surveillance viewing due to its claimed low cost and uniformity in materials br Materials from the II VI compounds such as HgCdTe are used for high performance infrared light sensing cameras An alternative within the III V family of compounds from InAsSb a III V compound which is common in opto electronics in items such as DVDs and phones A graded layer with increased atomic spacing and an intermediate layer of the GaAs substrate trap any potential defects br Metasurface based upconversion technology provides a night vision film that weighs less than a gram and can be placed across ordinary glasses Photons pass through a resonant non local lithium niobate metasurface with a pump beam The metasurface boosts the photons energy pushing them into the visible spectrum without converting them to electrons Cooling is not required Visible and infrared light appear in a single image Traditionally night vision systems capture side by side views from each spectrum so they can t produce identical images Its frequency range is nm infrared to visible nm light br br br Soviet Union Russia br br The Soviet Union and after the Russian Federation have developed their own night vision devices Models used after by the Russian Soviet Army are designated PNxx Russian xx where PN is the GRAU index of night vision devices The PN stands for pritsel nochnoy Russian meaning night sight and the xx is the model number Different models introduced around the same time use the same type of batteries and mounting mechanism Multi weapon models have replaceable elevation scales with one scale for the ballistic arc of each Supported weapons include the AK family sniper rifles light machine guns and hand held grenade launchers br br PN
