color usually quoted as having a range of from about to nanometers Another name for this color is near violet br br br Electric violet br br The color at right electric violet is the closest approximation to middle spectrum violet that can be made on a computer screen given the limitations of the sRGB color gamut It is an approximation of the color violet at about nanometers as plotted on

are produced from light instead of pigment br Pigment violet web color dark violet represents the way the color violet was always reproduced in pigments paints or colored pencils in the s br By the s because of the advent of psychedelic art artists became used to brighter pigments and pigments called Violet that are the pigment equivalent of the electric violet reproduced in the section above
