title: Titan (moon)
id: 47402
Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second largest in the Solar System It is the only moon known to have an atmosphere denser than the Earth s and is the only known object in space other than Earth on which clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid has been found Titan is one of the seven gravitationally rounded moons of Saturn and the second most distant among them Frequently described as a planet like moon Titan is larger in diameter than Earth s Moon and more massive It is the second largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter s moon Ganymede and is larger than Mercury but only as massive due to Mercury being made of mostly dense iron and rock while a large portion of Titan is made of less dense ice br Discovered in by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens Titan was the first known moon of Saturn and the sixth known planetary satellite after Earth s moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter Titan orbits Saturn at Saturn radii or km above Saturn s apparent surface From Titan s surface Saturn subtends an arc of degrees and if it were visible through the moon s thick atmosphere it would appear times larger in the sky in diameter than the Moon from Earth which subtends of arc br Titan is primarily composed of ice and rocky material which is likely differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by various layers of ice including a crust of ice Ih and a subsurface layer of ammonia rich liquid water Much as with Venus before the Space Age the dense opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan s surface until the Cassini Huygens mission in provided new information including the discovery of liquid hydrocarbon lakes in Titan s polar regions and the discovery of its atmospheric super rotation The geologically young surface is generally smooth with few impact craters although mountains and several possible cryovolcanoes have been found br The atmosphere of Titan is largely nitrogen minor components lead to the formation of methane and ethane clouds and heavy organonitrogen haze The climate including wind and rain creates surface features similar to those of Earth such as dunes rivers lakes seas probably of liquid methane and ethane and deltas and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on Earth With its liquids both surface and subsurface and robust nitrogen atmosphere Titan s methane cycle bears a striking similarity to Earth s water cycle albeit at the much lower temperature of about K C F Due to these factors Titan has been described as the most Earth like celestial object in the Solar System br br br History br br br Discovery br br Titan was discovered on March by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens Huygens was inspired by Galileo s discovery of Jupiter s four largest moons in and his improvements in telescope technology Christiaan with the help of his elder brother Constantijn Huygens Jr began building telescopes around and discovered the first observed moon orbiting Saturn with one of the telescopes they built It was the sixth moon ever discovered after Earth s Moon and the Galilean moons of Jupiter br br br Naming br Huygens named his discovery Saturni Luna or Luna Saturni Latin for moon of Saturn publishing in the tract De Saturni Luna Observatio Nova A New Observation of Saturn s Moon After Giovanni Domenico Cassini published his discoveries of four more moons of Saturn between and astronomers fell into the habit of referring to these and Titan as Saturn I through V with Titan then in fourth position Other early epithets for Titan include Saturn s ordinary satellite The International Astronomical Union officially numbers Titan as Saturn VI br The name Titan and the names of all seven satellites of Saturn then known came from John Herschel son of William Herschel discoverer of two other Saturnian moons Mimas and Enceladus in his publication Results of Astronomical Observations Made during the Years at the Cape of Good Hope Numerous small moons have been discovered around Saturn since then Saturnian moons are named after mythological giants The name Titan comes from the Titans a race of immortals in Greek mythology br br br Orbit and rotation br br Titan orbits Saturn once every days and hours Like Earth s Moon and many of the satellites of the giant planets its rotational period its day is identical to its orbital period Titan is tidally locked in synchronous rotation with Saturn and permanently shows one face to the planet Longitudes on Titan are measured westward starting from the meridian passing through this point Its orbital eccentricity is and the orbital plane is inclined degrees relative to the Saturnian equator hence also about a third of a degree off of the equatorial ring plane Viewed from Earth Titan reaches an angular distance of about Saturn radii just over kilometres mi from Saturn and subtends a disk arcseconds in diameter br The small and irregularly shaped satellite Hyperion is locked in a orbital resonance with Titan Hyperion probably formed in a stable orbital island whereas the massive Titan absorbed or ejected any other bodies that made close approaches br br br Bulk characteristics br br Titan is kilometres mi in diameter times that of the planet Mercury that of the Moon and that of Earth Titan is the tenth largest object in the solar system including the Sun Before the arrival of Voyager in Titan was thought to be slightly larger than Ganymede diameter kilometres mi and thus the largest moon in the Solar System this was an overestimation caused by Titan s dense opaque atmosphere with a haze layer kilometers above its surface This increases its apparent diameter Titan s diameter and mass and thus its density are similar to those of the Jovian moons Ganymede and Callisto Based on its bulk density of g cm Titan s composition is half ice and half rocky material Though similar in composition to Dione and Enceladus it is denser due to gravitational compression It has a mass that of Saturn making it the largest moon of the gas giants relative to the mass of its primary It is second in terms of relative diameter of moons to a gas giant Titan being of Saturn s diameter Triton is larger in diameter relative to Neptune at br Titan is probably partially differentiated into distinct layers with a kilometre mi rocky center This rocky center is believed to be surrounded by several layers composed of different crystalline forms of ice and or water The exact structure depends heavily on the heat flux from within Titan itself which is poorly constrained The interior may still be hot enough for a liquid layer consisting of a magma composed of water and ammonia between the ice Ih crust and deeper ice layers made of high pressure forms of ice The heat flow from inside Titan may even be too high for high pressure ices to form with the outermost layers instead consisting primarily of liquid water underneath a surface crust The presence of ammonia allows water to remain liquid even at a temperature as low as K C for eutectic mixture with water The Cassini probe discovered evidence for the layered structure in the form of natural extremely low frequency radio waves in Titan s atmosphere Titan s surface is thought to be a poor reflector of extremely low frequency radio waves so they may instead be reflecting off the liquid ice boundary of a subsurface ocean Surface features were observed by the Cassini spacecraft to systematically shift by up to kilometres mi between October and May which suggests that the crust is decoupled from the interior and provides additional evidence for an interior liquid layer Further supporting evidence for a liquid layer and ice shell decoupled from the solid core comes from the way the gravity field varies as Titan orbits Saturn Comparison of the gravity field with the RADAR based topography observations also suggests that the ice shell may be substantially rigid br br br Formation br The regular moons of Jupiter and Saturn are thought to have formed through co accretion a similar process to that believed to have formed the planets in the Solar System As the young gas giants formed they were surrounded by discs of material that gradually coalesced into moons Whereas Jupiter possesses four large satellites in highly regular planet like orbits Titan overwhelmingly dominates Saturn s system and possesses a high orbital eccentricity not immediately explained by co accretion alone A proposed model for the formation of Titan is that Saturn s system began with a group of moons similar to Jupiter s Galilean satellites but that they were disrupted by a series of giant impacts which would go on to form Titan Saturn s mid sized moons such as Iapetus and Rhea were formed from the debris of these collisions Such a violent beginning would also explain Titan s orbital eccentricity br A analysis of Titan s atmospheric nitrogen suggested that it was possibly sourced from material similar to that found in the Oort cloud and not from sources present during the co accretion of materials around Saturn br br br Atmosphere br br Titan is one of two known moons with a significant atmosphere with Triton hosting the other and its atmosphere is the only nitrogen rich dense atmosphere in the Solar System aside from Earth s Observations of it made in by Cassini suggest that Titan is a super rotator like Venus with an atmosphere that rotates much faster than its surface Observations from the Voyager space probes have shown that Titan s atmosphere is denser than Earth s with a surface pressure about atm It is also about times as massive as Earth s overall or about times more massive on a per surface area basis Opaque haze layers block most visible light from the Sun and other sources and obscure Titan s surface features Titan s lower gravity means that its atmosphere is far more extended than Earth s The atmosphere of Titan is opaque at many wavelengths and as a result a complete reflectance spectrum of the surface is impossible to acquire from orbit It was not until the arrival of the Cassini Huygens spacecraft in that the first direct images of Titan s surface were obtained br br Titan s atmospheric composition is nitrogen methane and hydrogen with trace amounts of other gases There are trace amounts of other hydrocarbons such as ethane diacetylene methylacetylene acetylene and propane and of other gases such as cyanoacetylene hydrogen cyanide carbon dioxide carbon monoxide cyanogen argon and helium The hydrocarbons are thought to form in Titan s upper atmosphere in reactions resulting from the breakup of methane by the Sun s ultraviolet light producing a thick orange smog Titan spends of its time within Saturn s magnetosphere which may help shield it from the solar wind br Energy from the Sun should have converted all traces of methane in Titan s atmosphere into more complex hydrocarbons within million years a short time compared to the age of the Solar System This suggests that methane must be replenished by a reservoir on or within Titan itself The ultimate origin of the methane in its atmosphere may be its interior released via eruptions from cryovolcanoes br On April NASA reported that complex organic chemicals collectively called tholins likely arise on Titan based on studies simulating the atmosphere of Titan br On June scientists at the IAA CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan br On September propene was detected in the atmosphere of Titan by NASA s Cassini spacecraft using its composite infrared spectrometer CIRS This is the first time propene has been found on any moon or planet other than Earth and is the first chemical found by the CIRS The detection of propene fills a mysterious gap in observations that date back to NASA s Voyager spacecraft s first close planetary flyby of Titan in during which it was discovered that many of the gases that make up Titan s brown haze were hydrocarbons theoretically formed via the recombination of radicals created by the Sun s ultraviolet photolysis of methane br On October methane was found in polar clouds on Titan On December astronomers reported viewing clouds likely made of methane moving across Titan using the James Webb Space Telescope br br br Climate br br Titan s surface temperature is about K C At this temperature water ice has an extremely low vapor pressure so the little water vapor present appears limited to the stratosphere Titan receives about as much sunlight as Earth Before sunlight reaches the surface about has been absorbed by the thick atmosphere leaving only of the amount of light Earth receives br Atmospheric methane creates a greenhouse effect on Titan s surface without which Titan would be much colder Conversely haze in Titan s atmosphere contributes to an anti greenhouse effect by absorbing sunlight canceling a portion of the greenhouse effect and making its surface significantly colder than its upper atmosphere br br Titan s clouds probably composed of methane ethane or other simple organics are scattered and variable punctuating the overall haze The findings of the Huygens probe indicate that Titan s atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane and other organic compounds onto its surface br Clouds typically cover of Titan s disk though outburst events have been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands to as much as One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened levels of sunlight during the southern summer generate uplift in the atmosphere resulting in convection This explanation is complicated by the fact that cloud formation has been observed not only after the southern summer solstice but also during mid spring Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size It was summer in Titan s southern hemisphere until when Saturn s orbit which governs Titan s motion moved Titan s northern hemisphere into the sunlight When the seasons switch it is expected that ethane will begin to condense over the south pole br br br Surface features br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br The surface of Titan has been described as complex fluid processed and geologically young Titan has been around since the Solar System s formation but its surface is much younger between million and billion years old Geological processes may have reshaped Titan s surface Titan s atmosphere is four times as thick as Earth s making it difficult for astronomical instruments to image its surface in the visible light spectrum The Cassini spacecraft used infrared instruments radar altimetry and synthetic aperture radar SAR imaging to map portions of Titan during its close fly bys The first images revealed a diverse geology with both rough and smooth areas There are features that may be volcanic in origin disgorging water mixed with ammonia onto the surface There is also evidence that Titan s ice shell may be substantially rigid which would suggest little geologic activity br There are also streaky features some of them hundreds of kilometers in length that appear to be caused by windblown particles Examination has also shown the surface to be relatively smooth the few objects that seem to be impact craters appeared to have been filled in perhaps by raining hydrocarbons or volcanoes Radar altimetry suggests height variation is low typically no more than meters Occasional elevation changes of meters have been discovered and Titan has mountains that sometimes reach several hundred meters to more than kilometer in height br br Titan s surface is marked by broad regions of bright and dark terrain These include Xanadu a large reflective equatorial area about the size of Australia It was first identified in infrared images from the Hubble Space Telescope in and later viewed by the Cassini spacecraft The convoluted region is filled with hills and cut by valleys and chasms It is criss crossed in places by dark lineaments sinuous topographical features resembling ridges or crevices These may represent tectonic activity which would indicate that Xanadu is geologically young Alternatively the lineaments may be liquid formed channels suggesting old terrain that has been cut through by stream systems There are dark areas of similar size elsewhere on Titan observed from the ground and by Cassini at least one of these Ligeia Mare Titan s second largest sea is almost a pure methane sea br br br Lakes br br The possibility of hydrocarbon seas on Titan was first suggested based on Voyager and data that showed Titan to have a thick atmosphere of approximately the correct temperature and composition to support them but direct evidence was not obtained until when data from Hubble and other observations suggested the existence of liquid methane on Titan either in disconnected pockets or on the scale of satellite wide oceans similar to water on Earth br The Cassini mission confirmed the former hypothesis When the probe arrived in the Saturnian system in it was hoped that hydrocarbon lakes or oceans would be detected from the sunlight reflected off their surface but no specular reflections were initially observed Near Titan s south pole an enigmatic dark feature named Ontario Lacus was identified and later confirmed to be a lake A possible shoreline was also identified near the pole via radar imagery Following a flyby on July in which the Cassini spacecraft s radar imaged the northern latitudes that were then in winter several large smooth and thus dark to radar patches were seen dotting the surface near the pole Based on the observations scientists announced definitive evidence of lakes filled with methane on Saturn s moon Titan in January The Cassini Huygens team concluded that the imaged features are almost certainly the long sought hydrocarbon lakes the first stable bodies of surface liquid found outside Earth Some appear to have channels associated with liquid and lie in topographical depressions The liquid erosion features appear to be a very recent occurrence channels in some regions have created surprisingly little erosion suggesting erosion on Titan is extremely slow or some other recent phenomena may have wiped out older riverbeds and landforms Overall the Cassini radar observations have shown that lakes cover only a small percentage of the surface making Titan much drier than Earth Most of the lakes are concentrated near the poles where the relative lack of sunlight prevents evaporation but several long standing hydrocarbon lakes in the equatorial desert regions have also been discovered including one near the Huygens landing site in the Shangri La region which is about half the size of the Great Salt Lake in Utah USA The equatorial lakes are probably oases i e the likely supplier is underground aquifers br br In June the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer on Cassini confirmed the presence of liquid ethane beyond doubt in Ontario Lacus On December Cassini passed directly over Ontario Lacus and observed specular reflection in radar The strength of the reflection saturated the probe s receiver indicating that the lake level did not vary by more than mm implying either that surface winds were minimal or the lake s hydrocarbon fluid is viscous br br On July Cassini s VIMS observed a specular reflection indicative of a smooth mirror like surface off what today is called Jingpo Lacus a lake in the north polar region shortly after the area emerged from years of winter darkness Specular reflections are indicative of a smooth mirror like surface so the observation corroborated the inference of the presence of a large liquid body drawn from radar imaging br Early radar measurements made in July and January indicated that Ontario Lacus was extremely shallow with an average depth of m and a maximum depth of to m to ft In contrast the northern hemisphere s Ligeia Mare was initially mapped to depths exceeding m the maximum discernable by the radar instrument and the analysis techniques of the time br Later science analysis released in more fully mapped the depths of Titan s three methane seas and showed depths of more than metres ft Ligeia Mare averages from to m to ft in depth while other parts of Ligeia did not register any radar reflection at all indicating a depth of more than m ft While only the second largest of Titan s methane seas Ligeia contains enough liquid methane to fill three Lake Michigans br In May Cassini s radar altimeter observed Titan s Vid Flumina channels defined as a drainage network connected to Titan s second largest hydrocarbon sea Ligeia Mare Analysis of the received altimeter echoes showed that the channels are located in deep up to m steep sided canyons and have strong specular surface reflections that indicate they are currently filled with liquid Elevations of the liquid in these channels are at the same level as Ligeia Mare to within a vertical precision of about m consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys Specular reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of Ligeia Mare consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system This is likely the first direct evidence of the presence of liquid channels on Titan and the first observation of hundred meter deep canyons on Titan Vid Flumina canyons are thus drowned by the sea but there are a few isolated observations to attest to the presence of surface liquids standing at higher elevations br During six flybys of Titan from to Cassini gathered radiometric tracking and optical navigation data from which investigators could roughly infer Titan s changing shape The density of Titan is consistent with a body that is about rock and water The team s analyzes suggest that Titan s surface can rise and fall by up to metres during each orbit That degree of warping suggests that Titan s interior is relatively deformable and that the most likely model of Titan is one in which an icy shell dozens of kilometers thick floats atop a global ocean The team s findings together with the results of previous studies hint that Titan s ocean may lie no more than kilometres mi below its surface On July NASA reported the ocean inside Titan may be as salty as the Dead Sea On September NASA reported studies suggesting methane rainfall on Titan may interact with a layer of icy materials underground called an alkanofer to produce ethane and propane that may eventually feed into rivers and lakes br In Cassini found the first evidence of fluid filled channels on Titan in a series of deep steep sided canyons flowing into Ligeia Mare This network of canyons dubbed Vid Flumina ranges in depth from to m and has sides as steep as They are believed to have formed either by crustal uplifting like Earth s Grand Canyon a lowering of sea level or perhaps a combination of the two The depth of erosion suggests that liquid flows in this part of Titan are long term features that persist for thousands of years br br br Impact craters br br Radar SAR and imaging data from Cassini have revealed few impact craters on Titan s surface These impacts appear to be relatively young compared to Titan s age The few impact craters discovered include a kilometre wide mi two ring impact basin named Menrva seen by Cassini s ISS as a bright dark concentric pattern A smaller kilometre wide mi flat floored crater named Sinlap and a km mi crater with a central peak and dark floor named Ksa have also been observed Radar and Cassini imaging have also revealed crateriforms circular features on the surface of Titan that may be impact related but lack certain features that would make identification certain For example a kilometre wide mi ring of bright rough material known as Guabonito has been observed by Cassini This feature is thought to be an impact crater filled in by dark windblown sediment Several other similar features have been observed in the dark Shangri La and Aaru regions Radar observed several circular features that may be craters in the bright region Xanadu during Cassini s April flyby of Titan br Many of Titan s craters or probable craters display evidence of extensive erosion and all show some indication of modification Most large craters have breached or incomplete rims despite the fact that some craters on Titan have relatively more massive rims than those anywhere else in the Solar System There is little evidence of formation of palimpsests through viscoelastic crustal relaxation unlike on other large icy moons Most craters lack central peaks and have smooth floors possibly due to impact generation or later eruption of cryovolcanic lava Infill from various geological processes is one reason for Titan s relative deficiency of craters atmospheric shielding also plays a role It is estimated that Titan s atmosphere reduces the number of craters on its surface by a factor of two br The limited high resolution radar coverage of Titan obtained through suggested the existence of nonuniformities in its crater distribution Xanadu has times more craters than elsewhere The leading hemisphere has a higher density than the trailing hemisphere There are lower crater densities in areas of equatorial dunes and in the north polar region where hydrocarbon lakes and seas are most common br Pre Cassini models of impact trajectories and angles suggest that where the impactor strikes the water ice crust a small amount of ejecta remains as liquid water within the crater It may persist as liquid for centuries or longer sufficient for the synthesis of simple precursor molecules to the origin of life br br br Cryovolcanism and mountains br br Scientists have long speculated that conditions on Titan resemble those of early Earth though at a much lower temperature The detection of argon in the atmosphere in indicated that volcanoes had spawned plumes of lava composed of water and ammonia Global maps of the lake distribution on Titan s surface revealed that there is not enough surface methane to account for its continued presence in its atmosphere and thus that a significant portion must be added through volcanic processes br Still there is a paucity of surface features that can be unambiguously interpreted as cryovolcanoes One of the first of such features revealed by Cassini radar observations in called Ganesa Macula resembles the geographic features called pancake domes found on Venus and was thus initially thought to be cryovolcanic in origin until Kirk et al refuted this hypothesis at the American Geophysical Union annual meeting in December The feature was found to be not a dome at all but appeared to result from accidental combination of light and dark patches In Cassini also detected an unusually bright feature called Tortola Facula which was interpreted as a cryovolcanic dome No similar features have been identified as of In December astronomers announced the discovery of two transient but unusually long lived bright spots in Titan s atmosphere which appear too persistent to be explained by mere weather patterns suggesting they were the result of extended cryovolcanic episodes br A mountain range measuring kilometres mi long kilometres mi wide and kilometres mi high was also discovered by Cassini in This range lies in the southern hemisphere and is thought to be composed of icy material and covered in methane snow The movement of tectonic plates perhaps influenced by a nearby impact basin could have opened a gap through which the mountain s material upweled Prior to Cassini scientists assumed that most of the topography on Titan would be impact structures yet these findings reveal that similar to Earth the mountains were formed through geological processes br In Jeffrey Moore planetary geologist of Ames Research Center proposed an alternate view of Titan s geology Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far he asserted that Titan is a geologically dead world whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering fluvial and eolian erosion mass wasting and other exogenic processes According to this hypothesis methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan s cold and stiff interior Ganesa Macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded scarps of large multi ring impact structures or as a result of the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior Even in this case Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic water ammonia mixture with a temperature of K C which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto Indeed were it not for its lack of an atmosphere Callisto could serve as a model for Titan s geology in this scenario Jeffrey Moore even called Titan Callisto with weather br In March structures resembling lava flows were announced in a region of Titan called Hotei Arcus which appears to fluctuate in brightness over several months Though many phenomena were suggested to explain this fluctuation the lava flows were found to rise metres ft above Titan s surface consistent with it having erupted from beneath the surface br In December the Cassini mission team announced the most compelling possible cryovolcano yet found Named Sotra Patera it is one in a chain of at least three mountains each between and m in height several of which are topped by large craters The ground around their bases appears to be overlaid by frozen lava flows br Crater like landforms possibly formed via explosive maar like or caldera forming cryovolcanic eruptions have been identified in Titan s polar regions These formations are sometimes nested or overlapping and have features suggestive of explosions and collapses such as elevated rims halos and internal hills or mountains The polar location of these features and their colocalization with Titan s lakes and seas suggests volatiles such as methane may help power them Some of these features appear quite fresh suggesting that such volcanic activity continues to the present br Most of Titan s highest peaks occur near its equator in so called ridge belts They are believed to be analogous to Earth s fold mountains such as the Rockies or the Himalayas formed by the collision and buckling of tectonic plates or to subduction zones like the Andes where upweling lava or cryolava from a melting descending plate rises to the surface One possible mechanism for their formation is tidal forces from Saturn Because Titan s icy mantle is less viscous than Earth s magma mantle and because its icy bedrock is softer than Earth s granite bedrock mountains are unlikely to reach heights as great as those on Earth In the Cassini team announced what they believe to be the tallest mountain on Titan Located in the Mithrim Montes range it is m tall br br If volcanism on Titan really exists the hypothesis is that it is driven by energy released from the decay of radioactive elements within the mantle as it is on Earth Magma on Earth is made of liquid rock which is less dense than the solid rocky crust through which it erupts Because ice is less dense than water Titan s watery magma would be denser than its solid icy crust This means that cryovolcanism on Titan would require a large amount of additional energy to operate possibly via tidal flexing from nearby Saturn The low pressure ice overlaying a liquid layer of ammonium sulfate ascends buoyantly and the unstable system can produce dramatic plume events Titan is resurfaced through the process by grain sized ice and ammonium sulfate ash which helps produce a wind shaped landscape and sand dune features Titan may have been much more geologically active in the past models of Titan s internal evolution suggest that Titan s crust was only kilometers thick until about million years ago allowing vigorous cryovolcanism with low viscosity water magmas to erase all surface features formed before that time Titan s modern geology would have formed only after the crust thickened to kilometers and thus impeded constant cryovolcanic resurfacing with any cryovolcanism occurring since that time producing much more viscous water magma with larger fractions of ammonia and methanol this would also suggest that Titan s methane is no longer being actively added to its atmosphere and could be depleted entirely within a few tens of millions of years br Many of the more prominent mountains and hills have been given official names by the International Astronomical Union According to JPL By convention mountains on Titan are named for mountains from Middle earth the fictional setting in fantasy novels by J R R Tolkien Colles collections of hills are named for characters from the same Tolkien works br br br Dark equatorial terrain br br In the first images of Titan s surface taken by Earth based telescopes in the early s large regions of dark terrain were revealed straddling Titan s equator Prior to the arrival of Cassini these regions were thought to be seas of liquid hydrocarbons Radar images captured by the Cassini spacecraft have instead revealed some of these regions to be extensive plains covered in longitudinal dunes up to ft m high about a kilometer wide and tens to hundreds of kilometers long Dunes of this type are always aligned with average wind direction In the case of Titan steady zonal eastward winds combine with variable tidal winds approximately meters per second The tidal winds are the result of tidal forces from Saturn on Titan s atmosphere which are times stronger than the tidal forces of the Moon on Earth and tend to drive wind toward the equator This wind pattern it was hypothesized causes granular material on the surface to gradually build up in long parallel dunes aligned west to east The dunes break up around mountains where the wind direction shifts br The longitudinal or linear dunes were initially presumed to be formed by moderately variable winds that either follow one mean direction or alternate between two different directions Subsequent observations indicate that the dunes point to the east although climate simulations indicate Titan s surface winds blow toward the west At less than meter per second they are not powerful enough to lift and transport surface material Recent computer simulations indicate that the dunes may be the result of rare storm winds that happen only every fifteen years when Titan is in equinox These storms produce strong downdrafts flowing eastward at up to meters per second when they reach the surface br The sand on Titan is likely not made up of small grains of silicates like the sand on Earth but rather might have formed when liquid methane rained and eroded the water ice bedrock possibly in the form of flash floods Alternatively the sand could also have come from organic solids called tholins produced by photochemical reactions in Titan s atmosphere Studies of dunes composition in May revealed that they possessed less water than the rest of Titan and are thus most likely derived from organic soot like hydrocarbon polymers clumping together after raining onto the surface Calculations indicate the sand on Titan has a density of one third that of terrestrial sand The low density combined with the dryness of Titan s atmosphere might cause the grains to clump together because of static electricity buildup The stickiness might make it difficult for the generally mild breeze close to Titan s surface to move the dunes although more powerful winds from seasonal storms could still blow them eastward br Around equinox strong downburst winds can lift micron sized solid organic particles up from the dunes to create Titanian dust storms observed as intense and short lived brightenings in the infrared br br br Observation and exploration br br Titan is never visible to the naked eye but can be observed through small telescopes or strong binoculars Amateur observation is difficult because of the proximity of Titan to Saturn s brilliant globe and ring system an occulting bar covering part of the eyepiece and used to block the bright planet greatly improves viewing Titan has a maximum apparent magnitude of and mean opposition magnitude This compares to for the similarly sized Ganymede in the Jovian system br Observations of Titan prior to the space age were limited In Spanish astronomer Josep Comas i Sol observed limb darkening of Titan the first evidence that the body has an atmosphere In Gerard P Kuiper used a spectroscopic technique to detect an atmosphere of methane br br br Fly by missions Pioneer and Voyager br br The first probe to visit the Saturnian system was Pioneer in which revealed that Titan was probably too cold to support life It took images of Titan including Titan and Saturn together in mid to late The quality was soon surpassed by the two Voyagers br Titan was examined by both Voyager and in and respectively Voyager s trajectory was designed to provide an optimized Titan flyby during which the spacecraft was able to determine the density composition and temperature of the atmosphere and obtain a precise measurement of Titan s mass Atmospheric haze prevented direct imaging of the surface though in intensive digital processing of images taken through Voyager s orange filter did reveal hints of the light and dark features now known as Xanadu and Shangri la which had been observed in the infrared by the Hubble Space Telescope Voyager which would have been diverted to perform the Titan flyby if Voyager had been unable to did not pass near Titan and continued on to Uranus and Neptune br br br Cassini Huygens br br Even with the data provided by the Voyagers Titan remained a body of mystery a large satellite shrouded in an atmosphere that makes detailed observation difficult br The Cassini Huygens spacecraft reached Saturn on July and began the process of mapping Titan s surface by radar A joint project of the European Space Agency ESA and NASA Cassini Huygens proved a very successful mission The Cassini probe flew by Titan on October and took the highest resolution images ever of Titan s surface at only kilometres mi discerning patches of light and dark that would be invisible to the human eye br On July Cassini made its first targeted close fly by at kilometres mi from Titan the closest flyby was at kilometres mi on June Liquid has been found in abundance on the surface in the north polar region in the form of many lakes and seas discovered by Cassini br br br Huygens landing br br Huygens was an atmospheric probe that touched down on Titan on January discovering that many of its surface features seem to have been formed by fluids at some point in the past Titan is the most distant body from Earth to have a space probe land on its surface br br The Huygens probe landed just off the easternmost tip of a bright region now called Adiri The probe photographed pale hills with dark rivers running down to a dark plain Current understanding is that the hills also referred to as highlands are composed mainly of water ice Dark organic compounds created in the upper atmosphere by the ultraviolet radiation of the Sun may rain from Titan s atmosphere They are washed down the hills with the methane rain and are deposited on the plains over geological time scales br After landing Huygens photographed a dark plain covered in small rocks and pebbles which are composed of water ice The two rocks just below the middle of the image on the right are smaller than they may appear the left hand one is centimeters across and the one in the center is centimeters across at a distance of about centimeters from Huygens There is evidence of erosion at the base of the rocks indicating possible fluvial activity The ground surface is darker than originally expected consisting of a mixture of water and hydrocarbon ice br In March NASA ESA and COSPAR decided to name the Huygens landing site the Hubert Curien Memorial Station in memory of the former president of the ESA br br br Dragonfly br br The Dragonfly mission developed and operated by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory will launch in July It consists of a large drone powered by an RTG to fly in the atmosphere of Titan as New Frontiers Its instruments will study how far prebiotic chemistry may have progressed The mission is planned to arrive at Titan in the mid s br br br Proposed or conceptual missions br br There have been several conceptual missions proposed in recent years for returning a robotic space probe to Titan Initial conceptual work has been completed for such missions by NASA and JPL and ESA At present none of these proposals have become funded missions br The Titan Saturn System Mission TSSM was a joint NASA ESA proposal for exploration of Saturn s moons It envisions a hot air balloon floating in Titan s atmosphere for six months It was competing against the Europa Jupiter System Mission EJSM proposal for funding In February it was announced that ESA NASA had given the EJSM mission priority ahead of the TSSM br The proposed Titan Mare Explorer TiME was a low cost lander that would splash down in a lake in Titan s northern hemisphere and float on the surface of the lake for three to six months It was selected for a Phase A design study in as a candidate mission for the th NASA Discovery Program opportunity but was not selected for flight br Another mission to Titan proposed in early by Jason Barnes a scientist at the University of Idaho is the Aerial Vehicle for In situ and Airborne Titan Reconnaissance AVIATR an uncrewed plane or drone that would fly through Titan s atmosphere and take high definition images of the surface of Titan NASA did not approve the requested million and the future of the project is uncertain br A conceptual design for another lake lander was proposed in late by the Spanish based private engineering firm SENER and the Centro de Astrobiolog a in Madrid The concept probe is called Titan Lake In situ Sampling Propelled Explorer TALISE The major difference compared to the TiME probe would be that TALISE is envisioned with its own propulsion system and would therefore not be limited to simply drifting on the lake when it splashes down br A Discovery Program contestant for its mission is Journey to Enceladus and Titan JET an astrobiology Saturn orbiter that would assess the habitability potential of Enceladus and Titan br In the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program NIAC awarded a Phase II grant to a design study of a Titan Submarine to explore the seas of Titan br br br Prebiotic conditions and life br br Titan is thought to be a prebiotic environment rich in complex organic compounds but its surface is in a deep freeze at C F K so it is currently understood that life cannot exist on the moon s frigid surface However Titan seems to contain a global ocean beneath its ice shell and within this ocean conditions are potentially suitable for microbial life br The Cassini Huygens mission was not equipped to provide evidence for biosignatures or complex organic compounds it showed an environment on Titan that is similar in some ways to ones hypothesized for the primordial Earth Scientists surmise that the atmosphere of early Earth was similar in composition to the current atmosphere on Titan with the important exception of a lack of water vapor on Titan br br br Formation of complex molecules br The Miller Urey experiment and several following experiments have shown that with an atmosphere similar to that of Titan and the addition of UV radiation complex molecules and polymer substances like tholins can be generated The reaction starts with dissociation of nitrogen and methane forming hydrogen cyanide and acetylene Further reactions have been studied extensively br It has been reported that when energy was applied to a combination of gases like those in Titan s atmosphere five nucleotide bases the building blocks of DNA and RNA were among the many compounds produced In addition amino acids the building blocks of protein were found It was the first time nucleotide bases and amino acids had been found in such an experiment without liquid water being present br On April NASA reported that complex organic chemicals could arise on Titan based on studies simulating the atmosphere of Titan br On June scientists at the IAA CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAH in the upper atmosphere of Titan br On July Cassini scientists positively identified the presence of carbon chain anions in Titan s upper atmosphere which appeared to be involved in the production of large complex organics br These highly reactive molecules were previously known to contribute to building complex organics in the Interstellar Medium therefore highlighting a possibly universal stepping stone to producing complex organic material br On July scientists reported that acrylonitrile or vinyl cyanide C H CN possibly essential for life by being related to cell membrane and vesicle structure formation had been found on Titan br In October researchers reported low temperature chemical pathways from simple organic compounds to complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon PAH chemicals Such chemical pathways may help explain the presence of PAHs in the low temperature atmosphere of Titan and may be significant pathways in terms of the PAH world hypothesis in producing precursors to biochemicals related to life as we know it br br br Possible subsurface habitats br Laboratory simulations have led to the suggestion that enough organic material exists on Titan to start a chemical evolution analogous to what is thought to have started life on Earth The analogy assumes the presence of liquid water for longer periods than is currently observable several hypotheses postulate that liquid water from an impact could be preserved under a frozen isolation layer It has also been hypothesized that liquid ammonia oceans could exist deep below the surface Another model suggests an ammonia water solution as much as kilometres mi deep beneath a water ice crust with conditions that although extreme by terrestrial standards are such that life could survive Heat transfer between the interior and upper layers would be critical in sustaining any subsurface oceanic life Detection of microbial life on Titan would depend on its biogenic effects with the atmospheric methane and nitrogen examined br br br Methane and life at the surface br br It has been speculated that life could exist in the lakes of liquid methane on Titan just as organisms on Earth live in water Such organisms would inhale H in place of O metabolize it with acetylene instead of glucose and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide However such hypothetical organisms would be required to metabolize at a deep freeze temperature of C F K br All life forms on Earth including methanogens use liquid water as a solvent it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon such as methane or ethane although water is a stronger solvent than methane Water is also more chemically reactive and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis A life form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way br In astrobiologist Chris McKay argued that if methanogenic life did exist on the surface of Titan it would likely have a measurable effect on the mixing ratio in the Titan troposphere levels of hydrogen and acetylene would be measurably lower than otherwise expected Assuming metabolic rates similar to those of methanogenic organisms on Earth the concentration of molecular hydrogen would drop by a factor of on the Titanian surface solely due to a hypothetical biological sink McKay noted that if life is indeed present the low temperatures on Titan would result in very slow metabolic processes which could conceivably be hastened by the use of catalysts similar to enzymes He also noted that the low solubility of organic compounds in methane presents a more significant challenge to any possible form of life Forms of active transport and organisms with large surface to volume ratios could theoretically lessen the disadvantages posed by this fact br In Darrell Strobel from Johns Hopkins University identified a greater abundance of molecular hydrogen in the upper atmospheric layers of Titan compared to the lower layers arguing for a downward flow at a rate of roughly molecules per second and disappearance of hydrogen near Titan s surface as Strobel noted his findings were in line with the effects McKay had predicted if methanogenic life forms were present The same year another study showed low levels of acetylene on Titan s surface which were interpreted by McKay as consistent with the hypothesis of organisms consuming hydrocarbons Although restating the biological hypothesis he cautioned that other explanations for the hydrogen and acetylene findings are more likely the possibilities of yet unidentified physical or chemical processes e g a surface catalyst accepting hydrocarbons or hydrogen or flaws in the current models of material flow Composition data and transport models need to be substantiated etc Even so despite saying that a non biological catalytic explanation would be less startling than a biological one McKay noted that the discovery of a catalyst effective at K C would still be significant With regards to the acetylene findings Mark Allen the principal investigator with the NASA Astrobiology Institute Titan team provided a speculative non biological explanation sunlight or cosmic rays could transform the acetylene in icy aerosols in the atmosphere into more complex molecules that would fall to the ground with no acetylene signature br As NASA notes in its news article on the June findings To date methane based life forms are only hypothetical Scientists have not yet detected this form of life anywhere As the NASA statement also says some scientists believe these chemical signatures bolster the argument for a primitive exotic form of life or precursor to life on Titan s surface br In February a hypothetical cell membrane capable of functioning in liquid methane at cryogenic temperatures deep freeze conditions was modeled Composed of small molecules containing carbon hydrogen and nitrogen it would have the same stability and flexibility as cell membranes on Earth which are composed of phospholipids compounds of carbon hydrogen oxygen and phosphorus This hypothetical cell membrane was termed an azotosome a combination of azote French for nitrogen and liposome br br br Obstacles br Despite these biological possibilities there are formidable obstacles to life on Titan and any analogy to Earth is inexact At a vast distance from the Sun Titan is frigid and its atmosphere lacks CO At Titan s surface water exists only in solid form Because of these difficulties scientists such as Jonathan Lunine have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life than as an experiment for examining hypotheses on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth Although life itself may not exist the prebiotic conditions on Titan and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding the early history of the terrestrial biosphere Using Titan as a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft but laboratory experiments and chemical and photochemical modeling on Earth br br br Panspermia hypothesis br br It is hypothesized that large asteroid and cometary impacts on Earth s surface may have caused fragments of microbe laden rock to escape Earth s gravity suggesting the possibility of panspermia Calculations indicate that these would encounter many of the bodies in the Solar System including Titan On the other hand Jonathan Lunine has argued that any living things in Titan s cryogenic hydrocarbon lakes would need to be so different chemically from Earth life that it would not be possible for one to be the ancestor of the other br br br Future conditions br Conditions on Titan could become far more habitable in the far future Five billion years from now as the Sun becomes a sub red giant its surface temperature could rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface making it habitable As the Sun s ultraviolet output decreases the haze in Titan s upper atmosphere will be depleted lessening the anti greenhouse effect on the surface and enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role These conditions together could create a habitable environment and could persist for several hundred million years This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth though the higher viscosity of ammonia water solutions coupled with low temperatures would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly on Titan br br br Gallery br br br Images
