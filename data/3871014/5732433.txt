A curved mirror is a mirror with a curved reflecting surface The surface may be either convex bulging outward or concave recessed inward Most curved mirrors have surfaces that are shaped like part of a sphere but other shapes are sometimes used in optical devices The most common non spherical type are parabolic reflectors found in optical devices such as reflecting telescopes that need to image distant objects since spherical mirror systems like spherical lenses suffer from spherical aberration Distorting mirrors are used for entertainment They have convex and concave regions that produce deliberately distorted images They also provide highly magnified or highly diminished smaller images when the object is placed at certain distances br br br Convex mirrors br br A convex mirror or diverging mirror is a curved mirror in which the reflective surface bulges towards the light source Convex mirrors reflect light outwards therefore they are not used to focus light Such mirrors always form a virtual image since the focal point F and the centre of curvature F are both imaginary points inside the mirror that cannot be reached As a result images formed by these mirrors cannot be projected on a screen since the image is inside the mirror The image is smaller than the object but gets larger as the object approaches the mirror br A collimated parallel beam of light diverges spreads out after reflection from a convex mirror since the normal to the surface differs at each spot on the mirror br br br Uses of convex mirrors br br The passenger side mirror on a car is typically a convex mirror In some countries these are labeled with the safety warning Objects in mirror are closer than they appear to warn the driver of the convex mirror s distorting effects on distance perception Convex mirrors are preferred in vehicles because they give an upright not inverted though diminished smaller image and because they provide a wider field of view as they are curved outwards br These mirrors are often found in the hallways of various buildings commonly known as hallway safety mirrors including hospitals hotels schools stores and apartment buildings They are usually mounted on a wall or ceiling where hallways intersect each other or where they make sharp turns They are useful for people to look at any obstruction they will face on the next hallway or after the next turn They are also used on roads driveways and alleys to provide safety for road users where there is a lack of visibility especially at curves and turns br Convex mirrors are used in some automated teller machines as a simple and handy security feature allowing the users to see what is happening behind them Similar devices are sold to be attached to ordinary computer monitors br Convex mirrors make everything seem smaller but cover a larger area of surveillance br Round convex mirrors called Oeil de Sorci re French for sorcerer s eye were a popular luxury item from the th century onwards shown in many depictions of interiors from that time With th century technology it was easier to make a regular curved mirror from blown glass than a perfectly flat one They were also known as bankers eyes due to the fact that their wide field of vision was useful for security Famous examples in art include the Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck and the left wing of the Werl Altarpiece by Robert Campin br br br Convex mirror image br br The image on a convex mirror is always virtual rays haven t actually passed through the image their extensions do like in a regular mirror diminished smaller and upright not inverted As the object gets closer to the mirror the image gets larger until br approximately the size of the object when it touches the mirror As the object moves away the image diminishes in size and gets gradually closer to the focus until it is reduced to a point in the focus when the object is at an infinite distance These features make convex mirrors very useful since everything appears smaller in the mirror they cover a wider field of view than a normal plane mirror so useful for looking at cars behind a driver s car on a road watching a wider area for surveillance etc br br br Concave mirrors br br A concave mirror or converging mirror has a reflecting surface that is recessed inward away from the incident light Concave mirrors reflect light inward to one focal point They are used to focus light Unlike convex mirrors concave mirrors show different image types depending on the distance between the object and the mirror br The mirrors are called converging mirrors because they tend to collect light that falls on them refocusing parallel incoming rays toward a focus This is because the light is reflected at different angles at different spots on the mirror as the normal to the mirror surface differs at each spot br br br Uses of concave mirrors br Concave mirrors are used in reflecting telescopes They are also used to provide a magnified image of the face for applying make up or shaving In illumination applications concave mirrors are used to gather light from a small source and direct it outward in a beam as in torches headlamps and spotlights or to collect light from a large area and focus it into a small spot as in concentrated solar power Concave mirrors are used to form optical cavities which are important in laser construction Some dental mirrors use a concave surface to provide a magnified image The mirror landing aid system of modern aircraft carriers also uses a concave mirror br br br Concave mirror image br br br Mirror shape br Most curved mirrors have a spherical profile These are the simplest to make and it is the best shape for general purpose use Spherical mirrors however suffer from spherical aberration parallel rays reflected from such mirrors do not focus to a single point For parallel rays such as those coming from a very distant object a parabolic reflector can do a better job Such a mirror can focus incoming parallel rays to a much smaller spot than a spherical mirror can A toroidal reflector is a form of parabolic reflector which has a different focal distance depending on the angle of the mirror br br br Analysis br br br Mirror equation magnification and focal length br The Gaussian mirror equation also known as the mirror and lens equation

br br o br br br br br br displaystyle d mathrm o br br and br br br br br d br br br i br br br br br br displaystyle d mathrm i br br are positive when the object and image are in front of the mirror respectively They are positive when the object or image is real br For convex mirrors if one moves the br br br br br br br br br d br br br o br br br br br br displaystyle d mathrm o br br term to the right side of the equation to solve for br br br br br br br br br d br br br i br br br br br br displaystyle d mathrm i br br then the result is always a negative number meaning that the image distance is negative the image is virtual located behind the mirror This is consistent with the behavior described above br For concave mirrors whether the image is virtual or real depends on how large the object distance is compared to the focal length If the br br br br br br br br f br br br displaystyle f br br term is larger than the br br br br br br br br br d br br br o br br br br br br displaystyle d mathrm o br br term then br br br br br br br br br d br br br i br br br br br br displaystyle d mathrm i br br is positive and the image is real Otherwise the term is negative and the image is virtual Again this validates the behavior described above br The magnification of a mirror is defined as the height of the image divided by the height of the object br br br br br m

tracing br br The image location and size can also be found by graphical ray tracing as illustrated in the figures above A ray drawn from the top of the object to the mirror surface vertex where the optical axis meets the mirror will form an angle with the optical axis The reflected ray has the same angle to the axis but on the opposite side See Specular reflection br A second ray can be drawn from the top of the object parallel to the optical axis This ray is reflected by the mirror and passes through its focal point The point at which these two rays meet is the image point corresponding to the top of the object Its distance from the optical axis defines the height of the image and its location along the axis is the image location The mirror equation and magnification equation can be derived geometrically by considering these two rays A ray that goes from the top of the object through the focal point can be considered instead Such a ray reflects parallel to the optical axis and also passes through the image point corresponding to the top of the object br br br Ray transfer matrix of spherical mirrors br br The mathematical treatment is done under the paraxial approximation
