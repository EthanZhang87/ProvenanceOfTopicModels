pigment composed of iron oxide and manganese oxide have been dated to BC Paintings of brown horses and other animals have been found on the walls of the Lascaux cave dating back about years The female figures in ancient Egyptian tomb paintings have brown skin painted with umber Light tan was often used on painted Greek amphorae and vases either as a background for black figures or the reverse br The Ancient Greeks and Romans produced a fine reddish brown ink of a color called sepia made from the ink of a variety of cuttlefish This ink was used by Leonardo da Vinci Raphael and other artists during the Renaissance and by artists up until the present time br In Ancient Rome brown clothing was associated with the lower classes or barbarians The term for the plebeians or urban poor was pullati which meant literally those dressed in brown br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Post classical history br In the Middle Ages brown robes were worn by monks of the Franciscan order as a sign of their humility and poverty Each social class was expected to wear a color suitable to their station and grey and brown were the colors of the poor Russet was a coarse homespun cloth made of wool and dyed with woad and madder to give it a subdued grey or brown shade By the statute of poor English people were required to wear russet The medieval poem Piers Plowman describes the virtuous Christian And is gladde of a goune of a graye russetAs of a tunicle of Tarse or of trye scarlet br In the Middle Ages dark brown pigments were rarely used in art painters and book illuminators artists of that period preferred bright distinct colors such as red blue and green rather than dark colors The umbers were not widely used in Europe before the end of the fifteenth century The Renaissance painter and writer Giorgio Vasari described them as being rather new in his time br Artists began using far greater use of browns when oil painting arrived in the late fifteenth century During the Renaissance artists generally used four different browns raw umber the dark brown clay mined from the earth around Umbria in Italy raw sienna a reddish brown earth mined near Siena in Tuscany burnt umber the Umbrian clay heated until it turned a darker shade and burnt sienna heated until it turned a dark reddish brown In Northern Europe Jan van Eyck featured rich earth browns in his portraits to set off the brighter colors br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Modern history br br br th and th century br The th and th century saw the greatest use of brown Caravaggio and Rembrandt Van Rijn used browns to create chiaroscuro effects where the subject appeared out of the darkness Rembrandt also added umber to the ground layers of his paintings because it promoted faster drying Rembrandt also began to use new brown pigment called Cassel earth or Cologne earth This was a natural earth color composed of over ninety percent organic matter such as soil and peat It was used by Rubens and Anthony van Dyck and later became commonly known as Van Dyck brown br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br th and th century br Brown was generally hated by the French impressionists who preferred bright pure colors The exception among French th century artists was Paul Gauguin who created luminous brown portraits of the people and landscapes of French Polynesia br In the late th century brown became a common symbol in western culture for simple inexpensive natural and healthy Bag lunches were carried in plain brown paper bags packages were wrapped in plain brown paper Brown bread and brown sugar were viewed as more natural and healthy than white bread and white sugar br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Brown in science and nature br br br Optics br Brown is a dark orange color made by combining red yellow and black It can be thought of as dark orange but it can also be made in other ways In the RGB color model which uses red green and blue light in various combinations to make all the colors on computer and television screens it is made by mixing red and green light br In terms of the visible spectrum brown refers to long wavelength hues yellow orange or red in combination with low luminance or saturation br Since brown may cover a wide range of the visible spectrum composite adjectives are used such as red brown yellowish brown dark brown or light brown br As a color of low intensity brown is a tertiary color a mix of the three subtractive primary colors is brown if the cyan content is low Brown exists as a color perception only in the presence of a brighter color contrast Yellow orange red or rose objects are still perceived as such if the general illumination level is low despite reflecting the same amount of red or orange light as a brown object would in normal lighting conditions br br br br br br br br Brown pigments dyes and inks br Raw umber and burnt umber are two of the oldest pigments used by humans Umber is a brown clay containing a large amount of iron oxide and between five and twenty percent manganese oxide which give the color Its shade varies from a greenish brown to a dark brown It takes its name from the Italian region of Umbria where it was formerly mined The principal source today is the island of Cyprus Burnt umber is the same pigment which has been roasted calcined which turns the pigment darker and more reddish br Raw sienna and burnt sienna are also clay pigments rich in iron oxide which were mined during the Renaissance around the city of Siena in Tuscany Sienna contains less than five percent manganese The natural sienna earth is a dark yellow ochre color when roasted it becomes a rich reddish brown called burnt sienna br Mummy brown was a pigment used in oil paints made from ground Egyptian mummies br Caput mortuum is a haematite iron oxide pigment used in painting The name is also used in reference to mummy brown br Van Dyck brown known in Europe as Cologne earth or Cassel earth is another natural earth pigment that was made up largely of decayed vegetal matter It made a rich dark brown and was widely used during the Renaissance to the th century It takes its name from the painter Anthony van Dyck but it was used by many other artists before him It was highly unstable and unreliable so its use was abandoned by the th century though the name continues to be used for modern synthetic pigments The color of Van Dyck brown can be recreated by mixing ivory black with mauve or with Venetian red or mixing cadmium red with cobalt blue br Mars brown The names of the earth colors are still used but very few modern pigments with these names actually contain natural earths most of their ingredients today are synthetic Mars brown is typical of these new colors made with synthetic iron oxide pigments The new colors have a superior coloring power and opacity but not the delicate hue as their namesakes br Walnuts have been used to make a brown dye since antiquity The Roman writer Ovid in the first century BC described how the Gauls used the juice of the hull or husk inside the shell of the walnut to make a brown dye for wool or a reddish dye for their hair br The chestnut tree has also been used since ancient times as a source brown dye The bark of the tree the leaves and the husk of the nuts have all been used to make dye The leaves were used to make a beige or yellowish brown dye and in the Ottoman Empire the yellow brown from chestnut leaves was combined with indigo blue to make shades of green br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Brown eyes br br With few exceptions all mammals have brown or darkly pigmented irises In humans brown eyes result from a relatively high concentration of melanin in the stroma of the iris which causes light of both shorter and longer wavelengths to be absorbed and in many parts of the world it is nearly the only iris color present Dark pigment of brown eyes is most common in East Asia Southeast Asia South Asia West Asia Oceania Africa Americas etc as well as parts of Eastern Europe and Southern Europe The majority of people in the world overall have dark brown eyes Brown irises range from highly pigmented dark brown almost black eyes to very light almost amber or hazel irises composed partially of lipochrome of Light or medium pigmented brown eyes are common in Europe Afghanistan Pakistan and Northern India as well as some parts of the Middle East and can also be found in populations in East Asia and Southeast Asia but are proportionally rare See eye color br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Brown hair br br Brown is the second most common color of human hair after black It is caused by higher levels of the natural dark pigment eumelanin and lower levels of the pale pigment pheomelanin Brown eumelanin is more common among Europeans while black eumelanin is more often found in the hair on non Europeans A small amount of black eumelanin in the absence of other pigments results in grey hair A small amount of brown eumelanin in the absence of other pigments results in blond hair br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Brown skin br A majority of people in the world have skin that is a shade of brown from a very light honey brown or a golden brown to a copper or bronze color to a coffee color or a dark chocolate brown Skin color and race are not the same many people classified as white or black actually have skin that is a shade of brown Brown skin is caused by melanin a natural pigment which is produced within the skin in cells called melanocytes Skin pigmentation in humans evolved to primarily regulate the amount of ultraviolet radiation penetrating the skin controlling its biochemical effects br Natural skin color can darken as a result of tanning due to exposure to sunlight The leading theory is that skin color adapts to intense sunlight irradiation to provide partial protection against the ultraviolet fraction that produces damage and thus mutations in the DNA of the skin cells There is a correlation between the geographic distribution of ultraviolet radiation UVR and the distribution of indigenous skin pigmentation around the world Darker skinned populations are found in the regions with the most ultraviolet closer to the equator while lighter skinned populations live closer to the poles with less UVR though immigration has changed these patterns br While white and black are commonly used to describe racial groups brown is rarely used because it crosses all racial lines br In Brazil the Portuguese word pardo which can mean different shades of brown is used to refer to multiracial people The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics IBGE asks people to identify themselves as branco white pardo brown negro black or amarelo yellow In percent of the population identified themselves as pardo See human skin color br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Soil br The thin top layer of the Earth s crust on land is largely made up of soil colored different shades of brown Good soil is composed of about forty five percent minerals twenty five percent water twenty five percent air and five percent organic material living and dead Half the color of soil comes from minerals it contains soils containing iron turn yellowish or reddish as the iron oxidizes Manganese nitrogen and sulfur turn brownish or blackish as they decay naturally br Rich and fertile soils tend to be darker in color the deeper brown color of fertile soil comes from the decomposing of the organic matter Dead leaves and roots become black or brown as they decay Poorer soils are usually paler brown in color and contain less water or organic matter br br Mollisols are the soil type found under grassland in the Great Plains of America the Pampas in Argentina and the Russian Steppes The soil is centimeters deep and is rich in nutrients and organic matter br Loess is a type of pale yellow or buff soil which originated as wind blown silt It is very fertile but is easily eroded by wind or water br Peat is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation whose decomposition is slowed by water Despite its dark brown color it is infertile but is useful as a fuel br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Mammals and birds br A large number of mammals and predatory birds have a brown coloration This sometimes changes seasonally and sometimes remains the same year round This color is likely related to camouflage since the backdrop of some environments such as the forest floor is often brown and especially in the spring and summertime when animals like the snowshoe hare get brown fur Most mammals are dichromats and so do not easily distinguish brown fur from green grass br br The brown rat or Norwegian rat Rattus norvegicus is one of the best known and most common rats br The brown bear Ursus arctos is a large bear distributed across much of northern Eurasia and North America br The ermine Mustela erminea has a brown back in summer or year round in the southern reaches of its range br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Biology br The solid waste excreted by human beings and many other animals is characteristically brown in color due to the presence of bilirubin a byproduct of destruction of red blood cells br br br Brown in culture br Surveys in Europe and the United States showed that brown was the least popular color among respondents It was the favorite color of only one percent of respondents and the least favorite color of twenty percent of people br br br Brown uniforms br Brown has been a popular color for military uniforms since the late th century largely because of its wide availability and low visibility When the Continental Army was established in at the outbreak of the American Revolution the first Continental Congress declared that the official uniform color would be brown but this was not popular with many militias whose officers were already wearing blue In the Congress asked George Washington to design a new uniform and in Washington made the official color of all uniforms blue and buff br In the Indian soldiers of the Corps of Guides in British India began to wear a yellowish shade of tan which became known as khaki from the Urdu word for dust colored taken from an earlier Persian word for soil The color made an excellent natural camouflage and was adopted by the British Army for their Abyssian Campaign in and later in the Boer War It was adopted by the United States Army during the Spanish American War and afterwards by the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps br In the s brown became the uniform color of the Nazi Party in Germany The Nazi paramilitary organization the Sturmabteilung SA wore brown uniforms and were known as the brownshirts The color
