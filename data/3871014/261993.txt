title: Monochrome
id: 261993
A monochrome or monochromatic image object or palette is composed of one color or values of one color Images using only shades of grey are called grayscale typically digital or black and white typically analog In physics monochromatic light refers to electromagnetic radiation that contains a narrow band of wavelengths which is a distinct concept br br br Application br Of an image the term monochrome is usually taken to mean the same as black and white or more likely grayscale but may also be used to refer to other combinations containing only tones of a single color such as green and white or green and red It may also refer to sepia displaying tones from light tan to dark brown or cyanotype blueprint images and early photographic methods such as daguerreotypes ambrotypes and tintypes each of which may be used to produce a monochromatic image br In computing monochrome has two meanings br br it may mean having only one color which is either on or off also known as a binary image br allowing shades of that color br A monochrome computer display is able to display only a single color often green amber red or white and often also shades of that color br In film photography monochrome is typically the use of black and white film Originally all photography was done in monochrome Although color photography was possible even in the late th century easily used color films such as Kodachrome were not available until the mid s br In digital photography monochrome images use only the data for brightness captured by the sensor or by post processing a color image to present only the perceived brightness by combining the values of multiple channels usually red blue and green The weighting of individual channels may be selected to achieve a desired artistic effect if only the red channel is selected by the weighting then the effect will be similar to that of using a red filter on panchromatic film If the red channel is eliminated and the green and blue combined then the effect will be similar to that of orthochromatic film or the use of a cyan filter on panchromatic film The selection of weighting so provides a wide variety of artistic expression in the final monochrome image br For production of an anaglyph image the original color stereogram source may first be reduced to monochrome in order to simplify the rendering of the image This is sometimes required in cases where a color image would render in a confusing manner given the colors and patterns present in the source image and the selection filters used typically red and its complement cyan br br br Color scheme br br A monochromatic color scheme comprises tones tints and shades of a single hue Tints are achieved by adding white thereby increasing lightness Shades are achieved by adding black thereby decreasing lightness Tones are achieved by adding gray thereby decreasing colorfulness br Monochromatic color schemes provide opportunities in art and visual communications design as they allow for a greater range of contrasting tones that can be used to attract attention create focus and support legibility br The use of a monochromatic color provides a strong sense of visual cohesion and can help support communication objectives through the use of connotative color The relative absence of hue contrast can be offset by variations in tone and the addition of texture br Monochromatic in science means consisting of a single wavelength of light or other radiation lasers for example usually produce monochromatic light or having or appearing to have only one color in comparison to polychromatic That means according to science the true monochromatic images can be strictly created only of shades of one color fading to black br However monochromatic also has another meaning similar to boring or colorless which sometimes leads to creating a design composed from true monochromatic color shades one hue fading to black and the colors created from the one hue but faded to all wavelengths to white This is not monochromatic in the strictly scientific meaning of the word In fact monochrome in the art world can be as complicated or even more complicated than other polychromatic art br br br In physics br br In physics monochromatic light is electromagnetic radiation of a single wavelength While no source of electromagnetic radiation is purely monochromatic in practice it is usually used to describe very narrowband sources such as monochromated or laser light The degree of monochromaticity can be defined by the spectral linewidth A device which isolates a narrow band of light from a broadband source is called a monochromator br br br See also br Duotone the use of two ink colors in printing br Halftone the use of black and white in a pattern that is perceived as shades of grey may be extended also to color images br Monochromacy a type of color vision deficiency br Monochromatic color br Monochrome monitor used with computers br Monochrome photography also known as black and white photography br Monochrome painting a style of painting that uses a single color excluding shades thereof br Monochrome printmaking printing styles that generate black and white images br Polychrome of multiple colors the opposite of monochrome br br br br br br External links br The dictionary definition of monochrome at Wiktionary
