 film more popularly referred to as mm film or mm is a format of photographic film with a film gauge of mm in loaded into a standardized type of magazine also referred to as a cassette or cartridge for use in film cameras br The term was introduced by Kodak in as a designation for mm film specifically for still photography perforated with Kodak Standard perforations It quickly grew in popularity surpassing film by the late s to become the most popular photographic film size Despite competition from formats such as and APS it remains the most popular film size today br The size of the film frame with its frame s aspect ratio of has been adopted by many high end digital single lens reflex and digital mirrorless cameras commonly referred to as full frame Even though the format is much smaller than historical medium format and large format film being historically referred to as miniature format or small format it is much larger than image sensors in most compact cameras and smartphone cameras br The engineering standard for this film is controlled by ISO titled size film and magazine br br br History br br br mm still cameras br br The film size is derived from earlier still cameras using lengths of mm movie film which had the same size but with different perforations The mm film standard for motion picture film was established in Thomas Edison s lab by William Kennedy Laurie Dickson Dickson took mm film stock supplied by George Eastman s Eastman Kodak Company The mm film was cut lengthwise into two equal width mm strips spliced together end to end and then perforated along both edges The original picture size was mm half the full frame size later used in still photography There were four perforations on each side of a motion picture frame br While the Leica camera popularized the format several mm still cameras used perforated movie film before the Leica was introduced in the s The first patent for one was issued to Leo Audobard and Baradat in England in The first full scale production camera was the Hom os a stereo camera produced by Jules Richard in and was sold until It took x mm stereo pairs using two Tessar lenses br In the French tienne Mollier designed a device for small format photography the Cent Vues which used the mm perforated film to take consecutive hundred views in mm He manufactured won the gold medal in the Concours L pine and in sold at a small scale and without much success br The first big selling mm still camera was the American Tourist Multiple which also appeared in at a cost of at today s prices the same cost as a modern Leica The first camera to take full frame mm exposures seems to be the Simplex introduced in the U S in It took either half frame or full frame shots on ft m rolls br The Minigraph by Levy Roth of Berlin another half frame small camera was sold in Germany in The patent for the Debrie Sept camera a combination mm still and movie camera was issued in the camera sold from br The Furet camera made and sold in France in took full frame x mm negatives and was the first cheap small mm camera of similar appearance to more modern models br br br Leica br br The Leica Camera designed by Oskar Barnack used mm film and proved that a format as small as mm mm was suitable for professional photography br Although Barnack designed his prototype camera around the first experimental production run of ur Leicas Serial No to did not take place until Full scale production of the Leica did not begin until While by that time there were at least a dozen other mm cameras available the Leica was a success and came to be associated with the format Mostly because of this mm popularity as well as the entire company legacy early Leica cameras are considered as highly collectible items The original Leica prototype holds the record as being the world s most expensive camera selling for million in br br br Pre loaded cassettes and Kodak Retina cameras br br In the earliest days the photographer had to load the film into reusable cassettes and at least for some cameras cut the film leader In Kodak introduced a daylight loading single use cassette This cassette was engineered so that it could be used in both Leica and Zeiss Ikon Contax cameras along with the camera for which it was invented namely the Kodak Retina camera The Retina camera and this daylight loading cassette were the invention of Dr August Nagel of the Kodak AG Dr Nagel Werk in Stuttgart Kodak bought Dr August Nagel s company in December and began marketing the Kodak Retina in the summer of The first Kodak Retina camera was a Typ The mm Kodak Retina camera line remained in production until Kodak also introduced a line of American made cameras that were simpler and more economical than the Retina Argus too made a long lived range of mm cameras notably the Argus C Kodak launched format Kodachrome colour film in AGFA followed with the introduction of Agfacolor Neu later in the same year br The designations and refer to mm film in daylight loading spools that could be loaded into Contax or Leica style reusable cassettes respectively without need of a darkroom The was a daylight loading spool for the mm stereo format br br br Reflex cameras br br Reflex viewfinders both twin and single lens had been used with earlier cameras using plates and rollfilm br The first mm single lens reflex SLR was the Kine Exakta introduced in World War II interrupted development of the type After the war Exakta resumed development and the Contax S model with the now familiar pentaprism viewing feature was introduced in In the s the SLR also began to be produced in Japan by such companies as Asahi and Miranda Asahi s Pentax introduced the instant return mirror important for the popularity of SLRs until then the viewfinder on an SLR camera blanked as the mirror sprang out of the optical path just before taking the picture returning when the film was wound on Nikon s F model introduced in March was a system camera that greatly improved the quality and utility of mm format cameras encouraging professionals especially photojournalists to switch from larger format cameras to the versatile rugged and fast SLR design Numerous other film formats waxed and waned in popularity but by the s interchangeable lens SLR cameras and smaller rangefinders from expensive Leicas to point and shoot pocket cameras were all using mm film and manufacturers had proliferated br Colour films improved both for print negatives and reversal slides while black and white films offered smoother grain and faster speeds than previously available Since mm was preferred by both amateur and professional photographers makers of film stock have long offered the widest range of different film speeds and types in the format The DX film speed encoding system was introduced in the s as were single use cameras pre loaded with mm film and using plastic lenses of reasonable enough quality to produce acceptable snapshots Automated all in one processing and printing machines made mm developing easier and less expensive so that quality colour prints became available not only from photographic specialty stores but also from supermarkets drugstores and big box retailers often in less than an hour br br br From br br In a smaller format called Advanced Photo System APS was introduced by a consortium of photographic companies in an attempt to supersede film Due in part to its small negative size APS was not taken seriously as a professional format despite the production of APS SLRs In the point and shoot markets at which the format was primarily aimed it enjoyed moderate initial success but still never rivalled the market penetration of Within five years of its launch cheap digital compact cameras started becoming widely available and APS sales plummeted br While they have shifted the vast majority of their product lines to digital major camera manufacturers such as Canon and Nikon continued to make expensive professional grade mm film SLRs until recently such as the Canon EOS V discontinued in and the Nikon F discontinued in Introductory mm SLRs compact film point and shoot cameras and single use cameras continue to be built and sold by a number of makers Leica finally introduced the digital Leica M rangefinder in but continues to make its M series rangefinder film cameras and lenses A digital camera back for the Leica R SLR camera was discontinued in On March Leica discontinued the R SLR and R series lenses br br br Characteristics br br br Cassette br br Individual rolls of film are enclosed in single spool light tight metal cassettes to allow cameras to be loaded in daylight The film is clipped or taped to a spool and exits via a slot lined with flocking The end of the film is cut on one side to form a leader It has the same dimensions and perforation pitch as mm movie print film also called long pitch KS whereas mm professional motion picture camera films are always short pitch BH br Most cameras require the film to be rewound before the camera is opened Some motorized cameras unwind the film fully upon loading and then expose the images in reverse order returning the film to the cassette this protects all exposed frames except the last one or two should the camera back be accidentally opened unexposed film gets spoiled however Disposable cameras use the same technique so that the user does not have to rewind br Since the s film cassettes have been marked with a DX encoding six digit barcode pattern which identifies the manufacturer and film type and thus processing method and the number of exposures for the use of photofinishing laboratories The cassettes are also manufactured with a Camera Auto Sensing code constructed as two rows of six rectangular areas on the metal cassette surface which are either conductive or insulating representing possible film speeds eight possible film lengths and four possible values of exposure tolerance or latitude Conforming cameras detect at least some of these areas only three contacts are needed to set a light meter for the four most popular film speeds br br br Film type and speed br The film has been made in several emulsion types and sensitivities film speeds described by ISO standards Since the introduction of digital cameras the most usual films have colour emulsions of ISO to ISO Films of lower sensitivity and better picture quality and higher sensitivity for low light are for more specialist purposes There are colour and monochrome films negative and positive Monochrome film is usually panchromatic orthochromatic has fallen out of use Film designed to be sensitive to infrared radiation can be obtained both monochrome and with false colour or pseudocolour rendition More exotic emulsions have been available in than other roll film sizes br br br Image format br br The term format usually refers to a mm film format commonly known as mm format The mm format is common to higher end digital image sensors where it is typically referred to as full frame format br On film the typical cameras produce a frame where the longer dimension of the mm frame runs parallel to the length of the film The perforation size and pitch are according to the standard specification KS For each frame the film advances perforations This is specified as mm This allows for mm gaps between frames Camera models typically have different locations for the sprocket which advances the film Therefore each camera model s frame may vary in position relative to the perforations The film is approximately mm thick br Other image formats have been applied to film such as the half frame format of mm which earned some popularity in the s and the mm of the Robot cameras The successful range of Olympus Pen F cameras utilized the smaller half frame size allowing the design of a very compact SLR camera Unusual formats include the mm and mm on the early Nikon rangefinders and mm for use with some stereo cameras In the Soviet KMZ factory introduced a mm panoramic format with its Horizont camera descendants of which are called in the Roman alphabet Horizon In Hasselblad and Fuji introduced a mm panoramic format with their XPan TX camera There is also a mm format used by Tessina subminiature camera br br br Length br br The film is available in lengths for varying numbers of exposures The standard full length roll has always been exposures assuming a standard frame size Through about exposure rolls were the only shorter length with widespread availability Since then exposure rolls have been largely discontinued in favour of and exposure rolls The length of film provided includes the length required for the indicated number of exposures plus sufficient additional length for the film spoiled by being exposed to ambient light when it is drawn out of the canister across the back of the camera and securely engaged with the film advancing spool before the camera back is closed A camera that uses less than the maximum distance between the spools may be able to make one additional exposure Self loading cameras that load the film after being closed don t spoil the additional length provided for conventional loading and can make that additional length available for two or three additional exposures The same length can be available for exposures in any camera if it is loaded without exposing the film to light e g in a darkroom or a dark bag A exposure disposable camera uses a standard exposure cassette loaded in the dark br Other mostly shorter lengths have been manufactured There have been some and exposure rolls given away as samples sometimes in disposable cameras or used by insurance adjusters to document damage claims Twelve exposure rolls have been used widely in the daily press Photographers who load their own cassettes can use any length of film with thinner film base up to exposures will fit br The Ilford HP black and white film on a thin polyester base allowed exposures in a single cassette They produced special reels and tanks to allow this to be processed br br br Use in digital cameras br br Digital sensors are available in various sizes Professional DSLR cameras usually use digital image sensors which approximate the dimensions of the mm format sometimes differing by fractions of a millimetre on one or both dimensions Since Nikon has referred to their mm format by the trade mark FX Other makers of mm format digital cameras including Leica Sony and Canon refer to their mm sensors simply as full frame br Most consumer DSLR cameras use smaller sensors with the most popular size being APS C which measures around mm giving it a crop factor of Compact cameras have smaller sensors with a crop factor of around to br br br Use in smart phones br Most smartphones as of have a default aspect ratio of crop factor of Mimicking mm film in a smartphone requires cropping to a aspect ratio crop factor of For an authentic homage one can apply creative digital filters like the ones commonly used in Instagram that map the colour profile to a characteristic look Different brands of mm film would achieve the creative colour profile through a chemical process For example Fuji Velvia film gave the photo a characteristic of saturated colours under daylight high contrast and exceptional sharpness br br br Lenses br A true normal lens for mm format would have a focal length of mm the diagonal measurement of the format However lenses of mm to mm are commonly considered normal lenses for the format in mass production and popular use Common focal lengths of lenses made for the format include and mm Most commonly a mm lens is the one considered normal any lens shorter than this is considered a wide angle lens and anything above is considered a telephoto lens Even then wide angles shorter than mm is called an extreme wide angle Lenses above mm but up to about mm are called short telephoto or sometimes as portrait telephotos from mm to about mm are called medium telephotos and above mm are called long telephotos br With many smaller formats now common such as APS C lenses are often advertised or marked with their mm equivalent or full frame equivalent focal length as a mnemonic due to the historic prevalence of the mm format This equivalent is computed by multiplying a the true focal length of the lens by b the ratio of the diagonal measurement of the native format to that of the mm format br As a result a lens for an APS C mm format camera body with a focal length of mm might be described as mm mm equivalent Although its true focal length remains mm its angle of view is equivalent to that of a mm lens on a mm format mm camera Another example is the lens of the inch format Fujifilm X which is marked with its true zoom range mm but has a mm equivalent zoom range of mm br br br See also br List of color film systems br br br br br br External links br Media related to film at Wikimedia
