 asan Ibn al Haytham Latinized as Alhazen full name Ab Al al asan ibn al asan ibn al Haytham c c was a medieval mathematician astronomer and physicist of the Islamic Golden Age from present day Iraq Referred to as the father of modern optics he made significant contributions to the principles of optics and visual perception in particular His most influential work is titled Kit b al Man ir Arabic Book of Optics written during which survived in a Latin edition The works of Alhazen were frequently cited during the scientific revolution by Isaac Newton Johannes Kepler Christiaan Huygens and Galileo Galilei br Ibn al Haytham was the first to correctly explain the theory of vision and to argue that vision occurs in the brain pointing to observations that it is subjective and affected by personal experience He also stated the principle of least time for refraction which would later become the Fermat s principle He made major contributions to catoptrics and dioptrics by studying reflection refraction and nature of images formed by light rays Ibn al Haytham was an early proponent of the concept that a hypothesis must be supported by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical reasoning an early pioneer in the scientific method five centuries before Renaissance scientists he is sometimes described as the world s first true scientist He was also a polymath writing on philosophy theology and medicine br Born in Basra he spent most of his productive period in the Fatimid capital of Cairo and earned his living authoring various treatises and tutoring members of the nobilities Ibn al Haytham is sometimes given the byname al Ba r after his birthplace or al Mi r the Egyptian Al Haytham was dubbed the Second Ptolemy by Abu l Hasan Bayhaqi and The Physicist by John Peckham Ibn al Haytham paved the way for the modern science of physical optics br br br Biography br Ibn al Haytham Alhazen was born c to a family of Arab or Persian origin in Basra Iraq which was at the time part of the Buyid emirate His initial influences were in the study of religion and service to the community At the time society had a number of conflicting views of religion that he ultimately sought to step aside from religion This led to him delving into the study of mathematics and science He held a position with the title of vizier in his native Basra and became famous for his knowledge of applied mathematics as evidenced by his attempt to regulate the flooding of the Nile br Upon his return to Cairo he was given an administrative post After he proved unable to fulfill this task as well he contracted the ire of the caliph al Hakim and is said to have been forced into hiding until the caliph s death in after which his confiscated possessions were returned to him br Legend has it that Alhazen feigned madness and was kept under house arrest during this period During this time he wrote his influential Book of Optics Alhazen continued to live in Cairo in the neighborhood of the famous University of al Azhar and lived from the proceeds of his literary production until his death in c A copy of Apollonius Conics written in Ibn al Haytham s own handwriting exists in Aya Sofya MS Aya Sofya fob dated Safar A H Note br Among his students were Sorkhab Sohrab a Persian from Semnan and Abu al Wafa Mubashir ibn Fatek an Egyptian prince br br br Book of Optics br br Alhazen s most famous work is his seven volume treatise on optics Kitab al Manazir Book of Optics written from to In it Ibn al Haytham was the first to explain that vision occurs when light reflects from an object and then passes to one s eyes and to argue that vision occurs in the brain pointing to observations that it is subjective and affected by personal experience br Optics was translated into Latin by an unknown scholar at the end of the th century or the beginning of the th century br This work enjoyed a great reputation during the Middle Ages The Latin version of De aspectibus was translated at the end of the th century into Italian vernacular under the title De li aspecti br It was printed by Friedrich Risner in with the title Opticae thesaurus Alhazeni Arabis libri septem nuncprimum editi Eiusdem liber De Crepusculis et nubium ascensionibus English Treasury of Optics seven books by the Arab Alhazen first edition by the same on twilight and the height of clouds br Risner is also the author of the name variant Alhazen before Risner he was known in the west as Alhacen br Works by Alhazen on geometric subjects were discovered in the Biblioth que nationale in Paris in by E A Sedillot In all A Mark Smith has accounted for full or near complete manuscripts and five fragments which are preserved in locations including one in the Bodleian Library at Oxford and one in the library of Bruges br br br Theory of optics br br Two major theories on vision prevailed in classical antiquity The first theory the emission theory was supported by such thinkers as Euclid and Ptolemy who believed that sight worked by the eye emitting rays of light The second theory the intromission theory supported by Aristotle and his followers had physical forms entering the eye from an object Previous Islamic writers such as al Kindi had argued essentially on Euclidean Galenist or Aristotelian lines The strongest influence on the Book of Optics was from Ptolemy s Optics while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen s account Alhazen s achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid the medical tradition of Galen and the intromission theories of Aristotle Alhazen s intromission theory followed al Kindi and broke with Aristotle in asserting that from each point of every colored body illuminated by any light issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point This left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation in particular every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye br What Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye He attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object for any one point on the eye only the ray that reached it directly without being refracted by any other part of the eye would be perceived He argued using a physical analogy that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye if only the perpendicular ray mattered then he had a one to one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved He later asserted in book seven of the Optics that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived as if perpendicular His arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why only perpendicular rays were perceived why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly His later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive However despite its weaknesses no other theory of the time was so comprehensive and it was enormously influential particularly in Western Europe Directly or indirectly his De Aspectibus Book of Optics inspired much activity in optics between the th and th centuries Kepler s later theory of the retinal image which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye built directly on the conceptual framework of Alhazen br Alhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines and carried out various experiments with lenses mirrors refraction and reflection His analyses of reflection and refraction considered the vertical and horizontal components of light rays separately br Alhazen studied the process of sight the structure of the eye image formation in the eye and the visual system Ian P Howard argued in a Perception article that Alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to Western Europeans writing centuries later For example he described what became in the th century Hering s law of equal innervation He wrote a description of vertical horopters years before Aguilonius that is actually closer to the modern definition than Aguilonius s and his work on binocular disparity was repeated by Panum in Craig Aaen Stockdale while agreeing that Alhazen should be credited with many advances has expressed some caution especially when considering Alhazen in isolation from Ptolemy with whom Alhazen was extremely familiar Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision but otherwise his account is very similar Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering s law In general Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy br In a more detailed account of Ibn al Haytham s contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune and Sabra Raynaud showed that the concepts of correspondence homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in Ibn al Haytham s optics But contrary to Howard he explained why Ibn al Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why by reasoning experimentally he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum s fusional area than that of the Vieth M ller circle In this regard Ibn al Haytham s theory of binocular vision faced two main limits the lack of recognition of the role of the retina and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts br br Alhazen s most original contribution was that after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical system His understanding of pinhole projection from his experiments appears to have influenced his consideration of image inversion in the eye which he sought to avoid He maintained that the rays that fell perpendicularly on the lens or glacial humor as he called it were further refracted outward as they left the glacial humor and the resulting image thus passed upright into the optic nerve at the back of the eye He followed Galen in believing that the lens was the receptive organ of sight although some of his work hints that he thought the retina was also involved br Alhazen s synthesis of light and vision adhered to the Aristotelian scheme exhaustively describing the process of vision in a logical complete fashion br His research in catoptrics the study of optical systems using mirrors was centred on spherical and parabolic mirrors and spherical aberration He made the observation that the ratio between the angle of incidence and refraction does not remain constant and investigated the magnifying power of a lens br br br Law of reflection br br Alhazen was the first physicist to give complete statement of the law of reflection He was first to state that the incident ray the reflected ray and the normal to the surface all lie in a same plane perpendicular to reflecting plane br br br Alhazen s problem br br His work on catoptrics in Book V of the Book of Optics contains a discussion of what is now known as Alhazen s problem first formulated by Ptolemy in AD It comprises drawing lines from two points in the plane of a circle meeting at a point on the circumference and making equal angles with the normal at that point This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular billiard table at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point Thus its main application in optics is to solve the problem Given a light source and a spherical mirror find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer This leads to an equation of the fourth degree This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of fourth powers where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers although he did not himself do this perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an integration where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a paraboloid Alhazen eventually solved the problem using conic sections and a geometric proof His solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in Latin translation br Later mathematicians used Descartes analytical methods to analyse the problem An algebraic solution to the problem was finally found in by Jack M Elkin an actuarian Other solutions were discovered in by Harald Riede and in by the Oxford mathematician Peter M Neumann br Recently Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories MERL researchers solved the extension of Alhazen s problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic parabolic and elliptical mirrors br br br Camera Obscura br The camera obscura was known to the ancient Chinese and was described by the Han Chinese polymath Shen Kuo in his scientific book Dream Pool Essays published in the year C E Aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his Problems but Alhazen s work contained the first clear description of camera obscura and early analysis of the device br Ibn al Haytham used a camera obscura mainly to observe a partial solar eclipse br In his essay Ibn al Haytham writes that he observed the sickle like shape of the sun at the time of an eclipse The introduction reads as follows The image of the sun at the time of the eclipse unless it is total demonstrates that when its light passes through a narrow round hole and is cast on a plane opposite to the hole it takes on the form of a moonsickle br It is admitted that his findings solidified the importance in the history of the camera obscura but this treatise is important in many other respects br Ancient optics and medieval optics were divided into optics and burning mirrors Optics proper mainly focused on the study of vision while burning mirrors focused on the properties of light and luminous rays On the shape of the eclipse is probably one of the first attempts made by Ibn al Haytham to articulate these two sciences br Very often Ibn al Haytham s discoveries benefited from the intersection of mathematical and experimental contributions This is the case with On the shape of the eclipse Besides the fact that this treatise allowed more people to study partial eclipses of the sun it especially allowed to better understand how the camera obscura works This treatise is a physico mathematical study of image formation inside the camera obscura Ibn al Haytham takes an experimental approach and determines the result by varying the size and the shape of the aperture the focal length of the camera the shape and intensity of the light source br In his work he explains the inversion of the image in the camera obscura the fact that the image is similar to the source when the hole is small but also the fact that the image can differ from the source when the hole is large All these results are produced by using a point analysis of the image br br br Refractometer br br In the seventh tract of his book of optics Alhazen described an apparatus for experimenting with various cases of refraction in order to investigate the relations between the angle of incidence the angle of refraction and the angle of deflection This apparatus was a modified version of an apparatus used by Ptolemy for similar purpose br br br Unconscious inference br br Alhazen basically states the concept of unconscious inference in his discussion of colour before adding that the inferential step between sensing colour and differentiating it is shorter than the time taken between sensing and any other visible characteristic aside from light and that time is so short as not to be clearly apparent to the beholder Naturally this suggests that the colour and form are perceived elsewhere Alhazen goes on to say that information must travel to the central nerve cavity for processing and the sentient organ does not sense the forms that reach it from the visible objects until br after it has been affected by these forms thus it does not sense color as color or light as light until after it has been affected by the form of color or light Now the affectation received by the sentient organ from the form of color or of light is a certain change and change must take place in time and it is in the time during which the form extends from the sentient organ s surface to the cavity of the common nerve and in the time following that that the sensitive faculty which exists in the whole of the sentient body will perceive color as color Thus the last sentient s perception of color as such and of light as such takes place at a time following that in which the form arrives from the surface of the sentient organ to the cavity of the common nerve br br br Color constancy br br Alhazen explained color constancy by observing that the light reflected from an object is modified by the object s color He explained that the quality of the light and the color of the object are mixed and the visual system separates light and color In Book II Chapter he writes Again the light does not travel from the colored object to the eye unaccompanied by the color nor does the form of the color pass from the colored object to the eye unaccompanied by the light Neither the form of the light nor that of the color existing in the colored object can pass except as mingled together and the last sentient can only br perceive them as mingled together Nevertheless the sentient perceives that the visible object is luminous and that the light seen in the object is other than the color and that these are two properties br br br Other contributions br The Kitab al Manazir Book of Optics describes several experimental observations that Alhazen made and how he used his results to explain certain optical phenomena using mechanical analogies He conducted experiments with projectiles and concluded that only the impact of perpendicular projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate whereas surfaces tended to deflect oblique projectile strikes For example to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet A perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not He also used this result to explain how intense direct light hurts the eye using a mechanical analogy Alhazen associated strong lights with perpendicular rays and weak lights with oblique ones The obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and the eye was in the choice of the perpendicular ray since only one such ray from each point on the surface of the object could penetrate the eye br Sudanese psychologist Omar Khaleefa has argued that Alhazen should be considered the founder of experimental psychology for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and optical illusions Khaleefa has also argued that Alhazen should also be considered the founder of psychophysics a sub discipline and precursor to modern psychology Although Alhazen made many subjective reports regarding vision there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and the claim has been rebuffed br Alhazen offered an explanation of the Moon illusion an illusion that played an important role in the scientific tradition of medieval Europe Many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the Moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky Alhazen argued against Ptolemy s refraction theory and defined the problem in terms of perceived rather than real enlargement He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects so the Moon appears close The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance Therefore the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky and further and larger on the horizon Through works by Roger Bacon John Pecham and Witelo based on Alhazen s explanation the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon with the refraction theory being rejected in the th century Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation he was not the first author to offer it Cleomedes c nd century gave this account in addition to refraction and he credited it to Posidonius c BCE Ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his Optics but the text is obscure Alhazen s writings were more widely available in the Middle Ages than those of these earlier authors and that probably explains why Alhazen received the credit br br br Scientific method br br Therefore the seeker after the truth is not one who studies the writings of the ancients and following his natural disposition puts his trust in them but rather the one who suspects his faith in them and questions what he gathers from them the one who submits to argument and demonstration and not to the sayings of a human being whose nature is fraught with all kinds of imperfection and deficiency The duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists if learning the truth is his goal is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads and attack it from every side He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency br An aspect associated with Alhazen s optical research is related to systemic and methodological reliance on experimentation i tibar Arabic and controlled testing in his scientific inquiries Moreover his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics ilm tabi i with mathematics ta alim geometry in particular This mathematical physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in Kitab al Manazir The Optics De aspectibus or Perspectivae and grounded his theories of vision light and colour as well as his research in catoptrics and dioptrics the study of the reflection and refraction of light respectively br According to Matthias Schramm Alhazen was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light spot formed by the projection of the moonlight through two small apertures onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up G J Toomer expressed some skepticism regarding Schramm s view partly because at the time the Book of Optics had not yet been fully translated from Arabic and Toomer was concerned that without context specific passages might be read anachronistically While acknowledging Alhazen s importance in developing experimental techniques Toomer argued that Alhazen should not be considered in isolation from other Islamic and ancient thinkers Toomer concluded his review by saying that it would not be possible to assess Schramm s claim that Ibn al Haytham was the true founder of modern physics without translating more of Alhazen s work and fully investigating his influence on later medieval writers br br br Other works on physics br br br Optical treatises br Besides the Book of Optics Alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject including his Risala fi l Daw Treatise on Light He investigated the properties of luminance the rainbow eclipses twilight and moonlight Experiments with mirrors and the refractive interfaces between air water and glass cubes hemispheres and quarter spheres provided the foundation for his theories on catoptrics br br br Celestial physics br Alhazen discussed the physics of the celestial region in his Epitome of Astronomy arguing that Ptolemaic models must be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where for example none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other The suggestion of mechanical models for the Earth centred Ptolemaic model greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the Ptolemaic system among the Christians of the West Alhazen s determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important however because it meant astronomical hypotheses were accountable to the laws of physics and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms br He also wrote Maqala fi daw al qamar On the Light of the Moon br br br Mechanics br In his work Alhazen discussed theories on the motion of a body br br br Astronomical works br br br On the Configuration of the World br In his On the Configuration of the World Alhazen presented a detailed description of the physical structure of the earth The earth as a whole is a round sphere whose center is the center of the world It is stationary in its the world s middle fixed in it and not moving in any direction nor moving with any of the varieties of motion but always at rest br The book is a non technical explanation of Ptolemy s Almagest which was eventually translated into Hebrew and Latin in the th and th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as Georg von Peuerbach during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance br br br Doubts Concerning Ptolemy br In his Al Shuk k al Batlamy s variously translated as Doubts Concerning Ptolemy or Aporias against Ptolemy published at some time between and Alhazen criticized Ptolemy s Almagest Planetary Hypotheses and Optics pointing out various contradictions he found in these works particularly in astronomy Ptolemy s Almagest concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets whereas the Hypotheses concerned what Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy s works He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy especially the equant failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points lines and circles br br Ptolemy assumed an arrangement hay a that cannot exist and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist F or a man to imagine a circle in the heavens and to imagine the planet moving in it does not bring about the planet s motion br Having pointed out the problems Alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in Ptolemy in a later work Alhazen believed there was a true configuration of the planets that Ptolemy had failed to grasp He intended to complete and repair Ptolemy s system not to replace it completely In the Doubts Concerning Ptolemy Alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories br br Truth is sought for itself but the truths he warns are immersed in uncertainties and the scientific authorities such as Ptolemy whom he greatly respected are not immune from error br He held that the criticism of existing theories which dominated this book holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge br br br Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets br Alhazen s The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets was written c Only one damaged manuscript has been found with only the introduction and the first section on the theory of planetary motion surviving There was also a second section on astronomical calculation and a third section on astronomical instruments Following on from his Doubts on Ptolemy Alhazen described a new geometry based planetary model describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry He kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular which required the inclusion of epicycles to explain observed motion but he managed to eliminate Ptolemy s equant In general his model didn t try to provide a causal explanation of the motions but concentrated on providing a complete geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy s model br br br Other astronomical works br Alhazen wrote a total of twenty five astronomical works some concerning technical issues such as Exact Determination of the Meridian a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the Milky Way Alhazen made the first systematic effort of evaluating the Milky Way s parallax combining Ptolemy s data and his own He concluded that the parallax is probably very much smaller than Lunar parallax and the Milky way should be a celestial object Though he was not the first who argued that the Milky Way does not belong to the atmosphere he is the first who did quantitative analysis for the claim br The fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory including the Doubts and Model of the Motions discussed above br br br Mathematical works br br In mathematics Alhazen built on the mathematical works of Euclid and Thabit ibn Qurra and worked on the beginnings of the link between algebra and geometry Alhazen made developments in conic sections and number theory br He developed a formula for summing the first natural numbers using a geometric proof to prove the formula br br br Geometry br br Alhazen explored what is now known as the Euclidean parallel postulate the fifth postulate in Euclid s Elements using a proof by contradiction and in effect introducing the concept of motion into geometry He formulated the Lambert quadrilateral which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the Ibn al Haytham Lambert quadrilateral He was criticised by Omar Khayyam who pointed that Aristotle had condemned the use of motion in geometry br In elementary geometry Alhazen attempted to solve the problem of squaring the circle using the area of lunes crescent shapes but later gave up on the impossible task The two lunes formed from a right triangle by erecting a semicircle on each of the triangle s sides inward for the hypotenuse and outward for the other two sides are known as the lunes of Alhazen they have the same total area as the triangle itself br br br Number theory br Alhazen s contributions to number theory include his work on perfect numbers In his Analysis and Synthesis he may have been the first to state that every even perfect number is of the form n n where n is prime but he was not able to prove this result Euler later proved it in the th century and it is now called the Euclid Euler theorem br Alhazen solved problems involving congruences using what is now called Wilson s theorem In his Opuscula Alhazen considers the solution of a system of congruences and gives two general methods of solution His first method the canonical method involved Wilson s theorem while his second method involved a version of the Chinese remainder theorem br br br Calculus br Alhazen discovered the sum formula for the fourth power using a method that could be generally used to determine the sum for any integral power He used this to find the volume of a paraboloid He could find the integral formula for any polynomial without having developed a general formula br br br Other works br br br Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals br Alhazen also wrote a Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals although no copies have survived It appears to have been concerned with the question of whether animals could react to music for example whether a camel would increase or decrease its pace br br br Engineering br In engineering one account of his career as a civil engineer has him summoned to Egypt by the Fatimid Caliph Al Hakim bi Amr Allah to regulate the flooding of the Nile River He carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual inundation of the Nile River and he drew plans for building a dam at the site of the modern day Aswan Dam His field work however later made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme and he soon feigned madness so he could avoid punishment from the Caliph br br br Philosophy br In his Treatise on Place Alhazen disagreed with Aristotle s view that nature abhors a void and he used geometry in an attempt to demonstrate that place al makan is the imagined three dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body Abd el latif a supporter of Aristotle s philosophical view of place later criticized the work in Fi al Radd ala Ibn al Haytham fi al makan A refutation of Ibn al Haytham s place for its geometrization of place br Alhazen also discussed space perception and its epistemological implications in his Book of Optics In tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience Alhazen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and therefore the autonomy of vision Without tangible notions of distance and size for br correlation sight can tell us next to nothing about such things br br br Theology br Alhazen was a Muslim and most sources report that he was a Sunni and a follower of the Ash ari school Ziauddin Sardar says that some of the greatest Muslim scientists such as Ibn al Haytham and Ab Rayh n al B r n who were pioneers of the scientific method were themselves followers of the Ash ari school of Islamic theology Like other Ash arites who believed that faith or taqlid should apply only to Islam and not to any ancient Hellenistic authorities Ibn al Haytham s view that taqlid should apply only to prophets of Islam and not to any other authorities formed the basis for much of his scientific skepticism and criticism against Ptolemy and other ancient authorities in his Doubts Concerning Ptolemy and Book of Optics br Alhazen wrote a work on Islamic theology in which he discussed prophethood and developed a system of philosophical criteria to discern its false claimants in his time br He also wrote a treatise entitled Finding the Direction of Qibla by Calculation in which he discussed finding the Qibla where prayers salat are directed towards mathematically br There are occasional references to theology or religious sentiment in his technical works e g br in Doubts Concerning Ptolemy br br Truth is sought for its own sake Finding the truth is difficult and the road to it is rough For the truths are plunged in obscurity God however has not preserved the scientist from error and has not safeguarded science from shortcomings and faults If this had been the case scientists would not have disagreed upon any point of science br In The Winding Motion br br From the statements made by the noble Shaykh it is clear that he believes in Ptolemy s words in everything he says without relying on a demonstration or calling on a proof but by pure imitation taqlid that is how experts in the prophetic tradition have faith in Prophets may the blessing of God be upon them But it is not the way that mathematicians have faith in specialists in the demonstrative sciences br Regarding the relation of objective truth and God br br I constantly sought knowledge and truth and it became my belief that for gaining access to the effulgence and closeness to God there is no better way than that of searching for truth and knowledge br br br Legacy br br Alhazen made significant contributions to optics number theory geometry astronomy and natural philosophy Alhazen s work on optics is credited with contributing a new emphasis on experiment br His main work Kitab al Manazir Book of Optics was known in the Muslim world mainly but not exclusively through the thirteenth century commentary by Kam l al D n al F ris the Tanq al Man ir li dhaw l ab r wa l ba ir In al Andalus it was used by the eleventh century prince of the Banu Hud dynasty of Zaragossa and author of an important mathematical text al Mu taman ibn H d A Latin translation of the Kitab al Manazir was made probably in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century This translation was read by and greatly influenced a number of scholars in Christian Europe including Roger Bacon Robert Grosseteste Witelo Giambattista della Porta Leonardo da Vinci Galileo Galilei Christiaan Huygens Ren Descartes and Johannes Kepler Meanwhile in the Islamic world Alhazen s work influenced Averroes writings on optics and his legacy was further advanced through the reforming of his Optics by Persian scientist Kamal al Din al Farisi died c in the latter s Kitab Tanqih al Manazir The Revision of Ibn al Haytham s Optics Alhazen wrote as many as books although only have survived Some of his treatises on optics survived only through Latin translation During the Middle Ages his books on cosmology were translated into Latin Hebrew and other languages br H J J Winter a British historian of science summing up the importance of Ibn al Haytham in the history of physics wrote br br After the death of Archimedes no really great physicist appeared until Ibn al Haytham If therefore we confine our interest only to the history of physics there is a long period of over twelve hundred years during which the Golden Age of Greece gave way to the era of Muslim Scholasticism and the experimental spirit of the noblest physicist of Antiquity lived again in the Arab Scholar from Basra br Although only one commentary on Alhazen s optics has survived the Islamic Middle Ages Geoffrey Chaucer mentions the work in The Canterbury Tales br br The impact crater Alhazen on the Moon is named in his honour as was the asteroid Alhazen In honour of Alhazen the Aga Khan University Pakistan named its Ophthalmology endowed chair as The Ibn e Haitham Associate Professor and Chief of Ophthalmology br The International Year of Light celebrated the th anniversary of the works on optics by Ibn Al Haytham br br br In the Hiding in the Light episode of Cosmos A Spacetime Odyssey presented by Neil deGrasse Tyson focused on the accomplishments of Ibn al Haytham He was voiced by Alfred Molina in the episode br Over forty years previously Jacob Bronowski presented Alhazen s work in a similar television documentary and the corresponding book The Ascent of Man In episode The Music of the Spheres Bronowski remarked that in his view Alhazen was the one really original scientific mind that Arab culture produced whose theory of optics was not improved on till the time of Newton and Leibniz br UNESCO declared the International Year of Light and its Director General Irina Bokova dubbed Ibn al Haytham the father of optics Amongst others this was to celebrate Ibn Al Haytham s achievements in optics mathematics and astronomy An international campaign created by the Inventions organisation titled Inventions and the World of Ibn Al Haytham featuring a series of interactive exhibits workshops and live shows about his work partnering with science centers science festivals museums and educational institutions as well as digital and social media platforms The campaign also produced and released the short educational film Inventions and
