title: Antisolar point

The antisolar point is the abstract point on the celestial sphere directly opposite the Sun from an observer s perspective This means that the antisolar point lies above the horizon when the Sun is below it and vice versa On a sunny day the antisolar point can be easily found it is located within the shadow of the observer s head Like the zenith and nadir the antisolar point is not fixed in three dimensional space but is defined relative to the observer Each observer has an antisolar point that moves as the observer changes position br The antisolar point forms the geometric center of several optical phenomena including subhorizon haloes rainbows glories the Brocken spectre and heiligenschein Occasionally around sunset or sunrise anticrepuscular rays appear to converge toward the antisolar point near the horizon However this is an optical illusion caused by perspective in reality the rays i e bands of shadow run near parallel to each other br Also around the antisolar point the gegenschein is often visible in a moonless night sky away from city lights arising from the backscatter of sunlight by interplanetary dust In astronomy the full Moon or a planet in opposition lies near the antisolar point During a total lunar eclipse the full Moon enters the umbra of Earth s shadow which the planet casts onto its atmosphere into space and toward the antisolar point br br br Anthelic point br The anthelic point is often used as a synonym for the antisolar point but the two should be differentiated br While the antisolar point is directly opposite the sun always below the horizon when the sun is up the anthelic point is opposite but at the same elevation as the sun and is therefore located on the parhelic circle There are several halo phenomena that are centered on or converge on the anthelic point such as the anthelion Wegener arcs Tricker arcs and the parhelic circle itself br br br See also br br Heiligenschein br Opposition surge br Subparhelic circle br Sylvanshine br br br
