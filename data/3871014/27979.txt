Sunlight is a portion of the electromagnetic radiation given off by the Sun in particular infrared visible and ultraviolet light On Earth sunlight is scattered and filtered through Earth s atmosphere as daylight when the Sun is above the horizon When direct solar radiation is not blocked by clouds it is experienced as sunshine a combination of bright light and radiant heat atmospheric When blocked by clouds or reflected off other objects sunlight is diffused Sources estimate a global average of between watts to watts per square meter over a hour day this figure is estimated by NASA to be about a quarter of Earth s average total solar irradiance br The ultraviolet radiation in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects as it is both a requisite for vitamin D synthesis and a mutagen br Sunlight takes about minutes to reach Earth from the surface of the Sun A photon starting at the center of the Sun and changing direction every time it encounters a charged particle would take between and years to get to the surface br Sunlight is a key factor in photosynthesis the process used by plants and other autotrophic organisms to convert light energy normally from the Sun into chemical energy that can be used to synthesize carbohydrates and fuel the organisms activities br Daylighting is the natural lighting of interior spaces by admitting sunlight br Solar irradiance is the solar energy available from sunlight br br br Measurement br Researchers can measure the intensity of sunlight using a sunshine recorder pyranometer or pyrheliometer To calculate the amount of sunlight reaching the ground both the eccentricity of Earth s elliptic orbit and the attenuation by Earth s atmosphere have to be taken into account The extraterrestrial solar illuminance Eext

and therefore the maximum Eext occurs around January each year The value of is determined knowing that the ratio between the perihelion AU squared and the aphelion AU squared should be approximately

airmass The atmospheric extinction brings the number of lux down to around lux br The total amount of energy received at ground level from the Sun at the zenith depends on the distance to the Sun and thus on the time of year It is about higher than average in January and lower in July see below If the extraterrestrial solar radiation is watts per square meter the value when the Earth Sun distance is astronomical unit then the direct sunlight at Earth s surface when the Sun is at the zenith is about W m but the total amount direct and indirect from the atmosphere hitting the ground is around W m In terms of energy sunlight at Earth s surface is around to percent infrared above nm to percent visible to nm and to percent ultraviolet below nm At the top of the atmosphere sunlight is about more intense having about ultraviolet UV with most of the extra UV consisting of biologically damaging short wave ultraviolet br Direct sunlight has a luminous efficacy of about lumens per watt of radiant flux This is higher than the efficacy of source of artificial lighting other than LEDs which means using sunlight for illumination heats up a room less than fluorescent or incandescent lighting Multiplying the figure of watts per square meter by lumens per watt indicates that bright sunlight provides an illuminance of approximately lux lumens per square meter on a perpendicular surface at sea level The illumination of a horizontal surface will be considerably less than this if the Sun is not very high in the sky Averaged over a day the highest amount of sunlight on a horizontal surface occurs in January at the South Pole see insolation br Dividing the irradiance of W m by the size of the Sun s disk in steradians gives an average radiance of MW per square metre per steradian However the radiance at the center of the sun s disk is somewhat higher than the average over the whole disk due to limb darkening Multiplying this by gives an upper limit to the irradiance which can be focused on a surface using mirrors MW m br br br Composition and power br br The spectrum of the Sun s solar radiation can be compared to that of a black body with a temperature of about K see graph The Sun emits EM radiation across most of the electromagnetic spectrum Although the radiation created in the solar core consists mostly of x rays internal absorption and thermalization convert these super high energy photons to lower energy photons before they reach the Sun s surface and are emitted out into space As a result the photosphere of the Sun does not emit much X radiation solar X rays although it does emit such hard radiations as X rays and even gamma rays during solar flares The quiet non flaring Sun including its corona emits a broad range br of wavelengths X rays ultraviolet visible light infrared and radio waves Different depths in the photosphere have different temperatures and this partially explains the deviations from a black body spectrum br There is also a flux of gamma rays from the quiescent sun obeying a power law between and TeV Some gamma rays are caused by cosmic rays interacting with the solar atmosphere but this does not explain these findings br The only direct signature of the nuclear processes in the core of the Sun is via the very weakly interacting neutrinos br br Although the solar corona is a source of extreme ultraviolet and X ray radiation these rays make up only a very small amount of the power output of the Sun see spectrum at right The spectrum of nearly all solar electromagnetic radiation striking the Earth s atmosphere spans a range of nm to about mm nm This band of significant radiation power can be divided into five regions in increasing order of wavelengths br br Ultraviolet C or UVC range which spans a range of to nm The term ultraviolet refers to the fact that the radiation is at higher frequency than violet light and hence also invisible to the human eye Due to absorption by the atmosphere very little reaches Earth s surface This spectrum of radiation has germicidal properties as used in germicidal lamps br Ultraviolet B or UVB range spans to nm It is also greatly absorbed by the Earth s atmosphere and along with UVC causes the photochemical reaction leading to the production of the ozone layer It directly damages DNA and causes sunburn In addition to this short term effect it enhances skin ageing and significantly promotes the development of skin cancer but is also required for vitamin D synthesis in the skin of mammals br Ultraviolet A or UVA spans to nm This band was once held to be less damaging to DNA and hence is used in cosmetic artificial sun tanning tanning booths and tanning beds and PUVA therapy for psoriasis However UVA is now known to cause significant damage to DNA via indirect routes formation of free radicals and reactive oxygen species and can cause cancer br Visible range or light spans to nm As the name suggests this range is visible to the naked eye It is also the strongest output range of the Sun s total irradiance spectrum br Infrared range that spans nm to nm mm It comprises an important part of the electromagnetic radiation that reaches Earth Scientists divide the infrared range into three types on the basis of wavelength br Infrared A nm to nm br Infrared B nm to nm br Infrared C nm to mm br br br Published tables br Tables of direct solar radiation on various slopes from to degrees north latitude in calories per square centimetre issued in and published by Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experiment Station Forest Service U S Department of Agriculture Portland Oregon USA appear on the web br br br Intensity in the Solar System br br Different bodies of the Solar System receive light of an intensity inversely proportional to the square of their distance from Sun br A table comparing the amount of solar radiation received by each planet in the Solar System at the top of its atmosphere br br The actual brightness of sunlight that would be observed at the surface also depends on the presence and composition of an atmosphere For example Venus s thick atmosphere reflects more than of the solar light it receives The actual illumination of the surface is about lux comparable to that on Earth in the daytime with overcast clouds br Sunlight on Mars would be more or less like daylight on Earth during a slightly overcast day and as can be seen in the pictures taken by the rovers there is enough diffuse sky radiation that shadows would not seem particularly dark Thus it would give perceptions and feel very much like Earth daylight The spectrum on the surface is slightly redder than that on Earth due to scattering by reddish dust in the Martian atmosphere br For comparison sunlight on Saturn is slightly brighter than Earth sunlight at the average sunset or sunrise Even on Pluto the sunlight would still be bright enough to almost match the average living room To see sunlight as dim as full moonlight on Earth a distance of about AU light hours is needed only a handful of objects in the Solar System have been discovered that are known to orbit farther than such a distance among them Sedna and OO br br br Variations in solar irradiance br br br Seasonal and orbital variation br br On Earth the solar radiation varies with the angle of the Sun above the horizon with longer sunlight duration at high latitudes during summer varying to no sunlight at all in winter near the pertinent pole When the direct radiation is not blocked by clouds it is experienced as sunshine The warming of the ground and other objects depends on the absorption of the electromagnetic radiation in the form of heat br The amount of radiation intercepted by a planetary body varies inversely with the square of the distance between the star and the planet Earth s orbit and obliquity change with time over thousands of years sometimes forming a nearly perfect circle and at other times stretching out to an orbital eccentricity of currently As the orbital eccentricity changes the average distance from the Sun the semimajor axis does not significantly vary and so the total insolation over a year remains almost

constant br br br If we assume the solar radiation power P as a constant over time and the solar irradiation given by the inverse square law we obtain also the average insolation as a constant However the seasonal and latitudinal distribution and intensity of solar radiation received at Earth s surface does vary The effect of Sun angle on climate results in the change in solar energy in summer and winter For example at latitudes of degrees this can vary by more than as a result of Earth s orbital variation Because changes in winter and summer tend to offset the change in the annual average insolation at any given location is near zero but the redistribution of energy between summer and winter does strongly affect the intensity of seasonal cycles Such changes associated with the redistribution of solar energy are considered a likely cause for the coming and going of recent ice ages see Milankovitch cycles br br br Solar intensity variation br br Space based observations of solar irradiance started in These measurements show that the solar constant is not constant It varies on many time scales including the year sunspot solar cycle When going further back in time one has to rely on irradiance reconstructions using sunspots for the past years or cosmogenic radionuclides for going back years br Such reconstructions have been done These studies show that in addition to the solar irradiance variation with the solar cycle the Schwabe cycle the solar activity varies with longer cycles such as the proposed year Gleisberg cycle year DeVries cycle and year Eddy cycle br br br Solar irradiance br br br Solar constant br br The solar constant is a measure of flux density is the amount of incoming solar electromagnetic radiation per unit area that would be incident on a plane perpendicular to the rays at a distance of one astronomical unit AU roughly the mean distance from the Sun to Earth The solar constant includes all types of solar radiation not just the visible light Its average value was thought to be approximately W m varying slightly with solar activity but recent recalibrations of the relevant satellite observations indicate a value closer to W m is more realistic br br br Total solar irradiance TSI and spectral solar irradiance SSI upon Earth br br Since a series of overlapping NASA and ESA satellite experiments have measured total solar irradiance TSI the amount of solar radiation received at the top of Earth s atmosphere as kilo watts per square meter kW m TSI observations continue with the ACRIMSAT ACRIM SOHO VIRGO and SORCE TIM satellite experiments Observations have revealed variation of TSI on many timescales including the solar magnetic cycle and many shorter periodic cycles TSI provides the energy that drives Earth s climate so continuation of the TSI time series database is critical to understanding the role of solar variability in climate change br Since the SORCE Spectral Irradiance Monitor SIM has monitored Spectral solar irradiance SSI the spectral distribution of the TSI Data indicate that SSI at UV ultraviolet wavelength corresponds in a less clear and probably more complicated fashion with Earth s climate responses than earlier assumed fueling broad avenues of new research in the connection of the Sun and stratosphere troposphere biosphere ocean and Earth s climate br br br Surface illumination and spectrum br br The spectrum of surface illumination depends upon solar elevation due to atmospheric effects with the blue spectral component dominating during twilight before and after sunrise and sunset respectively and red dominating during sunrise and sunset These effects are apparent in natural light photography where the principal source of illumination is sunlight as mediated by the atmosphere br While the color of the sky is usually determined by Rayleigh scattering an exception occurs at sunset and twilight Preferential absorption of sunlight by ozone over long horizon paths gives the zenith sky its blueness when the sun is near the horizon br br br Spectral composition of sunlight at Earth s surface br The Sun may be said to illuminate which is a measure of the light within a specific sensitivity range Many animals including humans have a sensitivity range of approximately nm and given optimal conditions the absorption and scattering by Earth s atmosphere produces illumination that approximates an equal energy illuminant for most of this range The useful range for color vision in humans for example is approximately nm Aside from effects that arise at sunset and sunrise the spectral composition changes primarily in respect to how directly sunlight is able to illuminate When illumination is indirect Rayleigh scattering in the upper atmosphere will lead blue wavelengths to dominate Water vapour in the lower atmosphere produces further scattering and ozone dust and water particles will also absorb particular wavelengths br br br Life on Earth br br The existence of nearly all life on Earth is fueled by light from the Sun Most autotrophs such as plants use the energy of sunlight combined with carbon dioxide and water to produce simple sugars a process known as photosynthesis These sugars are then used as building blocks and in other synthetic pathways that allow the organism to grow br Heterotrophs such as animals use light from the Sun indirectly by consuming the products of autotrophs either by consuming autotrophs by consuming their products or by consuming other heterotrophs The sugars and other molecular components produced by the autotrophs are then broken down releasing stored solar energy and giving the heterotroph the energy required for survival This process is known as cellular respiration br In prehistory humans began to further extend this process by putting plant and animal materials to other uses They used animal skins for warmth for example or wooden weapons to hunt These skills allowed humans to harvest more of the sunlight than was possible through glycolysis alone and human population began to grow br During the Neolithic Revolution the domestication of plants and animals further increased human access to solar energy Fields devoted to crops were enriched by inedible plant matter providing sugars and nutrients for future harvests Animals that had previously provided humans with only meat and tools once they were killed were now used for labour throughout their lives fueled by grasses inedible to humans Fossil fuels are the remnants of ancient plant and animal matter formed using energy from sunlight and then trapped within Earth for millions of years br br br Cultural aspects br br The effect of sunlight is relevant to painting evidenced for instance in works of douard Manet and Claude Monet on outdoor scenes and landscapes br br Many people find direct sunlight to be too bright for comfort indeed looking directly at the Sun can cause long term vision damage To compensate for the brightness of sunlight many people wear sunglasses Cars many helmets and caps are equipped with visors to block the Sun from direct vision when the Sun is at a low angle Sunshine is often blocked from entering buildings through the use of walls window blinds awnings shutters curtains or nearby shade trees Sunshine exposure is needed biologically for the production of Vitamin D in the skin a vital compound needed to make strong bone and muscle in the body br In many world religions such as Hinduism the Sun is considered to be a god as it is the source of life and energy on Earth The Sun was also considered to be a god in Ancient Egypt br br br Sunbathing br br Sunbathing is a popular leisure activity in which a person sits or lies in direct sunshine People often sunbathe in comfortable places where there is ample sunlight Some common places for sunbathing include beaches open air swimming pools parks gardens and sidewalk cafes Sunbathers typically wear limited amounts of clothing or some simply go nude For some an alternative to sunbathing is the use of a sunbed that generates ultraviolet light and can be used indoors regardless of weather conditions Tanning beds have been banned in a number of states in the world br For many people with light skin one purpose for sunbathing is to darken one s skin color get a sun tan as this is considered in some cultures to be attractive associated with outdoor activity vacations holidays and health Some people prefer naked sunbathing so that an all over or even tan can be obtained sometimes as part of a specific lifestyle br Controlled heliotherapy or sunbathing has been used as a treatment for psoriasis and other maladies br Skin tanning is achieved by an increase in the dark pigment inside skin cells called melanocytes and is an automatic response mechanism of the body to sufficient exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun or from artificial sunlamps Thus the tan gradually disappears with time when one is no longer exposed to these sources br br br Effects on human health br br The ultraviolet radiation in sunlight has both positive and negative health effects as it is both a principal source of vitamin D and a mutagen A dietary supplement can supply vitamin D without this mutagenic effect but bypasses natural mechanisms that would prevent overdoses of vitamin D generated internally from sunlight Vitamin D has a wide range of positive health effects which include strengthening bones and possibly inhibiting the growth of some cancers Sun exposure has also been associated with the timing of melatonin synthesis maintenance of normal circadian rhythms and reduced risk of seasonal affective disorder br Long term sunlight exposure is known to be associated with the development of skin cancer skin aging immune suppression and eye diseases such as cataracts and macular degeneration Short term overexposure is the cause of sunburn snow blindness and solar retinopathy br UV rays and therefore sunlight and sunlamps are the only listed carcinogens that are known to have health benefits and a number of public health organizations state that there needs to be a balance between the risks of having too much sunlight or too little There is a general consensus that sunburn should always be avoided br Epidemiological data shows that people who have more exposure to sunlight have less high blood pressure and cardiovascular related mortality While sunlight and its UV rays are a risk factor for skin cancer sun avoidance may carry more of a cost than benefit for over all good health A study found that there is no evidence that UV reduces lifespan in contrast to other risk factors like smoking alcohol and high blood pressure br br br Effect on plant genomes br Elevated solar UV B doses increase the frequency of DNA recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco Nicotiana tabacum plants These increases are accompanied by strong induction of an enzyme with a key role in recombinational repair of DNA damage Thus the level of terrestrial solar UV B radiation likely affects genome stability in plants br br br See also br br br br br br Further reading br
