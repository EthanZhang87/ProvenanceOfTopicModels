Spanish Crist bal Col n It was conceived as a reference to all of the New World The name was later adopted by the Republic of Colombia of formed from the territories of the old Viceroyalty of New Granada modern day Colombia Panama Venezuela Ecuador and northwest Brazil br When Venezuela Ecuador and Cundinamarca came to exist as independent states the former Department of Cundinamarca adopted the name Republic of New Granada New Granada officially changed its name in to the Granadine Confederation In the name was again changed this time to United States of Colombia before finally adopting its present name the Republic of Colombia in br To refer to this country the Colombian government uses the terms Colombia and Rep blica de Colombia br br br History br br br Pre Columbian era br br Owing to its location the present territory of Colombia was a corridor of early human civilization from Mesoamerica and the Caribbean to the Andes and Amazon basin The oldest archaeological finds are from the Pubenza and El Totumo sites in the Magdalena Valley kilometers mi southwest of Bogot These sites date from the Paleoindian period BCE At Puerto Hormiga and other sites traces from the Archaic Period BCE have been found Vestiges indicate that there was also early occupation in the regions of El Abra and Tequendama in Cundinamarca The oldest pottery discovered in the Americas found in San Jacinto dates to BCE br Indigenous people inhabited the territory that is now Colombia by BCE Nomadic hunter gatherer tribes at the El Abra Tibit and Tequendama sites near present day Bogot traded with one another and with other cultures from the Magdalena River Valley A site including eight miles km of pictographs that is under study at Serran a de la Lindosa was revealed in November Their age is suggested as being years old c B C by the anthropologists working on the site because of extinct fauna depicted It was during the earliest known human occupation of the area br Between and BCE hunter gatherer tribes transitioned to agrarian societies fixed settlements were established and pottery appeared Beginning in the st millennium BCE groups of Amerindians including the Muisca Zen Quimbaya and Tairona developed the political system of cacicazgos with a pyramidal structure of power headed by caciques The Muisca inhabited mainly the area of what is now the Departments of Boyac and Cundinamarca high plateau Altiplano Cundiboyacense where they formed the Muisca Confederation They farmed maize potato quinoa and cotton and traded gold emeralds blankets ceramic handicrafts coca and especially rock salt with neighboring nations The Tairona inhabited northern Colombia in the isolated mountain range of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta The Quimbaya inhabited regions of the Cauca River Valley between the Western and Central Ranges of the Colombian Andes Most of the Amerindians practiced agriculture and the social structure of each indigenous community was different Some groups of indigenous people such as the Caribs lived in a state of permanent war but others had less bellicose attitudes br br br Colonial period br br Alonso de Ojeda who had sailed with Columbus reached the Guajira Peninsula in Spanish explorers led by Rodrigo de Bastidas made the first exploration of the Caribbean coast in Christopher Columbus navigated near the Caribbean in In Vasco N ez de Balboa accompanied an expedition to the territory through the region of Gulf of Urab and they founded the town of Santa Mar a la Antigua del Dari n in the first stable settlement on the continent Santa Marta was founded in and Cartagena in Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jim nez de Quesada led an expedition to the interior in April and christened the districts through which he passed New Kingdom of Granada In August he provisionally founded its capital near the Muisca cacicazgo of Muyquyt and named it Santa Fe The name soon acquired a suffix and was called Santa Fe de Bogot Two other notable journeys by early conquistadors to the interior took place in the same period Sebasti n de Belalc zar conqueror of Quito traveled north and founded Cali in and Popay n in from to German conquistador Nikolaus Federmann crossed the Llanos Orientales and went over the Cordillera Oriental in a search for El Dorado the city of gold The legend and the gold would play a pivotal role in luring the Spanish and other Europeans to New Granada during the th and th centuries br The conquistadors made frequent alliances with the enemies of different indigenous communities Indigenous allies were crucial to conquest as well as to creating and maintaining empire Indigenous peoples in Colombia experienced a decline in population due to conquest as well as Eurasian diseases such as smallpox to which they had no immunity Regarding the land as deserted the Spanish Crown sold properties to all persons interested in colonized territories creating large farms and possession of mines In the th century the nautical science in Spain reached a great development thanks to numerous scientific figures of the Casa de Contrataci n and nautical science was an essential pillar of the Iberian expansion In the region of New Granada along with all other Spanish possessions in South America became part of the Viceroyalty of Peru with its capital in Lima In New Granada became a separate captaincy general within the viceroyalty with its capital at Santa Fe de Bogota In the Royal Audiencia was created by a royal decree and New Granada was ruled by the Royal Audience of Santa Fe de Bogot which at that time comprised the provinces of Santa Marta Rio de San Juan Popay n Guayana and Cartagena But important decisions were taken from the colony to Spain by the Council of the Indies br br In the th century European slave traders had begun to bring enslaved Africans to the Americas Spain was the only European power that did not establish factories in Africa to purchase slaves the Spanish Empire instead relied on the asiento system awarding merchants from other European nations the license to trade enslaved peoples to their overseas territories This system brought Africans to Colombia although many spoke out against the institution The indigenous peoples could not be enslaved because they were legally subjects of the Spanish Crown To protect the indigenous peoples several forms of land ownership and regulation were established by the Spanish colonial authorities resguardos encomiendas and haciendas br However secret anti Spanish discontentment was already brewing for Colombians since Spain prohibited direct trade between the Viceroyalty of Peru which included Colombia and the Viceroyalty of New Spain which included the Philippines the source of Asian products like silk and porcelain which was in demand in the Americas Illegal trade between Peruvians Filipinos and Mexicans continued in secret as smuggled Asian goods ended up in C rdoba Colombia the distribution center for illegal Asian imports due to the collusion between these peoples against the authorities in Spain They settled and traded with each other while disobeying the forced Spanish monopoly br br The Viceroyalty of New Granada was established in then temporarily removed and then re established in Its capital was Santa F de Bogot This Viceroyalty included some other provinces of northwestern South America that had previously been under the jurisdiction of the Viceroyalties of New Spain or Peru and correspond mainly to today s Venezuela Ecuador and Panama Bogot became one of the principal administrative centers of the Spanish possessions in the New World along with Lima and Mexico City though it remained less developed compared to those two cities in several economic and logistical ways br Great Britain declared war on Spain in and the city of Cartagena quickly became a top target for the British A massive British expeditionary force was dispatched to capture the city but after achieving initial inroads devastating outbreaks of disease crippled their numbers and the British were forced to withdraw The battle became one of Spain s most decisive victories in the conflict and secured Spanish dominance in the Caribbean until the Seven Years War The th century priest botanist and mathematician Jos Celestino Mutis was delegated by Viceroy Antonio Caballero y G ngora to conduct an inventory of the nature of New Granada Started in this became known as the Royal Botanical Expedition to New Granada It classified plants and wildlife and founded the first astronomical observatory in the city of Santa Fe de Bogot In July the Prussian scientist Alexander von Humboldt reached Santa Fe de Bogot where he met with Mutis In addition historical figures in the process of independence in New Granada emerged from the expedition as the astronomer Francisco Jos de Caldas the scientist Francisco Antonio Zea the zoologist Jorge Tadeo Lozano and the painter Salvador Rizo br br br Independence br br Since the beginning of the periods of conquest and colonization there were several rebel movements against Spanish rule but most were either crushed or remained too weak to change the overall situation The last one that sought outright independence from Spain sprang up around and culminated in the Colombian Declaration of Independence issued on July the day that is now celebrated as the nation s Independence Day This movement followed the independence of St Domingue present day Haiti in which provided some support to an eventual leader of this rebellion Sim n Bol var Francisco de Paula Santander also would play a decisive role br A movement was initiated by Antonio Nari o who opposed Spanish centralism and led the opposition against the Viceroyalty Cartagena became independent in November In the United Provinces of New Granada were proclaimed headed by Camilo Torres Tenorio The emergence of two distinct ideological currents among the patriots federalism and centralism gave rise to a period of instability Shortly after the Napoleonic Wars ended Ferdinand VII recently restored to the throne in Spain unexpectedly decided to send military forces to retake most of northern South America The viceroyalty was restored under the command of Juan S mano whose regime punished those who participated in the patriotic movements ignoring the political nuances of the juntas The retribution stoked renewed rebellion which combined with a weakened Spain made possible a successful rebellion led by the Venezuelan born Sim n Bol var who finally proclaimed independence in The pro Spanish resistance was defeated in in the present territory of Colombia and in in Venezuela After the Independence War around people or of the pre war population was dead br br The territory of the Viceroyalty of New Granada became the Republic of Colombia organized as a union of the current territories of Colombia Panama Ecuador Venezuela parts of Guyana and Brazil and north of Mara n River The Congress of C cuta in adopted a constitution for the new Republic Sim n Bol var became the first President of Colombia and Francisco de Paula Santander was made Vice President However the new republic was unstable and the Gran Colombia ultimately collapsed br Modern Colombia comes from one of the countries that emerged after the dissolution of Gran Colombia the other two being Ecuador and Venezuela Colombia was the first constitutional government in South America and the Liberal and Conservative parties founded in and respectively are two of the oldest surviving political parties in the Americas Slavery was abolished in the country in br Internal political and territorial divisions led to the dissolution of Gran Colombia in The so called Department of Cundinamarca adopted the name New Granada which it kept until when it became the Confederaci n Granadina Granadine Confederation After a two year civil war in the United States of Colombia was created lasting until when the country finally became known as the Republic of Colombia Internal divisions remained between the bipartisan political forces occasionally igniting very bloody civil wars the most significant being the Thousand Days War in which Colombians lost their lives when the Liberal Party supported by Venezuela Ecuador Nicaragua and Guatemala rebelled against the Nationalist government and took control of Santander ultimately being defeated in by nationalist forces br br br th century br br The United States of America s intentions to influence the area especially the Panama Canal construction and control led to the separation of the Department of Panama in and the establishment of it as a nation The United States paid Colombia in seven years after completion of the canal for redress of President Roosevelt s role in the creation of Panama and Colombia recognized Panama under the terms of the Thomson Urrutia Treaty Colombia and Peru went to war because of territory disputes far in the Amazon basin The war ended with a peace deal brokered by the League of Nations The League finally awarded the disputed area to Colombia in June br br Soon after Colombia achieved some degree of political stability which was interrupted by a bloody conflict that took place between the late s and the early s a period known as La Violencia The Violence Its cause was mainly mounting tensions between the two leading political parties which subsequently ignited after the assassination of the Liberal presidential candidate Jorge Eli cer Gait n on April The ensuing riots in Bogot known as El Bogotazo spread throughout the country and claimed the lives of at least Colombians br Colombia entered the Korean War when Laureano G mez was elected president It was the only Latin American country to join the war in a direct military role as an ally of the United States Particularly important was the resistance of the Colombian troops at Old Baldy br The violence between the two political parties decreased first when Gustavo Rojas deposed the President of Colombia in a coup d tat and negotiated with the guerrillas and then under the military junta of General Gabriel Par s br br After Rojas deposition the Colombian Conservative Party and the Colombian Liberal Party agreed to create the National Front a coalition that would jointly govern the country Under the deal the presidency would alternate between conservatives and liberals every years for years the two parties would have parity in all other elective offices The National Front ended La Violencia and National Front administrations attempted to institute far reaching social and economic reforms in cooperation with the Alliance for Progress Despite the progress in certain sectors many social and political problems continued and guerrilla groups were formally created such as the FARC the ELN and the M to fight the government and political apparatus br Since the s the country has suffered from an asymmetric low intensity armed conflict between government forces leftist guerrilla groups and right wing paramilitaries The conflict escalated in the s mainly in remote rural areas Since the beginning of the armed conflict human rights defenders have fought for the respect for human rights despite staggering opposition Several guerrillas organizations decided to demobilize after peace negotiations in br The United States has been heavily involved in the conflict since its beginnings when in the early s the U S government encouraged the Colombian military to attack leftist militias in rural Colombia This was part of the U S fight against communism Mercenaries and multinational corporations such as Chiquita Brands International are some of the international actors that have contributed to the violence of the conflict br Beginning in the mid s Colombian drug cartels became major producers processors and exporters of illegal drugs primarily marijuana and cocaine br On July a new Constitution was promulgated The changes generated by the new constitution are viewed as positive by Colombian society br br br st century br br The administration of President lvaro Uribe adopted the democratic security policy which included an integrated counter terrorism and counter insurgency campaign The government economic plan also promoted confidence in investors As part of a controversial peace process the AUC right wing paramilitaries had ceased to function formally as an organization In February millions of Colombians demonstrated against FARC and other outlawed groups br After peace negotiations in Cuba the Colombian government of President Juan Manuel Santos and the guerrillas of the FARC EP announced a final agreement to end the conflict However a referendum to ratify the deal was unsuccessful Afterward the Colombian government and the FARC signed a revised peace deal in November which the Colombian congress approved In President Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize The Government began a process of attention and comprehensive reparation for victims of conflict Colombia shows modest progress in the struggle to defend human rights as expressed by HRW A Special Jurisdiction of Peace has been created to investigate clarify prosecute and punish serious human rights violations and grave breaches of international humanitarian law which occurred during the armed conflict and to satisfy victims right to justice During his visit to Colombia Pope Francis paid tribute to the victims of the conflict br br In June Ivan Duque the candidate of the right wing Democratic Center party won the presidential election On August he was sworn in as the new President of Colombia to succeed Juan Manuel Santos Colombia s relations with Venezuela have fluctuated due to ideological differences between the two governments Colombia has offered humanitarian support with food and medicines to mitigate the shortage of supplies in Venezuela Colombia s Foreign Ministry said that all efforts to resolve Venezuela s crisis should be peaceful Colombia proposed the idea of the Sustainable Development Goals and a final document was adopted by the United Nations In February Venezuelan president Nicol s Maduro cut off diplomatic relations with Colombia after Colombian President Ivan Duque had helped Venezuelan opposition politicians deliver humanitarian aid to their country Colombia recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid as the country s legitimate president In January Colombia rejected Maduro s proposal that the two countries restore diplomatic relations br Protests started on April when the government proposed a tax bill that would greatly expand the range of the percent value added tax The June election run off vote ended in a win for
