Color symbolism in art literature and anthropology refers to the use of color as a symbol in various cultures and in storytelling There is great diversity in the use of colors and their associations between cultures and even within the same culture in different time periods The same color may have very different associations within the same culture at any time Diversity in color symbolism occurs because color meanings and symbolism occur on an individual cultural and universal basis Color symbolism is also context dependent and influenced by changes over time Symbolic representations of religious concepts or articles may include a specific color with which the concept or object is associated br br br Common associations br br br Red br Red is a primary color across all models of

expectations for a product and communicating its key characteristics Color is the second most important element that allows consumers to identify brand packaging br br Marketers for products with an international market navigate the color symbolism variances between cultures with targeted advertising Car manufacturer Volkswagen ran a commercial in Italy with a black sheep in the middle of a larger flock symbolizing those who owned a VW Golf as unique and self assured among a crowd of others who were not In several cultures around the world a black sheep represents an outcast and is seen as something undesirable while in Italy a black sheep represents confidence and independence There are many additional variances in color symbolism between cultures Cold is symbolized by blue in East Asia the US and Sweden while warmth is symbolized by yellow in the US and by blue in The Netherlands Sometimes the meanings of colors are in stark opposition across geographic boundaries requiring products marketed to specific demographics to account for those changes across different markets For instance feminity is symbolized by blue in The Netherlands and pink in the US whereas masculinity is symbolized by blue in Sweden and the US and red in the UK and France In some instances color symbolism in marketing is constructed The sales volume of a company whose product is defined by the name of its color is susceptible to the symbolism and association of that name in one example a company selling a paint color named off white more than doubled its sales simply by renaming the same color ancient silk br br br Conceptualizations of colors cross culturally br br Color symbolism has changed over time Between the th and th centuries the color was largely related to a religious context Blue was symbolic of heaven and white of purity Today purity is still symbolized by white in Australia and the US but by blue in other countries like India Similarly the church influenced the perception of colors like crimson and purple Largely because the dyes for these colors could only be sourced from precious pigments religious figures like Madonna Cardinals and the Virgin were seen in scarlet and purple Today purple symbolizes evil and infidelity in Japan but the same is symbolized by blue in East Asia and by yellow in France Additionally the sacred color of Hindu and Buddhist monks is orange The Renaissance was also a time in which black and purple were colors of mourning Today mourning or death is symbolized by white in East Asia black in the US and blue in Iran while happiness is symbolized by white in Australia and NZ and yellow in China br There is a general disagreement over whether reactions to color and their symbolism are a result of cultural conditioning or of instinct Several studies concluded that color is part of the social learning process because of the significant symbolism within the culture High quality trustworthiness and dependability are symbolized by blue in the US Japan Korea and green and yellow in China as well as purple in China South Korea and Japan Because of these variances critical cues vary across cultures Warning signs are coded differently as a danger is symbolized by green in Malaysia and red in the US and Mexico The same color of green symbolizes envy in Belgium and the US but envy is symbolized by yellow in Germany and Russia and purple in Mexico Even the colors that denote powerful emotions vary Love is symbolized by green in Japan red and purple in China Korea Japan and the US Unluckiness is symbolized by red in Chad Nigeria and Germany Luckiness is symbolized by red in China Denmark and Argentina The traditional bridal color is red in China and white in the US Ambition and desire are symbolized by red in India br One example in which different conceptualizations of color may lead to confusion is the coloring of upward or downward trends in financial markets whereas in most of the world green or blue is used to denote an upward trend and red is used to denote a downward trend in mainland China Japan South Korea and Taiwan the reverse is true This confusion often leads to Western media outlets using incorrect or reversed headline images to accompany reports of a major economic upturn or downturn in an Asian market br br br History br br Prior to its being widely studied in a scientific context color symbolism was theorized upon by curious individuals in other humanities These early theoreticians include German polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in his Theory of Colours and Russian abstract artist Wassily Kandinsky in his Concerning the Spiritual in Art among others Although color treatises such as these are often unscientific Kandinsky for instance was heavily influenced by Theosophy they occasionally find resonance with artists philosophers and others working in softer subjects br br br See also br Color code br Color psychology br Color theory br Political color br The
