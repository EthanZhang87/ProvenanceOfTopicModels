A color solid is the three dimensional representation of a color space or model and can be thought as an analog of for example the one dimensional color wheel which depicts the variable of hue similarity with red yellow green blue magenta etc or the two dimensional chromaticity diagram also known as color triangle which depicts the variables of hue and spectral purity The added spatial dimension allows a color solid to depict the three dimensions of color lightness gradations of light and dark tints or shades hue and colorfulness allowing the solid to depict all conceivable colors in an organized three dimensional structure br br br Organization br br Vertical cross sections of various spherically shaped color solids br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Different color theorists have each designed unique color solids Many are in the shape of a sphere whereas others are warped three dimensional ellipsoid figures these variations being designed to express some aspect of the relationship of the colors more clearly The color spheres conceived by Phillip Otto Runge and Johannes Itten are typical examples and prototypes for many other color solid schematics br As in the color wheel contrasting or complementary hues are located opposite each other in most color solids Moving toward the central axis colors become less and less saturated until all colors meet at the central axis as a neutral gray Moving vertically in the color solid colors become lighter toward the top and darker toward the bottom At the upper pole all hues meet in white at the bottom pole all hues meet in black br The vertical axis of the color solid then is gray all along its length varying from black at the bottom to white at the top it is a grayscale All pure saturated hues are located on the surface of the solid varying from light to dark down the color solid All colors that are desaturated in any degree that is that they can be though of containing both black and white in varying amounts comprise the solid s interior likewise varying in brightness from top to bottom br br br Optimal color solid br The optimal color solid R sch MacAdam color solid or simply visible gamut is a type of color solid that contains all the colors that humans are able to see The optimal color solid is bounded by the set of all optimal colors br The emission or reflectance spectrum of a color is the amount of light of each wavelength that it emits or reflects in proportion to a given maximum which has the value of If the emission or reflectance spectrum of a color is or across the entire visible spectrum and it has no more than two transitions between and or and then it is an optimal color With the current state of technology we are unable to produce any material or pigment with these properties br Thus two types of optimal color spectra are possible Either the transition goes from zero at both ends of the spectrum to one in the middle as shown in the image at right or it goes from one at the ends to zero in the middle The first type produces colors that are similar to the spectral colors and follow roughly the horseshoe shaped portion of the CIE xy chromaticity diagram the spectral locus but are generally more chromatic although less spectrally pure The second type produces colors that are similar to but generally more chromatic and less spectrally pure than the colors on the straight line in the CIE xy chromaticity diagram the line of purples leading to magenta or purple like colors br br In optimal color solids the colors of the visible spectrum are theoretically black because their emission or reflection spectrum is in only one wavelength and in all of the other infinite visible wavelengths that there are meaning that they have a lightness of with respect to white and will also have chroma but of course of spectral purity In short In optimal color solids spectral colors are equivalent to black lightness chroma but have full spectral purity they are located in the horseshoe shaped spectral locus of the chromaticiy diagram br In linear color spaces that contain all colors visible by humans such as LMS or CIE XYZ the set of half lines that start at the origin black and pass through all the points that represent the colors of the visible spectrum and the portion of a plane that passes through the violet half line and the red half line both ends of the visible spectrum generate the spectrum cone The black point coordinates of the optimal color solid and only the black point is tangent to the spectrum cone and the white point only the white point is tangent to the inverted spectrum cone with the inverted spectrum cone being symmetrical to the spectrum cone with respect to the middle gray point This means that in linear color spaces the optimal color solid is centrally symmetric br In most color spaces the surface of the optimal color solid is smooth except for two points black and white and two sharp edges the warm edge which goes from black to red to orange to yellow to white and the cold edge which goes from black to blue to cyan to white This is due to the following If the portion of the emission or reflection spectrum of a color is spectral red which is located at one end of the spectrum it will be seen as black If the size of the portion of total emission or reflectance is increased now covering from the red end of the spectrum to the yellow wavelengths it will be seen as red If the portion is expanded even more covering the green wavelengths it will be seen as orange or yellow If it is expanded even more it will cover more wavelengths than the yellow semichrome does approaching white until it is reached when the full spectrum is emitted or reflected The described process is called cumulation Cumulation can be started at either end of the visible spectrum we just described cumulation starting from the red end of the spectrum generating the warm sharp edge cumulation starting at the violet end of the spectrum will generate the cold sharp edge br br br Maximum chroma colors semichromes or full colors br Each hue has a maximum chroma color also known as maximum chroma point semichrome or full color there are no colors of that hue with a higher chroma They are the most chromatic vibrant colors that we are able to see Although we are for now unable to produce them these are the colors that would be located in an ideal color wheel They were called semichromes or full colors by the German chemist and philosopher Wilhelm Ostwald in the early th century br If B is the complementary wavelength of wavelength A then the straight line that connects A and B passes through the achromatic axis in a linear color space such as LMS or CIE XYZ If the emission or reflection spectrum of a color is for all the wavelengths between A and B and for all the wavelengths of the other half of the color space then that color is a maximum chroma color semichrome or full color this is the explanation to why they were called semichromes Thus maximum chroma colors are a type of optimal color br As explained full colors are far from being monochromatic If the spectral purity of a maximum chroma color is increased its chroma decreases because it will approach the visible spectrum ergo it will approach black br In perceptually uniform color spaces the lightness of the full colors varies from around in the violetish blue hues to around in the yellowish hues The chroma of each maximum chroma point also varies depending of the hue in optimal color solids plotted in perceptually uniform color spaces semichromes like red green blue violet and magenta have a high chroma while semichromes like yellow orange and cyan have a slightly lower chroma br br In color spheres and the HSL color space the maximum chroma colors are located around the equator at the periphery of the color sphere This makes color solids with a spherical shape inherently non perceptually uniform since they imply that all full colors have a lightness of when as humans perceive them there are full colors with a lightness from around to around A perceptually uniform color solid has an irregular shape br br br History of the idea of the optimal color solid br In the beginning of the th century industrial demands for a controllable way to describe colors and the new possibility to measure light spectra initiated intense research on mathematical descriptions of colors br The idea of optimal colors was introduced by the Baltic German chemist Wilhelm Ostwald Erwin Schr dinger showed in his article Theorie der Pigmente von gr ter Leuchtkraft Theory of Pigments with Highest Luminosity that the most saturated colors that can be created with a given total reflectivity are generated by surfaces having either zero or full reflectance at any given wavelength and the reflectivity spectrum must have at most two transitions between zero and full br Schr dinger s work was further developed by David MacAdam and Siegfried R sch MacAdam was the first person to calculate precise coordinates of selected points on the boundary of the optimal color solid in the CIE color space for lightness levels from Y to in steps of units This enabled him to draw the optimal color solid at an acceptable degree of precision Because of his achievement the boundary of the optimal color solid is called the MacAdam limit br On modern computers it is possible to calculate an optimal color solid with great precision in seconds Usually only the MacAdam limit the optimal colors the boundary of the Optimal color solid are computed because all the other non optimal colors exist inside the boundary br br br Color volume br Color volume is the set of all available color at all available hue saturation lightness and brightness It s the result of a D color space or D color gamut that represent chromaticity combined with the dynamic range br The term has been used to describe HDR s higher color volume than SDR i e peak brightness of at least cd m higher than SDR s cd m limit and wider color gamut than Rec sRGB br br br Usage br The color solid can also be used to clearly visualize the volume or gamut of a screen printer the human eye etc because it gives more information about lightness than the commonly used chromaticity diagram which lacks the dimension of lightness br Artists and art critics find the color solid to be a useful means of organizing the three variables of color hue lightness or value and saturation or chroma as modelled in the HCL and HSL color models in a single schematic using it as an aid in the composition and analysis of visual art br br br See also br br Color model br Color triangle br Color wheel br br br br br br External links br
