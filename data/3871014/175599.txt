A panorama formed from Greek all view is any wide angle view or representation of a physical space whether in painting drawing photography film seismic images or D modeling The word was coined in the th century by the English Irish descent painter Robert Barker to describe his panoramic paintings of Edinburgh and London The motion picture term panning is derived from panorama br A panoramic view is also purposed for multimedia cross scale applications to an outline overview from a distance along and across repositories This so called cognitive panorama is a panoramic view over and a combination of cognitive spaces used to capture the larger scale br br br History br br The device of the panorama existed in painting particularly in murals as early as A D in those found in Pompeii as a means of generating an immersive panoptic experience of a vista br Cartographic experiments during the Enlightenment era preceded European panorama painting and contributed to a formative impulse toward panoramic vision and depiction br This novel perspective was quickly conveyed to America by Benjamin Franklin who was present for the first manned balloon flight by the Montgolfier brothers in and by the American born physician John Jeffries who had joined French aeronaut Jean Pierre Blanchard on flights over England and the first aerial crossing of the English Channel in br br br As popular spectacle br In the mid th century panoramic paintings and models became a very popular way to represent landscapes topographic views and historical events Audiences of Europe in this period were thrilled by the aspect of illusion immersed in a winding degree panorama and given the impression of standing in a new environment The panorama was a degree visual medium patented under the title Apparatus for Exhibiting Pictures by the artist Robert Barker in The earliest that the word panorama appeared in print was on June in the British newspaper The Morning Chronicle referring to this visual spectacle Barker created a painting shown on a cylindrical surface and viewed from the inside giving viewers a vantage point encompassing the entire circle of the horizon rendering the original scene with high fidelity The inaugural exhibition a View of Edinburgh specifically the view from the summit of Calton Hill was first shown in that city in then transported to London in By Barker had built The Panorama rotunda at the center of London s entertainment district in Leicester Square where it remained attracting visitors for years then closing in before being converted into the church of Notre Dame de France br br Inventor Sir Francis Ronalds developed a machine to remove errors in perspective that were created when a sequence of planar sketches was combined into a cylinder It also projected the cylindrical drawing onto the wall of the rotunda at much larger scale to enable its accurate painting The apparatus was exhibited at the Royal Polytechnic Institution in the early s br br Large scale installations enhance the illusion for an audience of being surrounded with a real landscape The Bourbaki Panorama in Lucerne Switzerland was created by Edouard Castres in The painting measures about metres in height with a circumference of meters In the same year of the Dutch marine painter Hendrik Willem Mesdag created and established the Panorama Mesdag of The Hague Netherlands a cylindrical painting more than metres high and roughly meters in diameter meters in circumference In the United States of America is the Atlanta Cyclorama depicting the Civil War Battle of Atlanta It was first displayed in and is feet high by feet circumference metres Also on a gigantic scale and still extant is the Rac awice Panorama located in Wroc aw Poland which measures metres In addition to these historical examples there have been panoramas painted and installed in modern times prominent among these is the Velaslavasay Panorama in Los Angeles California br br br Photographs br br Panoramic photography soon came to displace painting as the most common method for creating wide views Not long after the introduction of the Daguerreotype in photographers began assembling multiple images of a view into a single wide image In the late th century flexible film enabled the construction of panoramic cameras using curved film holders and clockwork drives to rotate the lens in an arc and thus scan an image encompassing almost degrees br br Pinhole cameras of a variety of constructions can be used to make panoramic images A popular design is the oatmeal box a vertical cylindrical container in which the pinhole is made in one side and the film or photographic paper is wrapped around the inside wall opposite and extending almost right to the edge of the pinhole This generates an egg shaped image with more than view br Popular in the s and s but now superseded by digital presentation software Multi image also known as multi image slide presentations slide shows or diaporamas mm slide projections onto one or more screens characteristically lent themselves to the wide screen panorama They could run autonomously with silent synchronization pulses to control projector advance and fades recorded beside an audio voice over or music track Precisely overlapping slides placed in slide mounts with soft edge density masks would merge seamlessly on the screen to create the panorama Cutting and dissolving between sequential images generated animation effects in the panorama format br br A vertical panorama or vertorama is a panorama with an upright orientation instead of a horizontal It is created using the same techniques as when making a horizontal panorama br br br VR photographs br br Digital photography of the late twentieth century greatly simplified this assembly process which is now known as image stitching Such stitched images may even be fashioned into forms of virtual reality movies using technologies such as QuickTime VR Flash Java or even JavaScript A rotating line camera such as the Panoscan allows the capture of high resolution panoramic images and eliminates the need for image stitching but immersive spherical panorama movies that incorporate a full vertical viewing angle as well as around must be made by stitching multiple images Stitching images together can be used to create extremely high resolution gigapixel panoramic images br br br Motion picture br br On rare occasions panoramic movies have been constructed for specially designed display spaces typically at theme parks world s fairs and museums Starting in Disney has created theaters for its parks and the Swiss Transport Museum in Lucerne Switzerland features a theatre that is a large cylindrical space with an arrangement of screens whose bottom is several metres above the floor Panoramic systems that are less than around also exist For example Cinerama used a very wide curved screen with three synchronized projectors and IMAX Dome OMNIMAX movies are projected on a dome above the spectators br br br Non photographic representations br Panoramic representation can be generated from digital elevation models such as SRTM In these diagrams a panorama from any given point can be generated and imaged from the data br br br See also br Circle Vision br Cyclorama br Diorama br EveryScape br Google Street View br International Panorama
