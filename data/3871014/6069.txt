A color code is a system for encoding and representing non color information with colors to facilitate communication This information tends to be categorical representing unordered qualitative categories though may also be sequential representing an ordered quantitative variable br br br History br The earliest examples of color codes in use are for long distance communication by use of flags as in semaphore communication The United Kingdom adopted a color code scheme for such communication wherein red signified danger and white signified safety with other colors having similar assignments of meaning br As chemistry and other technologies advanced it became expedient to use coloration as a signal for telling apart things that would otherwise be confusingly similar such as wiring in electrical and electronic devices and pharmaceutical pills br br br Encoded Variable br A color code encodes a variable which may have different representations where the color code type should match the variable type br br Categorical variable the variable may represent discrete values of unordered qualitative data e g blood type br Binary variables are typically treated as a categorical variable e g sex br Quantitative variable the variable represents ordered quantitative data e g age br Discrete quantitative data e g the sides of a die are sometimes treated as a categorical variable despite the ordered nature br br br Types br br The types of color code are br br Categorical the colors are unordered but are chosen to maximize saliency of the colors by maximizing color difference between all color pair permutations br Continuous the colors are ordered and form a smooth color gradient br Discrete only a subset of a continuous color code are used still ordered where each is distinguishable from the others br br br Categorical br When color is the only varied attribute the color code is unidimensional When other attributes are varied e g shape size the code is multidimensional where the dimensions can be independent each encoding separate variables or redundant encoding the same variable Partial redundancy sees one variable as a subset of another For example playing card suits are multidimensional with color black red and shape club diamond heart spade which are partially redundant since clubs and spades are always black and diamonds and hearts are always red Tasks using categorical color codes can be classified as identification tasks where a single stimulus is shown and must be identified connotatively or denotatively versus search tasks where a color stimulus must be found within a field of heterogenous stimuli Performance in these tasks is measured by speed and or accuracy br The ideal color scheme for a categorical color code depends on whether speed or accuracy is more important Despite humans being able to distinguish distinct colors along the hue dimension during comparative task evidence supports that color schemes where colors differ only by hue equal luminosity and colorfulness should have a maximum of eightcategories with optimized stimulus spacing along the hue dimension though this would not be color blind accessible The IALA recommends categorical color codes in seven colors red orange yellow green blue white and black Adding redundant coding of luminosity and colorfulness adds information and increases speed and accuracy of color decoding tasks Color codes are superior to others encoding to letters shape size etc in certain types of tasks Adding color as a redundant attribute to a numeral or letter encoding in search tasks decreased time by Fig but in unidimensional identification tasks using alphanumeric or line inclination codes caused less errors than color codes br Several studies demonstrate a subjective preference for color codes over achromatic codes e g shapes even in studies where color coding did not increase performance over achromatic coding Subjects reported the tasks as less monotonous and less inducing of eye strain and fatigue br The ability to discriminate color differences decreases rapidly as the visual angle subtends less than or mm at a viewing distance of cm so color stimulus of at least mm in diameter or thickness is recommended when the color is on paper or on a screen Under normal conditions colored backgrounds do not affect the interpretation of color codes but chromatic and or low illumination of surface color code can degrade performance br br br Criticism br Color codes present some potential problems On forms and signage the use of color can distract from black and white text br Color codes are often designed without consideration for accessibility to color blind and blind people and may even be inaccessible for those with normal color vision since use of many colors to code many variables can lead to use of confusingly similar colors Only of the colorblind can correctly name surface color codes with color categories most of which test as mildly colorblind This finding uses ideal illumination when dimmer illumination is used performance drops sharply br br br Examples br Systems incorporating color coding include br br In electricity br pair color code telecommunications wiring br Audio connectors br Video connectors br Optical fibers br Electrical wiring AC power phase neutral and grounding
