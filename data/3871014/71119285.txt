The color blue has been important in culture politics art and fashion since ancient times Blue was used in ancient Egypt for jewelry and ornament In the Renaissance blue pigments were prized for paintings and fine blue and white porcelain in the Middle Ages deep rich blues made with cobalt were used in stained glass windows In the th century the colour was often used for military uniforms and fashion br As the color that most symbolized harmony blue was chosen as the color of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union br Surveys in the US and Europe show that blue is the color most commonly associated with harmony faithfulness confidence distance infinity the imagination cold and occasionally with sadness In US and European public opinion polls it is the most popular color chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favorite color The same surveys also showed that blue was the color most associated with the masculine just ahead of black and was also the color most associated with intelligence knowledge calm and concentration br br br History and art br br br Ancient br br Blue was a latecomer among colors used in art and decoration as well as language and literature Reds blacks browns and ochres are found in cave paintings from the Upper Paleolithic period but not blue Blue was also not used for dyeing fabric until long after red ochre pink and purple This is probably due to the perennial difficulty of making good blue dyes and pigments The earliest known blue dyes were made from plants woad in Europe indigo in Asia and Africa while blue pigments were made from minerals usually either lapis lazuli or azurite br Lapis lazuli a semi precious stone has been mined in Afghanistan for more than three thousand years and was exported to all parts of the ancient world Blue glazed faience ornaments have been found to have been produced during th millennium civilization Indus Valley civilization present day India and Pakistan In Iran and Mesopotamia it was used to make jewellery and vessels In Egypt it was used for the eyebrows on the funeral mask of King Tutankhamun BC Importing lapis lazuli by caravan across the desert from Afghanistan to Egypt was very expensive Beginning in about BC the ancient Egyptians began to produce their own blue pigment known as Egyptian blue by grinding silica lime copper and alkalai and heating it to or C or F This is considered the first synthetic pigment Egyptian blue was used to paint wood papyrus and canvas and was used to colour a glaze to make faience beads inlays and pots It was particularly used in funeral statuary and figurines and in tomb paintings Blue was considered a beneficial colour which would protect the dead against evil in the afterlife Blue dye was also used to colour the cloth in which mummies were wrapped br In Egypt blue was associated with the sky and with divinity The Egyptian god Amun could make his skin blue so that he could fly invisible across the sky Blue could also protect against evil many people around the Mediterranean still wear a blue amulet representing the eye of God to protect them from misfortune Blue glass was manufactured in Mesopotamia and Egypt as early as BC using the same copper ingredients as Egyptian blue pigment They also added cobalt which produced a deeper blue the same blue produced in the Middle Ages in the stained glass windows of the cathedrals of Saint Denis and Chartres The Ishtar Gate of ancient Babylon BC was decorated with deep blue glazed bricks used as a background for pictures of lions dragons and aurochs br The ancient Greeks classified colours by whether they were light or dark rather than by their hue The Greek word for dark blue kyaneos could also mean dark green violet black or brown The ancient Greek word for a light blue glaukos also could mean light green grey or yellow The Greeks imported indigo dye from India calling it indikon They used Egyptian blue in the wall paintings of Knossos in Crete around BC It was not one of the four primary colours for Greek painting described by Pliny the Elder red yellow black and white but nonetheless it was used as a background colour behind the friezes on Greek temples and to colour the beards of Greek statues br The Romans also imported indigo dye but blue was the colour of working class clothing the nobles and rich wore white black red or violet Blue was considered the colour of mourning and the colour of barbarians Julius Caesar reported that the Celts and Germans dyed their faces blue to frighten their enemies and tinted their hair blue when they grew old Nonetheless the Romans made extensive use of blue for decoration According to Vitruvius they made dark blue pigment from indigo and imported Egyptian blue pigment The walls of Roman villas in Pompeii had frescoes of brilliant blue skies and blue pigments were found in the shops of colour merchants The Romans had many different words for varieties of blue including caeruleus caesius glaucus cyaneus lividus venetus aerius and ferreus but two words both of foreign origin became the most enduring blavus from the Germanic word blau which eventually became bleu or blue and azureus from the Arabic word lazaward which became azure br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Byzantine and Islamic br Dark blue was widely used in the decoration of churches in the Byzantine Empire In Byzantine art Jesus and the Virgin Mary usually wore dark blue or purple Blue was used as a background colour representing the sky in the magnificent mosaics which decorated Byzantine churches br In the Islamic world blue was of secondary importance to green believed to be the favourite colour of the Prophet Mohammed At certain times in Moorish Spain and other parts of the Islamic world blue was the colour worn by Christians and Jews because only Muslims were allowed to wear white and green Dark blue and turquoise decorative tiles were widely used to decorate the facades and interiors of mosques and palaces from Spain to Central Asia Lapis lazuli pigment was also used to create the rich blues in Persian miniatures br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Medieval the rise of ultramarine br In the art and life of Europe during the early Middle Ages blue played a minor role The nobility wore red or purple while only the poor wore blue clothing coloured with poor quality dyes made from the woad plant Blue played no part in the rich costumes of the clergy or the architecture or decoration of churches This changed dramatically between and in Paris when the Abbe Suger rebuilt the Saint Denis Basilica He installed stained glass windows coloured with cobalt which combined with the light from the red glass filled the church with a bluish violet light The church became the marvel of the Christian world and the colour became known as the bleu de Saint Denis In the years that followed even more elegant blue stained glass windows were installed in other churches including at Chartres Cathedral and Sainte Chapelle in Paris br Another important factor in the increased prestige of the colour blue in the th century was the veneration of the Virgin Mary and a change in the colours used to depict her clothing In earlier centuries her robes had usually been painted in sombre black grey violet dark green or dark blue In the th century the Roman Catholic Church dictated that painters in Italy and the rest of Europe consequently to paint the Virgin Mary with the new most expensive pigment imported from Asia ultramarine blue became associated with holiness humility and virtue br Ultramarine was made from lapis lazuli from the mines of Badakshan in the mountains of Afghanistan near the source of the Oxus River The mines were visited by Marco Polo in about he reported here is found a high mountain from which they extract the finest and most beautiful of blues Ground lapis was used in Byzantine manuscripts as early as the th century but it was impure and varied greatly in colour Ultramarine refined out the impurities through a long and difficult process creating a rich and deep blue It was called bleu outremer in French and blu oltremare in Italian since it came from the other side of the sea For this very reason it cost far more than any other colour and therefore became the luxury colour for the kings and princes of Europe br King Louis IX of France better known as Saint Louis became the first king of France to regularly dress in blue This was copied by other nobles Paintings of the mythical King Arthur began to show him dressed in blue The coat of arms of the kings of France became an azure or light blue shield sprinkled with golden fleur de lis or lilies Blue had come from obscurity to become the royal colour br Once blue became the color of the king it also became the color of the wealthy and powerful in Europe In the Middle Ages in France and to some extent in Italy the dyeing of blue cloth was subject to license from the crown or state In Italy the dyeing of blue was assigned to a specific guild the tintori di guado and could not be done by anyone else without severe penalty The wearing of blue implied some dignity and some wealth br Besides ultramarine several other blues were widely used in the Middle Ages and later in the Renaissance Azurite a form of copper carbonate was often used as a substitute for ultramarine The Romans used it under the name lapis armenius or Armenian stone The British called it azure of Amayne or German azure The Germans themselves called it bergblau or mountain stone It was mined in France Hungary Spain and Germany and it made a pale blue with a hint of green which was ideal for painting skies It was a favourite background colour of the German painter Albrecht D rer br Another blue often used in the Middle Ages was called tournesol or folium It was made from the plant crozophora tinctoria which grew in the south of France It made a fine transparent blue valued in medieval manuscripts br Another common blue pigment was smalt which was made by grinding blue cobalt glass into a fine powder It made a deep violet blue similar to ultramarine and was vivid in frescoes but it lost some of its brilliance in oil paintings It became especially popular in the th century when ultramarine was difficult to obtain It was employed at times by Titian Tintoretto Veronese El Greco Van Dyck Rubens and Rembrandt br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Renaissance br In the Renaissance a revolution occurred in painting artists began to paint the world as it was actually seen with perspective depth shadows and light from a single source Artists had to adapt their use of blue to the new rules In medieval paintings blue was used to attract the attention of the viewer to the Virgin Mary and identify her In Renaissance paintings artists tried to create harmonies between blue and red lightening the blue with lead white paint and adding shadows and highlights Raphael was a master of this technique carefully balancing the reds and the blues so no one colour dominated the picture br Ultramarine was the most prestigious blue of the Renaissance and patrons sometimes specified that it be used in paintings they commissioned The contract for the Madone des Harpies by Andrea del Sarto required that the robe of the Virgin Mary be coloured with ultramarine costing at least five good florins an ounce Good ultramarine was more expensive than gold in the German painter Albrecht D rer reported in a letter that he had paid twelve ducats the equivalent of g oz of gold for just g oz of ultramarine br Often painters or clients saved money by using less expensive blues such as azurite smalt or pigments made with indigo but this sometimes caused problems Pigments made from azurite were less expensive but tended to turn dark and green with time An example is the robe of the Virgin Mary in The Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints by Raphael in the Metropolitan Museum in New York The Virgin Mary s azurite blue robe has degraded into a greenish black br The introduction of oil painting changed the way colours looked and how they were used Ultramarine pigment for instance was much darker when used in oil painting than when used in tempera paintings or in frescoes To balance their colors Renaissance artists like Raphael added white to lighten the ultramarine The sombre dark blue robe of the Virgin Mary became a brilliant sky blue Titian created his rich blues by using many thin glazes of paint of different blues and violets which allowed the light to pass through which made a complex and luminous colour like stained glass He also used layers of finely ground or coarsely ground ultramarine which gave subtle variations to the blue br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Blue materials br br Blue materials have long attracted attention as colourants Early artists relied on mineral based pigments derived from lapis lazuli and ultramarine and to some extent azurite Ancient Egyptians developed a synthetic copper based pigment called Egyptian blue Medieval artists discovered that cobalt imparted deep blue colours to glasses and glazes The s witnessed the development of blue dyes and pigments derived from organic precursors These were Prussian blue and indigo The former was readily prepared in the laboratory and readily incorporated into paints It had a major impact on the art world Indigo was ideally suited for dying fabrics Vast areas were dedicated to the cultivation of indigo The latter part of the s witnessed the explosive development of synthetic organic dyes including synthetic indigo and copper phthalocyanine br br br Porcelain br In about the th century Chinese artisans abandoned the Han blue colour they had used for centuries and began to use cobalt blue made with cobalt salts of alumina to manufacture fine blue and white porcelain The plates and vases were shaped dried the paint applied with a brush covered with a clear glaze then fired at a high temperature Beginning in the th century this type of porcelain was exported in large quantity to Europe where it inspired a whole style of art called Chinoiserie European courts tried for many years to imitate Chinese blue and white porcelain but only succeeded in the th century after a missionary brought the secret back from China br Other famous white and blue patterns appeared in Delft Meissen Staffordshire and Saint Petersburg Russia br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Uniforms br In the th century Frederick William Elector of Brandenburg was one of the first rulers to give his army blue uniforms The reasons were economic the German states were trying to protect their pastel dye industry against competition from imported indigo dye When Brandenburg became the Kingdom of Prussia in the uniform colour was adopted by the Prussian army Most German soldiers wore dark blue uniforms until the First World War with the exception of the Bavarians who wore light blue br In the British uniform for naval officers was officially established as an embroidered coat of the colour then called marine blue now known as navy blue In the late th century the blue uniform became a symbol of liberty and revolution In October even before the United States declared its independence George Mason and one hundred Virginia neighbours of George Washington organized a voluntary militia unit the Fairfax County Independent Company of Volunteers and elected Washington the honorary commander For their uniforms they chose blue and buff the colours of the Whig Party the opposition party in England whose policies were supported by George Washington and many other patriots in the American colonies br When the Continental Army was established in at the outbreak of the American Revolution the first Continental Congress declared that the official uniform colour would be brown but this was not popular with many militias whose officers were already wearing blue In the Congress asked George Washington to design a new uniform and in Washington made the official colour of all uniforms blue and buff Blue continued to be the colour of the field uniform of the US Army until and is still the colour of the dress uniform br In France the Gardes Fran aises the elite regiment which protected Louis XVI wore dark blue uniforms with red trim In the soldiers gradually changed their allegiance from the king to the people and they played a leading role in the storming of the Bastille Blue became the colour of the revolutionary armies opposed to the white uniforms of the Royalists and the Austrians br Napoleon Bonaparte abandoned many of the doctrines of the French Revolution but he kept blue as the uniform colour for his army although he had great difficulty obtaining the blue dye since the British held naval control in the Atlantic and blocked the importation of indigo to France Napoleon was forced to dye uniforms with woad which had an inferior blue colour The French army wore a dark blue uniform coat with red trousers until when it was found to be a too visible target on the battlefields of World War I It was replaced with uniforms of a light blue grey colour called horizon blue br Blue was the colour of liberty and revolution in the th century but in the th it increasingly became the colour of government authority the uniform colour of policemen and other public servants It was considered serious and authoritative without being menacing In when Robert Peel established the Metropolitan Police in London he made the colour of the uniform jacket a dark almost black blue to make the policemen look different from the red coated soldiers who had on occasion been used to enforce order The traditional blue jacket with silver buttons of the London bobbie was not abandoned until the mid s when it was replaced for all but formal occasions by a jumper or sweater of the colour officially known as NATO blue br The New York City Police Department modelled after London s Metropolitan Police was established in and in they were officially given a navy blue uniform the colour they wear today br Navy blue is one of the most popular school uniform colours with the Toronto Catholic District School Board adopting a dress code policy which requires students system wide to wear white tops and navy blue bottoms br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Impressionist painting br The invention of new synthetic pigments in the th and th centuries considerably brightened and expanded the palette of painters J M W Turner experimented with the new cobalt blue and of the twenty colors most used by the Impressionists twelve were new and synthetic colours including cobalt blue ultramarine and cerulean blue br Another important influence on painting in the th century was the theory of complementary colors developed by the French chemist Michel Eugene Chevreul in and published in He demonstrated that placing complementary colors such as blue and yellow orange or ultramarine and yellow next to each other heightened the intensity of each color to the apogee of their tonality In an American physicist Ogden Rood published a book charting the complementary colors of each color in the spectrum This principle of painting was used by Claude Monet in his Impression Sunrise where he put a vivid blue next to a bright orange Sun and in R gate Argenteuil where he painted an orange Sun against blue water The colors brighten each other Renoir used the same contrast of cobalt blue water and an orange Sun in Canotage sur la Seine Both Monet and Renoir liked to use pure colors without any blending br Monet and the impressionists were among the first to observe that shadows were full of color In his La Gare Saint Lazare the grey smoke vapour and dark shadows are actually composed of mixtures of bright pigment including cobalt blue cerulean blue synthetic ultramarine emerald green Guillet green chrome yellow vermilion and ecarlate red Blue was a favourite color of the impressionist painters who used it not just to depict nature but to create moods feelings and atmospheres Cobalt blue a pigment of cobalt oxide aluminium oxide was a favourite of Auguste Renoir and Vincent van Gogh It was similar to smalt a pigment used for centuries to make blue glass but it was much improved by the French chemist Louis Jacques Th nard who introduced it in It was very stable but extremely expensive Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo Cobalt blue is a divine colour and there is nothing so beautiful for putting atmosphere around things br Van Gogh described to his brother Theo how he composed a sky The dark blue sky is spotted with clouds of an even darker blue than the fundamental blue of intense cobalt and others of a lighter blue like the bluish white of the Milky Way the sea was very dark ultramarine the shore a sort of violet and of light red as I see it and on the dunes a few bushes of prussian blue

was worn by Louis IX of France better known as Saint Louis Wearing blue implied dignity and wealth and blue clothing was restricted to the nobility Black replaced blue as the power colour in the th century when European princes and then merchants and bankers wanted to show their seriousness dignity and devoutness see Black br Blue gradually returned to court fashion in the th century as part of a palette of peacock bright colours shown off in extremely elaborate costumes The modern blue business suit has its roots in England in the middle of the th century Following the London plague of and the London fire of King Charles II of England ordered that his courtiers wear simple coats waistcoats and breeches and the palette of colours became blue grey white and buff Widely imitated this style of men s fashion became almost a uniform of the London merchant class and the English country gentleman br During the American Revolution the leader of the Whig Party in England Charles James Fox wore a blue coat and buff waistcoat and breeches the colours of the Whig Party and of the uniform of George Washington whose principles he supported The men s suit followed the basic form of the military uniforms of the time particularly the uniforms of the cavalry br In the early th century during the Regency of the future King George IV the blue suit was revolutionized by a courtier named George Beau Brummel Brummel created a suit that closely fitted the human form The new style had a long tail coat cut to fit the body and long tight trousers to replace the knee length breeches and stockings of the previous century He used plain colors such as blue and grey to concentrate attention on the form of the body not the clothes Brummel observed If people turn to look at you in the street you are not well dressed This fashion was adopted by the Prince Regent then by London society and the upper classes Originally the coat and trousers were different colors but in the th century the suit of a single colour became fashionable By the late th century the black suit had become the uniform of businessmen in England and America In the th century the black suit was largely replaced by the dark
