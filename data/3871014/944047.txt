Color printing or colour printing is the reproduction of an image or text in color as opposed to simpler black and white br or monochrome printing br br br History of color printing br Woodblock printing on textiles preceded printing on paper in both East Asia and Europe and the use of different blocks to produce patterns in color was common The earliest way of adding color to items printed on paper was by hand coloring and this was widely used for printed images in both Europe and East Asia Chinese woodcuts have this from at least the th century and European ones from very shortly after their introduction in the th century where it continued to be practiced sometimes at a very skilled level until the th century elements of the official British Ordnance Survey maps were hand colored by boys until Early European printed books often left spaces for initials rubrics and other elements to be added by hand just as they had been in manuscripts and a few early printed books had elaborate borders and miniatures added However this became much rarer after about br br br East Asia br Traditional East Asian printing of both text and images used woodblock printing effectively the same technique as woodcut in the West and printing in a number of colors by using multiple blocks each inked in a different color was known from early on br br br China br British art historian Michael Sullivan writes that the earliest color printing known in China and indeed in the whole world is a two color frontispiece to a Buddhist sutra scroll dated Color prints were also used later in the Ming Dynasty In Chinese woodblock printing early color woodcuts mostly occur in luxury books about art especially the more prestigious medium of painting The first known example is a book on ink cakes printed in and color technique reached its height in books on painting published in the seventeenth century Notable examples are Ming era Chinese painter Hu Zhengyan s Treatise on the Paintings and Writings of the Ten Bamboo Studio of and the Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden published in and and printed in five colors br br br Japan br br In Japan color woodcuts were used for both sheet prints and book illustrations though these techniques are better known within the history of prints The full color technique called nishiki e in its fully developed form spread rapidly and was used widely for sheet prints from the s on Text was nearly always monochrome and many books continued to be published with monochrome illustrations sumizuri e but the growth of the popularity of ukiyo e brought with it demand for ever increasing numbers of colors and complexity of techniques By the nineteenth century most artists designed prints that would be published in color Major stages of this development were br br Sumizuri e ink printed pictures monochrome printing using only black ink br Tan e monochrome sumizuri e prints with handcoloring distinguished by use of orange highlights using a red pigment called tan br Beni e red pictures monochrome sumizuri e prints with handcoloring distinguished by use of red ink details or highlights Should not be confused with benizuri e below br Urushi e a method in which glue was used to thicken the ink emboldening the image gold mica and other substances were often used to enhance the image further This technique was often used in combination with hand coloring Urushi e can also refer to paintings using lacquer instead of paint lacquer was very rarely if ever used on prints br Benizuri e crimson printed pictures images printed in two or three colors usually containing red and green pigments as well as black ink This printing technique should not be confused with beni e above Both beni e and benizuri e are so named for the predominant reddish colorants derived from dyes of the safflower plant beni br Nishiki e brocade pictures a method in which multiple blocks were used for separate portions of the image allowing a number of colors to be utilized to achieve incredibly complex and detailed images a separate block would be carved to apply only to the portion of the image designated for a single color Registration marks called kent were used to ensure correspondence between the application of each block br Further developments followed from refinements of technique and trends in taste For instance br br Aizuri e indigo printed pictures Murasaki e purple pictures and other styles in which a single color would be used in addition to or instead of black ink These are specialty techniques that grew in popularity in the nineteenth century though a few examples can be seen earlier br br br Europe br br Most early methods of color printing involved several prints one for each color although there were various ways of printing two colors together if they were separate Liturgical and many other kinds of books required rubrics normally printed in red these were long done by a separate print run with a red forme for each page Other methods were used for single leaf prints The chiaroscuro woodcut was a European method developed in the early th century where to a normal woodcut block with a linear image the line block one or more colored tone blocks printed in different colors would be added This was the method developed in Germany in Italy only tone blocks were often used to create an effect more like a wash drawing Jacob Christoph Le Blon developed a method using three intaglio plates usually in mezzotint these were overprinted to achieve a wide range of colors br In the th century a number of different methods of color printing using woodcut technically Chromoxylography and other methods were developed in Europe which for the first time achieved widespread commercial success so that by the later decades the average home might contain many examples both hanging as prints and as book illustrations George Baxter patented in a method using an intaglio line plate or occasionally a lithograph printed in black or a dark color and then overprinted with up to twenty different colors from woodblocks Edmund Evans used relief and wood throughout with up to eleven different colors and latterly specialized in illustrations for children s books using fewer blocks but overprinting non solid areas of color to achieve blended colors English Artists such as Randolph Caldecott Walter Crane and Kate Greenaway were influenced by the Japanese prints now available and fashionable in Europe to create a suitable style with flat areas of color br Chromolithography was another process which by the end of the th century had become dominant although this used multiple prints with a stone for each color Mechanical color separation initially using photographs of the image taken with three different color filters reduced the number of prints needed to three Zincography with zinc plates later replaced lithographic stones and remained the most common method of color printing until the s br br br Modern techniques br br br CMYK br Color printing involves a series of steps or transformations to generate a quality color reproduction The following sections focus on the steps used when reproducing a color image in CMYK printing br Any natural scene or color photograph can be optically and physiologically dissected into three primary colors red green and blue roughly equal amounts of which give rise to the perception of white and different proportions of which give rise to the visual sensations of all other colors The additive combination of any two primary colors in roughly equal proportion gives rise to the perception of a secondary color For example red and green yields yellow red and blue yields magenta a purple hue and green and blue yield cyan a turquoise hue Only yellow is counter intuitive br Yellow cyan and magenta are merely the basic secondary colors unequal mixtures of the primaries give rise to perception of many other colors all of which may be considered tertiary br While there are many techniques for reproducing images in color graphic processes and industrial equipment are used for the mass reproduction of color images on paper In this sense color printing involves reproduction techniques suited for printing presses capable of thousands or millions of impressions for publishing newspapers and magazines brochures cards posters and similar mass market items In this type of industrial or commercial printing the technique used to print full color images such as color photographs is referred to as four color process or merely process printing Four inks are used three secondary colors plus black These ink colors are cyan magenta yellow and key black abbreviated as CMYK br Cyan can be thought of as minus red magenta as minus green and yellow as minus blue These inks are semi transparent translucent Where two inks overlap on the paper due to sequential printing impressions a primary color is perceived For example yellow minus blue overprinted by magenta minus green yields red Where the three inks may overlap almost all incident light is absorbed or subtracted yielding near black but in practical terms it is better and cheaper to use a separate black ink instead of combining three colored inks The secondary or subtractive colors cyan magenta and yellow may be considered primary by printers and watercolorists whose basic inks and paints are transparent br Two graphic techniques are required to prepare images for four color printing In the pre press stage original images are translated into forms that can be used on a printing press through color separation and screening or halftoning These steps make possible the creation of printing plates that can transfer color impressions to paper on printing presses based on the principles of lithography br A method of full color printing is six color process printing for example Pantone s Hexachrome system which adds orange and green to the traditional CMYK inks for a larger and more vibrant gamut or color range However such alternate color systems still rely on color separation halftoning and lithography to produce printed images Six color printing is widely used to increase the printability and so that to increase the production br An emerging method is extended gamut printing or color printing which adds three more colors such as green orange and violet to extend the printability or gamut so that a wide range of Pantone colors also can be reproduced without changing the ink settings This method is also called OGV printing The digital inkjet printers such as EPSON SureColor series has been using this method successfully to reproduce Pantone colors br Color printing can also involve as few as one color ink or color inks which are not the primary colors Using a limited number of color inks or color inks in addition to the primary colors is referred to as spot color printing Generally spot color inks are formulations that are designed to print alone rather than to blend with other inks on the paper to produce various hues and shades The range of spot color inks much like paint is nearly unlimited and much more varied than the colors that can be produced by four color process printing Spot color inks range from subtle pastels to intense fluorescents to reflective metallics br br br Modern process br br br Color separation process br br Typically color separation is the responsibility of the color separator This includes cleaning up the file to make it print ready and creating a proof for the prepress approval process The process of color separation starts by separating the original artwork into red green and blue components for example by a digital scanner Before digital imaging was developed the traditional method of doing this was to photograph the image three times using a filter for each color However this is achieved the desired result is three grayscale images which represent the red green and blue RGB components of the original image br The next step is to invert each of these separations When a negative image of the red component is produced the resulting image represents the cyan component of the image Likewise negatives are produced of the green and blue components to produce magenta and yellow separations respectively This is done because cyan magenta and yellow are subtractive primaries which each represent two of the three additive primaries RGB after one additive primary has been subtracted from white light br Cyan magenta and yellow are the three basic colors used for color reproduction When these three colors are variously used in printing the result should be a reasonable reproduction of the original but in practice this is not the case Due to limitations in the inks the darker colors are dirty and muddied To resolve this a black separation is also created which improves the shadow and contrast of the image Numerous techniques exist to derive this black separation from the original image these include grey component replacement under color removal and under color addition This printing technique is referred to as CMYK the K stands for key a traditional word for the black printing plate br Today s digital printing methods do not have the restriction of a single color space that traditional CMYK processes do Many presses can print from files that were ripped with images using either RGB or CMYK modes The color reproduction abilities of a particular color space can vary the process of obtaining accurate colors within a color model is called color matching br br br Screening br Inks used in color printing presses are semi transparent and can be printed on top of each other to produce different hues For example green results from printing yellow and cyan inks on top of each other However a printing press cannot vary the amount of ink applied to particular picture areas except through screening a process that represents lighter shades as tiny dots rather than solid areas of ink This is analogous to mixing white paint into a color to lighten it except the white is the paper itself In process color printing the screened image or halftone for each ink color is printed in succession The screen grids are set at different angles and the dots therefore create tiny rosettes which through a kind of optical illusion appear to form a continuous tone image You can view the halftoning which enables printed images by examining a printed picture under magnification br Traditionally halftone screens were generated by inked lines on two sheets of glass that were cemented together at right angles Each of the color separation films were then exposed through these screens The resulting high contrast image once processed had dots of varying diameter depending on the amount of exposure that area received which was modulated by the grayscale separation film image br The glass screens were made obsolete by high contrast films where the halftone dots were exposed with the separation film This in turn was replaced by a process where the halftones are electronically generated directly on the film with a laser Most recently computer to plate CTP technology has allowed printers to bypass the film portion of the process entirely CTP images the dots directly on the printing plate with a laser saving money and eliminating the film step The amount of generation loss in printing a lithographic negative onto a lithographic plate unless the processing procedures are completely ignored is almost completely negligible as there are no losses of dynamic range no density gradations nor are there any colored dyes or large silver grains to contend with in an ultra slow rapid access negative br Screens with a frequency of to lines per inch lpi reproduce color photographs in newspapers The coarser the screen lower frequency the lower the quality of the printed image Highly absorbent newsprint requires a lower screen frequency than less absorbent coated paper stock used in magazines and books where screen frequencies of to lpi and higher are used br The measure of how much an ink dot spreads and becomes larger on paper is called dot gain This phenomenon must be accounted for in photographic or digital preparation of screened images Dot gain is higher on more absorbent uncoated paper stock such as newsprint br br br See also br Block printing br Flexography br Letterpress printing br Offset printing br Rotogravure br Typography br br br br br br Notes br Bruno Michael H Ed
