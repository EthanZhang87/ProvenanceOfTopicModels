title: Total internal reflection
id: 30426
In physics total internal reflection TIR is the phenomenon in which waves arriving at the interface boundary from one medium to another e g from water to air are not refracted into the second external medium but completely reflected back into the first internal medium It occurs when the second medium has a higher wave speed i e lower refractive index than the first and the waves are incident at a sufficiently oblique angle on the interface For example the water to air surface in a typical fish tank when viewed obliquely from below reflects the underwater scene like a mirror with no loss of brightness Fig br TIR occurs not only with electromagnetic waves such as light and microwaves but also with other types of waves including sound and water waves If the waves are capable of forming a narrow beam Fig the reflection tends to be described in terms of rays rather than waves in a medium whose properties are independent of direction such as air water or glass the rays are perpendicular to associated wavefronts br br Refraction is generally accompanied by partial reflection When waves are refracted from a medium of lower propagation speed higher refractive index to a medium of higher propagation speed lower refractive index e g from water to air the angle of refraction between the outgoing ray and the surface normal is greater than the angle of incidence between the incoming ray and the normal As the angle of incidence approaches a certain threshold called the critical angle the angle of refraction approaches at which the refracted ray becomes parallel to the boundary surface As the angle of incidence increases beyond the critical angle the conditions of refraction can no longer be satisfied so there is no refracted ray and the partial reflection becomes total For visible light the critical angle is about for incidence from water to air and about for incidence from common glass to air br Details of the mechanism of TIR give rise to more subtle phenomena While total reflection by definition involves no continuing flow of power across the interface between the two media the external medium carries a so called evanescent wave which travels along the interface with an amplitude that falls off exponentially with distance from the interface The total reflection is indeed total if the external medium is lossless perfectly transparent continuous and of infinite extent but can be conspicuously less than total if the evanescent wave is absorbed by a lossy external medium attenuated total reflectance or diverted by the outer boundary of the external medium or by objects embedded in that medium frustrated TIR Unlike partial reflection between transparent media total internal reflection is accompanied by a non trivial phase shift not just zero or for each component of polarization perpendicular or parallel to the plane of incidence and the shifts vary with the angle of incidence The explanation of this effect by Augustin Jean Fresnel in added to the evidence in favor of the wave theory of light br The phase shifts are used by Fresnel s invention the Fresnel rhomb to modify polarization The efficiency of the total internal reflection is exploited by optical fibers used in telecommunications cables and in image forming fiberscopes and by reflective prisms such as image erecting Porro roof prisms for monoculars and binoculars br br br Optical description br br Although total internal reflection can occur with any kind of wave that can be said to have oblique incidence including e g microwaves and sound waves it is most familiar in the case of light waves br Total internal reflection of light can be demonstrated using a semicircular cylindrical block of common glass or acrylic glass In Fig a ray box projects a narrow beam of light a ray radially inward The semicircular cross section of the glass allows the incoming ray to remain perpendicular to the curved portion of the air glass surface and then hence to continue in a straight line towards the flat part of the surface although its angle with the flat part varies br Where the ray meets the flat glass to air interface the angle between the ray and the normal perpendicular to the interface is called the angle of incidence If this angle is sufficiently small the ray is partly reflected but mostly transmitted and the transmitted portion is refracted away from the normal so that the angle of refraction between the refracted ray and the normal to the interface is greater than the angle of incidence For the moment let us call the angle of incidence i and the angle of refraction t where t is for transmitted reserving r for reflected As i increases and approaches a certain critical angle denoted by c or sometimes cr the angle of refraction approaches that is the refracted ray approaches a tangent to the interface and the refracted ray becomes fainter while the reflected ray becomes brighter As i increases beyond c the refracted ray disappears and only the reflected ray remains so that all of the energy of the incident ray is reflected this is total internal reflection TIR In brief br br If i c the incident ray is split being partly reflected and partly refracted br If i c the incident ray suffers total internal reflection TIR none of it is transmitted br br br Critical angle br The critical angle is the smallest angle of incidence that yields total reflection or equivalently the largest angle for which a refracted ray exists For light waves incident from an internal medium with a single refractive index n to an external medium with a single refractive index n the critical angle is given by br br br br br br br br c br br br br br br arcsin br br br br n br br br br br br br br br n br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle theta text c arcsin n n br br and is defined if n n For some other types of waves it is more convenient to think in terms of propagation velocities rather than refractive indices The explanation of the critical angle in terms of velocities is more general and will therefore be discussed first br br When a wavefront is refracted from one medium to another the incident incoming and refracted outgoing portions of the wavefront meet at a common line on the refracting surface interface Let this line denoted by L move at velocity u across the surface where u is measured normal to L Fig Let the incident and refracted wavefronts propagate with normal velocities br br br br br v br br br br br br br displaystyle v br br and br br br br br v br br br br br br br displaystyle v br br respectively and let them make the dihedral angles and respectively with the interface From the geometry br br br br br v br br br br br br br displaystyle v br br is the component of u in the direction normal to the incident wave so that br br br br br v br br br br br br br u br sin br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle v u sin theta br br Similarly br br br br br v br br br br br br u br sin br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle v u sin theta br br Solving each equation for u and equating the results we obtain the general law of refraction for waves br br But the dihedral angle between two planes is also the angle between their normals So is the angle between the normal to the incident wavefront and the normal to the interface while is the angle between the normal to the refracted wavefront and the normal to the interface and Eq tells us that the sines of these angles are in the same ratio as the respective velocities br This result has the form of Snell s law except that we have not yet said that the ratio of velocities is constant nor identified and with the angles of incidence and refraction called i and t above However if we now suppose that the properties of the media are isotropic independent of direction two further conclusions follow first the two velocities and hence their ratio are independent of their directions and second the wave normal directions coincide with the ray directions so that and coincide with the angles of incidence and refraction as defined above br br Obviously the angle of refraction cannot exceed In the limiting case we put and c in Eq and solve for the critical angle br br In deriving this result we retain the assumption of isotropic media in order to identify and with the angles of incidence and refraction br For electromagnetic waves and especially for light it is customary to express the above results in terms of refractive indices The refractive index of a medium with normal velocity br br br br br v br br br br br br br displaystyle v br br is defined as br br br br br n br br br br br br br c br br br br br v br br br br br br br br br displaystyle n c v br br where c is the speed of light in vacuum Hence br br br br br v br br br br br br

these substitutions in Eqs and we obtain br br and br br Eq is the law of refraction for general media in terms of refractive indices provided that and are taken as the dihedral angles but if the media are isotropic then n and n become independent of direction while and may be taken as the angles of incidence and refraction for the rays and Eq follows So for isotropic media Eqs and together describe the behavior in Fig br According to Eq for incidence from water n to air n we have c whereas for incidence from common glass or acrylic n to air n we have c br The arcsin function yielding c is defined only if n n br br br br br br v br br br br br br br v br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle v geq v br br Hence for isotropic media total internal reflection cannot occur if the second medium has a higher refractive index lower normal velocity than the first For example there cannot be TIR for incidence from air to water rather the critical angle for incidence from water to air is the angle of refraction at grazing incidence from air to water Fig br The medium with the higher refractive index is commonly described as optically denser and the one with the lower refractive index as optically rarer Hence it is said that total internal reflection is possible for dense to rare incidence but not for rare to dense incidence br br br Everyday examples br br When standing beside an aquarium with one s eyes below the water level one is likely to see fish or submerged objects reflected in the water air surface Fig The brightness of the reflected image just as bright as the direct view can be startling br A similar effect can be observed by opening one s eyes while swimming just below the water s surface If the water is calm the surface outside the critical angle measured from the vertical appears mirror like reflecting objects below The region above the water cannot be seen except overhead where the hemispherical field of view is compressed into a conical field known as Snell s window whose angular diameter is twice the critical angle cf Fig The field of view above the water is theoretically across but seems less because as we look closer to the horizon the vertical dimension is more strongly compressed by the refraction e g by Eq for air to water incident angles of and the corresponding angles of refraction are cr in Fig and indicating that the image of a point above the horizon is from the edge of Snell s window while the image of a point above the horizon is only from the edge br Fig for example is a photograph taken near the bottom of the shallow end of a swimming pool What looks like a broad horizontal stripe on the right hand wall consists of the lower edges of a row of orange tiles and their reflections this marks the water level which can then be traced across the other wall The swimmer has disturbed the surface above her scrambling the lower half of her reflection and distorting the reflection of the ladder to the right But most of the surface is still calm giving a clear reflection of the tiled bottom of the pool The space above the water is not visible except at the top of the frame where the handles of the ladder are just discernible above the edge of Snell s window within which the reflection of the bottom of the pool is only partial but still noticeable in the photograph One can even discern the color fringing of the edge of Snell s window due to variation of the refractive index hence of the critical angle with wavelength see Dispersion br br The critical angle influences the angles at which gemstones are cut The round brilliant cut for example is designed to refract light incident on the front facets reflect it twice by TIR off the back facets and transmit it out again through the front facets so that the stone looks bright Diamond Fig is especially suitable for this treatment because its high refractive index about and consequently small critical angle about yield the desired behavior over a wide range of viewing angles Cheaper materials that are similarly amenable to this treatment include cubic zirconia index and moissanite non isotropic hence doubly refractive with an index ranging from about to depending on direction and polarization both of these are therefore popular as diamond simulants br br br Evanescent wave br br Mathematically waves are described in terms of time varying fields a field being a function of location in space A propagating wave requires an effort field and a flow field the latter being a vector if we are working in two or three dimensions The product of effort and flow is related to power see System equivalence For example for sound waves in a non viscous fluid we might take the effort field as the pressure a scalar and the flow field as the fluid velocity a vector The product of these two is intensity power per unit area For electromagnetic waves we shall take the effort field as the electric field E and the flow field as the magnetizing field H Both of these are vectors and their vector product is again the intensity see Poynting vector br When a wave in say medium is reflected off the interface between medium and medium the flow field in medium is the vector sum of the flow fields due to the incident and reflected waves If the reflection is oblique the incident and reflected fields are not in opposite directions and therefore cannot cancel out at the interface even if the reflection is total either the normal component or the tangential component of the combined field as a function of location and time must be non zero adjacent to the interface Furthermore the physical laws governing the fields will generally imply that one of the two components is continuous across the interface that is it does not suddenly change as we cross the interface for example for electromagnetic waves one of the interface conditions is that the tangential component of H is continuous if there is no surface current Hence even if the reflection is total there must be some penetration of the flow field into medium and this in combination with the laws relating the effort and flow fields implies that there will also be some penetration of the effort field The same continuity condition implies that the variation waviness of the field in medium will be synchronized with that of the incident and reflected waves in medium br br But if the reflection is total the spatial penetration of the fields into medium must be limited somehow or else the total extent and hence the total energy of those fields would continue to increase draining power from medium Total reflection of a continuing wavetrain permits some energy to be stored in medium but does not permit a continuing transfer of power from medium to medium br Thus using mostly qualitative reasoning we can conclude that total internal reflection must be accompanied by a wavelike field in the external medium traveling along the interface in synchronism with the incident and reflected waves but with some sort of limited spatial penetration into the external medium such a field may be called an evanescent wave br Fig shows the basic idea The incident wave is assumed to be plane and sinusoidal The reflected wave for simplicity is not shown The evanescent wave travels to the right in lock step with the incident and reflected waves but its amplitude falls off with increasing distance from the interface br Two features of the evanescent wave in Fig are to be explained later first that the evanescent wave crests are perpendicular to the interface and second that the evanescent wave is slightly ahead of the incident wave br br br Frustrated total internal reflection FTIR br If the internal reflection is to be total there must be no diversion of the evanescent wave Suppose for example that electromagnetic waves incident from glass with a higher refractive index to air with a lower refractive index at a certain angle of incidence are subject to TIR And suppose that we have a third medium often identical to the first whose refractive index is sufficiently high that if the third medium were to replace the second we would get a standard transmitted wavetrain for the same angle of incidence Then if the third medium is brought within a distance of a few wavelengths from the surface of the first medium where the evanescent wave has significant amplitude in the second medium then the evanescent wave is effectively refracted into the third medium giving non zero transmission into the third medium and therefore less than total reflection back into the first medium As the amplitude of the evanescent wave decays across the air gap the transmitted waves are attenuated so that there is less transmission and therefore more reflection than there would be with no gap but as long as there is some transmission the reflection is less than total This phenomenon is called frustrated total internal reflection where frustrated negates total abbreviated frustrated TIR or FTIR br br Frustrated TIR can be observed by looking into the top of a glass of water held in one s hand Fig If the glass is held loosely contact may not be sufficiently close and widespread to produce a noticeable effect But if it is held more tightly the ridges of one s fingerprints interact strongly with the evanescent waves allowing the ridges to be seen through the otherwise totally reflecting glass air surface br The same effect can be demonstrated with microwaves using paraffin wax as the internal medium where the incident and reflected waves exist In this case the permitted gap width might be e g cm or several cm which is easily observable and adjustable br The term frustrated TIR also applies to the case in which the evanescent wave is scattered by an object sufficiently close to the reflecting interface This effect together with the strong dependence of the amount of scattered light on the distance from the interface is exploited in total internal reflection microscopy br The mechanism of FTIR is called evanescent wave coupling and is a good analog to visualize quantum tunneling Due to the wave nature of matter an electron has a non zero probability of tunneling through a barrier even if classical mechanics would say that its energy is insufficient Similarly due to the wave nature of light a photon has a non zero probability of crossing a gap even if ray optics would say that its approach is too oblique br Another reason why internal reflection may be less than total even beyond the critical angle is that the external medium may be lossy less than perfectly transparent in which case the external medium will absorb energy from the evanescent wave so that the maintenance of the evanescent wave will draw power from the incident wave The consequent less than total reflection is called attenuated total reflectance ATR This effect and especially the frequency dependence of the absorption can be used to study the composition of an unknown external medium br br br Derivation of evanescent wave br In a uniform plane sinusoidal electromagnetic wave the electric field E has the form br br where Ek is the constant complex amplitude vector i is the imaginary unit k is the wave vector whose magnitude k is the angular wavenumber r is the position vector is the angular frequency t is time and it is understood that the real part of the expression is the physical field The magnetizing field H has the same form with the same k and The value of the expression is unchanged if the position r varies in a direction normal to k hence k is normal to the wavefronts br If is the component of r in the direction of k the field can be written br br br br br br E br br k br br br br br e br br i br br k br

br From the electric field in the external medium has the form br br where kt is the wave vector for the transmitted wave we assume isotropic media but the transmitted wave is not yet assumed to be evanescent br br In Cartesian coordinates x y z let the region y have refractive index n and let the region y have refractive index n Then the xz plane is the interface and the y axis is normal to the interface Fig Let i and j in bold roman type be the unit vectors in the x and y directions respectively Let the plane of incidence containing the incident wave normal and the normal to the interface be the xy plane the plane of the page with the angle of incidence i measured from j towards i Let the angle of refraction measured in the same sense be t t for transmitted reserving r for reflected br From the transmitted wave vector kt has magnitude n k Hence from the geometry br br where the last step uses Snell s law Taking the dot product with the position vector we get br br so that Eq becomes br br In the case of TIR the angle t does not exist in the usual sense But we can still interpret for the transmitted evanescent wave by allowing cos t to be complex This becomes necessary when we write cos t in terms of sin t and thence in terms of sin i using Snell s law br br For i greater than the critical angle the value under the square root symbol is negative so that br br To determine which sign is applicable we substitute into obtaining br br where the undetermined sign is the opposite of that in For an evanescent transmitted wave that is one whose amplitude decays as y increases the undetermined sign in must be minus so the undetermined sign in must be plus br With the correct sign the result can be abbreviated br br where br br and k is the wavenumber in vacuum i e br br br br br br br br br c br br br br br displaystyle omega c br br br So the evanescent wave is a plane sinewave traveling in the x direction with an amplitude that decays exponentially in the y direction cf Fig It is evident that the energy stored in this wave likewise travels in the x direction and does not cross the interface Hence the Poynting vector generally has a component in the x direction but its y component averages to zero although its instantaneous y component is not identically zero br br Eq indicates that the amplitude of the evanescent wave falls off by a factor e as the coordinate y measured from the interface increases by the distance br br br br d br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle d kappa br br commonly called the penetration depth of the evanescent wave Taking

br br br displaystyle n n br br Fig As i decreases towards the critical angle the denominator approaches zero so that d increases without limit as is to be expected because as soon as i is less than critical uniform plane waves are permitted in the external medium As i approaches grazing incidence d approaches a minimum br br For incidence from water to air or common glass to air dmin is not much different from But d is larger at smaller angles of incidence Fig and the amplitude may still be significant at distances of several times d for example because e is just greater than the evanescent wave amplitude within a distance d of the interface is at least of its value at the interface Hence speaking loosely we tend to say that the evanescent wave amplitude is significant within a few wavelengths of the interface br br br Phase shifts br Between and Augustin Jean Fresnel discovered that total internal reflection is accompanied by a non trivial phase shift that is a phase shift that is not restricted to or as the Fresnel reflection coefficient acquires a non zero imaginary part We shall now explain this effect for electromagnetic waves in the case of linear homogeneous isotropic non magnetic media The phase shift turns out to be an advance which grows as the incidence angle increases beyond the critical angle but which depends on the polarization of the incident wave br In equations and we advance the phase by the angle if we replace t by t that is if we replace t by t with the result that the complex field is multiplied by e i So a phase advance is equivalent to multiplication by a complex constant with a negative argument This becomes more obvious when e g the field is factored as br br br br br br E br br k br br br br br e br br i br br k br br r br br br br br e br br br i br br t br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbf E k e i mathbf k cdot r e i omega t br br where the last factor contains the time dependence br To represent the polarization of the incident reflected or transmitted wave the electric field adjacent to an interface can be resolved into two perpendicular components known as the s and p components which are parallel to the surface and the plane of incidence respectively in other words the s and p components are respectively square and parallel to the plane of incidence br For each component of polarization the incident reflected or transmitted electric field E in Eq has a certain direction and can be represented by its complex scalar component in that direction The reflection or transmission coefficient can then be defined as a ratio of complex components at the same point or at infinitesimally separated points on opposite sides of the interface But in order to fix the signs of the coefficients we must choose positive senses for the directions For the s components the obvious choice is to say that the positive directions of the incident reflected and transmitted fields are all the same e g the z direction in Fig For the p components this article adopts the convention that the positive directions of the incident reflected and transmitted fields are inclined towards the same medium that is towards the same side of the interface e g like the red arrows in Fig But the reader should be warned that some books use a different convention for the p components causing a different sign in the resulting formula for the reflection coefficient br For the s polarization let the reflection and transmission coefficients be rs and ts respectively For the p polarization let the corresponding coefficients be rp and tp Then for linear homogeneous isotropic non magnetic media the coefficients are given by br br For a derivation of the above see Fresnel equations Theory br Now we suppose that the transmitted wave is evanescent With the correct sign substituting into gives br br where br br that is n is the index of the internal medium relative to the external one or the index of the internal medium if the external one is vacuum So the magnitude of rs is and the argument of rs is br br which gives a phase advance of br br Making the same substitution in we find that ts has the same denominator as rs with a positive real numerator instead of a complex conjugate numerator and therefore has half the argument of rs so that the phase advance of the evanescent wave is half that of the reflected wave br With the same choice of sign substituting into gives br br whose magnitude is and whose argument is br br which gives a phase advance of br br Making the same substitution in we again find that the phase advance of the evanescent wave is half that of the reflected wave br Equations and apply when c i where i is the angle of incidence and c is the critical angle arcsin n These equations show that br br each phase advance is zero at the critical angle for which the numerator is zero br each phase advance approaches as i and br p s at intermediate values of i because the factor n is in the numerator of and the denominator of br For i c the reflection coefficients are given by equations and and are real so that the phase shift is either if the coefficient is positive or if the coefficient is negative br In if we put br br br br br n br br br br br br br n br br br br br sin br br br br br i br br br br br br sin br br br br br t br br br br br displaystyle n n sin theta text i sin theta text t br br Snell s law and multiply the numerator and denominator by n sin t we obtain br br which is positive for all angles of incidence with a transmitted ray since t i giving a phase shift s of zero br If we do likewise with the result is easily shown to be equivalent to br br which is negative for small angles that is near normal incidence but changes sign at Brewster s angle where i and t are complementary Thus the phase shift p is for small i but switches to at Brewster s angle Combining the complementarity with Snell s law yields i arctan n as Brewster s angle for dense to rare incidence br Equations and are known as Fresnel s sine law and Fresnel s tangent law Both reduce to at normal incidence but yield the correct results in the limit as i That they have opposite signs as we approach normal incidence is an obvious disadvantage of the sign convention used in this article the corresponding advantage is that they have the same signs at grazing incidence br br That completes the information needed to plot s and p for all angles of incidence This is done in Fig with p in red and s in blue for three refractive indices On the angle of incidence scale horizontal axis Brewster s angle is where p red falls from to and the critical angle is where both p and s red and blue start to rise again To the left of the critical angle is the region of partial reflection where both reflection coefficients are real phase or with magnitudes less than To the right of the critical angle is the region of total reflection where both reflection coefficients are complex with magnitudes equal to In that region the black curves show the phase advance of the p component relative to the s component br br It can be seen that a refractive index of is not enough to give a phase difference whereas a refractive index of is enough by a slim margin to give a phase difference at two angles of incidence about and br This relative shift is employed in Fresnel s invention now known as the Fresnel rhomb in which the angles of incidence are chosen such that the two internal reflections cause a total relative phase shift of between the two polarizations of an incident wave This device performs the same function as a birefringent quarter wave plate but is more achromatic that is the phase shift of the rhomb is less sensitive to wavelength Either device may be used for instance to transform linear polarization to circular polarization which Fresnel also discovered and vice versa br br In Fig is computed by a final subtraction but there are other ways of expressing it Fresnel himself in gave a formula for cos Born and Wolf p derive an expression for tan and find its maximum analytically br For TIR of a beam with finite width the variation in the phase shift with the angle of incidence gives rise to the Goos H nchen effect which is a lateral shift of the reflected beam within the plane of incidence This effect applies to linear polarization in the s or p direction The Imbert Fedorov effect is an analogous effect for circular or elliptical polarization and produces a shift perpendicular to the plane of incidence br br br Applications br br Optical fibers exploit total internal reflection to carry signals over long distances with little attenuation They are used in telecommunication cables and in image forming fiberscopes such as colonoscopes br In the catadioptric Fresnel lens invented by Augustin Jean Fresnel for use in lighthouses the outer prisms use TIR to deflect light from the lamp through a greater angle than would be possible with purely refractive prisms but with less absorption of light and less risk of tarnishing than with conventional mirrors br br Other reflecting prisms that use TIR include the following with some overlap between the categories br br Image erecting prisms for binoculars and spotting scopes include paired Porro prisms Fig the Porro Abbe prism the inline Koenig and Abbe Koenig prisms and the compact inline Schmidt Pechan prism The last consists of two components of which one is a kind of Bauernfeind prism which requires a reflective coating on one of its two reflecting faces due to a sub critical angle of incidence These prisms have the additional function of folding the optical path from the objective lens to the prime focus reducing the overall length for a given primary focal length br A prismatic star diagonal for an astronomical telescope may consist of a single Porro prism configured for a single reflection giving a mirror reversed image or an Amici roof prism which gives a non reversed image br Roof prisms use TIR at two faces meeting at a sharp angle This category includes the Koenig Abbe Koenig Schmidt Pechan and Amici types already mentioned and the roof pentaprism used in SLR cameras the last of these requires a reflective coating on one non TIR face br A prismatic corner reflector uses three total internal reflections to reverse the direction of incoming light br The Dove prism gives an inline view with mirror reversal br Polarizing prisms Although the Fresnel rhomb which converts between linear and elliptical polarization is not birefringent doubly refractive there are other kinds of prisms that combine birefringence with TIR in such a way that light of a particular polarization is totally reflected while light of the orthogonal polarization is at least partly transmitted Examples include the Nicol prism Glan Thompson prism Glan Foucault prism or Foucault prism and Glan Taylor prism br Refractometers which measure refractive indices often use the critical angle br Rain sensors for automatic windscreen windshield wipers have been implemented using the principle that total internal reflection will guide an infrared beam from a source to a detector if the outer surface of the windshield is dry but any water drops on the surface will divert some of the light br Edge lit LED panels used e g for backlighting of LCD computer monitors exploit TIR to confine the LED light to the acrylic glass pane except that some of the light is scattered by etchings on one side of the pane giving an approximately uniform luminous emittance br br Total internal reflection microscopy TIRM uses the evanescent wave to illuminate small objects close to the reflecting interface The consequent scattering of the evanescent wave a form of frustrated TIR makes the objects appear bright when viewed from the external side In the total internal reflection fluorescence microscope TIRFM instead of relying on simple scattering we choose an evanescent wavelength short enough to cause fluorescence Fig The high sensitivity of the illumination to the distance from the interface allows measurement of extremely small displacements and forces br A beam splitter cube uses frustrated TIR to divide the power of the incoming beam between the transmitted and reflected beams The width of the air gap or low refractive index gap between the two prisms can be made adjustable giving higher transmission and lower reflection for a narrower gap or higher reflection and lower transmission for a wider gap br Optical modulation can be accomplished by means of frustrated TIR with a rapidly variable gap As the transmission coefficient is highly sensitive to the gap width the function being approximately exponential until the gap is almost closed this technique can achieve a large dynamic range br Optical fingerprinting devices have used frustrated TIR to record images of persons fingerprints without the use of ink cf Fig br Gait analysis can be performed by using frustrated TIR with a high speed camera to capture and analyze footprints br A gonioscope used in optometry and ophthalmology for the diagnosis of glaucoma suppresses TIR in order to look into the angle between the iris and the cornea This view is usually blocked by TIR at the cornea air interface The gonioscope replaces the air with a higher index medium allowing transmission at oblique incidence typically followed by reflection in a mirror which itself may be implemented using TIR br Some multi touch interactive tables and whiteboards utilise FTIR to detect fingers touching the screen An infrared camera is placed behind the screen surface which is edge lit by infrared LEDs when touching the surface FTIR causes some of the infrared light to escape the screen plane and the camera sees this as bright areas Computer vision software is then used to translate this into a series of coordinates and gestures br br br History br br br Discovery br The surprisingly comprehensive and largely correct explanations of the rainbow by Theodoric of Freiberg written between and and Kam l al D n al F ris completed by although sometimes mentioned in connection with total internal reflection TIR are of dubious relevance because the internal reflection of sunlight in a spherical raindrop is not total But according to Carl Benjamin Boyer Theodoric s treatise on the rainbow also classified optical phenomena under five causes the last of which was a total reflection at the boundary of two transparent media Theodoric s work was forgotten until it was rediscovered by Giovanni Battista Venturi in br br Theodoric having fallen into obscurity the discovery of TIR was generally attributed to Johannes Kepler who published his findings in his Dioptrice in Although Kepler failed to find the true law of refraction he showed by experiment that for air to glass incidence the incident and refracted rays rotated in the same sense about the point of incidence and that as the angle of incidence varied through the angle of refraction as we now call it varied through He was also aware that the incident and refracted rays were interchangeable But these observations did not cover the case of a ray incident from glass to air at an angle beyond and Kepler promptly concluded that such a ray could only be reflected br Ren Descartes rediscovered the law of refraction and published it in his Dioptrique of In the same work he mentioned the senses of rotation of the incident and refracted rays and the condition of TIR But he neglected to discuss the limiting case and consequently failed to give an expression for the critical angle although he could easily have done so br br br Huygens and Newton Rival explanations br Christiaan Huygens in his Treatise on Light paid much attention to the threshold at which the incident ray is unable to penetrate into the other transparent substance Although he gave neither a name nor an algebraic expression for the critical angle he gave numerical examples for glass to air and water to air incidence noted the large change in the angle of refraction for a small change in the angle of incidence near the critical angle and cited this as the cause of the rapid increase in brightness of the reflected ray as the refracted ray approaches the tangent to the interface Huygens insight is confirmed by modern theory in Eqs and above there is nothing to say that the reflection coefficients increase exceptionally steeply as t approaches except that according to Snell s law t itself is an increasingly steep function of i br br Huygens offered an explanation of TIR within the same framework as his explanations of the laws of rectilinear propagation reflection ordinary refraction and even the extraordinary refraction of Iceland crystal calcite That framework rested on two premises first every point crossed by a propagating wavefront becomes a source of secondary wavefronts Huygens principle and second given an initial wavefront any subsequent position of the wavefront is the envelope common tangent surface of all the secondary wavefronts emitted from the initial position All cases of reflection or refraction by a surface are then explained simply by considering the secondary waves emitted from that surface In the case of refraction from a medium of slower propagation to a medium of faster propagation there is a certain obliquity of incidence beyond which it is impossible for the secondary wavefronts to form a common tangent in the second medium this is what we now call the critical angle As the incident wavefront approaches this critical obliquity the refracted wavefront becomes concentrated against the refracting surface augmenting the secondary waves that produce the reflection back into the first medium br Huygens system even accommodated partial reflection at the interface between different media albeit vaguely by analogy with the laws of collisions between particles of different sizes However as long as the wave theory continued to assume longitudinal waves it had no chance of accommodating polarization hence no chance of explaining the polarization dependence of extraordinary refraction or of the partial reflection coefficient or of the phase shift in TIR br br Isaac Newton rejected the wave explanation of rectilinear propagation believing that if light consisted of waves it would bend and spread every way into the shadows His corpuscular theory of light explained rectilinear propagation more simply and it accounted for the ordinary laws of refraction and reflection including TIR on the hypothesis that the corpuscles of light were subject to a force acting perpendicular to the interface In this model for dense to rare incidence the force was an attraction back towards the denser medium and the critical angle was the angle of incidence at which the normal velocity of the approaching corpuscle was just enough to reach the far side of the force field at more oblique incidence the corpuscle would be turned back Newton gave what amounts to a formula for the critical angle albeit in words as the Sines are which measure the Refraction so is the Sine of Incidence at which the total Reflexion begins to the Radius of the Circle br Newton went beyond Huygens in two ways First not surprisingly Newton pointed out the relationship between TIR and dispersion when a beam of white light approaches a glass to air interface at increasing obliquity the most strongly refracted rays violet are the first to be taken out by total Reflexion followed by the less refracted rays Second he observed that total reflection could be frustrated as we now say by laying together two prisms one plane and the other slightly convex and he explained this simply by noting that the corpuscles would be attracted not only to the first prism but also to the second br In two other ways however Newton s system was less coherent First his explanation of partial reflection depended not only on the supposed forces of attraction between corpuscles and media but also on the more nebulous hypothesis of Fits of easy Reflexion and Fits of easy Transmission Second although his corpuscles could conceivably have sides or poles whose orientations could conceivably determine whether the corpuscles suffered ordinary or extraordinary refraction in Island Crystal his geometric description of the extraordinary refraction was theoretically unsupported and empirically inaccurate br br br Laplace Malus and attenuated total reflectance ATR br William Hyde Wollaston in the first of a pair of papers read to the Royal Society of London in reported his invention of a refractometer based on the critical angle of incidence from an internal medium of known refractive power refractive index to an external medium whose index was to be measured With this device Wollaston measured the refractive powers of numerous materials some of which were too opaque to permit direct measurement of an angle of refraction Translations of his papers were published in France in and apparently came to the attention of Pierre Simon Laplace br br According to Laplace s elaboration of Newton s theory of refraction a corpuscle incident on a plane interface between two homogeneous isotropic media was subject to a force field that was symmetrical about the interface If both media were transparent total reflection would occur if the corpuscle were turned back before it exited the field in the second medium But if the second medium were opaque reflection would not be total unless the corpuscle were turned back before it left the first medium this required a larger critical angle than the one given by Snell s law and consequently impugned the validity of Wollaston s method for opaque media Laplace combined the two cases into a single formula for the relative refractive index in terms of the critical angle minimum angle of incidence for TIR The formula contained a parameter which took one value for a transparent external medium and another value for an opaque external medium Laplace s theory further predicted a relationship between refractive index and density for a given substance br br In Laplace s theory was tested experimentally by his prot g tienne Louis Malus Taking Laplace s formula for the refractive index as given and using it to measure the refractive index of bees wax in the liquid transparent state and the solid opaque state at various temperatures hence various densities Malus verified Laplace s relationship between refractive index and density br But Laplace s theory implied that if the angle of incidence exceeded his modified critical angle the reflection would be total even if the external medium was absorbent Clearly this was wrong in Eqs above there is no threshold value of the angle i beyond which becomes infinite so the penetration depth of the evanescent wave is always non zero and the external medium if it is at all lossy will attenuate the reflection As to why Malus apparently observed such an angle for opaque wax we must infer that there was a certain angle beyond which the attenuation of the reflection was so small that ATR was visually indistinguishable from TIR br br br Fresnel and the phase shift br Fresnel came to the study of total internal reflection through his research on polarization In Fran ois Arago discovered that polarized light was apparently depolarized in an orientation dependent and color dependent manner when passed through a slice of doubly refractive crystal the emerging light showed colors when viewed through an analyzer second polarizer Chromatic polarization as this phenomenon came to be called was more thoroughly investigated in by Jean Baptiste Biot In Biot established that one case studied by Arago namely quartz cut perpendicular to its optic axis was actually a gradual rotation of the plane of polarization with distance br br In Fresnel offered his first attempt at a wave based theory of chromatic polarization Without yet explicitly invoking transverse waves his theory treated the light as consisting of two perpendicularly polarized components In he noticed that plane polarized light seemed to be partly depolarized by total internal reflection if initially polarized at an acute angle to the plane of incidence By including total internal reflection in a chromatic polarization experiment he found that the apparently depolarized light was a mixture of components polarized parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence and that the total reflection introduced a phase difference between them Choosing an appropriate angle of incidence not yet exactly specified gave a phase difference of of a cycle Two such reflections from the parallel faces of two coupled prisms gave a phase difference of of a cycle In that case if the light was initially polarized at to the plane of incidence and reflection it appeared to be completely depolarized after the two reflections These findings were reported in a memoir submitted and read to the French Academy of Sciences in November br In Fresnel derived formulae equivalent to his sine and tangent laws Eqs and above by modeling light waves as transverse elastic waves with vibrations perpendicular to what had previously been called the plane of polarization Using old experimental data he promptly confirmed that the equations correctly predicted the direction of polarization of the reflected beam when the incident beam was polarized at to the plane of incidence for light incident from air onto glass or water The experimental confirmation was reported in a postscript to the work in which Fresnel expounded his mature theory of chromatic polarization introducing transverse waves Details of the derivation were given later in a memoir read to the academy in January The derivation combined conservation of energy with continuity of the tangential vibration at the interface but failed to allow for any condition on the normal component of vibration br Meanwhile in a memoir submitted in December Fresnel coined the terms linear polarization circular polarization and elliptical polarization For circular polarization the two perpendicular components were a quarter cycle out of phase br The new terminology was useful in the memoir of January containing the detailed derivations of the sine and tangent laws in that same memoir Fresnel found that for angles of incidence greater than the critical angle the resulting reflection coefficients were complex with unit magnitude Noting that the magnitude represented the amplitude ratio as usual he guessed that the argument represented the phase shift and verified the hypothesis by experiment The verification involved br br calculating the angle of incidence that would introduce a total phase difference of between the s and p components for various numbers of total internal reflections at that angle generally there were two solutions br subjecting light to that number of total internal reflections at that angle of incidence with an initial linear polarization at to the plane of incidence and br checking that the final polarization was circular br This procedure was necessary because with the technology of the time one could not measure the s and p phase shifts directly and one could not measure an arbitrary degree of ellipticality of polarization such as might be caused by the difference between the phase shifts But one could verify that the polarization was circular because the brightness of the light was then insensitive to the orientation of the analyzer br For glass with a refractive index of Fresnel calculated that a phase difference between the two reflection coefficients hence a difference after two reflections required an angle of incidence of or He cut a rhomb to the latter angle and found that it performed as expected Thus the specification of the Fresnel rhomb was completed Similarly Fresnel calculated and verified the angle of incidence that would give a phase difference after three reflections at the same angle and four reflections at the same angle In each case there were two solutions and in each case he reported that the larger angle of incidence gave an accurate circular polarization for an initial linear polarization at to the plane of reflection For the case of three reflections he also tested the smaller angle but found that it gave some coloration due to the proximity of the critical angle and its slight dependence on wavelength Compare Fig above which shows that the phase difference is more sensitive to the refractive index for smaller angles of incidence br For added confidence Fresnel predicted and verified that four total internal reflections at would give an accurate circular polarization if two of the reflections had water as the external medium while the other two had air but not if the reflecting surfaces were all wet or all dry br Fresnel s deduction of the phase shift in TIR is thought to have been the first occasion on which a physical meaning was attached to the argument of a complex number Although this reasoning was applied without the benefit of knowing that light waves were electromagnetic it passed the test of experiment and survived remarkably intact after James Clerk Maxwell changed the presumed nature of the waves Meanwhile Fresnel s success inspired James MacCullagh and Augustin Louis Cauchy beginning in to analyze reflection from metals by using the Fresnel equations with a complex refractive index The imaginary part of the complex index represents absorption br The term critical angle used for convenience in the above narrative is anachronistic it apparently dates from br In the th century quantum electrodynamics reinterpreted the amplitude of an electromagnetic wave in terms of the probability of finding a photon In this framework partial transmission and frustrated TIR concern the probability of a photon crossing a boundary and attenuated total reflectance concerns the probability of a photon being absorbed on the other side br
