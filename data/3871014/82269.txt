title: Focal length
id: 82269
The focal length of an optical system is a measure of how strongly the system converges or diverges light it is the inverse of the system s optical power A positive focal length indicates that a system converges light while a negative focal length indicates that the system diverges light A system with a shorter focal length bends the rays more sharply bringing them to a focus in a shorter distance or diverging them more quickly For the special case of a thin lens in air a positive focal length is the distance over which initially collimated parallel rays are brought to a focus or alternatively a negative focal length indicates how far in front of the lens a point source must be located to form a collimated beam For more general optical systems the focal length has no intuitive meaning it is simply the inverse of the system s optical power br In most photography and all telescopy where the subject is essentially infinitely far away longer focal length lower optical power leads to higher magnification and a narrower angle of view conversely shorter focal length or higher optical power is associated with lower magnification and a wider angle of view On the other hand in applications such as microscopy in which magnification is achieved by bringing the object close to the lens a shorter focal length higher optical power leads to higher magnification because the subject can be brought closer to the center of projection br br br Thin lens approximation br For a thin lens in air the focal length is the distance from the center of the lens to the principal foci or focal points of the lens For a converging lens for example a convex lens the focal length is positive and is the distance at which a beam of collimated light will be focused to a single spot For a diverging lens for example a concave lens the focal length is negative and is the distance to the point from which a collimated beam appears to be diverging after passing through the lens br When a lens is used to form an image of some object the distance from the object to the lens u the distance from the lens to the image v and the focal length f are related by br br br br br br br br f br br

distant light source on a screen The lens is moved until a sharp image is formed on the screen In this case u is negligible and the focal length is then given by br br br br br f br br v br br br br br displaystyle f approx v br br br Determining the focal length of a concave lens is somewhat more difficult The focal length of such a lens is defined as the point at which the spreading beams of light meet when they are extended backwards No image is formed during such a test and the focal length must be determined by passing light for example the light of a laser beam through the lens examining how much that light becomes dispersed bent and following the beam of light backwards to the lens s focal point br br br General optical systems br br For a thick lens one which has a non negligible thickness or an imaging system consisting of several lenses or mirrors e g a photographic lens or a telescope there are several related concepts that are referred to as focal lengths br br Effective focal length EFL br The effective focal length is the inverse of the optical power of an optical system and is the value used to calculate the magnification of the system The imaging properties of the optical system can be modeled by replacing the system with an ideal thin lens with the same EFL The EFL also provides a simple method for finding the nodal points without tracing any rays It was previously called equivalent focal length not to be confused with mm equivalent focal length br Front focal length FFL br The front focal length f is the distance from the front focal point F to the front principal plane H br Rear focal length RFL br The rear focal length f is the distance from the rear principal plane H to the rear focal point F br Front focal distance FFD br The front focal distance FFD sF is the distance from the front focal point of the system F to the vertex of the first optical surface S Some authors refer to this as front focal length br Back focal distance BFD br Back focal distance BFD s F is the distance from the vertex of the last optical surface of the system S to the rear focal point F Some authors refer to this as back focal length br For an optical system in air the effective focal length front focal length and rear focal length are all the same and may be called simply focal length br br For an optical system in a medium other than air or vacuum the front and rear focal lengths are equal to the EFL times the refractive index of the medium in front of or behind the lens n and n in the diagram above The term focal length by itself is ambiguous in this case The historical usage was to define the focal length as the EFL times the index of refraction of the medium For a system with different media on both sides such as the human eye the front and rear focal lengths are not equal to one another and convention may dictate which one is called the focal length of the system Some modern authors avoid this ambiguity by instead defining focal length to be a synonym for EFL br The distinction between front rear focal length and EFL is important for studying the human eye The eye can be represented by an equivalent thin lens at an air fluid boundary with front and rear focal lengths equal to those of the eye or it can be represented by a different equivalent thin lens that is totally in air with focal length equal to the eye s EFL br For the case of a lens of thickness d in air n n and surfaces with radii of curvature R and R the effective focal length f is given by the Lensmaker s equation br br br br br br br br f

if it is concave The value of R is negative if the second surface is convex and positive if concave Sign conventions vary between different authors which results in different forms of these equations depending on the convention used br For a spherically curved mirror in air the magnitude of the focal length is equal to the radius of curvature of the mirror divided by two The focal length is positive for a concave mirror and negative for a convex mirror In the sign convention used in optical design a concave mirror has negative radius of curvature so br br br br br f br br br br br R br

field of view FOV of a lens are inversely proportional For a standard rectilinear lens FOV arctan x f where x is the width of the film br When a photographic lens is set to infinity its rear principal plane is separated from the sensor or film which is then situated at the focal plane by the lens s focal length Objects far away from the camera then produce sharp images on the sensor or film which is also at the image plane br To render closer objects in sharp focus the lens must be adjusted to increase the distance between the rear principal plane and the film to put the film at the image plane The focal length f the distance from the front principal plane to the object to photograph s and the distance from the rear principal plane to the image plane s are then related by br br br br

consider a normal lens for a mm camera with a focal length of f mm To focus a distant object s the rear principal plane of the lens must be located a distance s mm from the film plane so that it is at location of the image plane To focus an object m away s mm the lens must be moved mm farther away from the film plane to s mm br The focal length of a lens determines the magnification at which it images distant objects It is equal to the distance between the image plane and a pinhole that images distant objects the same size as the lens in question For rectilinear lenses that is with no image distortion the imaging of distant objects is well modelled as a pinhole camera model br This model leads to the simple geometric model that photographers use for computing the angle of view of a camera in this case the angle of view depends only on the ratio of focal length to film size In general the angle of view depends also on the distortion br A lens with a focal length about equal to the diagonal size of the film or sensor format is known as a normal lens its angle of view is similar to the angle subtended by a large enough print viewed at a typical viewing distance of the print diagonal which therefore yields a normal perspective when viewing the print br this angle of view is about degrees diagonally For full frame mm format cameras the diagonal is mm and a typical normal lens has a mm focal length A lens with a focal length shorter than normal is often referred to as a wide angle lens typically mm and less for mm format cameras while a lens significantly longer than normal may be referred to as a telephoto lens typically mm and more for mm format cameras Technically long focal length lenses are only telephoto if the focal length is longer than the physical length of the lens but the term is often used to describe any long focal length lens br Due to the popularity of the mm standard camera lens combinations are often described in terms of their mm equivalent focal length that is the focal length of a lens that would have the same angle of view or field of view if used on a full frame mm camera Use of a mm equivalent focal length is particularly common with digital cameras which often use sensors smaller than mm film and so require correspondingly shorter focal lengths to achieve a given angle of view by a factor known as the crop factor br br br Optical power br br The optical power of a lens or curved mirror is a physical quantity equal to the reciprocal of the focal length expressed in metres A dioptre is its unit of measurement with dimension of reciprocal length equivalent to one reciprocal metre dioptre m For example a dioptre lens brings parallel rays of light to focus at metre A flat window has an optical power of zero dioptres as it does not cause light to converge or diverge br The main benefit of using optical power rather than focal length is that the thin lens formula has the object distance image distance and focal length all as reciprocals Additionally when relatively thin lenses are placed close together their powers approximately add Thus a thin dioptre lens placed close to a thin dioptre lens yields almost the same focal length as a single dioptre lens br br br See also br Depth of field br Dioptre br f number or focal ratio br br br
