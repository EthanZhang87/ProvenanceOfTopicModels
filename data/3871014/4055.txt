In Norse mythology Bifr st also called Bilr st is a burning rainbow bridge that reaches between Midgard Earth and Asgard the realm of the gods The bridge is attested as Bilr st in the Poetic Edda compiled in the th century from earlier traditional sources as Bifr st in the Prose Edda written in the th century by Snorri Sturluson and in the poetry of skalds Both the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda alternately refer to the bridge as sbr Old Norse sir s bridge br According to the Prose Edda the bridge ends in heaven at Himinbj rg the residence of the god Heimdall who guards it from the j tnar The bridge s destruction during Ragnar k by the forces of Muspell is foretold Scholars have proposed that the bridge may have originally represented the Milky Way and have noted parallels between the bridge and another bridge in Norse mythology Gjallarbr br br br Etymology br Scholar Andy Orchard suggests that Bifr st may mean shimmering path He notes that the first element of Bilr st bil meaning a moment suggests the fleeting nature of the rainbow which he connects to the first element of Bifr st the Old Norse verb bifa meaning to shimmer or to shake noting that the element evokes notions of the lustrous sheen of the bridge Austrian Germanist Rudolf Simek says that Bifr st either means the swaying road to heaven also citing bifa or if Bilr st is the original form of the two which Simek says is likely the fleetingly glimpsed rainbow possibly connected to bil perhaps meaning moment weak point br br br Attestations br Two poems in the Poetic Edda and two books in the Prose Edda provide information about the bridge br br br Poetic Edda br br In the Poetic Edda the bridge is mentioned in the poems Gr mnism l and F fnism l where it is referred to as Bilr st In one of two stanzas in the poem Gr mnism l that mentions the bridge Gr mnir the god Odin in disguise provides the young Agnarr with cosmological knowledge including that Bilr st is the best of bridges Later in Gr mnism l Gr mnir notes that Asbr burns all with flames and that every day the god Thor wades through the waters of K rmt and rmt and the two Kerlaugar br br In F fnism l the dying wyrm Fafnir tells the hero Sigurd that during the events of Ragnar k bearing spears gods will meet at sk pnir From there the gods will cross Bilr st which will break apart as they cross over it causing their horses to dredge through an immense river br br br Prose Edda br br The bridge is mentioned in the Prose Edda books Gylfaginning and Sk ldskaparm l where it is referred to as Bifr st In chapter of Gylfaginning Gangleri King Gylfi in disguise asks the enthroned figure of High what way exists between heaven and earth Laughing High replies that the question isn t an intelligent one and goes on to explain that the gods built a bridge from heaven and earth He incredulously asks Gangleri if he has not heard the story before High says that Gangleri must have seen it and notes that Gangleri may call it a rainbow High says that the bridge consists of three colors has great strength and is built with art and skill to a greater extent than other constructions br High notes that although the bridge is strong it will break when Muspell s lads attempt to cross it and their horses will have to make do with swimming over great rivers Gangleri says that it doesn t seem that the gods built the bridge in good faith if it is liable to break considering that they can do as they please High responds that the gods do not deserve blame for the breaking of the bridge for there is nothing in this world that will be secure when Muspell s sons attack br In chapter of Gylfaginning Just As High says that Bifr st is also called Asbr and that every day the gods ride their horses across it with the exception of Thor who instead wades through the boiling waters of the rivers K rmt and rmt to reach Ur arbrunnr a holy well where the gods have their court As a reference Just As High quotes the second of the two stanzas in Gr mnism l that mention the bridge see above Gangleri asks if fire burns over Bifr st High says that the red in the bridge is burning fire and without it the frost jotnar and mountain jotnar would go up into heaven if anyone who wanted could cross Bifr st High adds that in heaven there are many beautiful places and that everywhere there has divine protection around it br In chapter High tells Gangleri that the location of Himinbj rg stands at the edge of heaven where Bifrost reaches heaven While describing the god Heimdallr in chapter High says that Heimdallr lives in Himinbj rg by Bifr st and guards the bridge from mountain jotnar while sitting at the edge of heaven In chapter High quotes the first of the two Gr mnism l stanzas that mention the bridge In chapter High foretells the events of Ragnar k High says that during Ragnar k the sky will split open and from the split will ride forth the sons of Muspell When the sons of Muspell ride over Bifr st it will break as was said above br In the Prose Edda book Sk ldskaparm l the bridge receives a single mention In chapter a work by the th century skald lfr Uggason is provided where Bifr st is referred to as the powers way br br br Theories br br In his translation of the Prose Edda Henry Adams Bellows comments that the Gr mnism l stanza mentioning Thor and the bridge stanza may mean that Thor has to go on foot in the last days of the destruction when the bridge is burning Another interpretation however is that when Thor leaves the heavens i e when a thunder storm is over the rainbow bridge becomes hot in the sun br John Lindow points to a parallel between Bifr st which he notes is a bridge between earth and heaven or earth and the world of the gods and the bridge Gjallarbr a bridge between earth and the underworld or earth and the world of the dead Several scholars have proposed that Bifr st may represent the Milky Way br br br Adaptations br In the final scene of Richard Wagner s opera Das Rheingold the god Froh summons a rainbow bridge over which the gods cross to enter Valhalla br In J R R Tolkien s legendarium the level bridge of The Fall of N menor an early version of the Akallabeth recalls Bifr st It departs from the earth at a tangent allowing immortal Elves but not mortal Men to travel the Old Straight Road to the lost earthly paradise of Valinor after the world has been remade br Bifr st appears in comic books associated with the Marvel Comics character Thor and in subsequent adaptations of those comic books In the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Thor Jane Foster describes the Bifr st as an Einstein Rosen bridge which functions as a means of transportation across space in a short period of time br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Media related
