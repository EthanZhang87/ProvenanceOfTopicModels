A moonbow also known as a moon rainbow or lunar rainbow is a rainbow produced by moonlight rather than direct sunlight Other than the difference in the light source its formation is the same as for a solar rainbow It is caused by the refraction of light in many water droplets such as a rain shower or a waterfall and is always positioned in the opposite part of the sky from the Moon relative to the observer br br Moonbows are much fainter than solar rainbows due to the smaller amount of light reflected from the surface of the Moon Because the light is usually too faint to excite the cone color receptors in human eyes it is difficult for the human eye to discern colors in a moonbow As a result a moonbow often appears to be white However the colors in a moonbow do appear in long exposure photographs br Moonbows have been mentioned at least since Aristotle s Meteorology circa BC br br br Viewing br Moonbows are most easily viewed when the Moon is at or nearest to its brightest phase full moon For moonbows to have the greatest prospect of appearing the Moon must be low in the sky at an elevation of less than degrees preferably lower and must not be obscured by cloud In addition the night sky must be very dark Since the sky is not completely dark on a rising setting full moon this means they can only be observed two to three hours before sunrise a time with few observers or two to three hours after sunset And of course there must be water droplets e g from rain or spray opposite the Moon This combination of requirements makes moonbows much rarer than rainbows produced by the daytime sunlight Moonbows may also be visible when rain falls during full moonrise at extreme latitudes during the winter months when the prevalence of the hours of darkness gives more opportunity for the phenomenon to be observed br It is said that the definition of the colours depends upon the size of the moisture drops present in the air the smaller they are the less vivid the colours Below inch diameter they usually refract more or less white light as the component colours are merged br br br Locations br br Numerous places in the world feature spray fog or mist induced bows In the United States such bows may be seen in relation to various waterfalls including Niagara Falls New York Yosemite National Park California and Cumberland Falls near Corbin Kentucky Victoria Falls on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe is also widely known for spray moonbows br Spray moonbows are also seen with some regularity in the cloud forests of Costa Rica in mountain towns like Monteverde and Santa Elena These occur when clouds of mist are blown in from the Caribbean by the Christmas Winds The Christmas Winds happen from the end of December through late January or early February These clouds of mists create a streaming pattern of stripes giving rise to their popular name in Spanish pelo de gato cat s hair Moonbows happen in this part of Costa Rica almost every full moon in the months of December through February The bows that are caused by Pelo de Gato are not limited to just before dawn but can happen after sunset too but it does need a full or nearly full moon br Moonbows are also found in wet regions of Hawaii such as Kauai with the moon rising in the east during light rain and the Big Island of Hawaii br br br br br br External links br br Maui s Night Sky Time elapse photography by Wally Pacholka Maui No Ka Oi Magazine Vol No May br Lunar Rainbow photos from Victoria Falls br Moonbow picture br Moonbow picture made with long exposure br Zambezi Guide on taking photos of Lunar Rainbows from Victoria Falls Archived at the Wayback Machine br Moonbow in New Zealand br Moonbow photo at Brandywine Falls Whistler Canada br Moving rainbow over Patagonia all night time lapse movie Archived at the Wayback Machine br Kentucky State Park Moonbow Dates At the bottom of the page under the Moonbow tab br Moon Light Effects Moon Rings Moon Dogs And Other Moon Light Phenomena Archived at the Wayback Machine br Moonbow on Big Island Hawaii br Moonbow over Yosemite Falls from Cook s Meadow br https moon lamp co uk
