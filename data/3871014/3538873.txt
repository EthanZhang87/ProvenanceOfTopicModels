id: 3538873
In British heraldry vert is the tincture equivalent to green It is one of the five dark tinctures called colours br Vert is commonly found in modern flags and coat of arms and to a lesser extent also in the classical heraldry of the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern period br Green flags were historically carried by Ottokar II of Bohemia in the th century In the modern period a green ensign was flown by Irish vessels becoming a symbol of Irish nationalism in the th and th century The Empire of Brazil used a yellow rhombus on a green field from now seen in the flag of Brazil In the th century a green field was chosen for a number of national flag designs especially in the Arab and Muslim world because of the symbolism of green in Islam including the solid green flag of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya br Vert is portrayed in heraldic hatching by lines at a degree angle from upper left to lower right or indicated by the abbreviation v or vt when a coat of arms is tricked br br br Etymology br Vert is simply the French word for green It has been used in English in the sense of a heraldic tincture since the early th century br Vert is not used in modern French heraldry Instead sinople has been used for green since at least the th century Earlier in the medieval period however vert was used for green while sinople originally referred to a shade of red before becoming associated with green br In Spanish heraldry either sinople or verde can be used for green Verde is also used in Portugal In both the Spanish and Portuguese languages verde literally translates as green Sinopel is the spelling used in Dutch heraldry In German heraldry they use gr n which also translates as green br br br Middle Ages br The green tincture was left out of some heraldic works in the Middle Ages but the first known English treatise the Anglo Norman De Heraudie dated to sometime between and lists vert among the other tinctures br The French term sinople was in use prior to the th century but it did not refer to green but rather to red being identical in origin to Cinnabar originally the name of a red pigment also known as sinopia br Descriptions of knightly shields as painted at least partly green in Arthurian romance are found earlier even in the late th century Here the Chevalier au Vert Escu knight with the green shield often marks a kind of supernatural character outside of normal chivalric society as is still the case with the English Green Knight of c perhaps in connection with the Wild Man or Green Man of medieval figurative art br The Anglo Norman prose Brut c has Brutus of Troy bear a green shield Brutus Vert Escu Brutus Viride Scutum br Green is occasionally found in historical coats of arms as opposed to the fictional green knights of Arthurian romance from as early as the th century but it remained rare and indeed actively avoided well into the th century but becomes more common in the classical heraldry of the th and th centuries br According to Pawe Dudzi ski the chairman of the Heraldic Committee within the Polish Ministry of Interior and Administration early heraldic green used to be bright obtained from verdigris pigment which allowed contrast with azure obtained from dark ultramarine pigment in arms that contravened the rule of tincture br An early example of a green escutcheon was that of the coat of arms of Styria based on the banner of Ottokar II of Bohemia r described by chronist Ottokar aus der Gaal c as br br ein banier gr ene als ein gras darin ein pantel swebte blanc als ob ez lebte br a banner green as grass therein suspended a panther in white depicted as if alive br A curious example occurs in an early armorial of the Burgundian Order of the Knights of the Golden Fleece Toison d Or where the arms of the Lannoy family are recorded as argent three lions rampant sinople etc Despite the fact that sinople signified a shade of red in early heraldry the lions in this th century manuscript are clearly green although rather faded The fugitive nature of the green pigments of that day may have had some influence on the low use of that colour in early heraldry br br br Classical heraldry br During the th century green was still rare as a tincture for the field of a coat of arms but it was used increasingly for the heraldic designs shown in the field especially when depicting trees or other vegetation Thus the coat of arms of Hungary shows a double cross on a hill as a symbol of the rp d kings where the cross was shown in silver argent and the hill in green from the late th century br The only green shown in the arms of the states of the Holy Roman Empire in the Quaternion Eagle by Hans Burgkmair c are the crancelin of Saxony and the Zirbelnuss of Augsburg br The three lions rampant verts of the Marquessate of Franchimont are attested in the th century br Siebmachers Wappenbuch of shows a number of green heraldic devices in the coat of arms of cities For example the coat of arms of the town of Waldkappel forest chapel as depicting a chapel in a forest on a red field with the ground on which the chapel is standing and four trees behind the chapel drawn in green br There are a number of other examples where Siebmacher as a green mount the heraldic hill at the bottom of the shield on which the heraldic charge is standing br For the town of Gr nberg Siebmacher shows a yellow field on which a knight is riding his horse running on a green hill and the knight flying a green banner br br br Poetic meanings br The different tinctures are traditionally associated with particular heavenly bodies precious stones virtues and flowers although these associations have been mostly disregarded by serious heraldists Vert is associated with br br Of jewels the emerald
