title: Dichromacy

Dichromacy from Greek di meaning two and chromo meaning color is the state of having two types of functioning photoreceptors called cone cells in the eyes Organisms with dichromacy are called dichromats Dichromats require only two primary colors to be able to represent their visible gamut By comparison trichromats need three primary colors and tetrachromats need four Likewise every color in a dichromat s gamut can be evoked with monochromatic light By comparison every color in a trichromat s gamut can be evoked with a combination of monochromatic light and white light br Dichromacy in humans is a color vision deficiency in which one of the three cone cells is absent or not functioning and color is thereby reduced to two dimensions br br br Perception br br Dichromatic color vision is enabled by two types of cone cells with different spectral sensitivities and the neural framework to compare the excitation of the different cone cells The resulting color vision is simpler than typical human trichromatic color vision and much simpler than tetrachromatic color vision typical of birds and fish br A dichromatic color space can be defined by only two primary colors When these primary colors are also the unique hues then the color space contains the individuals entire gamut In dichromacy the unique hues can be evoked by exciting only a single cone at a time e g monochromatic light near the extremes of the visible spectrum A dichromatic color space can also be defined by non unique hues but the color space will not contain the individual s entire gamut For comparison a trichromatic color space requires three primary colors to be defined However even when choosing three pure spectral colors as the primaries the resulting color space will never encompass the entire trichromatic individual s gamut br The color vision of dichromats can be represented in a dimensional plane where one coordinate represented brightness and the other coordinate represents hue However the perception of hue is not directly analogous to trichromatic hue but rather a spectrum diverging from white neutral in the middle to two unique hues at the extreme e g blue and yellow Unlike trichromats white experienced when both cone cells are equally excited can be evoked by monochromatic light This means that dichromats see white in the rainbow br br br Humans br br Dichromacy in humans is a form of color blindness color vision deficiency Normal human color vision is trichromatic so dichromacy is achieved by losing functionality of one of the three cone cells The classification of human dichromacy depends on which cone is missing br br Protanopia is a severe form of red green color blindness in which the L cone is absent It is sex linked and affects about of males Colors of confusion include blue purple and green yellow br Deuteranopia is a severe form of red green color blindness in which the M cone is absent It is sex linked and affects about of males Color vision is very similar to protanopia br Tritanopia is a severe form of blue yellow color blindness in which the S cone is absent It is much rarer than the other types occurring in about in but is not sex linked so affects females and males at similar rates They tend to confuse greens and blues and yellow can appear pink br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Diagnosis br br The three determining elements of a dichromatic opponent color space are the missing color the null luminance plane and the null chrominance plane The description of the phenomena itself does not indicate the color that is impaired to the dichromat however it does provide enough information to identify the fundamental color space the colors that are seen by the dichromat This is based on testing both the null chrominance plane and null luminance plane which intersect on the missing color The cones excited to a corresponding color in the color space are visible to the dichromat and those that are not excited are the missing colors br br br Color detecting abilities of dichromats br According to color vision researchers at the Medical College of Wisconsin including Jay Neitz each of the three standard color detecting cones in the retina of trichromats blue green and red can pick up about different gradations of color If each detector is independent of the others the total number of colors discernible by an average human is their product i e about million Nevertheless other researchers have put the number at upwards of million The same calculation suggests that a dichromat such as a human with red green color blindness would be able to distinguish about different colors but no such calculation has been verified by psychophysical testing br Furthermore dichromats have a significantly higher threshold than trichromats for colored stimuli flickering at low Hz frequencies At higher or Hz frequencies dichromats perform as well as or better than trichromats This means such animals would still observe the flicker instead of a temporally fused visual perception as is the case in human movie watching at a high enough frame rate br br br Mammals br Until the s popular belief held that most mammals outside of primates were monochromats In the last half century however a focus on behavioral and genetic testing of mammals has accumulated extensive evidence of dichromatic color vision in a number of mammalian orders Mammals are now usually assumed to be dichromats possessing S and L cones with monochromats viewed as the exceptions br The common vertebrate ancestor extant during the Cambrian was tetrachromatic possessing distinct opsins classes Early mammalian evolution would see the loss of two of these four opsins due to the nocturnal bottleneck as dichromacy may improve an animal s ability to distinguish colors in dim light Placental mammals are therefore as a rule dichromatic br The exceptions to this rule of dichromatic vision in placental mammals are old world monkeys and apes which re evolved trichromacy and marine mammals both pinnipeds and cetaceans which are cone monochromats New World Monkeys are a partial exception in most species males are dichromats and about of females are trichromats but the owl monkeys are cone monochromats and both sexes of howler monkeys are trichromats br Trichromacy has been retained or re evolved in marsupials where trichromatic vision is widespread Recent genetic and behavioral evidence suggests the South American marsupial Didelphis albiventris is dichromatic with only two classes of cone opsins having been found within the genus Didelphis br br br See also br Pentachromacy br Mantis shrimp dodecachromats br RG color space br br br br br br Sources br Scheibner H Cleveland S
