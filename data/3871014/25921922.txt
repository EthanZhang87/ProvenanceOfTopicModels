title: Impossible color
id: 25921922
Impossible colors are colors that do not appear in ordinary visual functioning Different color theories suggest different hypothetical colors that humans are incapable of perceiving for one reason or another and fictional colors are routinely created in popular culture While some such colors have no basis in reality phenomena such as cone cell fatigue enable colors to be perceived in certain circumstances that would not be otherwise br br br Opponent process br br The color opponent process is a color theory that states that the human visual system interprets information about color by processing signals from cone and rod cells in an antagonistic manner The three types of cone cells have some overlap in the wavelengths of light to which they respond so it is more efficient for the visual system to record differences between the responses of cones rather than each type of cone s individual response The opponent color theory suggests that there are three opponent channels br br Red versus green br Blue versus yellow br Black versus white this is achromatic and detects light dark variation or luminance br Responses to one color of an opponent channel are antagonistic to those to the other color and signals output from a place on the retina can contain one or the other but not both for each opponent pair br br br Imaginary colors br br A fictitious color or imaginary color is a point in a color space that corresponds to combinations of cone cell responses in one eye that cannot be produced by the eye in normal circumstances seeing any possible light spectrum No physical object can have an imaginary color br The spectral sensitivity curve of medium wavelength M cone cells overlaps those of short wavelength S and long wavelength L cone cells Light of any wavelength that interacts with M cones also interacts with S or L cones or both to some extent Therefore no wavelength and no spectral power distribution excites only one sort of cone If for example M cones could be excited alone this would make the brain see an imaginary color greener than any physically possible green Such a hyper green color would be in the CIE color space chromaticity diagram in the blank area above the colored area and between the y axis and the line x y br br br Imaginary colors in color spaces br br Although they cannot be seen imaginary colors are often found in the mathematical descriptions that define color spaces br Any additive mixture of two real colors is also a real color When colors are displayed in the CIE XYZ color space additive mixture results in color along the line between the colors being mixed By mixing any three colors one can therefore create any color contained in the triangle they describe this is called the gamut formed by those three colors which are called primary colors Any colors outside of this triangle cannot be obtained by mixing the chosen primaries br When defining primaries the goal is often to leave as many real colors in gamut as possible Since the region of real colors is not a triangle see illustration it is not possible to pick three real colors that span the whole region The gamut can be increased by selecting more than three real primary colors but since the region of real colors is bounded by a smooth curve there will always be some colors near its edges that are left out For this reason primary colors are often chosen that are outside of the region of real colors that is imaginary or fictitious primary colors in order to capture the greatest area of real colors br In computer and television screen color displays the corners of the gamut triangle are defined by commercially available phosphors chosen to be as near as possible to pure red green and blue within the area of real colors Because of this these displays inevitably exhibit colors nearest to real colors lying within its gamut triangle rather than exact matches to real colors that plot outside of it The specific gamuts available to commercial display devices vary by manufacturer and model and are often defined as part of international standards for example the gamut of chromaticities defined by sRGB color space was developed into a standard IEC by the International Electrotechnical Commission br br br Chimerical colors br br A chimerical color is an imaginary color that can be seen temporarily by looking steadily at a strong color until some of the cone cells become fatigued temporarily changing their color sensitivities and then looking at a markedly different color The direct trichromatic description of vision cannot explain these colors which can involve saturation signals outside the physical gamut imposed by the trichromatic model Opponent process color theories which treat intensity and chroma as separate visual signals provide a biophysical explanation of these chimerical colors For example staring at a saturated primary color field and then looking at a white object results in an opposing shift in hue causing an afterimage of the complementary color Exploration of the color space outside the range of real colors by this means is major corroborating evidence for the opponent process theory of color vision Chimerical colors can be seen while seeing with one eye or with both eyes and are not observed to reproduce simultaneously qualities of opposing colors e g yellowish blue Chimerical colors include br br Stygian colors br These are simultaneously dark and impossibly saturated For example to see stygian blue staring at bright yellow causes a dark blue afterimage then on looking at black the blue is seen as blue against the black also as dark as the black The color is not possible to achieve through normal vision because the lack of incident light in the black prevents saturation of the blue yellow chromatic signal the blue appearance br Self luminous colors br These mimic the effect of glowing material even when viewed on a medium such as paper which can only reflect and not emit its own light For example to see self luminous red staring at green causes a red afterimage then on looking at white the red is seen against the white and may seem to be brighter than the white br Hyperbolic colors br These are impossibly highly saturated For example to see hyperbolic orange staring at bright cyan causes an orange afterimage then on looking at orange the resulting orange afterimage seen against the orange background may cause an orange color purer than the purest orange color that can be made by any normally seen light br br br Colors outside physical color space br br According to the opponent process theory under normal circumstances there is no hue that could be described as a mixture of opponent hues that is as a hue looking redgreen or yellowblue br In Hewitt D Crane and Thomas P Piantanida performed tests using an eye tracker device that had a field of a vertical red stripe adjacent to a vertical green stripe or several narrow alternating red and green stripes or in some cases yellow and blue instead The device could track involuntary movements of one eye there was a patch over the other eye and adjust mirrors so the image would follow the eye and the boundaries of the stripes were always on the same places on the eye s retina the field outside the stripes was blanked with occluders Under such conditions the edges between the stripes seemed to disappear perhaps due to edge detecting neurons becoming fatigued and the colors flowed into each other in the brain s visual cortex overriding the opponency mechanisms and producing not the color expected from mixing paints or from mixing lights on a screen but new colors entirely which are not in the CIE color space either in its real part or in its imaginary parts For red and green some saw an even field of the new color some saw a regular pattern of just visible green dots and red dots some saw islands of one color on a background of the other color Some of the volunteers for the experiment reported that afterward they could still imagine the new colors for a period of time br br Some observers indicated that although they were aware that what they were viewing was a color that is the field was not achromatic they were unable to name or describe the color One of these observers was an artist with large color vocabulary Other observers of the novel hues described the first stimulus as a reddish green br br In Vincent A Billock and Gerald A Gleason and Brian H Tsou set up an experiment to test a theory that the experiment did not control for variations in the perceived luminance of the colors from subject to subject two colors are equiluminant for an observer when rapidly alternating between the colors produces the least impression of flickering The experiment was similar but controlled for luminance They had these observations br br Some subjects out of described transparency phenomena as though the opponent colors originated in two depth planes and could be seen one through the other br We found that when colors were equiluminant subjects saw reddish greens bluish yellows or a multistable spatial color exchange an entirely novel perceptual phenomena sic when the colors were nonequiluminant subjects saw spurious pattern formation br br This led them to propose a soft wired model of cortical color opponency in which populations of neurons compete to fire and in which the losing neurons go completely silent In this model eliminating competition by for instance inhibiting connections between neural populations can allow mutually exclusive neurons to fire together br Hsieh and Tse in disputed the existence of colors forbidden by opponency theory and claimed they are in reality intermediate colors However by their own account their methods differed from Crane and Piantanida They stabilized the border between two colors on the retina using an eye tracker linked to deflector mirrors whereas we relied on visual fixation Hsieh and Tse do not compare their methods to Billock and Tsou and do not cite their work even though it was published five years earlier in See also binocular rivalry br br br In fiction br Some works of fiction have mentioned fictional colors outside of the normal human visual spectrum that have not been observed yet and whose observation may require advanced technology different physics or magic Introduction of a new color is often an allegory intending to deliver additional information to the reader Such colors are primarily discussed in literary works as they are currently impossible to visualize when a new color is shown in the episode Reincarnation of the animated show Futurama the animation for that segment of the show is purposely kept in shades of gray br One of the earliest examples of fictional colors comes from the Ambrose Bierce horror short story The Damned Thing wherein the titular monster is theorized to have been a color beyond human senses rendering the monster itself invisible Popular examples also include the science fiction novel A Voyage to Arcturus by David Lindsay which mentions two new primary colors ulfire and jale The Colour Out of Space a story by H P Lovecraft is named after an otherwise unnamed color usually not observable by humans generated by alien entities Philip K Dick s novel Galactic Pot Healer mentions a color rej Terry Pratchett in his Discworld series that began with The Colour of Magic describes octarine a color that can be seen only by magicians and cats and Marion Zimmer Bradley in her novel The Colors of Space mentions the eighth color made visible during the FTL travel Brazilian writer Ziraldo s children s book Flicts tells the story of a color of the same name represented as an earthy shade of beige that is segregated by the other colors found in the rainbow flags and elsewhere because Flicts is rare seen as uncharacteristic and therefore undervalued at the end of the book Flicts finds its place as the color of the moon after being gifted an English copy of the book Neil Armstrong signed it and wrote The moon is flicts Pleurigloss is the favorite color of the immortal afterlife being Michael from the television show The Good Place In the show pleurigloss is described as the color of when a soldier comes home from war and sees his dog for the first time Vernor Vinge s science fiction novel A Deepness in the Sky includes a species who can see a color whose name is translated as plaid including a reference to alpha plaid In Fallen London Sunless Sea and Sunless Skies which
