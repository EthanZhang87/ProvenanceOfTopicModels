White is the lightest color and is achromatic having no hue It is the color of objects such as snow chalk and milk and is the opposite of black White objects fully reflect and scatter all the visible wavelengths of light White on television and computer screens is created by a mixture of red blue and green light The color white can be given with white pigments especially titanium dioxide br In ancient Egypt and ancient Rome priestesses wore white as a symbol of purity and Romans wore white togas as symbols of citizenship In the Middle Ages and Renaissance a white unicorn symbolized chastity and a white lamb sacrifice and purity It was the royal color of the kings of France and of the monarchist movement that opposed the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War Greek temples and Roman temples were faced with white marble and beginning in the th century with the advent of neoclassical architecture white became the most common color of new churches capitols and other government buildings especially in the United States It was also widely used in th century modern architecture as a symbol of modernity and simplicity br According to surveys in Europe and the United States white is the color most often associated with perfection the good honesty cleanliness the beginning the new neutrality and exactitude White is an important color for almost all world religions The pope the head of the Roman Catholic Church has worn white since as a symbol of purity and sacrifice In Islam and in the Shinto religion of Japan it is worn by pilgrims In Western cultures and in Japan white is the most common color for wedding dresses symbolizing purity and virginity In many Asian cultures white is also the color of mourning br br br Etymology br The word white continues Old English hw t ultimately from a Common Germanic w taz also reflected in OHG h w z ON hv tr Goth eits The root is ultimately from Proto Indo European language kwid surviving also in Sanskrit veta to be white or bright and Slavonic sv t light The Icelandic word for white hv tur is directly derived from the Old Norse form of the word hv tr Common Germanic also had the word blankaz white bright blinding borrowed into Late Latin as blancus which provided the source for Romance words for white Catalan Occitan and French blanc Spanish blanco Italian bianco Galician Portuguese branco etc The antonym of white is black br Some non European languages have a wide variety of terms for white The Inuit language has seven different words for seven different nuances of white Sanskrit has specific words for bright white the white of teeth the white of sandalwood the white of the autumn moon the white of silver the white of cow s milk the white of pearls the white of a ray of sunlight and the white of stars Japanese has six different words depending upon brilliance or dullness or if the color is inert or dynamic br br br History and art br br br Prehistoric and ancient history br White was one of the first colors used in art The Lascaux Cave in France contains drawings of bulls and other animals drawn by paleolithic artists between and years ago Paleolithic artists used calcite or chalk sometimes as a background sometimes as a highlight along with charcoal and red and yellow ochre in their vivid cave paintings br In ancient Egypt white was connected with the goddess Isis The priests and priestesses of Isis dressed only in white linen and it was used to wrap mummies br In Greece and other ancient civilizations white was often associated with mother s milk In Greek mythology the chief god Zeus was nourished at the breast of the nymph Amalthea In the Talmud milk was one of four sacred substances along with wine honey and the rose br The ancient Greeks saw the world in terms of darkness and light so white was a fundamental color According to Pliny the Elder in his Natural History Apelles th century BC and the other famous painters of ancient Greece used only four colors in their paintings white red yellow and black For painting the Greeks used the highly toxic pigment lead white made by a long and laborious process br A plain white toga known as a toga virilis was worn for ceremonial occasions by all Roman citizens over the age of Magistrates and certain priests wore a toga praetexta with a broad purple stripe br In the time of the Emperor Augustus no Roman man was allowed to appear in the Roman forum without a toga br The ancient Romans had two words for white albus a plain white the source of the word albino and candidus a brighter white A man who wanted public office in Rome wore a white toga brightened with chalk called a toga candida the origin of the word candidate The Latin word candere meant to shine to be bright It was the origin of the words candle and candid br In ancient Rome the priestesses of the goddess Vesta dressed in white linen robes a white palla or shawl and a white veil They protected the sacred fire and the penates of Rome White symbolized their purity loyalty and chastity br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Postclassical history br The early Christian church adopted the Roman symbolism of white as the color of purity sacrifice and virtue It became the color worn by priests during Mass the color worn by monks of the Cistercian Order and under Pope Pius V a former monk of the Dominican Order it became the official color worn by the pope himself Monks of the Order of Saint Benedict dressed in the white or gray of natural undyed wool but later changed to black the color of humility and penitence br Postclassical history art the white lamb became the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ on behalf of mankind John the Baptist described Christ as the lamb of God who took the sins of the world upon himself The white lamb was the center of one of the most famous paintings of the Medieval period the Ghent Altarpiece by Jan van Eyck br White was also the symbolic color of the transfiguration The Gospel of Saint Mark describes Jesus clothing in this event as shining exceeding white as snow Artists such as Fra Angelico used their skill to capture the whiteness of his garments In his painting of the transfiguration at the Convent of Saint Mark in Florence Fra Angelico emphasized the white garment by using a light gold background placed in an almond shaped halo br The white unicorn was a common subject of Postclassical history manuscripts paintings and tapestries It was a symbol of purity chastity and grace which could only be captured by a virgin It was often portrayed in the lap of the Virgin Mary br During the Postclassical history painters rarely ever mixed colors but in the Renaissance the influential humanist and scholar Leon Battista Alberti encouraged artists to add white to their colors to make them lighter brighter and to add hilaritas or gaiety Many painters followed his advice and the palette of the Renaissance was considerably brighter br br br Modern history br Until the th century white was commonly worn by widows as a color of mourning The widows of the kings of France wore white until Anne of Brittany in the th century A white tunic was also worn by many knights along with a red cloak which showed the knights were willing to give their blood for the king or Church br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br th and th centuries br White was the dominant color of architectural interiors in the Baroque period and especially the Rococo style that followed it in the th century Church interiors were designed to show the power glory and wealth of the church They seemed to be alive filled with curves asymmetry mirrors gilding statuary and reliefs unified by white br White was also a fashionable color for both men and women in the th century Men in the aristocracy and upper classes wore powdered white wigs and white stockings and women wore elaborate embroidered white and pastel gowns br After the French Revolution a more austere white blanc cass became the most fashionable color in women s costumes which were modeled after the outfits of Ancient Greece and Republican Rome Because of the rather revealing design of these dresses the women wearing them were called les merveilleuses the marvellous by French men of that era The Empire style under Emperor Napol on I was modeled after the more conservative outfits of Ancient Imperial Rome The dresses were high in fashion but low in warmth considering the more severe weather conditions of northern France in the former wife of Napoleon Jos phine de Beauharnais caught pneumonia and died after taking a walk in the cold night air with Tsar Alexander I of Russia br White was the universal color of both men and women s underwear and of sheets in the th and th centuries It was unthinkable to have sheets or underwear of any other color The reason was simple the manner of washing linen in boiling water caused colors to fade When linen was worn out it was collected and turned into high quality paper br The th century American painter James McNeill Whistler working at the same time as the French impressionists created a series of paintings with musical titles where he used color to create moods the way composers used music His painting Symphony in White No The White Girl which used his mistress Joanna Hiffernan as a model used delicate colors to portray innocence and fragility and a moment of uncertainty br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br th and st centuries br The White movement was the opposition that formed against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War which followed the Russian Revolution in It was finally defeated by the Bolsheviks in and many of its members emigrated to Europe br At the end of the th century lead white was still the most popular pigment but between and chemical companies in Norway and the United States began to produce titanium white made from titanium oxide It had first been identified in the th century by the German chemist Martin Klaproth who also discovered uranium It had twice the covering power of lead white and was the brightest white pigment known By percent of the white pigments sold were titanium white br The absoluteness of white appealed to modernist painters It was used in its simplest form by the Russian suprematist painter Kazimir Malevich in his painting the white square the companion to his earlier black square It was also used by the Dutch modernist painter Piet Mondrian His most famous paintings consisted of a pure white canvas with grid of vertical and horizontal black lines and rectangles of primary colors br Black and white also appealed to modernist architects such as Le Corbusier He said a house was a machine for living in and called for a calm and powerful architecture built of reinforced concrete and steel without any ornament or frills Almost all the buildings of contemporary architect Richard Meier such as his museum in Rome to house the ancient Roman Ara Pacis or Altar of Peace are stark white in the tradition of Le Corbusier br br br br br br br br br br br br Scientific understanding color science br Light is perceived by the human visual system as white when the incoming light to the eye stimulates all three types of color sensitive cone cells in the eye in roughly equal amounts Materials that do not emit light themselves appear white if their surfaces reflect back most of the light that strikes them in a diffuse way br br br White light br br br br br br br br br br br In Isaac Newton demonstrated that white light was composed of multiple colors by passing it through a prism to break it up into components then using a second prism to reassemble them Before Newton most scientists believed that white was the fundamental color of light br White light can be generated by the sun by stars or by earthbound sources such as fluorescent lamps white LEDs and incandescent bulbs On the screen of a color television or computer white is produced by mixing the primary colors of light red green and blue RGB at full intensity a process called additive mixing see image above White light can be fabricated using light with only two wavelengths for instance by mixing light from a red and cyan laser or yellow and blue lasers This light will however have very few practical applications since color rendering of objects will be greatly distorted br The fact that light sources with vastly different spectral power distributions can result in a similar sensory experience is due to the way the light is processed by the visual system One color that arises from two different spectral power distributions is called a metamerism br Many of the light sources that emit white light emit light at almost all visible wavelengths sun light incandescent lamps of various Color temperatures This has led to the notion that white light can be defined as a mixture of all colors or all visible wavelengths br A range of spectral distributions of light sources can be perceived as white there is no single unique specification of white light For example when buying a white light bulb one might buy one labeled K K etc which produce light having very different spectral distributions and yet this will not prevent the user from identifying the color of objects that those light bulbs illuminate br br br White objects br Color vision allows us to distinguish different objects by their color In order to do so color constancy can keep the perceived color of an object relatively unchanged when the illumination changes among various broad whitish spectral distributions of light br The same principle is used in photography and cinematography where the choice of white point determines a transformation of all other color stimuli Changes in or manipulation of the white point can be used to explain some optical illusions such as The dress br While there is no single unique specification of white light there is indeed a unique specification of white object or more specifically white surface br A perfectly white surface diffusely reflects scatters all visible light that strikes it without absorbing any irrespective of the light s wavelength or spectral distribution br Since it does not absorb any of the incident light white is the lightest possible color br If the reflection is not diffuse but rather specular this describes a mirror rather than a white surface br Reflection of of incident light at all wavelengths is a form of uniform reflectance so white is an achromatic color meaning a color without hue The color stimulus produced by the perfect diffuser is usually considered to be an achromatic stimulus for all illuminants except for those whose light sources appear to be highly chromatic br Color constancy is achieved by chromatic adaptation The International Commission on Illumination defines white adapted as a color stimulus that an observer who is chromatically adapted to the viewing environment would judge to be perfectly achromatic and to have a luminance factor of unity The color stimulus that is considered to be the adapted white may be different at different locations within a scene br br br White features in nature br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Beaches with sand containing high amounts of quartz or eroded limestone also appear white since quartz and limestone reflect or scatter sunlight rather than absorbing it Tropical white sand beaches may also have a high quantity of white calcium carbonate from tiny bits of seashells ground to fine sand by the action of the waves br The White Cliffs of Dover take their white color from the large amount of chalk made of limestone which they contain which reflects the sunlight br Snow is a mixture of air and tiny ice crystals When white sunlight enters snow very little of the spectrum is absorbed almost all of the light is reflected or scattered by the air and water molecules so the snow appears to be the color of sunlight white Sometimes the light bounces around inside the ice crystals before being scattered making the snow seem to sparkle br In the case of glaciers the ice is more tightly pressed together and contains little air As sunlight enters the ice more light of the red spectrum is absorbed so the light scattered will be bluish br Clouds are white for the same reason as ice They are composed of water droplets or ice crystals mixed with air very little light that strikes them is absorbed and most of the light is scattered appearing to the eye as white Shadows of other clouds above can make clouds look gray and some clouds have their own shadow on the bottom of the cloud br Many mountains with winter or year round snow cover are named accordingly Mauna Kea means white mountain in Hawaiian Mont Blanc means white mountain in French Changbai Mountains literally meaning perpetually white mountains marks the border between China and Korea br br br White materials br br br br br br br br br br br Chalk is a type of limestone made of the mineral calcite or calcium carbonate It was originally deposited under the sea as the scales or plates of tiny micro organisms called Coccolithophore It was the first white pigment used by prehistoric artists in cave paintings The chalk used on blackboards today is usually made of gypsum or calcium sulphate a powder pressed into sticks br Bianco di San Giovanni is a pigment used in the Renaissance which was described by the painter Cennino Cennini in the th century It is similar to chalk made of calcium carbonate with calcium hydroxide It was made of dried lime which was made into a powder then soaked in water for eight days with the water changed each day It was then made into cakes and dried in the sun br Lead white was being produced during the th century BC the process is described is Pliny the Elder Vitruvius and the ancient Greek author Theophrastus Pieces of lead were put into clay pots which had a separate compartment filled with vinegar The pots in turn were piled on shelves close to cow dung The combined fumes of the vinegar and the cow dung caused the lead to corrode into lead carbonate It was a slow process which could take a month or more It made an excellent white and was used by artists for centuries but it was also toxic It was replaced in the th century by zinc white and titanium white br Titanium white is the most popular white for artists today it is the brightest available white pigment and has twice the coverage of lead white It first became commercially available in It is made out of titanium dioxide from the minerals brookite anatase rutile or ilmenite currently the major source Because of its brilliant whiteness it is used as a colorant for most toothpaste and sunscreen br Zinc white is made from zinc oxide It is similar to but not as opaque as titanium white It is added to some foods to enrich them with zinc an important nutrient Chinese white is a variety of zinc white made for artists br Some materials can be made to look whiter than white this is achieved using optical brightener agents OBA These are chemical compounds that absorb light in the ultraviolet and violet region usually nm of the electromagnetic spectrum and re emit light in the blue region typically nm OBAs are often used in paper and clothing to create an impression of very bright white This is due to the fact that the materials actually send out more visible light than they receive br br br Bleach and bleaching br Bleaching is a process for whitening fabrics which has been practiced for thousands of years Sometimes it was simply a matter of leaving the fabric in the sun to be faded by the bright light In the th century several scientists developed varieties of chlorine bleach including sodium hypochlorite and calcium hypochlorite bleaching powder Bleaching agents that do not contain chlorine most often are based on peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate While most bleaches are oxidizing agents a fewer number are reducing agents such as sodium dithionite br Bleaches attack the chromophores the part of a molecule which absorbs light and causes fabrics to have different colors An oxidizing bleach works by breaking the chemical bonds that make up the chromophore This changes the molecule into a different substance that either does not contain a chromophore or contains a chromophore that does not absorb visible light A reducing bleach works by converting double bonds in the chromophore into single bonds This eliminates the ability of the chromophore to absorb visible light br Sunlight acts as a bleach through a similar process High energy photons of light often in the violet or ultraviolet range can disrupt the bonds in the chromophore rendering the resulting substance colorless br Some detergents go one step further they contain fluorescent chemicals which glow making the fabric look literally whiter than white br br br In the natural world br br br Astronomy br br A white dwarf is a stellar remnant composed mostly of electron degenerate matter They are very dense a white dwarf s mass is comparable to that of the Sun and its volume is comparable to that of the Earth Its faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy A white dwarf is very hot when it is formed but since it has no source of energy it will gradually radiate away its energy and cool down This means that its radiation which initially has a high color temperature will lessen and redden with time Over a very long time a white dwarf will cool to temperatures at which it will no longer emit significant heat or light and it will become a cold black dwarf However since no white dwarf can be older than the Age of the universe approximately billion years even the oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins and no black dwarfs are thought to exist yet br An A type main sequence star A V or A dwarf star is a main sequence hydrogen burning star of spectral type A and luminosity class V These stars have spectra which are defined by strong hydrogen Balmer absorption lines They have masses from to times the mass of the Sun and surface temperatures between and K br br br Biology br White animals use their color as a form of camouflage in winter Animals such as penguins are countershaded with white bellies again as camouflage br br br br br br br

the other events of the life of Christ such as Corpus Christi Sunday and Trinity Sunday It is also worn at the services dedicated to the Virgin Mary and to those Saints who were not martyred as well as other special occasions such as the ordination of priests and the installation of new bishops Within the hierarchy of the church lighter colors indicated higher rank ordinary priests wore black

considerably and reflects regional as well as religious influences Ihram is typically worn during Dhu al Hijjah the last month in the Islamic calendar br White also has a long history of use as a religious and political symbol in Islam beginning with the white banner that tradition ascribes to the Quraysh the tribe to which Muhammad belonged The Umayyad dynasty also used white as its dynastic color following the personal banner of its founder Mu awiya I while the Shi ite Fatimids also chose white to highlight their opposition to the Sunni Abbasid Caliphate whose color was black br In Judaism during the rituals of Yom Kippur the ceremony of atonement the rabbi dresses in white as do the members of the congregation to restore the bonds between God and his followers br In the traditional Japanese religion of Shinto an area of white gravel or stones marks a sacred place called a niwa These places were dedicated to the kami spirits which had descended from the heavens or had come across the sea Later temples of Zen Buddhism in Japan often featured a Zen garden where white sand or gravel was carefully raked to resemble rivers or streams designed as objects of meditation br

other ancient temples of Greece and the buildings of the Roman Forum were mostly made of or clad in white marble though it is now known that some of these ancient buildings were actually brightly painted The Roman tradition of using white stone for government buildings and churches was revived in the Renaissance and especially in the neoclassic style of the th and th centuries White stone became the material of choice for government buildings in Washington D C and other American cities European cathedrals were also usually built of white or light colored stone though many darkened over the centuries from smoke and soot br The Renaissance architect and scholar Leon Battista Alberti wrote in that churches should be plastered white on the inside since white was the only appropriate
