and convert it to heat br A new museum structure located in the middle of an urban park was initially controversial San Francisco voters twice defeated bond measures that were to fund the new museum project After the second defeat the museum itself planned to relocate to a location in the financial district However an effort led by generous supporters arose and kept the museum in the Golden Gate Park br The designers were sensitive to the appearance of the building in its natural setting Walter Hood a landscape architect based in Oakland designed the museum s new gardens The entire exterior is clad in sq ft m of copper which is expected to eventually oxidize and take on a greenish tone and a distinct texture to echo the nearby eucalyptus trees In order to further harmonize with the surroundings shapes were cut into the top to reveal gardens and courtyards where trees had been planted the giant tree ferns that form a backdrop for the museum entrance are particularly dramatic acres square meters of new landscaping were planted as well with transplanted trees and historic boulders The building is clad with variably perforated and dimpled copper plates whose patina will slowly change through exposure to the elements This exterior facade was developed and fabricated by engineers at Zahner A ft m observation tower allows visitors to see much of Golden Gate Park s Music Concourse see below and rises above the Park s treetops providing a view of the Golden Gate and Marin Headlands br The twisting foot m tall tower is a distinctive feature and can be seen rising above
