Web colors are colors used in displaying web pages on the World Wide Web they can be described by way of three methods a color may be specified as an RGB triplet in hexadecimal format a hex triplet or according to its common English name in some cases A color tool or other graphics software is often used to generate color values In some uses hexadecimal color codes are specified with notation using a leading number sign A color is specified according to the intensity of its red green and blue components each represented by eight bits Thus there are bits used to specify a web color within the sRGB gamut and colors that may be so specified br Colors outside the sRGB gamut can be specified in Cascading Style Sheets by making one or more of the red green and blue components negative or greater than so the color space is theoretically an unbounded extrapolation of sRGB similar to scRGB Specifying a non sRGB color this way requires the RGB function call It is impossible with the hexadecimal syntax and thus impossible in legacy HTML documents that do not use CSS br The first versions of Mosaic and Netscape Navigator used the X color names as the basis for their color lists as both started as X Window System applications br Web colors have an unambiguous colorimetric definition sRGB which relates the chromaticities of a particular phosphor set a given transfer curve adaptive whitepoint and viewing conditions These have been chosen to be similar to many real world monitors and viewing conditions to allow rendering to be fairly close to the specified values even without color management User agents vary in the fidelity with which they represent the specified colors More advanced user agents use color management to provide better color fidelity this is particularly important for Web to print applications br br br Hex triplet br A hex triplet is a six digit or eight digit three byte or four byte hexadecimal number used in HTML CSS SVG and other computing applications to represent colors The bytes represent the red green and blue components of the color The optional fourth byte refers to alpha channel One byte represents a number in the range to FF in hexadecimal notation or to in decimal notation This represents the least to the most intensity of each of the color components Thus web colors specify colors in the bit RGB color scheme The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation in the following order br br Byte red value color type red br Byte green value color type green br Byte blue value color type blue br Byte optional alpha value br For example consider the color where the red green blue values are decimal numbers red green blue a hardwood brown color The decimal numbers and are equivalent to the hexadecimal numbers B A and E respectively The hex triplet is obtained by concatenating the six hexadecimal digits together B A E in this example br If any one of the three color values is less than hex decimal it must be represented with a leading zero so that the triplet always has exactly six digits For example the decimal triplet would be represented by the hex digits forming the hex triplet br The number of colors that can be represented by this system is or or br br br Shorthand hexadecimal form br An abbreviated three hexadecimal digit or four digit form can be used but can cause errors if software or maintenance scripts are only expecting the long form Expanding this form to the six digit form is as simple as repeating each digit C becomes CC as presented on the following CSS example br br This shorthand form reduces the palette to colors equivalent of bit color as opposed to bit color using the whole six digit form colors This limitation is sufficient for many text based documents br br br Converting RGB to hexadecimal br br RGB values are usually given in the range if they are in the range the values are multiplied by before conversion This number divided by sixteen integer division ignoring any remainder gives the first hexadecimal digit between and F where the letters A to F represent the numbers to See hexadecimal for more details The remainder gives the second hexadecimal digit For instance the RGB value as shown in the previous example of hex triplets divides into groups of thus the first digit is A remainder of ten gives the hexadecimal number A Likewise the RGB value divides into groups of thus the first digit is C A remainder of nine gives the hexadecimal number C This process is repeated for each of the three color values br Conversion between number bases is a common feature of calculators including both hand held models and the software calculators bundled with most modern operating systems Web based tools specifically for converting color values are also available br br br HTML color names br Recent W C specifications of color names distinguishes between basic and extended colors In HTML and XHTML colors can be used for text background color frame borders tables and individual table cells br br br Basic colors br The basic colors are colors defined in the HTML specification ratified in as follows names are defined in this context to be case insensitive br br These were labelled as sRGB and included in the HTML specification which noted they were the standard colors supported with the Windows VGA palette br br br Extended colors br br Extended colors are the result of merging specifications from HTML CSS SVG and CSS User Interfaces CSS UI br Several colors are defined by web browsers A particular browser may not recognize all of these colors but as of all modern general use graphical browsers support the full list of colors Many of these colors are from the list of X color names distributed with the X Window System These colors were standardized by SVG and are accepted by SVG Full user agents They are not part of SVG Tiny br The list of colors shipped with the X product varies between implementations and clashes with certain of the HTML names such as green X colors are defined as simple RGB hence no particular color space rather than sRGB This means that the list of colors found in X e g in usr lib X rgb txt should not directly be used to choose colors for the web br The list of web X colors from the CSS specification along with their hexadecimal and decimal equivalents is shown below Compare the alphabetical lists in the W C standards This includes the common synonyms aqua HTML CSS standard name and cyan common sRGB name fuchsia HTML CSS standard name and magenta common sRGB name gray HTML CSS standard name and grey br br br CSS colors br The Cascading Style Sheets specification defines the same number of named colors as the HTML spec namely the HTML colors and colors from the Netscape X color list for a total of names that were recognized by Internet Explorer IE and Netscape Navigator Blooberry com notes that Opera and Safari also included Netscape s expanded list of color names but later discovered names not included with Opera on Windows br In CSS the color orange one of the was added to the section with the HTML colors as a th color The CSS specification did not include orange in the HTML color keywords section which was renamed as Basic color keywords In the same reference the SVG color keywords section was renamed Extended color keywords after starting out as X color keywords in an earlier working draft The working draft for the level color module combines the Basic and Extended sections together in a simple Named Colors section br br CSS SVG and CSS allow web authors to use system colors which are color names whose values are taken from the operating system picking the operating system s highlighted text color or the background color for tooltip controls This enables web authors to style their content in line with the operating system of the user agent The CSS color module has deprecated the use of system colors in favor of CSS UI System Appearance property which itself was subsequently dropped from CSS br br The CSS specification also introduces HSL color space values to style sheets br br CSS also supports the special color transparent which represents an alpha value of zero by default transparent is rendered as an invisible nominal black rgba It was introduced in CSS but its scope of use has expanded over the versions br br br CSS Color br Level of the CSS Color specification introduced several new CSS color formats br Besides new ways to write colors it also introduces the concept of mixing colors in a non sRGB color space a first step towards fixing a well known issue in color gradients Some sections explaining color theory and common operations like gamut mapping are also added to aid implementation br br br Device independent color br CSS Color introduces several different formats for device independent color that can display the entirety of visible color in a capable screen including br br Lab and LCH br OKLab and OKLCH preferred over Lab LCH br XYZ D or D default br br br Predefined color spaces br A number of RGB spaces with gamuts that are wider than sRGB are also introduced through the new color function br br Display P br Prophoto br REC br Adobe RGB br A linearized variant of sRGB is also defined for color mixing br br br Other formats br On June the CSS WG added the color RebeccaPurple to the Editor s Draft of the Colors module level to commemorate Eric Meyer s daughter Rebecca who died on June her sixth birthday br br CSS also introduces the HWB color model as an alternative to HSL HSV br br br CSS Color br The draft CSS Color specification introduces syntax for mixing and manipulating existing colors including br br A color mix function for mixing colors br Relative color syntax for manipulating components of an existing color br Custom color spaces are also supported via ICC profiles This allows the use of CMYK on web pages br br br Web safe colors br br In the mid s many displays were only capable of displaying colors dictated by the hardware or changeable by a color table When a color was found e g in an image that was not available a different one had to be used This was done by either using the closest color or by using dithering br There were various attempts to make a standard color palette A set of colors was needed that could be shown without dithering on color displays the number was chosen partly because computer operating systems customarily reserved sixteen to twenty colors for their own use it was also selected because it allowed exactly six equally spaced shades of red green and blue each from to FF including both limits br The list of colors was presented as if it had special properties that render it immune to dithering but on color displays applications could actually set a palette of any selection of colors that they chose dithering the rest These colors were chosen specifically because they matched the palettes selected by various browser applications There were not very different palettes in use in different browsers br Web safe colors had a flaw in that on systems such as X where the palette is shared between applications smaller color cubes or were allocated by browsers the web safe colors would dither on such systems Different results were obtained by providing an image with a larger range of colors and allowing the browser to quantize the color space if needed rather than suffer the quality loss of a double quantization br Through the s use of color displays in personal computers dropped sharply in favour of bit TrueColor displays and the use of web safe colors has fallen into practical disuse br The web safe colors do not all have standard names but each can be specified by an RGB triplet each component red green and blue takes one of the six values from the following table out of the possible values available for each component in full bit color br br The following table shows all of the web safe colors One shortcoming of the web safe palette is its small range of light colors for webpage backgrounds whereas the intensities at the low end of the range such as the two darkest are similar to each other making them hard to distinguish Values flanked by asterisk are part of the really safe palette see Safest web colors below br br br Color table br br Each color code listed is a shorthand for the RGB value For example code is equivalent to RGB code or HEX code br br br Safest web colors br Designers were encouraged to stick to these web safe colors in their websites because there were a lot of bit color displays when the color palette was developed David Lehn and Hadley Stern discovered that only of the colors in the web safe palette are reliably displayed without inconsistent remapping on bit computer displays They called these colors the really safe palette it consists largely of shades of green yellow and cyan br br br Accessibility br br br Color selection br Some browsers and devices do not support colors For these displays or blind and colorblind users Web content depending on colors can be unusable or difficult to use br Either no colors should be specified to invoke the browser s default colors or both the background and all foreground colors such as the colors of plain text unvisited links hovered links active links and visited links should be specified to avoid black on black or white on white effects br br br Color contrast br The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines recommend a contrast ratio of at least between the relative luminance of text and its background color or at least for large text Enhanced accessibility requires contrast ratios greater than br However addressing accessibility concerns is not simply a matter of increasing the contrast ratio As a report to the Web Accessibility Initiative indicates dyslexic readers are better served by contrast ratios below the maximum The recommendations they refer to of off black A A A on off white FFFFE and black on creme FAFAC have contrast ratios of and respectively Among their other color pairs brown on dark green A A has a contrast ratio of which is less than the WCAG recommendation dark brown E E on light green B B has a contrast ratio of and blue D on yellow FFFF has a contrast ratio of The colors named in the report use different color values than the web colors of the same name br br br See also br br br br br br External links br CSS color value on MDN Web Docs br CSS Color Specification br Web colors at Curlie
