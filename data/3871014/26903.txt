The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it It was formed about billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc The Sun is a typical star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core releasing this energy from its outer photosphere Astronomers classify it as a G type main sequence star br The largest objects that orbit the Sun are the eight planets In order from the Sun they are four terrestrial planets Mercury Venus Earth and Mars two gas giants Jupiter and Saturn and two ice giants Uranus and Neptune All terrestrial planets have solid surfaces Inversely all giant planets do not have a definite surface as they are mainly composed of gases and liquids Over of the Solar System s mass is in the Sun and nearly of the remaining mass is in Jupiter and Saturn br There is a strong consensus among astronomers that the Solar System has at least nine dwarf planets Ceres Orcus Pluto Haumea Quaoar Makemake Gonggong Eris and Sedna There are a vast number of small Solar System bodies such as asteroids comets centaurs meteoroids and interplanetary dust clouds Some of these bodies are in the asteroid belt between Mars s and Jupiter s orbit and the Kuiper belt just outside Neptune s orbit Six planets seven dwarf planets and other bodies have orbiting natural satellites which are commonly called moons br The Solar System is constantly flooded by the Sun s charged particles the solar wind forming the heliosphere Around astronomical units from the Sun the solar wind is halted resulting in the heliopause This is the boundary of the Solar System to interstellar space The outermost region of the Solar System is the theorized Oort cloud the source for long period comets extending to a radius of AU The closest star to the Solar System Proxima Centauri is light years AU away Both stars belong to the Milky Way galaxy br br br Formation and evolution br br br Past br br The Solar System formed at least billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud This initial cloud was likely several light years across and probably birthed several stars As is typical of molecular clouds this one consisted mostly of hydrogen with some helium and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars br As the pre solar nebula collapsed conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster The center where most of the mass collected became increasingly hotter than the surroundings As the contracting nebula spun faster it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly AU and a hot dense protostar at the center The planets formed by accretion from this disc in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other coalescing to form ever larger bodies Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System but they either merged or were destroyed or ejected leaving the planets dwarf planets and leftover minor bodies br Due to their higher boiling points only metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner Solar System close to the Sun within the frost line They would eventually form the rocky planets of Mercury Venus Earth and Mars Because these refractory materials only comprised a small fraction of the solar nebula the terrestrial planets could not grow very large br The giant planets Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune formed further out beyond the frost line the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium the lightest and most abundant elements Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt Kuiper belt and Oort cloud br Within million years the pressure and density of hydrogen in the center of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear fusion As helium accumulates at its core the Sun is growing brighter early in its main sequence life its brightness was that of what it is today The temperature reaction rate pressure and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved the thermal pressure counterbalancing the force of gravity At this point the Sun became a main sequence star Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space br Following the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk the Nice model proposes that gravitational encounters between planetisimals and the gas giants caused each to migrate into different orbits This led to dynamical instability of the entire system which scattered the planetisimals and ultimately placed the gas giants in their current positions During this period the grand tack hypothesis suggests that a final inward migration of Jupiter dispersed much of the asteroid belt leading to the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner planets br br br Present and future br The Solar System remains in a relatively stable slowly evolving state by following isolated gravitationally bound orbits around the Sun Although the Solar System has been fairly stable for billions of years it is technically chaotic and may eventually be disrupted There is a small chance that another star will pass through the Solar System in the next few billion years Although this could destabilize the system and eventually lead millions of years later to expulsion of planets collisions of planets or planets hitting the Sun it would most likely leave the Solar System much as it is today br br The Sun s main sequence phase from beginning to end will last about billion years for the Sun compared to around two billion years for all other subsequent phases of the Sun s pre remnant life combined The Solar System will remain roughly as it is known today until the hydrogen in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium which will occur roughly billion years from now This will mark the end of the Sun s main sequence life At that time the core of the Sun will contract with hydrogen fusion occurring along a shell surrounding the inert helium and the energy output will be greater than at present The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly times its current diameter and the Sun will become a red giant Because of its increased surface area the surface of the Sun will be cooler K F at its coolest than it is on the main sequence br The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury as well as Venus and render Earth uninhabitable possibly destroying it as well Eventually the core will be hot enough for helium fusion the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle Its outer layers will be ejected into space leaving behind a dense white dwarf half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth The ejected outer layers may form a planetary nebula returning some of the material that formed the Sun but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon to the interstellar medium br br br General characteristics br Astronomers sometimes divide the Solar System structure into separate regions The inner Solar System includes Mercury Venus Earth Mars and the bodies in the asteroid belt The outer Solar System includes Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune and the bodies in the Kuiper belt Since the discovery of the Kuiper belt the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune br br br Composition br br The principal component of the Solar System is the Sun a G type main sequence star star that contains of the system s known mass and dominates it gravitationally The Sun s four largest orbiting bodies the giant planets account for of the remaining mass with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than The remaining objects of the Solar System including the four terrestrial planets the dwarf planets moons asteroids and comets together comprise less than of the Solar System s total mass br The Sun is composed of roughly hydrogen and helium as are Jupiter and Saturn A composition gradient exists in the Solar System created by heat and light pressure from the early Sun those objects closer to the Sun which are more affected by heat and light pressure are composed of elements with high melting points Objects farther from the Sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting points The boundary in the Solar System beyond which those volatile substances could coalesce is known as the frost line and it lies at roughly five times the Earth s distance from the Sun br br br Orbits br br The planets and other large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth s orbit known as the ecliptic Smaller icy objects such as comets frequently orbit at significantly greater angles to this plane Most of the planets in the Solar System have secondary systems of their own being orbited by natural satellites called moons All of the largest natural satellites are in synchronous rotation with one face permanently turned toward their parent The four giant planets have planetary rings thin discs of tiny particles that orbit them in unison br As a result of the formation of the Solar System planets and most other objects orbit the Sun in the same direction that the Sun is rotating That is counter clockwise as viewed from above Earth s north pole There are exceptions such as Halley s Comet Most of the larger moons orbit their planets in prograde direction matching the direction of planetary rotation Neptune s moon Triton is the largest to orbit in the opposite retrograde manner Most larger objects rotate around their own axes in the prograde direction relative to their orbit though the rotation of Venus is retrograde br To a good first approximation Kepler s laws of planetary motion describe the orbits of objects around the Sun These laws stipulate that each object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus which causes the body s distance from the Sun to vary over the course of its year A body s closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its aphelion With the exception of Mercury the orbits of the planets are nearly circular but many comets asteroids and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits Kepler s laws only account for the influence of the Sun s gravity upon an orbiting body not the gravitational pulls of different bodies upon each other On a human time scale these perturbations can be accounted for using numerical models but the planetary system can change chaotically over billions of years br The angular momentum of the Solar System is a measure of the total amount of orbital and rotational momentum possessed by all its moving components Although the Sun dominates the system by mass it accounts for only about of the angular momentum The planets dominated by Jupiter account for most of the rest of the angular momentum due to the combination of their mass orbit and distance from the Sun with a possibly significant contribution from comets br br br Distances and scales br br The radius of the Sun is AU km mi Thus the Sun occupies part in of the volume of a sphere with a radius the size of Earth s orbit whereas Earth s volume is roughly millionth that of the Sun Jupiter the largest planet is AU from the Sun and has a radius of km AU mi whereas the most distant planet Neptune is AU from the Sun br With a few exceptions the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun the larger the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearest object to the Sun For example Venus is approximately AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury whereas Saturn is AU out from Jupiter and Neptune lies AU out from Uranus Attempts have been made to determine a relationship between these orbital distances like the Titius Bode law and Johannes Kepler s model based on the Platonic solids but ongoing discoveries have invalidated these hypotheses br Some Solar System models attempt to convey the relative scales involved in the Solar System in human terms Some are small in scale and may be mechanical called orreries whereas others extend across cities or regional areas The largest such scale model the Sweden Solar System uses the meter foot Avicii Arena in Stockholm as its substitute Sun and following the scale Jupiter is a meter foot sphere at Stockholm Arlanda Airport km mi away whereas the farthest current object Sedna is a cm in sphere in Lule km mi away br If the Sun Neptune distance is scaled to meters ft then the Sun would be about cm in in diameter roughly two thirds the diameter of a golf ball the giant planets would be all smaller than about mm in and Earth s diameter along with that of the other terrestrial planets would be smaller than a flea mm or in at this scale br br br Habitability br br Besides solar energy the primary characteristic of the Solar System enabling the presence of life is the heliosphere and planetary magnetic fields for those planets that have them These magnetic fields partially shield the Solar System from high energy interstellar particles called cosmic rays The density of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium and the strength of the Sun s magnetic field change on very long timescales so the level of cosmic ray penetration in the Solar System varies though by how much is unknown br The zone of habitability of the Solar System is conventionally located in the inner Solar System where planetary surface or atmospheric temperatures admit the possibility of liquid water Habitability might be possible in subsurface oceans of various outer Solar System moons br br br Comparison with extrasolar systems br br Compared to many extrasolar systems the Solar System stands out in lacking planets interior to the orbit of Mercury The known Solar System lacks super Earths planets between one and ten times as massive as the Earth although the hypothetical Planet Nine if it does exist could be a super Earth orbiting in the edge of the Solar System br Uncommonly it has only small terrestrial and large gas giants elsewhere planets of intermediate size are typical both rocky and gas so there is no gap as seen between the size of Earth and of Neptune with a radius times as large As many of these super Earths are closer to their respective stars than Mercury is to the Sun a hypothesis has arisen that all planetary systems start with many close in planets and that typically a sequence of their collisions causes consolidation of mass into few larger planets but in case of the Solar System the collisions caused their destruction and ejection br The orbits of Solar System planets are nearly circular Compared to many other systems they have smaller orbital eccentricity Although there are attempts to explain it partly with a bias in the radial velocity detection method and partly with long interactions of a quite high number of planets the exact causes remain undetermined br br br Sun br br The Sun is the Solar System s star and by far its most massive component Its large mass Earth masses which comprises of all the mass in the Solar System produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium This releases an enormous amount of energy mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light br Because the Sun fuses hydrogen at its core it is a main sequence star More specifically it is a G type main sequence star where the type designation refers to its effective temperature Hotter main sequence stars are more luminous but shorter lived The Sun s temperature is intermediate between that of the hottest stars and that of the coolest stars Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars known as red dwarfs make up about of the fusor stars in the Milky Way br The Sun is a population I star having formed in the spiral arms of the Milky Way galaxy It has a higher abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium metals in astronomical parlance than the older population II stars in the galactic bulge and halo Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars so the first generation of stars had to die before the universe could be enriched with these atoms The oldest stars contain few metals whereas stars born later have more This higher metallicity is thought to have been crucial to the Sun s development of a planetary system because the planets formed from the accretion of metals br The region of space dominated by the Solar magnetosphere is the heliosphere which spans much of the Solar System Along with light the Sun radiates a continuous stream of charged particles a plasma called the solar wind This stream spreads outwards at speeds from kilometers per hour mph to kilometers per hour mph filling the vacuum between the bodies of the Solar System The result is a thin dusty atmosphere called the interplanetary medium which extends to at least AU br Activity on the Sun s surface such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections disturbs the heliosphere creating space weather and causing geomagnetic storms Coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field and huge quantities of material from the surface of the Sun The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth s magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth s upper atmosphere where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles The largest stable structure within the heliosphere is the heliospheric current sheet a spiral form created by the actions of the Sun s rotating magnetic field on the interplanetary medium br br br Inner Solar System br The inner Solar System is the region comprising the terrestrial planets and the asteroids Composed mainly of silicates and metals the objects of the inner Solar System are relatively close to the Sun the radius of this entire region is less than the distance between the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn This region is within the frost line which is a little less than AU from the Sun br br br Inner planets br br The four terrestrial or inner planets have dense rocky compositions few or no moons and no ring systems They are composed largely of refractory minerals such as silicates which form their crusts and mantles and metals such as iron and nickel which form their cores Three of the four inner planets Venus Earth and Mars have atmospheres substantial enough to generate weather all have impact craters and tectonic surface features such as rift valleys and volcanoes br br Mercury AU from the Sun is the smallest planet in the Solar System Its surface is greyish with an expansive rupes cliff system generated from thrust faults and bright ray systems formed by impact event remnants In the past Mercury was volcanically active producing smooth basaltic plains similar to the Moon It is likely that Mercury has a silicate crust and a large iron core Mercury has a very tenuous atmosphere consisting of solar wind particles and ejected atoms Mercury has no natural satellites br Venus AU has a reflective whitish atmosphere that is mainly composed of carbon dioxide At the surface the atmospheric pressure is ninety times as dense as on Earth s sea level Venus is the hottest planet with surface temperatures over C F mainly due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere The planet lacks a protective magnetic field to protect against stripping by the solar wind which suggests that its atmosphere is sustained by volcanic activity Its surface displays extensive evidence of volcanic activity with stagnant lid tectonics Venus has no natural satellites br Earth AU is the only place in the universe where life and surface liquid water are known to exist Earth s atmosphere contains nitrogen and oxygen which is the result of the presence of life The planet has a complex climate and weather system with conditions differing drastically between climate regions The solid surface of Earth is dominated by green vegetation deserts and white ice sheets Earth s surface is shaped by plate tectonics that formed the continental masses Earth s planetary magnetosphere shields the surface from radiation limiting atmospheric stripping and maintaining life habitability br The Moon is Earth s only natural satellite Its diameter is one quarter the size of Earth s Its surface is covered in very fine regolith and dominated by impact craters Large dark patches on the Moon maria are formed from past volcanic activity The Moon s atmosphere is extremely thin consisting of a partial vacuum with particle densities of under per cm br Mars AU has a radius about half of that of Earth Most of the planet is red due to iron oxide in Martian soil and the polar regions are covered in white ice caps made of water and carbon dioxide Mars has an atmosphere composed mostly of carbon dioxide with surface pressure of that of Earth which is sufficient to support some weather phenomena Its surface is peppered with volcanoes and rift valleys and has a rich collection of minerals Mars has a highly differentiated internal structure and lost its magnetosphere billion years ago Mars has two tiny moons br Phobos is Mars s inner moon It is a small irregularly shaped object with a mean radius of km mi Its surface is very unreflective and dominated by impact craters In particular Phobos s surface has a very large Stickney impact crater that is roughly km mi in radius br Deimos is Mars s outer moon Like Phobos it is irregularly shaped with a mean radius of km mi and its surface reflects little light However the surface of Deimos is noticeably smoother than Phobos because the regolith partially covers the impact craters br br br Asteroids br br Asteroids except for the largest Ceres are classified as small Solar System bodies and are composed mainly of carbonaceous refractory rocky and metallic minerals with some ice They range from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers in size Many asteroids are divided into asteroid groups and families based on their orbital characteristics Some asteroids have natural satellites that orbit them that is asteroids that orbit larger asteroids br Mercury crossing asteroids are those with perihelia within the orbit of Mercury At least are known to date and include the closest objects to the Sun known in the Solar System No vulcanoids asteroids between the orbit of Mercury and the Sun have been discovered As of one asteroid has been discovered to orbit completely within Venus s orbit Ayl chaxnim br Venus crossing asteroids are those that cross the orbit of Venus There are as of br Near Earth asteroids have orbits that approach relatively close to Earth s orbit and some of them are potentially hazardous objects because they might collide with Earth in the future br Mars crossing asteroids are those with perhihelia above AU which cross the orbit of Mars As of NASA lists confirmed Mars crossing asteroids br br br Asteroid belt br The asteroid belt occupies a torus shaped region between and AU from the Sun which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter It is thought to be remnants from the Solar System s formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter The asteroid belt contains tens of thousands possibly millions of objects over one kilometer in diameter Despite this the total mass of the asteroid belt is unlikely to be more than a thousandth of that of Earth The asteroid belt is very sparsely populated spacecraft routinely pass through without incident br br Below are the descriptions of the three largest bodies in the asteroid belt They are all considered to be relatively intact protoplanets a precursor stage before becoming a fully formed planet see List of exceptional asteroids br br Ceres AU is the only dwarf planet in the asteroid belt It is the largest object in the belt with a diameter of km mi Its surface contains a mixture of carbon frozen water and hydrated minerals There are signs of past cryovolcanic activity where volatile material such as water are erupted onto the surface as seen in surface bright spots Ceres has a very thin water vapor atmosphere but practically speaking it is indistinguishable from a vacuum br Vesta AU is the second largest object in the asteroid belt Its fragments survive as the Vesta asteroid family and numerous HED meteorites found on Earth Vesta s surface dominated by basaltic and metamorphic material has a denser composition than Ceres s Its surface is marked by two giant craters Rheasilvia and Veneneia br Pallas AU is the third largest object in the asteroid belt It has its own Pallas asteroid family Not much is known about Pallas because it has never been visited by a spacecraft though its surface is predicted to be composed of silicates br Hilda asteroids are in a resonance with Jupiter that is they go around the Sun three times for every two Jovian orbits They lie in three linked clusters between Jupiter and the main asteroid belt br br br Outer Solar System br The outer region of the Solar System is home to the giant planets and their large moons The centaurs and many short period comets orbit in this region Due to their greater distance from the Sun the solid objects in the outer Solar System contain a higher proportion of volatiles such as water ammonia and methane than those of the inner Solar System because the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid without significant rates of sublimation br br br Outer planets br br The four outer planets called giant planets or Jovian planets collectively make up of the mass known to orbit the Sun All four giant planets have multiple moons and a ring system although only Saturn s rings are easily observed from Earth Jupiter and Saturn are composed mainly of gases with extremely low melting points such as hydrogen helium and neon hence their designation as gas giants Uranus and Neptune are ice giants meaning they are significantly composed of ice in the astronomical sense as in chemical compounds with melting points of up to a few hundred kelvins such as water methane ammonia hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide Icy substances comprise the majority of the satellites of the giant planets and small objects that lie beyond Neptune s orbit br br Jupiter AU is the biggest and most massive planet in the Solar System On the surface there are orange brown and white cloud bands moving via the principles of atmospheric circulation with giant storms swirling on the surface such as the Great Red Spot and various white ovals Jupiter possesses a very strong magnetosphere enough to redirect ionizing radiation and cause auroras on its poles As of Jupiter has confirmed satellites which can roughly be sorted into three groups br The Amalthea group consisting of Metis Adrastea Amalthea and Thebe They orbit substantially closer to Jupiter than other satellites Materials from these natural satellites are the source of Jupiter s faint ring br The Galilean moons consisting of Ganymede Callisto Io and Europa They are the largest moons of Jupiter and exhibit planetary properties br Irregular satellites consisting of substantially smaller natural satellites They have more distant orbits than objects listed above br Saturn AU has a distinctive visible ring system orbiting around its equator which is composed of small ice and rock particles Like Jupiter it is mostly made of hydrogen and helium At its north and south poles Saturn has peculiar hexagon shaped storms larger than the diameter of Earth Saturn has a magnetosphere capable of producing weak auroras As of Saturn has confirmed satellites grouped as follows br Ring moonlets and shepherds which orbit inside or close to Saturn s rings A moonlet can only partially clear out dust in their orbit while the ring shepherds are able to completely clear out dust forming visible gaps in the rings br Inner large satellites consisting of Mimas Enceladus Tethys and Dione These satellites all orbits within Saturn s E ring They are all composed mostly of water ice and are believed to have differentiated internal structure br Trojan moons consisting of Calypso and Telesto trojans of Tethys and Helene and Polydeuces trojans of Dione These small moons share their orbits with Tethys and Dione leading or trailing behind either br Outer large satellites consisting of Rhea Titan Hyperion and Iapetus In particular Titan is the only satellite in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere br Irregular satellites consisting of substantially smaller natural satellites They have more distant orbits than the objects listed above Phoebe is the largest irregular satellite of Saturn br Uranus AU uniquely among the planets orbits the Sun on its side as its axial tilt is This gives the planet extreme seasonal variation as each pole points toward and then away from the Sun Uranus s outer layer has a muted cyan color but underneath these clouds contain many mysteries about its climate phenomena such as its unusually low internal heat and erratic cloud formation As of Uranus has confirmed satellites which are divided into three groups br Inner satellites which orbit inside Uranus s ring system They are very close to each other which suggest that their orbits are chaotic br Large satellites consisting of Titania Oberon Umbriel Ariel and Miranda Most of them have a roughly equal amounts rock and ice except Miranda which is made primarily of ice br Irregular satellites having more distant and eccentric orbits than objects listed above br Neptune AU is the furthest planet known in the Solar System Its outer atmosphere has a slightly muted cyan color with occasional storms on the surface that look like dark spots Like Uranus many atmospheric phenomena of Neptune are still unexplained such as the thermosphere s abnormally high temperature or the strong tilt of its magnetosphere As of Neptune has confirmed satellites which are divided into two groups br Regular satellites which have circular orbits that lie near Neptune s equator br Irregular satellites which as the name implies have less regular orbits One of them Triton is Neptune s largest moon It is geologically active with erupting geysers of nitrogen gas and possesses a thin cloudy nitrogen atmosphere br br br Centaurs and trojans br br The centaurs are icy comet like bodies whose semi major axes are greater than Jupiter s and less than Neptune s between and AU These are former Kuiper belt and scattered disc objects SDOs that were gravitationally perturbed closer to the Sun by the outer planets and are expected to become comets or get ejected out of the Solar System While most centaurs are inactive and asteroid like some exhibit clear cometary activity such as the first centaur discovered Chiron which has been classified as a comet P because it develops a coma just as comets do when they approach the Sun The largest known centaur Chariklo has a diameter of about km mi and is one of the only few minor planets known to possess a ring system br Trojans are bodies located in within another body s gravitationally stable Lagrange points L ahead in its orbit or L behind in its orbit Every planet except Mercury and Saturn is known to possess at least trojan The Jupiter trojan population is roughly equal to that of the asteroid belt After Jupiter Neptune possesses the most confirmed trojans at br br br Trans Neptunian region br Beyond the orbit of Neptune lies the area of the trans Neptunian region with the doughnut shaped Kuiper belt home of Pluto and several other dwarf planets and an overlapping disc of scattered objects which is tilted toward the plane of the Solar System and reaches much further out than the Kuiper belt The entire region is still largely unexplored It appears to consist overwhelmingly of many thousands of small worlds the largest having a diameter only a fifth that of Earth and a mass far smaller than that of the Moon composed mainly of rock and ice This region is sometimes described as the third zone of the Solar System enclosing the inner and the outer Solar System br br br Kuiper belt br br The Kuiper belt is a great ring of debris similar to the asteroid belt but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice It extends between and AU from the Sun It is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies although the largest few are probably large enough to be dwarf planets There are estimated to be over Kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than km mi but the total mass of the Kuiper belt is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth Many Kuiper belt objects have satellites and most have orbits that are substantially inclined to the plane of the ecliptic br The Kuiper belt can be roughly divided into the classical belt and the resonant trans Neptunian objects The latter have orbits whose periods are in a simple ratio to that of Neptune for example going around the Sun twice for every three times that Neptune does or once for every two The classical belt consists of objects having no resonance with Neptune and extends from roughly to AU Members of the classical Kuiper belt are sometimes called cubewanos after the first of their kind to be discovered originally designated QB and has since been named Albion they are still in near primordial low eccentricity orbits br Currently there is strong consensus among astronomers that five members of the Kuiper belt are dwarf planets Many dwarf planet candidates are being considered pending further data for verification br br Orcus AU is in the same orbital resonance with Neptune as Pluto and is the largest such object after Pluto itself Its eccentricity and inclination are similar to Pluto s but its perihelion lies about from that of Pluto Thus the phase of Orcus s orbit is opposite to Pluto s Orcus is at aphelion most recently in around when Pluto is at perihelion most recently in and vice versa For this reason it has been called the anti Pluto It has one known moon Vanth br Pluto AU is the largest known object in the Kuiper belt Pluto has a relatively eccentric orbit inclined degrees to the ecliptic plane Pluto has a resonance with Neptune meaning that Pluto orbits twice around the Sun for every three Neptunian orbits Kuiper belt objects whose orbits share this resonance are called plutinos Pluto has five moons Charon Styx Nix Kerberos and Hydra br Charon the largest of Pluto s moons is sometimes described as part of a binary system with Pluto as the two bodies orbit a barycenter of gravity above their surfaces i e they appear to orbit each other br Haumea AU was discovered in It is in a temporary orbital resonance with Neptune Haumea possesses a ring system two known moons named Hi iaka and Namaka and rotates so quickly once every hours that it is stretched into an ellipsoid It is part of a collisional family of Kuiper belt objects that share similar orbits which suggests a giant impact on Haumea ejected fragments into space billions of years ago br Makemake AU although smaller than Pluto is the largest known object in the classical Kuiper belt that is a Kuiper belt object not in a confirmed resonance with Neptune Makemake is the brightest object in the Kuiper belt after Pluto Discovered in it was officially named in Its orbit is far more inclined than Pluto s at It has one known moon S br Quaoar AU is the second largest known object in the classical Kuiper belt after Makemake Its orbit is significantly less eccentric and inclined than those of Makemake or Haumea It possesses a ring system and one known moon Weywot br br br Scattered disc br br The scattered disc which overlaps the Kuiper belt but extends out to near AU is thought to be the source of short period comets Scattered disc objects are believed to have been perturbed into erratic orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune s early outward migration Most scattered disc objects have perihelia within the Kuiper belt but aphelia far beyond it some more than AU from the Sun SDOs orbits can be inclined up to from the ecliptic plane Some astronomers consider the scattered disc to be merely another region of the Kuiper belt and describe scattered disc objects as scattered Kuiper belt objects Some astronomers classify centaurs as inward scattered Kuiper belt objects along with the outward scattered residents of the scattered disc br Currently there is strong consensus among astronomers that two of the bodies in the scattered disc are dwarf planets br br Eris AU is the largest known scattered disc object and the most massive known dwarf planet Eris s discovery contributed to a debate about the definition of a planet because it is more massive than Pluto and about the same diameter It has one known moon Dysnomia Like Pluto its orbit is highly eccentric with a perihelion of AU roughly Pluto s distance from the Sun and an aphelion of AU and steeply inclined to the ecliptic plane at an angle of br Gonggong AU is a dwarf planet in a comparable orbit to Eris except that it is in a resonance with Neptune It has one known moon Xiangliu br br br Extreme trans Neptunian objects br br Some objects in the Solar System have a very large orbit and therefore are much less affected by the known giant planets than other minor planet populations These bodies are called extreme trans Neptunian objects or ETNOs for short Generally ETNOs semi major axes are at least AU wide For example Lele k honua orbits the Sun once every years with a distance of AU from the Sun br This population is divided into three subgroups by astronomers The scattered ETNOs have perihelia around AU and an exceptionally high eccentricity of more than As with the regular scattered disc objects they were likely formed as result of gravitational scattering by Neptune and still interact with the giant planets The detached ETNOs with perihelia approximately between and AU are less affected by Neptune than the scattered ETNOs but are still relatively close to Neptune The sednoids or inner Oort cloud objects with perihelia beyond AU are too far from Neptune to be strongly influenced by it br Currently there is one ETNO that is classified as a dwarf planet br br Sedna AU was the first extreme trans Neptunian object to be discovered It is a large reddish object and it takes years for Sedna to complete one orbit Mike Brown who discovered the object in asserts that it cannot be part of the scattered disc or the Kuiper belt because its perihelion is too distant to have been affected by Neptune s migration The sednoid population is named after Sedna br br br Edge of the heliosphere br br The Sun s stellar wind bubble the heliosphere a region of space dominated by the Sun has its boundary at the termination shock Based on the Sun s peculiar motion relative to the local standard of rest this boundary is roughly AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly AU from the Sun downwind Here the solar wind collides with the interstellar medium and dramatically slows condenses and becomes more turbulent forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath br The heliosheath has been theorized to look and behave very much like a comet s tail extending outward for a further AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind Evidence from the Cassini and Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field but the actual shape remains unknown br The shape and form of the outer edge of the heliosphere is likely affected by the fluid dynamics of interactions with the interstellar medium as well as solar magnetic fields prevailing to the south e g it is bluntly shaped with the northern hemisphere extending AU farther than the southern hemisphere The heliopause is considered the beginning of the interstellar medium Beyond the heliopause at around AU lies the bow shock a plasma wake left by the Sun as it travels through the Milky Way Large objects outside the heliopause remain gravitationally bound to the sun but the flow of matter in the interstellar medium homogenizes the distribution of micro scale objects br br br Miscellaneous populations br br br Comets br br Comets are small Solar System bodies typically only a few kilometers across composed largely of volatile ices They have highly eccentric orbits generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto When a comet enters the inner Solar System its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise creating a coma a long tail of gas and dust often visible to the naked eye br Short period comets have orbits lasting less than two hundred years Long period comets have orbits lasting thousands of years Short period comets are thought to originate in the Kuiper belt whereas long period comets such as Hale Bopp are thought to originate in the Oort cloud Many comet groups such as the Kreutz sungrazers formed from the breakup of a single parent Some comets with hyperbolic orbits may originate outside the Solar System but determining their precise orbits is difficult Old comets whose volatiles have mostly been driven out by solar warming are often categorized as asteroids br br br Meteoroids meteors and dust br br Solid objects smaller than one meter are usually called meteoroids and micrometeoroids grain sized with the exact division between the two categories being debated over the years By the IAU designated any solid object having a diameter between micrometers and meter as meteoroids and depreciated the micrometeoroid categorization instead terms smaller particles simply as dust particles br Some meteoroids formed via disintegration of comets and asteroids while a few formed via impact debris ejected from planetary bodies Most meteoroids are made of silicates and heavier metals like nickel and iron When passing through the Solar System comets produce a trail of meteoroids it is hypothesized that this is caused either by vaporization of the comet s material or by simple breakup of dormant comets When crossing an atmosphere these meteoroids will produce bright streaks in the sky due to atmospheric entry called meteors If a stream of meteoroids enter the atmosphere on parallel trajectories the meteors will seemingly radiate from a point in the sky hence the phenomenon s name meteor shower br The inner Solar System is home to the zodiacal dust cloud which is visible as the hazy zodiacal light in dark unpolluted skies It may be generated by collisions within the asteroid belt brought on by gravitational interactions with the planets a more recent proposed origin is materials from planet Mars The outer Solar System hosts a cosmic dust cloud It extends from about AU to about AU and was probably created by collisions within the Kuiper belt br br br Boundary area and uncertainties br br Much of the Solar System is still unknown Areas beyond thousands of AU away are still virtually unmapped and learning about this region of space is difficult Study in this region depends upon inferences from those few objects whose orbits happen to be perturbed such that they fall closer to the Sun and even then detecting these objects has often been possible only when they happened to become bright enough to register as comets Many objects may yet be discovered in the Solar System s uncharted regions br The Oort cloud is a theorized spherical shell of up to a trillion icy objects that is thought to be the source for all long period comets No direct observation of the Oort cloud is possible with present imaging technology It is theorized to surround the Solar System at roughly AU ly from the Sun and possibly to as far as AU ly The Oort cloud is thought to be composed of comets that were ejected from the inner Solar System by gravitational interactions with the outer planets Oort cloud objects move very slowly and can be perturbed by infrequent events such as collisions the gravitational effects of a passing star or the galactic tide the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way br As of the s a few astronomers have hypothesized that Planet Nine a planet beyond Neptune might exist based on statistical variance in the orbit of extreme trans Neptunian objects Their closest approaches to the Sun are mostly clustered around one sector and their orbits are similarly tilted suggesting that a large planet might be influencing their orbit over millions of years However some astronomers said that this observation might be credited to observational biases or just sheer coincidence br The Sun s gravitational field is estimated to dominate the gravitational forces of surrounding stars out to about two light years AU Lower estimates for the radius of the Oort cloud by contrast do not place it farther than AU Most of the mass is orbiting in the region between and AU The furthest known objects such as Comet West have aphelia around AU from the Sun The Sun s Hill sphere with respect to the galactic nucleus the effective range of its gravitational influence is thought to extend up to a thousand times farther and encompasses the hypothetical Oort cloud It was calculated by G A Chebotarev to be AU br br br Celestial neighborhood br br Within light years of the Sun there are relatively few stars the closest being the triple star system Alpha Centauri which is about light years away and may be in the Local Bubble s G Cloud Alpha Centauri A and B are a closely tied pair of Sun like stars whereas the closest star to Sun the small red dwarf Proxima Centauri orbits the pair at a distance of light years In a potentially habitable exoplanet was found to be orbiting Proxima Centauri called Proxima Centauri b the closest confirmed exoplanet to the Sun br The Solar System is surrounded by the Local Interstellar Cloud although it is not clear if it is embedded in the Local Interstellar Cloud or if it lies just outside the cloud s edge Multiple other interstellar clouds exist in the region within light years of the Sun known as the Local Bubble The latter feature is an hourglass shaped cavity or superbubble in the interstellar medium roughly light years across The bubble is suffused with high temperature plasma suggesting that it may be the product of several recent supernovae br The Local Bubble is a small superbubble compared to the neighboring wider Radcliffe Wave and Split linear structures formerly Gould Belt each of which are some thousands of light years in length All these structures are part of the Orion Arm which contains most of the stars in the Milky Way that are visible to the unaided eye br Groups of stars form together in star clusters before dissolving into co moving associations A prominent grouping that is visible to the naked eye is the Ursa Major moving group which is around light years away within the Local Bubble The nearest star cluster is Hyades which lies at the edge of the Local Bubble The closest star forming regions are the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex and the Taurus molecular cloud the latter lies just beyond the Local Bubble and is part of the Radcliffe wave br Stellar flybys that pass within light years of the Sun occur roughly once every years The closest well measured approach was Scholz s Star which approached to AU of the Sun some thousands years ago likely passing through the outer Oort cloud There is a chance every billion years that a star will pass within AU of the Sun potentially disrupting the Solar System br br br Galactic position br br The Solar System is located in the Milky Way a barred spiral galaxy with a diameter of about light years containing more than billion stars The Sun is part of one of the Milky Way s outer spiral arms known as the Orion Cygnus Arm or Local Spur br Its speed around the center of the Milky Way is about km s so that it completes one revolution every million years This revolution is known as the Solar System s galactic year The solar apex the direction of the Sun s path through interstellar space is near the constellation Hercules in the direction of the current location of the bright star Vega The plane of the ecliptic lies at an angle of about to the galactic plane br The Sun follows a nearly circular orbit around the Galactic Center where the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A resides at a distance of light years orbiting at roughly the same speed as that of the spiral arms If it orbited close to the center gravitational tugs from nearby stars could perturb bodies in the Oort cloud and send many comets into the inner Solar System producing collisions with potentially catastrophic implications for life on Earth In this scenario the intense radiation of the Galactic Center could interfere with the development of complex life br The Solar System s location in the Milky Way is a factor in the evolutionary history of life on Earth Spiral arms are home to a far larger concentration of supernovae gravitational instabilities and radiation that could disrupt the Solar System but since Earth stays in the Local Spur and therefore does not pass frequently through spiral arms this has given Earth long periods of stability for life to evolve However according to the controversial Shiva hypothesis the changing position of the Solar System relative to other parts of the Milky Way could explain periodic extinction events on Earth br br br Discovery and exploration br br Humanity s knowledge of the Solar System has grown incrementally over the centuries Up to the Late Middle Ages Renaissance astronomers from Europe to India believed Earth to be stationary at the center of the universe and categorically different from the divine or ethereal objects that moved through the sky Although the Greek philosopher Aristarchus of Samos had speculated on a heliocentric reordering of the cosmos Nicolaus Copernicus was the first person known to have developed a mathematically predictive heliocentric system br Heliocentrism did not triumph immediately over geocentrism but the work of Copernicus had its champions notably Johannes Kepler Using a heliocentric model that improved upon Copernicus by allowing orbits to be elliptical and the precise observational data of Tycho Brahe Kepler produced the Rudolphine Tables which enabled accurate computations of the positions of the then known planets Pierre Gassendi used them to predict a transit of Mercury in and Jeremiah Horrocks did the same for a transit of Venus in This provided a strong vindication of heliocentrism and Kepler s elliptical orbits br In the th century Galileo publicized the use of the telescope in astronomy he and Simon Marius independently discovered that Jupiter had four satellites in orbit around it Christiaan Huygens followed on from these observations by discovering Saturn s moon Titan and the shape of the rings of Saturn In Edmond Halley observed a transit of Mercury across the Sun leading him to realize that observations of the solar parallax of a planet more ideally using the transit of Venus could be used to trigonometrically determine the distances between Earth Venus and the Sun Halley s friend Isaac Newton in his magisterial Principia Mathematica of demonstrated that celestial bodies are not quintessentially different from Earthly ones the same laws of motion and of gravity apply on Earth and in the skies br br The term Solar System entered the English language by when John Locke used it to refer to the Sun planets and comets In Halley realized that repeated sightings of a comet were of the same object returning regularly once every years This was the first evidence that anything other than the planets repeatedly orbited the Sun though Seneca had theorized this about comets in the st century Careful observations of the transit of Venus allowed astronomers to calculate the average Earth Sun distance as miles km only greater than the modern value br Uranus having occasionally been observed since and possibly from antiquity was recognized to be a planet orbiting beyond Saturn by In Friedrich Bessel successfully measured a stellar parallax an apparent shift in the position of a star created by Earth s motion around the Sun providing the first direct experimental proof of heliocentrism Neptune was identified as a planet some years later in thanks to its gravitational pull causing a slight but detectable variation in the orbit of Uranus Mercury s orbital anomaly observations led to searches for Vulcan a planet interior of Mercury but these attempts were quashed with Albert Einstein s theory of general relativity in br In the th century humans began their space exploration around the Solar System starting with placing telescopes in space since the s By all eight planets have been visited by space probes Probes have returned samples from comets and asteroids as well as flown through the Sun s corona and visited two dwarf planets Pluto and Ceres To save on fuel some space missions make use of gravity assist maneuvers such as the two Voyager probes accelerating when flyby planets in the outer Solar System and the Parker Solar Probe decelerating closer towards the Sun after flyby with Venus br Humans have landed on the Moon during the Apollo program in the s and s and will return to the Moon in the s with the Artemis program Discoveries in the th and st century has prompted the redefinition of the term planet in hence the demotion of Pluto to a dwarf planet and further interest in trans Neptunian objects br br br
