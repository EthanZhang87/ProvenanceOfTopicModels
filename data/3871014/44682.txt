title: CMYK color model
id: 44682
The CMYK color model also known as process color or four color is a subtractive color model based on the CMY color model used in color printing and is also used to describe the printing process itself The abbreviation CMYK refers to the four ink plates used cyan magenta yellow and key black br The CMYK model works by partially or entirely masking colors on a lighter usually white background The ink reduces the light that would otherwise be reflected Such a model is called subtractive because inks subtract the colors red green and blue from white light white light minus red leaves cyan white light minus green leaves magenta and white light minus blue leaves yellow br In additive color models such as RGB white is the additive combination of all primary colored lights and black is the absence of color In the CMYK model it is the opposite white is the natural color of the paper or other background black results from a full combination of colored inks To save cost on ink and to produce deeper black tones unsaturated and dark colors are produced by using black ink instead of or in addition to the combination of cyan magenta and yellow br br br Halftoning br br With CMYK printing halftoning also called screening allows for less than full saturation of the primary colors tiny dots of each primary color are printed in a pattern small enough that humans perceive a solid color Magenta printed with a halftone for example produces a pink color because the eye perceives the tiny magenta dots on the large white paper as lighter and less saturated than the color of pure magenta ink Halftoning allows for a continuous variability of each color which enables continuous color mixing of the primaries Without halftoning each primary would be binary i e on off which only allows for the reproduction of eight colors white the three primaries the three secondaries and black br br br Comparison to CMY br br The CMYK color model is based on the CMY color model which omits the black ink However the imperfect black generated by mixing commercially practical cyan magenta and yellow inks is unsatisfactory so four color printing uses black ink in addition to the subtractive primaries Common reasons for using black ink include br br In traditional preparation of color separations a red keyline on the black line art marked the outline of solid or tint color areas In some cases a black keyline was used when it served as both a color indicator and an outline to be printed in black because usually the black plate contained the keyline The K in CMYK represents the keyline or black plate also sometimes called the key plate br Text is typically printed in black and includes fine detail such as serifs To avoid even slight blurring when reproducing text or other finely detailed outlines using three inks would require impractically accurate registration br A combination of cyan magenta and yellow inks soaks the paper with ink making it slower to dry causing bleeding or especially on low quality paper such as newsprint weakening the paper so much that it tears br Although a combination of cyan magenta and yellow inks should in theory completely absorb the entire visible spectrum of light and produce a perfect black practical inks fall short of their ideal characteristics and the result is actually a dark muddy color that does not quite appear black Black ink absorbs more light and yields much better blacks br Black ink is less expensive than the combination of colored inks that makes black br A black made with just CMY inks is sometimes called a composite black br When a very dark area is wanted a colored or gray CMY bedding is applied first then a full black layer is applied on top making a rich deep black this is called rich black br The amount of black to use to replace amounts of the other inks is variable and the choice depends on the technology paper and ink in use Processes called under color removal under color addition and gray component replacement are used to decide on the final mix different CMYK recipes will be used depending on the printing task br br br Other printer color models br CMYK or process color printing is contrasted with spot color printing in which specific colored inks are used to generate the colors appearing on paper Some printing presses are capable of printing with both four color process inks and additional spot color inks at the same time High quality printed materials such as marketing brochures and books often include photographs requiring process color printing other graphic effects requiring spot colors such as metallic inks and finishes such as varnish which enhances the glossy appearance of the printed piece br CMYK are the process printers which often have a relatively small color gamut Processes such as Pantone s proprietary six color CMYKOG Hexachrome considerably expand the gamut Light saturated colors often cannot be created with CMYK and light colors in general may make visible the halftone pattern Using a CcMmYK process with the addition of light cyan and magenta inks to CMYK can solve these problems and such a process is used by many inkjet printers including desktop models br br br Comparison with RGB displays br br Comparisons between RGB displays and CMYK prints can be difficult since the color reproduction technologies and properties are very different A computer monitor mixes shades of red green and blue light to create color pictures A CMYK printer instead uses light absorbing cyan magenta and yellow inks whose colors are mixed using dithering halftoning or some other optical technique br Similar to monitors the inks used in printing produce a color gamut that is only a subset of the visible spectrum although both color modes have their own specific ranges As a result of this items which are displayed on a computer monitor may not completely match the look of items which are printed if opposite color modes are being combined in both mediums When designing items to be printed designers view the colors which they are choosing on an RGB color mode their computer screen and it is often difficult to visualize the way in which the color will turn out post printing because of this br br br Spectrum of printed paper br To reproduce color the CMYK color model codes for absorbing light rather than emitting it as is assumed by RGB The K component absorbs all wavelengths and is therefore achromatic The cyan magenta and yellow components are used for color reproduction and they may be viewed as the inverse of RGB Cyan absorbs red magenta absorbs green and yellow absorbs blue R G B br br br Conversion br br Since RGB and CMYK spaces are both device dependent spaces there is no simple or general conversion formula that converts between them Conversions are generally done through color management systems using color profiles that describe the spaces being converted An ICC profile defines the bidirectional conversion between a neutral profile connection color space CIE XYZ or Lab and a selected colorspace in this case both RGB and CMYK The precision of the conversion depends on the profile itself the exact methodology and because the gamuts do not generally match the rendering intent and constraints such as ink limit br ICC profiles internally built out of lookup tables and other transformation functions are capable of handling many effects of ink blending One example is the dot gain which show up as non linear components in the color to density mapping More complex interactions such as Neugebauer blending can be modelled in higher dimension lookup tables br The problem of computing a colorimetric estimate of the color that results from printing various combinations of ink has been addressed by many scientists A general method that has emerged for the case of halftone printing is to treat each tiny overlap of color dots as one of combinations of CMY or of combinations of CMYK colors which in this context are known as Neugebauer primaries The resultant color would be an area weighted colorimetric combination of these primary colors except that the Yule Nielsen effect of scattered light between and within the areas complicates the physics and the analysis empirical formulas for such analysis have been developed in terms of detailed dye combination absorption spectra and empirical parameters br Standardization of printing practices allow for some profiles to be predefined One of them is the US Specifications for Web Offset Publications which has its ICC color profile built into some software
