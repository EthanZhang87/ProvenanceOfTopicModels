they waited until late at night to rinse the dye from their clothes running a cycle with bleach in the washing machines after leaving br The design has undergone several revisions to remove two colors for expediency and later re add those colors when they became more widely available As of the most common variant consists of six stripes with the colors red orange yellow green blue and violet Baker referred to this version of the flag as the commercial version because it came about due to practical considerations of mass production Specifically the rainbow flag lost its hot pink stripe when Baker approached the Paramount Flag Company to begin mass producing them and the hot pink fabric was too rare and expensive to include The rainbow flag lost its turquoise stripe before the Gay Freedom Day Parade as the committee organizing the parade wanted to fly the flag in two halves from the light poles along both sides of Market Street so it became a six striped flag with equal halves In March Baker created a nine stripe version of his original flag with lavender pink turquoise and indigo stripes along with the red orange yellow green and violet According to Baker the lavender stripe symbolizes diversity br br br br br br External links br br Official website br Gilbert Baker The Gay Betsy Ross on YouTube In The Life Media
