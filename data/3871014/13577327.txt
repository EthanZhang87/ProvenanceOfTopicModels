title: Atmosphere of Titan
id: 13577327
The atmosphere of Titan is the dense layer of gases surrounding Titan the largest moon of Saturn Titan is the only natural satellite in the Solar System with an atmosphere that is denser than the atmosphere of Earth and is one of two moons with an atmosphere significant enough to drive weather the other being the atmosphere of Triton Titan s lower atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen methane and hydrogen There are trace amounts of other hydrocarbons such as ethane diacetylene methylacetylene acetylene propane PAHs and of other gases such as cyanoacetylene hydrogen cyanide carbon dioxide carbon monoxide cyanogen acetonitrile argon and helium The isotopic study of nitrogen isotopes ratio also suggests acetonitrile may be present in quantities exceeding hydrogen cyanide and cyanoacetylene The surface pressure is about higher than on Earth at bars kPa which is near the triple point of methane and allows there to be gaseous methane in the atmosphere and liquid methane on the surface The orange color as seen from space is produced by other more complex chemicals in small quantities possibly tholins tar like organic precipitates br br br Observational history br The presence of a significant atmosphere was first suspected by Spanish astronomer Josep Comas i Sol who observed distinct limb darkening on Titan in from the Fabra Observatory in Barcelona Catalonia This observation was confirmed by Dutch astronomer Gerard P Kuiper in using a spectroscopic technique that yielded an estimate of an atmospheric partial pressure of methane of the order of millibars kPa Subsequent observations in the s showed that Kuiper s figures had been significant underestimates methane abundances in Titan s atmosphere were ten times higher and the surface pressure was at least double what he had predicted The high surface pressure meant that methane could only form a small fraction of Titan s atmosphere In Voyager made the first detailed observations of Titan s atmosphere revealing that its surface pressure was higher than Earth s at bars about times that of Earth s br The joint NASA ESA Cassini Huygens mission provided a wealth of information about Titan and the Saturn system in general since entering orbit on July It was determined that Titan s atmospheric isotopic abundances were evidence that the abundant nitrogen in the atmosphere came from materials in the Oort cloud associated with comets and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times It was determined that complex organic chemicals could arise on Titan including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons propylene and methane br The Dragonfly mission by NASA is planning to land a large aerial vehicle on Titan in The mission will study Titan s habitability and prebiotic chemistry at various locations The drone like aircraft will perform measurements of geologic processes and surface and atmospheric composition br br br Overview br br Observations from the Voyager space probes have shown that the Titanean atmosphere is denser than Earth s with a surface pressure about times that of Earth s Titan s atmosphere is about times as massive as Earth s overall or about times more massive on a per surface area basis It supports opaque haze layers that block most visible light from the Sun and other sources and renders Titan s surface features obscure The atmosphere is so thick and the gravity so low that humans could fly through it by flapping wings attached to their arms Titan s lower gravity means that its atmosphere is far more extended than Earth s even at a distance of km the Cassini spacecraft had to make adjustments to maintain a stable trajectory against atmospheric drag The atmosphere of Titan is opaque at many wavelengths and a complete reflectance spectrum of the surface is impossible to acquire from the outside It was not until the arrival of Cassini Huygens in that the first direct images of Titan s surface were obtained The Huygens probe was unable to detect the direction of the Sun during its descent and although it was able to take images from the surface the Huygens team likened the process to taking pictures of an asphalt parking lot at dusk br br br Vertical structure br br Titan s vertical atmospheric structure is similar to Earth They both have a troposphere stratosphere mesosphere and thermosphere However Titan s lower surface gravity creates a more extended atmosphere with scale heights of km mi in comparison to km mi on Earth Voyager data combined with data from Huygens and radiative convective models provide increased understanding of Titan s atmospheric structure br Troposphere This is the layer where a lot of the weather occurs on Titan Since methane condenses out of Titan s atmosphere at high altitudes its abundance increases below the tropopause at an altitude of km mi leveling off at a value of between km mi and the surface Methane rain haze rainout and varying cloud layers are found in the troposphere br Stratosphere The atmospheric composition in the stratosphere is nitrogen the only dense nitrogen rich atmosphere in the Solar System aside from Earth s with the remaining composed mostly of methane and hydrogen The main tholin haze layer lies in the stratosphere at about km mi In this layer of the atmosphere there is a strong temperature inversion caused by the haze due to a high ratio of shortwave to infrared opacity br Mesosphere A detached haze layer is found at about km mi within the mesosphere The temperature at this layer is similar to that of the thermosphere because of the cooling of hydrogen cyanide HCN lines br Thermosphere Particle production begins in the thermosphere This was concluded after finding and measuring heavy ions and particles This was also Cassini s closest approach in Titan s atmosphere br Ionosphere Titan s ionosphere is also more complex than Earth s with the main ionosphere at an altitude of km mi but with an additional layer of charged particles at km mi This splits Titan s atmosphere to some extent into two separate radio resonating chambers The source of natural extremely low frequency ELF waves on Titan as detected by Cassini Huygens is unclear as there does not appear to be lightning activity The main sources of Titan s ionosphere are solar irradiance Saturn s magnetospheric electrons and ions br br br br br H br

lines and galactic cosmic rays see more in br br br Atmospheric composition and chemistry br br Titan s atmospheric chemistry is diverse and complex Each layer of the atmosphere has unique chemical interactions occurring within that are then interacting with other sub layers in the atmosphere For instance the hydrocarbons are thought to form in Titan s upper atmosphere in reactions resulting from the breakup of methane by the Sun s ultraviolet light producing a thick orange smog The table below highlights the production and loss mechanisms of the most abundant photochemically produced molecules in Titan s atmosphere br br br Magnetic field br Titan s internal magnetic field is negligible and perhaps even nonexistent although studies in showed that Titan retains remnants of Saturn s magnetic field on the brief occasions when it passes outside Saturn s magnetosphere and is directly exposed to the solar wind This may ionize and carry away some molecules from the top of the atmosphere One interesting case was detected as an example of the coronal mass ejection impact onto Saturn s magnetosphere causing Titan s orbit to be exposed to the shocked solar wind in the magnetosheath This leads to the increased particle precipitation and the formation of extreme electron densities in Titan s ionosphere Its orbital distance of Saturn radii does place it within Saturn s magnetosphere occasionally However the difference between Saturn s rotational period hours and Titan s orbital period days causes a relative speed of about km s between the Saturn s magnetized plasma and Titan That can actually intensify reactions causing atmospheric loss instead of guarding the atmosphere from the solar wind br br br Chemistry of the ionosphere br In November scientists uncovered evidence of negative ions with roughly times the mass of hydrogen in Titan s ionosphere which are thought to fall into the lower regions to form the orange haze which obscures Titan s surface The smaller negative ions have been identified as linear carbon chain anions with larger molecules displaying evidence of more complex structures possibly derived from benzene These negative ions appear to play a key role in the formation of more complex molecules which are thought to be tholins and may form the basis for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons cyanopolyynes and their derivatives Remarkably negative ions such as these have previously been shown to enhance the production of larger organic molecules in molecular clouds beyond our Solar System a similarity which highlights the possible wider relevance of Titan s negative ions br br br Atmospheric circulation br br There is a pattern of air circulation found flowing in the direction of Titan s rotation from west to east In addition seasonal variation in the atmospheric circulation has also been detected Observations by Cassini of the atmosphere made in also suggest that Titan is a super rotator like Venus with an atmosphere that rotates much faster than its surface The atmospheric circulation is explained by a big Hadley circulation that is occurring from pole to pole br br br Methane cycle br br Similar to the hydrological cycle on Earth Titan features a methane cycle This methane cycle results in surface formations that resemble formations we find on Earth Lakes of methane and ethane are found across Titan s polar regions Methane condenses into clouds in the atmosphere and then precipitates onto the surface This liquid methane then flows into the lakes Some of the methane in the lakes will evaporate over time and form clouds in the atmosphere again starting the process over However since methane is lost in the thermosphere there has to be a source of methane to replenish atmospheric methane Energy from the Sun should have converted all traces of methane in Titan s atmosphere into more complex hydrocarbons within million years a short time compared to the age of the Solar System This suggests that methane must be somehow replenished by a reservoir on or within Titan itself Most of the methane on Titan is in the atmosphere Methane is transported through the cold trap at the tropopause Therefore the circulation of methane in the atmosphere influences the radiation balance and chemistry of other layers in the atmosphere If there is a reservoir of methane on Titan the cycle would only be stable over geologic timescales br br Evidence that Titan s atmosphere contains over a thousand times more methane than carbon monoxide would appear to rule out significant contributions from cometary impacts because comets are composed of more carbon monoxide than methane That Titan might have accreted an atmosphere from the early Saturnian nebula at the time of formation also seems unlikely in such a case it ought to have atmospheric abundances similar to the solar nebula including hydrogen and neon Many astronomers have suggested that the ultimate origin for the methane in Titan s atmosphere is from within Titan itself released via eruptions from cryovolcanoes br Another possible source for methane replenishment in Titan s atmosphere is methane clathrates Clathrates are compounds in which an ice lattice surrounds a gas particle much like a cage In this case methane gas is surrounded by a water crystal cage These methane clathrates could be present underneath Titan s icy surface having formed much earlier in Titan s history Through the dissociation of methane clathrates methane could be outgassed into the atmosphere replenishing the supply br On December astronomers reported viewing clouds likely made of methane moving across Titan using the James Webb Space Telescope br br br Daytime and twilight sunrise sunset skies br br Sky brightness and viewing conditions are expected to be quite different from Earth and Mars due to Titan s farther distance from the Sun AU and complex haze layers in its atmosphere The sky brightness model videos show what a typical sunny day may look like standing on the surface of Titan based on radiative transfer models br For astronauts who see with visible light the daytime sky has a distinctly dark orange color and appears uniform in all directions due to significant Mie scattering from the many high altitude haze layers The daytime sky is calculated to be times dimmer than an afternoon on Earth which is similar to the viewing conditions of a thick smog or dense fire smoke The sunsets on Titan are expected to be underwhelming events where the Sun disappears about half way up in the sky above the horizon with no distinct change in color After that the sky will slowly darken until it reaches night However the surface is expected to remain as bright as the full Moon up to Earth day after sunset br In near infrared light the sunsets resemble a Martian sunset or dusty desert sunset Mie scattering has a weaker influence at longer infrared wavelengths allowing for more colorful and variable sky conditions During the daytime the Sun has a noticeable solar corona that transitions color from white to red over the afternoon The afternoon sky brightness is times dimmer than Earth As evening time approaches the Sun is expected to disappear fairly close to the horizon Titan s atmospheric optical depth is the lowest at microns So the Sun at microns may even be visible when it is below the horizon due to atmospheric refraction Similar to images of Martian sunsets from Mars rovers a fan like corona is seen to develop above the Sun due to scattering from haze or dust at high altitudes br In regards to Saturn the planet is nearly fixed in its position in the sky because Titan s orbit is tidally locked around Saturn However there is a small east to west motion over a Titan year due to the orbital eccentricity similar to the analemma on Earth Sunlight reflected off of Saturn Saturnshine is about times weaker than solar insolation on the surface of Titan Even though Saturn appears several times bigger in the sky than the Moon in Earth s sky the outline of Saturn is masked out by the brighter Sun during the daytime Saturn may become discernible at night but only at a wavelength of microns This is due to two factors the small optical depth of Titan s atmosphere at microns and the strong m emissions from Saturn s night side In visible light Saturn will make the sky on Titan s Saturn facing side appear slightly brighter similar to an overcast night with a full moon on Earth Saturn s rings are hidden from view owing to the alignment of Titan s orbital plane and the plane of the rings Saturn is expected to show phases akin to the phases of Venus on Earth that partially illuminate the surface of Titan at night except for eclipses br From outer space Cassini images from near infrared to UV wavelengths have shown that the twilight periods phase angles are brighter than the daytime on Titan This observation has not been observed on any other planetary body with a thick atmosphere The Titanean twilight outshining the dayside is due to a combination of Titan s atmosphere extending hundreds of kilometers above the surface and intense forward Mie scattering from the haze Radiative transfer models have not reproduced this effect br br br Anti Greenhouse Effect br One of the most captivating aspects of Titan s atmosphere is the anti greenhouse effect a phenomenon that significantly shapes the moon s climate and surface conditions Unlike Earth where greenhouse gases absorb and re radiate solar energy to warm the planet Titan s atmosphere operates differently due to its high concentration of methane especially in the stratosphere This methane functions as an anti greenhouse gas by absorbing some incoming solar energy before it can reach the surface leading to cooler surface temperatures than if methane were less abundant br When comparing the atmospheric temperature profiles of Earth and Titan stark contrasts emerge On Earth the temperature typically increases as altitude decreases from to kilometers above the surface In contrast Titan s temperature profile shows a decline over the same altitude range This variation is largely due to the differing impacts of greenhouse and anti greenhouse effects in Earth s and Titan s atmospheres respectively br Moreover the dynamics of Saturn s magnetosphere may also influence the distribution of anti greenhouse gases and their settlement through Titan s atmosphere potentially causing seasonal or temporal variations in haze density Such variations could subtly alter Titan s thermal balance thereby indirectly affecting the anti greenhouse effect Titan orbits within Saturn s magnetosphere for approximately of its orbital period During this time charged particles trapped in the magnetosphere interact with Titan s upper atmosphere as the moon passes by leading to the generation of a denser haze Consequently the variability of Saturn s magnetic field over its approximately year orbital period could cause variations in these interactions potentially increasing or decreasing the haze density br Although most observed variations in Titan s atmosphere during its orbital period are typically attributed to its direct interactions with sunlight the influence of Saturn s magnetospheric changes is believed to play a non negligible role The interaction between Titan s atmosphere and Saturn s magnetic environment underscores the complex interplay between celestial bodies and their atmospheres revealing a dynamic system shaped by both internal chemical processes and external astronomical conditions future studies if approached may help to prove or disprove the impact of a changing magnetosphere on a dense atmosphere like that of Titan br It s smart to consider the anti greenhouse effect on Titan when comparing the world to other celestial bodies in the solar system Venus atmosphere for example is famously dense However Venus sees an extreme greenhouse effect that heats the planet rather than its dense atmosphere serving as a cooling mechanism Scientific comparisons between the two atmospheres could provide insights on a plethora of ideas like atmospheric formation evolution and sustainability br br br Atmospheric evolution br The persistence of a dense atmosphere on Titan has been enigmatic as the atmospheres of the structurally similar satellites of Jupiter Ganymede and Callisto are negligible Although the disparity is still poorly understood data from recent missions have provided basic constraints on the evolution of Titan s atmosphere br br Roughly speaking at the distance of Saturn solar insolation and solar wind flux are sufficiently low that elements and compounds that are volatile on the terrestrial planets tend to accumulate in all three phases Titan s surface temperature is also quite low about K C F Consequently the mass fractions of substances that can become atmospheric constituents are much larger on Titan than on Earth In fact current interpretations suggest that only about of Titan s mass is silicates with the rest consisting primarily of various H O water ices and NH H O ammonia hydrates NH which may be the original source of Titan s atmospheric N dinitrogen may constitute as much as of the NH H O mass Titan is most likely differentiated into layers where the liquid water layer beneath ice Ih may be rich in NH br br Tentative constraints are available with the current loss mostly due to low gravity and solar wind aided by photolysis The loss of Titan s early atmosphere can be estimated with the N N isotopic ratio because the lighter N is preferentially lost from the upper atmosphere under photolysis and heating Because Titan s original N N ratio is poorly constrained the early atmosphere may have had more N by factors ranging from to with certainty only in the lower factor Because N is the primary component of Titan s atmosphere the isotopic ratio suggests that much of the atmosphere has been lost over geologic time Nevertheless atmospheric pressure on its surface remains nearly times that of Earth as it began with a proportionally greater volatile budget than Earth or Mars It is possible that most of the atmospheric loss was within million years of accretion from a highly energetic escape of light atoms carrying away a large portion of the atmosphere hydrodynamic escape Such an event could be driven by heating and photolysis effects of the early Sun s higher output of X ray and ultraviolet XUV photons br Because Callisto and Ganymede are structurally similar to Titan it is unclear why their atmospheres are insignificant relative to Titan s Nevertheless the origin of Titan s N via geologically ancient photolysis of accreted and degassed NH as opposed to degassing of N from accretionary clathrates may be the key to a correct inference Had N been released from clathrates Ar and Ar that are inert primordial isotopes of the Solar System should also be present in the atmosphere but neither has been detected in significant quantities The insignificant concentration of Ar and Ar also indicates that the K temperature required to trap them and N in clathrates did not exist in the Saturnian sub nebula Instead the temperature may have been higher than K limiting even the accumulation of NH as hydrates Temperatures would have been even higher in the Jovian sub nebula due to the greater gravitational potential energy release mass and proximity to the Sun greatly reducing the NH inventory accreted by Callisto and Ganymede The resulting N atmospheres may have been too thin to survive the atmospheric erosion effects that Titan has withstood br br An alternative explanation is that cometary impacts release more energy on Callisto and Ganymede than they do at Titan due to the higher gravitational field of Jupiter That could erode the atmospheres of Callisto and Ganymede whereas the cometary material would actually build Titan s atmosphere However the H H i e D H ratio of Titan s atmosphere is nearly times lower than that of comets The difference suggests that cometary material is unlikely to be the major contributor to Titan s atmosphere Titan s atmosphere also contains over a thousand times more methane than carbon monoxide which supports the idea that cometary material is not a likely contributor since comets are composed of more carbon monoxide than methane br br br See also br Atmosphere of Venus br Atmosphere of Earth br Atmosphere of Mars br br br br br br Further reading br Roe H G Titan s Methane Weather Annual Review of Earth
