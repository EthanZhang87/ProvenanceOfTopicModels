Cyan is the color between blue and green on the visible spectrum of light It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength between and nm between the wavelengths of green and blue br In the subtractive color system or CMYK color model which can be overlaid to produce all colors in paint and color printing cyan is one of the primary colors along with magenta and yellow In the additive color system or RGB color model used to create all the colors on a computer or television display cyan is made by mixing equal amounts of green and blue light Cyan is the complement of red it can be made by the removal of red from white Mixing red light and cyan light at the right intensity will make white light br br br Shades and variations br Different shades of cyan can vary in terms of hue chroma also known as saturation intensity or colorfulness or lightness or value tone or brightness or any combination of these characteristics Differences in value can also be referred to as tints and shades with a tint being a cyan mixed with white and a shade being mixed with black br Color nomenclature is subjective Many shades of cyan with a bluish hue are called blue Similarly those with a greenish hue are referred to as green A cyan with a dark shade is commonly known as teal A teal blue shade leans toward the blue end of the spectrum Variations of teal with a greener tint are commonly referred to as teal green br Turquoise reminiscent of the stone with the same name is a shade in the green spectrum of cyan hues Celeste is a lightly tinted cyan that represents the color a clear sky Other colors in the cyan color range are electric blue aquamarine and others described as blue green br br br History br Cyan boasts a rich and diverse history holding cultural significance for millennia In ancient civilizations turquoise valued for its aesthetic appeal served as a highly regarded precious gem Turquoise comes in a variety of shades from green to blue but cyan hues are particularly prevalent Approximately years ago an intricately crafted dragon shaped treasure made from over pieces of turquoise and jade was created This artifact is widely recognized as the oldest Chinese dragon totem by many Chinese scholars br Turquoise jewelry also held significant importance among the Aztecs who often featured this precious gemstone in vibrant frescoes for both symbolic and decorative purposes The Aztecs revered turquoise associating its color with the heavens and sacredness Additionally ancient Egyptians interpreted cyan hues as representing faith and truth while Tibetans viewed them as a symbol of infinity br After earlier uses in various contexts cyan hues found increased use in diverse cultures due to their appealing aesthetic qualities in religious structures and art pieces For example the prominent dome of the Goharshad Mosque in Iran built in showcases this trend Additionally Jacopo da Pontormo s use of a teal shade for Mary s robe in the painting Carmignano Visitation demonstrates the allure for these hues During the th century speakers of the English language began using the term turquoise to describe the cyan color of objects that resembled the color of the stone br In the s the French sculptor Fr d ric Bartholdi began the construction of what would later become the Statue of Liberty Over time exposure to the elements caused the copper structure to develop its distinctive patina now recognized as iconic cyan Following this there was a significant advancement in the use of cyan during the late th and early th centuries br Impressionist artists such as Claude Monet in his renowned Water Lilies effectively incorporated cyan hues into their works Deviating from traditional interpretations of local color under neutral lighting conditions the focus of artists was on accurately depicting perceived color and the influence of light on altering object hues Specifically daylight plays a significant role in shifting the perceived color of objects toward cyan hues In the color term teal was introduced to describe deeper shades of cyan br In the late th century while traditional nomenclature of red yellow and blue persisted the printing industry initiated a shift towards utilizing magenta and cyan inks for red and blue hues respectively This transition aimed to establish a more versatile color gamut achievable with only three primary colors In a document in the printing industry stated The four color set comprises Yellow Red magenta Blue cyan Black This practice of labeling magenta yellow and cyan as red yellow and blue persisted until As the hues evolved the printing industry maintained the use of the traditional terms red yellow and blue Consequently pinpointing the exact date of origin for CMYK in which cyan serves as a primary color proves challenging br In August the HP Deskwriter C became the first Deskwriter to offer color printing as an option It used interchangeable black and color cyan magenta and yellow inkjet print cartridges With the inclusion of cyan ink in printers the term cyan has become widely recognized in both home and office settings According to TUP Technology User Profile approximately of online American adults regularly use a home printer br br br Etymology and terminology br Its name is derived from the Ancient Greek word kyanos meaning dark blue enamel Lapis lazuli It was formerly known as cyan blue or cyan blue and its first recorded use as a color name in English was in Further origins of the color name can be traced back to a dye produced from the cornflower Centaurea cyanus br In most languages cyan is not a basic color term and it phenomenologically appears as a greenish vibrant hue of blue to most English speakers Other English terms for this borderline hue region include blue green aqua turquoise teal and grue br br br On the web and in printing br br br Web colors cyan and aqua br br The web color cyan shown at right is a secondary color in the RGB color model which uses combinations of red green and blue light to create all the colors on computer and television displays In X colors this color is called both cyan and aqua In the HTML color list this same color is called aqua br The web colors are more vivid than the cyan used in the CMYK color system and the web colors cannot be accurately reproduced on a printed page To reproduce the web color cyan in inks it is necessary to add some white ink to the printer s cyan below so when it is reproduced in printing it is not a primary subtractive color It is called aqua a name in use since because it is a color commonly associated with water such as the appearance of the water at a tropical beach br br br Process cyan br br Cyan is also one of the common inks used in four color printing along with magenta yellow and black this set of colors is referred to as CMYK In printing the cyan ink is sometimes known as printer s cyan process cyan or process blue br While both the additive secondary and the subtractive primary are called cyan they can be substantially different from one another Cyan printing ink is typically more saturated than the RGB secondary cyan depending on what RGB color space and ink are considered That is process cyan is usually outside the RGB gamut and there is no fixed conversion from CMYK primaries to RGB Different formulations are used for printer s ink so there can be variations in the printed color that is pure cyan ink This is because real world subtractive unlike additive color mixing does not consistently produce the same result when mixing apparently identical colors since the specific frequencies filtered out to produce that color affect how it interacts with other colors Phthalocyanine blue is one such commonly used pigment A typical formulation of process cyan is shown in the color box on the right br br br In science and nature br br br Color of water br Pure water is nearly colorless However it does absorb slightly more red light than blue giving significant volumes of water a bluish tint increased scattering of blue light due to fine particles in the water shifts the blue color toward green for a typically cyan net color br br br Cyan and cyanide br Cyanide derives its name from Prussian blue a blue pigment containing the cyanide ion br br br Bacteria br Cyanobacteria sometimes called blue green algae are an important link in the food chain br br br Astronomy br The planet Uranus is colored cyan because of the abundance of methane in its atmosphere Methane absorbs red light and reflects the blue green light which allows observers to see it as cyan br br br Energy br Natural gas methane used by many for home cooking on gas stoves has a cyan colored flame when burned with a mixture of air br br br Photography and film br Cyanotype or blueprint a monochrome photographic printing process that predates the use of the word cyan as a color yields a deep cyan blue colored print based on the Prussian blue pigment br Cinecolor a bi pack color process the photographer would load a standard camera with two films one orthochromatic dyed red and a panchromatic strip behind it Color light would expose the cyan record on the ortho stock which also acted as a filter exposing only red light to the panchromatic film stock br br br Medicine br Cyanosis is an abnormal blueness of the skin usually a sign of poor oxygen intake patients are typically described as being cyanotic br Cyanopsia is a color vision defect where vision is tinted blue This can be a drug induced side effect or
