Pantone LLC stylized as PANTONE is an American limited liability company headquartered in Carlstadt New Jersey and best known for its Pantone Matching System PMS a proprietary color space used in a variety of industries notably graphic design fashion design product design printing and manufacturing and supporting the management of color from design to production in physical and digital formats among coated and uncoated materials cotton polyester nylon and plastics br X Rite a supplier of color measurement instruments and software purchased Pantone for US million in October and was itself acquired by Danaher Corporation in At the end of September Danaher spun off its Environmental and Applied Solutions segment as Veralto Corporation br br br History br Pantone began in New Jersey in the s as the commercial printing company of brothers Mervin and Jesse Levine M J Levine Advertising In its founders both advertising executives hired recent Hofstra University graduate Lawrence Herbert as a part time employee Herbert used his chemistry knowledge to systematize and simplify the company s stock of pigments and production of colored inks by Herbert was running the ink and printing division at a profit while the commercial display division was US in debt he subsequently purchased the company s technological assets from the Levine Brothers for US equivalent to in and renamed them Pantone br The company s primary products include the Pantone Guides which consist of a large number of small approximately inches or cm thin cardboard or plastic sheets printed on one side with a series of related color swatches and then bound into a small fan deck For instance a particular page might contain several yellows of varying tints br The idea behind the PMS is to allow designers to color match specific colors when a design enters production stage regardless of the equipment used to produce the color This system has been widely adopted by graphic designers and reproduction and printing houses Pantone recommends that PMS Color Guides be purchased annually as their inks become yellowish over time Color variance also occurs within editions based on the paper stock used coated matte or uncoated while interedition color variance occurs when there are changes to the specific paper stock used br br br Falling out with Adobe br In a dispute between Pantone and Adobe resulted in the removal of Pantone color coordinates from Photoshop and Adobe s other design software causing colors in graphic artists digital documents to be replaced with black unless artists paid Pantone a separate monthly subscription fee Artists accused Pantone and Adobe of holding their work hostage UK artist Stuart Semple responded by releasing FREETONE a freeware clone of Pantone s color lists for use with Adobe software br br br Pantone Color Matching System br br The Pantone Color Matching System is largely a standardized color reproduction system as of it has colors By standardizing the colors different manufacturers in different locations can all refer to the Pantone system to make sure colors match without direct contact with one another br One such use is standardizing colors in the CMYK process The CMYK process is a method of printing color by using four inks cyan magenta yellow and black A majority of the world s printed material is produced using the CMYK process and there is a special subset of Pantone colors that can be reproduced using CMYK Those that are possible to simulate through the CMYK process are labeled as such within the company s guides br However about of the Pantone system s spot colors as of year cannot be simulated with CMYK but with base pigments including black mixed in specified amounts called base colors Those colors included colors with numbers to from and some lighter colors from to in The original four digit colors introduced in were remapped into three digits br The Pantone system also later allowed for many special colors to be produced such as metallics fluorescents neons and pastels There are fluorescents from to first here are base colors so called Dayglo and from to Packaging metallics previously premium metallics are placed from to of those added later altogether base colors Silver and Rose Gold while normal metallics are placed from to first here are base colors and from to Pastels are from to with base colors being and While most of the Pantone system colors are beyond the printed CMYK gamut it was only in that Pantone began providing translations of their existing system with screen based colors Screen based colors use the RGB color model red green blue system to create various colors A lot of colors are outside sRGB The discontinued Goe system has RGB LAB SPD values with each color and has base colors while only of those new Bright Red Pink Medium Purple and Dark Blue Other were in the system before Yellow Orange Rubine Red Green Process Blue and Black that in Goe were named Medium Yellow Bright Orange Strong Red Bright Green Medium Blue and Neutral Black PMS has more basic base colors some not monopigmented Yellow Red Warm Red Rhodamine Red Purple Violet Reflex Blue Blue br Pantone colors are described by their allocated number typically referred to as for example PMS PMS colors are almost always used in branding and have even found their way into government legislation and military standards to describe the colors of flags and seals In January the Scottish Parliament debated a petition reference PE to refer to the blue in the Scottish flag as Pantone Countries such as Canada and South Korea and organizations such as the FIA have also chosen to refer to specific Pantone colors to use when producing flags US states including Texas have set legislated PMS colors of their flags br br br Pantone Goe System br On September Pantone introduced the Goe System Goe consisted of new colors in a new matching and numbering system In addition to the standard swatch books now called the GoeGuide the new system also included adhesive backed GoeSticks interactive software tools and an online community where users were able to share color swatches and information br The Goe system was streamlined to use fewer base colors ten plus clear coating for reflections only base colors were new and accommodate many technical challenges in reproducing colors on a press br The Pantone Goe system was discontinued in November but new base colors were added into PMS and some of new colors too though those base colors are harder to purchase br br br Other products br br In mid Pantone partnering with Vermont based Fine Paints of Europe introduced a new line of interior and exterior paints The color palette uses Pantone s color research and trending and has more than colors br In November Pantone partnered with Redland London to create a collection of bags inspired from Pantone s authority on color br Pantone also produced Hexachrome a patented six color printing system In addition to custom CMYK inks Hexachrome added orange and green inks to expand the color gamut for better color reproduction It was therefore also known as a CMYKOG process Hexachrome was discontinued by Pantone in when Adobe Systems stopped supporting their HexWare plugin software In color printing system was developed adding Violet in CMYKOGV that can cover of spot colors while CMYK only about new colors were added marked XGC extended gamut coated some colors do not have a number like Process Blue XGC or Purple XGC Base colors of OGV were new mono pigment inks pigments PO PG and PV were used respectively with and hue angles br Pantone Color Manager allows for users of the Adobe Creative Suite and Creative Cloud as well as other software to import the most up to date information inclusive of L a b numbers as well as CMYK and sRGB representations of all the various palettes including chromatic adaptation under default D or D with degree or degree observer or even any ICC profile L a b numbers allow for the most accurate representation of color in a device independent manner but ideally X rite InkFormulation is needed to emulate substrates and all base colors of main Pantone system or colors of CMYKOGV Support is being phased out in favour of Pantone Connect plugin from Adobe Exchange of Creative Cloud Adobe Illustrator removed five acb files Adobe Color Books of Pantone from version since Pantone was deprecated by Pantone anyway Photoshop and Acrobat still work br br br Color of the Year br Since the Pantone Color Institute has declared a particular color Color of the Year Twice a year the company hosts in a European capital a secret meeting of representatives from various nations color standards groups After two days of presentations and debate they choose a color for the following year for example the color for summer was chosen in London in the spring of br The selected color purportedly connects with the zeitgeist for example the press release declaring Honeysuckle the color of said In times of stress we need something to lift our spirits Honeysuckle is a captivating stimulating color that gets the adrenaline going perfect to ward off the blues The results of the meeting are published in Pantone View which fashion designers florists and many other consumer oriented companies purchase to help guide their designs and planning for future products In and Pantone chose two colors for Color of the Year br br In the color of the year Tangerine Tango was used to create a makeup line in partnership with Sephora The product line named Sephora Pantone Universe collection features Tangerine Tango embellished false lashes nail lacquers cream glitters and high pigment lip glosses Emerald color was reported to be out of sRGB gamut Also new Very Peri color of is present in TCX dyed cotton reference and TPG Textile Paper Green form here TCX for sRGB hex values are mentioned br The person behind Pantone s Color of the Year executive director of the Pantone Color Institute Leatrice Eiseman explained in an interview how s Color of the Year Radiant Orchid was chosen br br I look for ascending color trends colors that are being used in broader ways and broader context than before In this case Radiant Orchid descends from the purple family which is kind of a magical color that denotes creativity and innovation Purple is just that kind of a complex interesting attracting kind of color The back story to purple is that it inspires confidence in your creativity and we re living in a world where that kind of creative innovation is greatly admired In the world of color purple is an attention getter and it has a meaning It speaks to people and we felt that it was time for the purple family to be celebrated That s why we chose the particular shade called Radiant Orchid br Pantone has said that color has always been an integral part of how a culture expresses the attitudes and emotions of the times br br br Intellectual property br Pantone asserts that their lists of color numbers and pigment values are the intellectual property of Pantone and free use of the list is not allowed This is frequently held as a reason Pantone colors cannot be supported in open source software and are not often found in low cost proprietary software Pantone has been accused of being intentionally unclear about its exact legal claims but it is acknowledged that the simplest claim would be trademark misappropriation or dilution towards someone who produced a color palette marketed as compatible with Pantone s br By contrast intellectual property scholar Aaron Perzanowski claims that Pantone has no intellectual property rights over individual colors or color libraries br br br
