Lesbian gay bisexual and transgender LGBT movements are social movements that advocate for LGBT people in society Although there is not a primary or an overarching central organization that represents all LGBT people and their interests numerous LGBT rights organizations are active worldwide The first organization to promote LGBT rights was the Scientific Humanitarian Committee founded in in Berlin br A commonly stated goal among these movements is equal rights for LGBT people often focusing on specific goals such as ending the criminalization of homosexuality or enacting same sex marriage Others have focused on building LGBT communities or worked towards liberation for the broader society from biphobia homophobia and transphobia LGBT movements organized today are made up of a wide range of political activism and cultural activity including lobbying street marches social groups media art and research br br br Overview br br Sociologist Mary Bernstein writes For the lesbian and gay movement then cultural goals include but are not limited to challenging dominant constructions of masculinity and femininity homophobia and the primacy of the gendered heterosexual nuclear family heteronormativity Political goals include changing laws and policies to gain new rights benefits and protections from harm Bernstein emphasizes that activists seek both types of goals in both the civil and political spheres br As with other social movements there is also conflict within and between LGBT movements especially about strategies for change and debates over exactly who represents the constituency of these movements and this also applies to changing education There is debate over the extent that lesbians gays bisexuals transgender people intersex people and others share common interests and a need to work together Leaders of the lesbian and gay movement of the s s and s often attempted to hide masculine lesbians feminine gay men transgender people and bisexuals from the public eye creating internal divisions within LGBT communities Roffee and Waling documented that LGBT people experience microaggressions bullying and anti social behaviors from other people within the LGBT community This is due to misconceptions and conflicting views as to what entails LGBT For example transgender people found that other members of the community were not understanding toward their own individual specific needs and would instead make ignorant assumptions and this could cause health risks Additionally bisexual people found that lesbian or gay people were not understanding or appreciative of bisexual sexuality Evidently even though most of these people would say that they stand for the same values as the majority of the community there are still remaining inconsistencies even within the LGBT community br LGBT movements have often adopted a kind of identity politics that sees gay bisexual and transgender people as a fixed class of people a minority group or groups and this is very common among LGBT communities Those using this approach aspire to liberal political goals of freedom and equal opportunity and aim to join the political mainstream on the same level as other groups in society In arguing that sexual orientation and gender identity are innate and cannot be consciously changed attempts to change gay lesbian and bisexual people into heterosexuals conversion therapy are generally opposed by the LGBT community Such attempts are often based on religious beliefs that perceive gay lesbian and bisexual activity as immoral Religion has however never been univocal opposed to either homosexuality bisexuality or transgenderism usually treating sex between men and sex between women differently As of today numerous religious communities and many believers in other religions are generally accepting of LGBT rights br However others within LGBT movements have criticized identity politics as limited and flawed elements of the queer movement have argued that the categories of gay and lesbian are restrictive and attempted to deconstruct those categories which are seen to reinforce rather than challenge a cultural system that will always mark the non heterosexual as inferior br After the French Revolution the anticlerical feeling in Catholic countries coupled with the liberalizing effect of the Napoleonic Code made it possible to sweep away sodomy laws However in Protestant countries where the church was less severe there was no general reaction against statutes that were religious in origin As a result many of those countries retained their statutes on sodomy until late in the th century However some countries have still retained their statutes on sodomy For example in a case in India s High Court was judged using a year old reading that was punishing sodomy br br br History br br br Enlightenment era br In eighteenth and nineteenth century Europe same sex sexual behavior and cross dressing were widely considered to be socially unacceptable and were serious crimes under sodomy and sumptuary laws There were however some exceptions For example in the th century cross dressing was common in plays as evident in the content of many of William Shakespeare s plays and by the actors in actual performance since female roles in Elizabethan theater were always performed by males usually prepubescent boys br Thomas Cannon wrote what may be the earliest published defense of homosexuality in English Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplify d Although only fragments of his work have survived it was a humorous anthology of homosexual advocacy written with an obvious enthusiasm for its subject It contains the argument Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms downright Nonsense Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts Are not they however constructed and consequently impelling Nature br br Social reformer Jeremy Bentham wrote the first known argument for homosexual law reform in England around at a time when the legal penalty for buggery was death by hanging His advocacy stemmed from his utilitarian philosophy in which the morality of an action is determined by the net consequence of that action on human well being He argued that homosexuality was a victimless crime and therefore not deserving of social approbation or criminal charges He regarded popular negative attitudes against homosexuality as an irrational prejudice fanned and perpetuated by religious teachings However he did not publicize his views as he feared reprisal his powerful essay was not published until br The emerging currents of secular humanist thought that had inspired Bentham also informed the French Revolution and when the newly formed National Constituent Assembly began drafting the policies and laws of the new republic in groups of militant sodomite citizens in Paris petitioned the Assembl e nationale the governing body of the French Revolution for freedom and recognition In France became the first nation to decriminalize homosexuality probably thanks in part to Jean Jacques R gis de Cambac r s who was one of the authors of the Napoleonic Code With the introduction of the Napoleonic Code in the Duchy of Warsaw also decriminalized homosexuality br In the new Penal Code of the Brazilian Empire did not repeat the title XIII of the fifth book of the Ordena es Philipinas which made sodomy a crime In an anonymous English language writer wrote a poetic defense of Captain Nicholas Nicholls who had been sentenced to death in London for sodomy br br Three years later in Switzerland Heinrich Hoessli published the first volume of Eros Die M nnerliebe der Griechen English Eros The Male Love of the Greeks another defense of same sex love br br br Emergence of LGBT movement br br In many ways social attitudes to homosexuality became more hostile during the late Victorian era In the Labouchere Amendment was included in the Criminal Law Amendment Act which criminalized any act of gross indecency with another male person a charge that was successfully invoked to convict playwright Oscar Wilde in with the most severe sentence possible under the Act br The first person known to describe himself as a drag queen was William Dorsey Swann born enslaved in Hancock Maryland Swann was the first American on record who pursued legal and political action to defend the LGBTQ community s right to assemble During the s and s Swann organized a series of drag balls in Washington D C Swann was arrested in police raids numerous times including in the first documented case of arrests for female impersonation in the United States on April br From the s social reformers began to defend homosexuality but due to the controversial nature of their advocacy kept their identities secret The Uranian poets and prose writers who sought to rehabilitate the love between men and boys and in doing so often appealed to Ancient Greece formed a rather cohesive group with a well expressed philosophy A secret British society called the Order of Chaeronea campaigned for the legalization of homosexuality The society was founded in by George Cecil Ives one of the earliest gay rights campaigners who had been working for the end of oppression of homosexuals what he called the Cause Members included Oscar Wilde Charles Kains Jackson Samuel Elsworth Cottam Montague Summers and John Gambril Nicholson Ives met Wilde at the Authors Club in London in Wilde was taken by his boyish looks and persuaded him to shave off his mustache and once kissed him passionately in the Travellers Club In Lord Alfred Douglas with whom he had a brief affair introduced Ives to several Oxford poets whom Ives also tried to recruit br John Addington Symonds was a poet and an early advocate of male love In he wrote A Problem in Greek Ethics a work of what would later be called gay history Although the Oxford English Dictionary credits the medical writer C G Chaddock for introducing homosexual into the English language in Symonds had already used the word in A Problem in Greek Ethics br Symonds also translated classical poetry on homoerotic themes and wrote poems drawing on ancient Greek imagery and language such as Eudiades which has been called the most famous of his homoerotic poems While the taboos of Victorian England prevented Symonds from speaking openly about homosexuality his works published for a general audience contained strong implications and some of the first direct references to male male sexual love in English literature By the end of his life Symonds homosexuality had become an open secret in Victorian literary and cultural circles In particular Symonds memoirs written over a four year period from to form one of the earliest known works of self conscious homosexual autobiography in English The recently decoded autobiographies of Anne Lister are an earlier example in English br Another friend of Ives was the English socialist poet Edward Carpenter Carpenter thought that homosexuality was an innate and natural human characteristic and that it should not be regarded as a sin or a criminal offense In the s Carpenter began a concerted effort to campaign against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation possibly in response to the recent death of Symonds whom he viewed as his campaigning inspiration His book on the subject The Intermediate Sex would become a foundational text of the LGBT movements of the th century Scottish anarchist John Henry Mackay also wrote in defense of same sex love and androgyny br English sexologist Havelock Ellis wrote the first objective scientific study of homosexuality in in which he treated it as a neutral sexual condition Called Sexual Inversion it was first printed in German and then translated into English a year later In the book Ellis argued that same sex relationships could not be characterized as a pathology or a crime and that its importance rose above the arbitrary restrictions imposed by society He also studied what he called inter generational relationships and that these also broke societal taboos on age difference in sexual relationships The book was so controversial at the time that one bookseller was charged in court for holding copies of the work It is claimed that Ellis coined the term homosexual but in fact he disliked the word due to its conflation of Greek and Latin br These early proponents of LGBT rights such as Carpenter were often aligned with a broader socio political movement known as free love a critique of Victorian sexual morality and the traditional institutions of family and marriage that were seen to enslave women Some advocates of free love in the early th century including Russian anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman also spoke in defense of same sex love and challenged repressive legislation br An early LGBT movement also began in Germany at the turn of the th century centering on the doctor and writer Magnus Hirschfeld In he formed the Scientific Humanitarian Committee campaign publicly against the notorious law Paragraph which made sex between men illegal Adolf Brand later broke away from the group disagreeing with Hirschfeld s medical view of the intermediate sex seeing male male sex as merely an aspect of manly virility and male social bonding Brand was the first to use outing as a political strategy claiming that German Chancellor Bernhard von B low engaged in homosexual activity br br The book Sind es Frauen Roman ber das Dritte Geschlecht English Are These Women Novel about the Third Sex by Aim e Duc was as much a political treatise as a novel criticizing pathological theories of homosexuality and gender inversion in women Anna R ling delivering a public speech in at the request of Hirschfeld became the first female Uranian activist R ling who also saw men women and homosexuals as three distinct genders called for an alliance between the women s and sexual reform movements but this speech is her only known contribution to the cause Women only began to join the previously male dominated sexual reform movement around when the German government tried to expand Paragraph to outlaw sex between women Heterosexual feminist leader Helene St cker became a prominent figure in the movement Friedrich Radszuweit published LGBT literature and magazines in Berlin e g Die Freundin br Hirschfeld whose life was dedicated to social progress for people who were transsexual transvestite and homosexual formed the Institut f r Sexualwissenschaft Institute for Sexology in The institute conducted an enormous amount of research saw thousands of transgender and homosexual clients at consultations and championed a broad range of sexual reforms including sex education contraception and women s rights However the gains made in Germany would soon be drastically reversed with the rise of Nazism and the institute and its library were destroyed in The Swiss journal Der Kreis was the only part of the movement to continue through the Nazi era br USSR s Criminal Code of decriminalized homosexuality This was a remarkable step in the USSR at the time which was very backward economically and socially and where many conservative attitudes towards sexuality prevailed This step was part of a larger project of freeing sexual relationships and expanding women s rights including legalizing abortion granting divorce on demand equal rights for women and attempts to socialize housework During Stalin s era however USSR reverted all these progressive measures re criminalizing homosexuality and imprisoning gay men and banning abortion br In English writer Radclyffe Hall published a novel titled The Well of Loneliness Its plot centers on Stephen Gordon a woman who identifies herself as an invert after reading Krafft Ebing s Psychopathia Sexualis and lives within the homosexual subculture of Paris The novel included a foreword by Havelock Ellis and was intended to be a call for tolerance for inverts by publicizing their disadvantages and accidents of being born inverted Hall subscribed to Ellis and Krafft Ebing s theories and rejected conservatively understood version of Freud s theory that same sex attraction was caused by childhood trauma and was curable br In the United States several secret or semi secret groups were formed explicitly to advance the rights of homosexuals as early as the turn of the th century but little is known about them A better documented group is Henry Gerber s Society for Human Rights formed in Chicago in which was quickly suppressed br br br Homophile movement br br Immediately following World War II a number of homosexual rights groups came into being or were revived across the Western world in Britain France Germany the Netherlands the Scandinavian countries and the United States These groups usually preferred the term homophile to homosexual emphasizing love over sex The homophile movement began in the late s with groups in the Netherlands and Denmark and continued throughout the s and s with groups in Sweden Norway the United States France Britain and elsewhere ONE Inc the first public homosexual organization in the U S was bankrolled by the wealthy transsexual man Reed Erickson A U S transgender rights journal Transvestia The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress also published two issues in br The homophile movement lobbied to establish a prominent influence in political systems of social acceptability Radicals of the s would later disparage the homophile groups for being assimilationist Any demonstrations were orderly and polite By there were dozens of homophile organizations and publications in the U S and a national organization had been formed but they were largely ignored by the media A gay march held in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia according to some historians marked the beginning of the modern gay rights movement Meanwhile in San Francisco the LGBT youth organization Vanguard was formed by Adrian Ravarour to demonstrate for equality and Vanguard members protested for equal rights during the months of April July followed by the August Compton s riot where transgender street prostitutes in the poor neighborhood of Tenderloin rioted against police harassment at a popular all night restaurant Gene Compton s Cafeteria br The Wolfenden Report was published in Britain on September after publicized convictions for homosexuality of well known men including Edward Montagu Scott rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu Disregarding the conventional ideas of the day the committee recommended that homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence All but James Adair were in favor of this and contrary to some medical and psychiatric witnesses evidence at that time found that homosexuality cannot legitimately be regarded as a disease because in many cases it is the only symptom and is compatible with full mental health in other respects The report added The law s function is to preserve public order and decency to protect the citizen from what is offensive or injurious and to provide sufficient safeguards against exploitation and corruption of others It is not in our view the function of the law to intervene in the private life of citizens or to seek to enforce any particular pattern of behavior br The report eventually led to the introduction of the Sexual Offences Bill supported by Labour MP Roy Jenkins then the Labour Home Secretary When passed the Sexual Offenses Act decriminalized homosexual acts between two men over years of age in private in England and Wales The seemingly innocuous phrase in private led to the prosecution of participants in sex acts involving three or more men e g the Bolton who were so convicted as recently as br Bisexual activism became more visible toward the end of the s in the United States In bisexual activist Robert A Martin also known as Donny the Punk founded the Student Homophile League at Columbia University and New York University In Columbia University officially recognized this group thus making them the first college in the United States to officially recognize a gay student group Activism on behalf of bisexuals in particular also began to grow especially in San Francisco One of the earliest organizations for bisexuals the Sexual Freedom League in San Francisco was facilitated by Margo Rila and Frank Esposito beginning in Two years later during a staff meeting at a San Francisco mental health facility serving LGBT people nurse Maggi Rubenstein came out as bisexual Due to this bisexuals began to be included in the facility s programs for the first time br br br Gay Liberation movement br br The new social movements of the sixties such as the Black Power and anti Vietnam war movements in the US the May insurrection in France and Women s Liberation throughout the Western world inspired many LGBT activists to become more radical and the Gay Liberation movement emerged towards the end of the decade This new radicalism is often attributed to the Stonewall riots of when a group of gay men lesbians drag queens and transgender women at a bar in New York City resisted a police raid br Immediately after Stonewall such groups as the Gay Liberation Front GLF and the Gay Activists Alliance GAA were formed Their use of the word gay represented a new unapologetic defiance as an antonym for straight respectable sexual behavior it encompassed a range of non normative sexuality and sought ultimately to free the bisexual potential in everyone rendering obsolete the categories of homosexual and heterosexual According to Gay Lib writer Toby Marotta their Gay political outlooks were not homophile but liberationist Out loud and proud they engaged in colorful street theater The GLF s A Gay Manifesto set out the aims for the fledgling gay liberation movement and influential intellectual Paul Goodman published The Politics of Being Queer Chapters of the GLF were established across the U S and in other parts of the Western world The Front homosexuel d action r volutionnaire was formed in by lesbians who split from the Mouvement Homophile de France br The Gay liberation movement overall like the gay community generally and historically has had varying degrees of gender nonconformity and assimilationist platforms among its members Early marches by the Mattachine society and Daughters of Bilitis stressed looking respectable and mainstream and after the Stonewall Uprising the Mattachine Society posted a sign in the window of the club calling for peace Gender nonconformity has always been a primary way of signaling homosexuality and bisexuality and by the late s and mainstream fashion was increasingly incorporating what by the s would be considered unisex fashions In the drag queen caucus of the GLF including Marsha P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera formed the group Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries STAR which focused on providing support for gay prisoners housing for homeless gay youth and street people especially other young street queens In Lee Brewster and Bunny Eisenhower formed the Queens Liberation Front QLF partially in protest to the treatment of the drag queens at the first Christopher Street Liberation Day March br One of the values of the movement was gay pride Within weeks of the Stonewall Riots Craig Rodwell proprietor of the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop in lower Manhattan persuaded the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations ERCHO to replace the Fourth of July Annual Reminder at Independence Hall in Philadelphia with a first commemoration of the Stonewall Riots Liberation groups including the Gay Liberation Front Queens the Gay Activists Alliance Radicalesbians and Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries STAR all took part in the first Gay Pride Week Los Angeles held a big parade on the first Gay Pride Day Smaller demonstrations were held in San Francisco Chicago and Boston br br In the United Kingdom the GLF had its first meeting in the basement of the London School of Economics on October Bob Mellors and Aubrey Walter had seen the effect of the GLF in the United States and created a parallel movement based on revolutionary politics and alternative lifestyle br By the UK GLF was recognized as a political movement in the national press holding weekly meetings of to people The GLF Manifesto was published and a series of high profile direct actions were carried out br The disruption of the opening of the Festival of Light was the best organized of GLF action The Festival of Light whose leading figures included Mary Whitehouse met at Methodist Central Hall Groups of GLF members in drag invaded and spontaneously kissed each other others released mice sounded horns and unveiled banners and a contingent dressed as workmen obtained access to the basement and shut off the lights br In the gay liberation movement in Germany and Switzerland started with Rosa von Praunheims movie It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse But the Society in Which He Lives br Easter saw the Gay Lib annual conference held in the Guild of Undergraduates Union students union building at the University of Birmingham br In May the American Psychiatric Association after years of pressure from activists changed the wording concerning homosexuality in the Sixth printing of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders from a mental disorder to that of a sexual orientation disturbance While still not a flattering description it took gay people out of the category of being automatically considered mentally ill simply for their sexual orientation br By internal disagreements had led to the movement s splintering Organizations that spun off from the movement included the London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard Gay News and Icebreakers The GLF Information Service continued for a few further years providing gay related resources GLF branches had been set up in some provincial British towns e g Bradford Bristol Leeds and Leicester and some survived for a few years longer The Leicester group founded by Jeff Martin was noted for its involvement in the setting up of the local Gayline which is still active today and has received funding from the National Lottery They also carried out a high profile campaign against the local paper the Leicester Mercury which refused to advertise Gayline s services at the time br In Sweden became the first country in the world to allow people who were transsexual by legislation to surgically change their sex and provide free hormone replacement therapy Sweden also permitted the age of consent for same sex partners to be at age making it equal to heterosexual couples br In Japan LGBT groups were established in the s In Ken Togo ran for the Upper House election br br br LGBT rights movement present br br br br Bisexuals became more visible in the LGBT rights movement in the s In a Quaker group the Committee of Friends on Bisexuality issued the Ithaca Statement on Bisexuality supporting bisexuals The Statement which may have been the first public declaration of the bisexual movement and was certainly the first statement on bisexuality issued by an American religious assembly appeared in the Quaker Friends Journal and The Advocate in In that same year the National Bisexual Liberation Group formed in New York In the San Francisco Bisexual Center opened br From the radical Gay Liberation movement of the early s arose a more reformist and single issue Gay Rights movement which portrayed gays and lesbians as a minority group and used the language of civil rights in many respects continuing the work of the homophile period In Berlin for example the radical Homosexual Action West Berlin was eclipsed by the General Homosexual Working Group br Gay and lesbian rights advocates argued that one s sexual orientation does not reflect on one s gender that is you can be a man and desire a man without any implications for your gender identity as a man and the same is true if you are a woman Gays and lesbians were presented as identical to heterosexuals in all ways but private sexual practices and butch bar dykes and flamboyant street queens were seen as negative stereotypes of lesbians and gays Veteran activists such as Sylvia Rivera and Beth Elliot were sidelined or expelled because they were transgender br In Maureen Colquhoun came out as the first Lesbian Member of Parliament MP for the Labour Party in the UK When elected she was married in a heterosexual marriage br In the groundbreaking film portraying homosexual gay icon Quentin Crisp s life The Naked Civil Servant was transmitted by Thames Television for the British Television channel ITV The British journal Gay Left also began publication After British Home Stores sacked an openly gay trainee Tony Whitehead a national campaign subsequently picketed their stores in protest br In Harvey Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors becoming the first openly gay man in the State of California to be elected to public office Milk was assassinated by a former city supervisor Dan White in br In a former Miss America contestant and orange juice spokesperson Anita Bryant began a campaign Save Our Children in Dade County Florida greater Miami which proved to be a major setback in the Gay Liberation movement Essentially she established an organization which put forth an amendment to the laws of the county which resulted in the firing of many public school teachers on the suspicion that they were homosexual br In a number of people in Sweden called in sick with a case of being homosexual in protest of homosexuality being classified as an illness This was followed by an activist occupation of the main office of the National Board of Health and Welfare Within a few months Sweden became the first country in the world to remove homosexuality as an illness br Between and the international gay community rallied behind Eliane Morissens a Belgian lesbian who had been fired from her teaching post for coming out on television and bringing attention to employment discrimination The case prompted protests articles and fundraising events throughout Europe and the Americas Articles were carried in Toronto s The Body Politic the Gay Community News of Boston and the San Francisco Sentinel The French magazine Gai pied created a support network to organize demonstrations and launched a petition drive for subscribers and members of the International Gay Association IGA to call on the Council of Europe to renounce discrimination against homosexuals The International Lesbian Information Service ILIS published information in their newsletter about letter writing campaigns and organized fund raisers and solidarity protests to help pay for Morissens legal and personal expenses and bring attention to the case Both ILIS and IGA lobbied European teachers unions in support of Morissens Though Morissens appealed the school board decision to the local council the highest court in Belgium Council of State and the European Court of Human Rights her termination was upheld at every level The LGBT community was disappointed in the outcome because each court of appeal refused to recognize or examine whether employment discrimination had occurred accepting the employer s version of events and narrowly examining freedom of expression br Lesbian feminism which was most influential from the mid s to the mid s encouraged women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men and advocated lesbianism as the logical result of feminism As with Gay Liberation this understanding of the lesbian potential in all women was at odds with the minority rights framework of the Gay Rights movement Many women of the Gay Liberation movement felt frustrated at the domination of the movement by men and formed separate organisations some who felt gender differences between men and women could not be resolved developed lesbian separatism influenced by writings such as Jill Johnston s book Lesbian Nation Organizers at the time focused on this issue Diane Felix also known as DJ Chili D in the Bay Area club scene is a Latino American lesbian once joined the Latino American queer organization GALA She was known for creating entertainment spaces specifically for queer women especially in Latino American community These places included gay bars in San Francisco such as A Little More and Colors Disagreements between different political philosophies were at times extremely heated and became known as the lesbian sex wars clashing in particular over views on sadomasochism prostitution and transsexuality The term gay came to be more strongly associated with homosexual males br In Canada the coming into effect of Section of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in saw a shift in the gay rights movement in Canada as Canadian gays and lesbians moved from liberation to litigious strategies Premised on Charter protections and on the notion of the immutability of homosexuality judicial rulings rapidly advanced rights including those that compelled the Canadian government to legalize same sex marriage It has been argued that while this strategy was extremely effective in advancing the safety dignity and equality of Canadian homosexuals its emphasis of sameness came at the expense of difference and may have undermined opportunities for more meaningful change br Mark Segal often referred to as the dean of American gay journalism disrupted the CBS evening news with Walter Cronkite in an event covered in newspapers across the country and viewed by of American households many seeing or hearing about homosexuality for the first time br Another setback in the United States occurred in when the US Supreme Court upheld a Georgia anti sodomy law in the case Bowers v Hardwick This ruling would be overturned two decades later in Lawrence v Texas br br br br br br AIDS pandemic br br Some historians posit that a new era of the gay rights movement began in the s with the emergence of AIDS As gay men became seriously ill and died in ever increasing numbers and many lesbian activists became their caregivers the leadership of many organizations was decimated Other organizations shifted their energies to focus their efforts on AIDS This era saw a resurgence of militancy with direct action groups like AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power ACT UP formed in as well as its offshoots Queer Nation and the Lesbian Avengers Some younger activists seeing gay and lesbian as increasingly normative and politically conservative began using queer as a defiant statement of all sexual minorities and gender variant people just as the earlier liberationists had done with gay Less confrontational terms that attempt to reunite the interests of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people also became prominent including various acronyms like LGBT LGBTQ and LGBTI where the Q and I stand for queer or questioning and intersex respectively br br br Warrenton War Conference br A War Conference of gay leaders was held in Warrenton Virginia in The closing statement of the conference set out a plan for a media campaign First we recommend a nation wide media campaign to promote a positive image of gays and lesbians Every national state and local must accept the responsibility We must consider the media in every project we undertake We must in addition take every advantage we can to include public service announcements and paid advertisements and to cultivate reporters and editors of newspapers radio and television To help facilitate this we need national media workshops to train our leaders And we must encourage our gay and lesbian press to increase coverage of the national process Our media efforts are fundamental to the full acceptance of us in American life But they are also a way for us to increase the funding of our movement A media campaign costs money but ultimately it may be one of our most successful fund raising devices br The statement also called for an annual planning conference to help set and modify our national agenda The Human Rights Campaign lists this event as a milestone in gay history and identifies it as where National Coming Out Day originated br On June the first Gay Pride march was celebrated in Asia in the Philippines In the Middle East LGBT organizations remain illegal and LGBT rights activists face extreme opposition from the state The s also saw the emergence of many LGBT youth movements and organizations such as LGBT youth centers gay straight alliances in high schools and youth specific activism such as the National Day of Silence Colleges also became places of LGBT activism and support for activists and LGBT people in general with many colleges opening LGBT centers br The s also saw a rapid push of the transgender movement while at the same time a sidelining of the identity of those who are transsexual In the English speaking world Leslie Feinberg published Transgender Liberation A Movement Whose Time Has Come in Gender variant peoples across the globe also formed minority rights movements Hijra activists campaigned for recognition as a third sex in India and Travesti groups began to organize against police brutality across Latin America while activists in the United States formed direct confrontation groups such as the Transexual Menace br br br st century br br br Same sex marriage br As of same sex marriages are recognized in Andorra Argentina Australia Austria Belgium Brazil

Spain Sweden Switzerland Taiwan the United Kingdom the United States and Uruguay br The Netherlands was the first country to allow same sex marriage in Following with Belgium in and Spain and Canada in South Africa became the first African nation to legalize same sex marriage in and is currently the only African nation where same sex marriage is legal Despite this uptick in tolerance of the LGBT community in South Africa so called corrective rapes have become prevalent in response primarily targeting the poorer women who live in townships and those who have no recourse in responding to the crimes because of the notable lack of police presence and prejudice they may face for reporting assaults br On October the assembly of the Church of Sweden voted strongly in favour of giving its blessing to homosexual couples including the use of the term marriage matrimony br Iceland became the first country in the world to legalize same sex marriage through a unanimous vote on June A month later Argentina became the first country in Latin America to legalize same sex marriage br On June in Obergefell v Hodges the U S Supreme Court ruled to that the Constitution requires that same sex couples be allowed to marry no matter where they live in the United States With this ruling the United States became the th country to legalize same sex marriages entirely br Between September and November Australia held a national survey on the subject of same sex marriage of respondents supported legally recognizing same sex marriage nationwide This cleared the way for a private member s bill to be debated in the federal parliament br In Taiwan became the first country in Asia to allow same sex marriage There has been a legal movement attempting to recognise marriage equality in Japan br br br Other rights br In in the case Lawrence v Texas the Supreme Court of the United States struck down sodomy laws in fourteen states making consensual homosexual sex legal in all states a significant step forward in LGBT activism and one that had been fought for by activists since the inception of modern LGBT social movements br From November to The Yogyakarta Principles on application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity was adopted by an international meeting of specialists in Yogyakarta the International Commission of Jurists and the International Service for Human Rights br During this same period some municipalities have been enacting laws against homosexuality For example Rhea County Tennessee unsuccessfully tried to ban homosexuals in br The Don t ask don t tell law forbidding homosexual people from serving openly in the United States military was repealed in This meant that gays and lesbians could now serve openly in the military without any fear of being discharged because of their sexual orientation In the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development s Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity issued a regulation to prohibit discrimination in federally assisted housing programs The new regulations ensure that the department s core housing programs are open to all eligible persons regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity br The UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity gathered signatures in the United Nations General Assembly on December br In early a series of protests organized by Add The Words Idaho and former state senator Nicole LeFavour some including civil disobedience and concomitant arrests took place in Boise Idaho which advocated adding the words sexual orientation and gender identity to the state s Human Rights act br On September consensual gay sex was legalized in India by their Supreme Court br br In June the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Civil Rights Act could protect gay and transgender people from workplace discrimination The Bostock v Clayton County decision found that protections guaranteed on the basis of sex could extend to sexual orientation and identity in areas like housing and employment Democrats such as then presidential candidate Joe Biden praised the decision Today by affirming that sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination are prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act the Supreme Court has confirmed the simple but profoundly American idea that every human being should be treated with respect and dignity Due to a lack of federal protections discrimination against LGBT people in public accommodation or the sale of goods and services by private businesses remains legal leaving vulnerable those in more than half the states in the U S br In October the Council of Europe s Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity SOGI Unit along with the European Court of Human Rights held a conference to mark the th anniversary of the European Convention on Human Rights on October The entity announced launching an event called A Living Instrument for Everyone The Role of the European Convention on Human Rights in Advancing Equality for LGBTI persons focused on the progress achieved in equality for LGBTI persons in Europe through the European Convention mechanism br President Biden signed an executive order barring LGBTQ discrimination on his first day in office Later the same year Biden reversed a Trump era policy of banning transgender people from the military authorized embassies to fly the pride flag and officially recognized June as Pride Month br br br LGBT and human rights br Some people worry that gay rights conflict with individuals freedom of speech religious freedoms in the workplace and the ability to run churches charitable organizations and other religious organizations that hold opposing social and cultural views to LGBT rights There is also concern that religious organizations might be forced to accept and perform same sex marriages or risk losing their tax exempt status br Freedom of religion may however also protect LGBT people As pointed out at the United Nations Human Rights Council in the formal report of the United Nations Independent Expert on sexual orientation and gender identity on the basis of the explanation in a article by human rights expert Dag istein Endsj adherents of denominations and belief systems who embrace LGBT equality can claim that anti LGBT manifestations of religion such as criminalization and discrimination not only impinge upon the right of LGBT people to be free from violence and discrimination based on SOGI sexual orientation and gender identity but also violate the pro LGBT denominations own rights of freedom of religion As pointed out in this article freedom of religion also generally protects LGBT people against religious oppression as freedom of religion also protects the freedom not to hold religious beliefs and not to practise a religion As the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief noted in in certain States where religion has been given official or privileged status other fundamental rights of individuals especially women religious minorities and members of the LGBTI community are disproportionately restricted or vitiated under threat of sanctions as a result of obligatory observation of State imposed religious orthodoxy br br br Public opinion br br LGBT movements are opposed by a variety of individuals and organizations

will open the door for the legalization of polygamy that it is unnatural and that it encourages unhealthy behavior Some social conservatives believe that all sexual relationships with people other than an opposite sex spouse undermines the traditional family and that children should be reared in homes with both a father and a mother As society in some countries mostly in Western Europe North America Australia New Zealand Japan and Taiwan has become more accepting of homosexuality there therefore has also been the emergence of many groups that desire to end homosexuality during the s one of the best known groups that was established with this goal is the ex gay movement br br Eric Rofes author of the book A Radical Rethinking of Sexuality and Schooling Status Quo or Status Queer argues that the inclusion of teachings on homosexuality in public schools will play an important role in transforming public ideas about lesbian and gay individuals As a former teacher in the public school system Rofes recounts how he was fired from his teaching position after making the decision to come out as gay As a result of the stigma that he faced as a gay teacher he emphasizes the necessity of the public to take radical approaches to making significant changes in public attitudes about homosexuality According to Rofes radical approaches are grounded in the belief that something fundamental needs to be transformed for authentic and sweeping changes to occur The radical approaches proposed by Rofes have been met with strong opposition from anti gay rights activists such as John Briggs Former California senator John Briggs proposed Proposition a ballot initiative that would require that all California state public schools fire any gay or lesbian teachers or counselors along with any faculty that displayed support for gay rights in an effort to prevent what he believe to be the corruption of the children s minds The exclusion of homosexuality from the sexual education curriculum in addition to the absence of sexual counseling programs in public schools has resulted in increased feelings of isolation and alienation for gay and lesbian students who desire to have gay counseling programs that will help them come to terms with their sexual orientation Eric Rofes founder of youth homosexual programs such as Out There and Committee for Gay Youth stresses the importance of having support programs that help youth learn to identify with their sexual orientation br David Campos author of the book Sex Youth and Sex Education A Reference Handbook illuminates the argument proposed by proponents of sexual education programs in public schools Many gay rights supporters argue that teachings about the diverse sexual orientations that exist outside of heterosexuality are pertinent to creating students that are well informed about the world around them However Campos also acknowledges that the sex education curriculum alone cannot teach youth about factors associated with sexual orientation but instead he suggests that schools implement policies that create safe school learning environments and foster support for LGBT youth It is his belief that schools that provide unbiased factual information about sexual orientation along with supportive counseling programs for these homosexual youth will transform the way society treats homosexuality br Many opponents of LGBT social movements have attributed their indifference toward homosexuality as being a result of the immoral values that it may instill in children who are exposed to homosexual individuals In opposition to this claim many proponents of increased education about homosexuality suggest that educators should refrain from teaching about sexuality in schools entirely In her book entitled Gay and Lesbian Movement Margaret Cruikshank provides statistical data from the Harris and Yankelovich polls which confirmed that over of American adults believe that students should be educated about sexuality within their public school In addition the poll also found that of parents believe that homosexuality and abortion should be included in the curriculum as well An assessment conducted on California public school systems discovered that only of all parents actually disapproved of their child being taught about sexuality in school br br It had been suggested that education has a positive impact on support for same sex marriage African Americans statistically have lower rates of educational achievement however the education level of African Americans does not have as much significance on their attitude towards same sex marriage as it does on white attitudes Educational attainment among whites has a significant positive effect on support for same sex marriage whereas the direct effect of education among African Americans is less significant The income levels of whites have a direct and positive correlation with support for same sex marriage but African American income level is not significantly associated with attitudes toward same sex marriage br br Location also affects ideas towards same sex marriage residents of rural and southern areas are significantly more opposed to same sex marriage in comparison to residents elsewhere Gays and lesbians that live in rural areas face many challenges including sparse populations and the traditional culture held closely by the small population of most rural areas generally hostile social climates towards gays relative to urban areas and less social and institution support and access compared to urban areas In order to combat this problem that the LGBT community faces social networks and apps such as Moovs have been created for LGBT individuals with like minds that are enabled to connect share and feel the heartbeat of the community as one br In a study conducted by Darren E Sherkat Kylan M de Vries and Stacia Creek at the Southern Illinois University Carbondale researchers found that women tend to be more consistently supportive of LGBT rights than men and that individuals that are divorced or have never married are also more likely to grant marital rights to same sex couples than married or widowed individuals They also claimed that white women are significantly more supportive than white men but there are no gender discrepancies among African Americans The year in which one was born was also found to be a strong indicator of attitude towards same sex marriage generations born after are considerably more supportive of same sex marriage than older generations Finally the study reported that statistically African Americans are more opposed to same sex marriage than any other ethnicity br Studies show that Non Protestant Christians are much more likely to support same sex unions than Protestants of African Americans claim that they are Baptist or Protestant whereas only of white Americans are Religion as measured by individuals religious affiliations behaviors and beliefs has a lot of influence in structuring same sex union attitudes and consistently influences opinions about homosexuality The most liberal attitudes are generally reflected by Jews liberal Protestants and people who are not affiliated with religion This is because many of their religious traditions have not systematically condemned homosexual behaviors in recent years Moderate and tolerant attitudes are generally reflected by Catholics and moderate Protestants And lastly the most conservative views are held by Evangelical Protestants Moreover it is a tendency for one to be less tolerant of homosexuality if their social network is strongly tied to a religious congregation Organized religion especially Protestant and Baptist affiliations espouse conservative views which traditionally denounce same sex unions Therefore these congregations are more likely to hear messages of this nature Polls have also indicated that the amount and level of personal contact that individuals have with homosexual individuals and traditional morality affects attitudes of same sex marriage and homosexuality br br br br br br Further reading br br Robert Aldrich ed Gay Life and
