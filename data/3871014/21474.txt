In mathematics the natural numbers are the numbers etc possibly excluding Some define the natural numbers as the non negative integers while others define them as the positive integers Some authors acknowledge both definitions whenever convenient Some texts define the whole numbers as the natural numbers together with zero excluding zero from the natural numbers while in other writings the whole numbers refer to all of the integers including negative integers The counting numbers refer to the natural numbers in common language particularly in primary school education and are similarly ambiguous although typically exclude zero br The natural numbers can be used for counting as in there are six coins on the table in which case they serve as cardinal numbers They may also be used for ordering as in this is the third largest city in the country in which case they serve as ordinal numbers Natural numbers are sometimes used as labels also known as nominal numbers e g jersey numbers in sports which do not have the properties of numbers in a mathematical sense br The natural numbers form a set commonly symbolized as a bold N or blackboard bold br br br br br N br br br br displaystyle mathbb N br br Many other number sets are built by successively extending the set of natural numbers the integers by including an additive identity if not yet in and an additive inverse n for each nonzero natural number n the rational numbers by including a multiplicative inverse br br br br br br br br n br br br displaystyle n br br for each nonzero integer n and also the product of these inverses by integers the real numbers by including the limits of Cauchy sequences of rationals the complex numbers by adjoining to the real numbers a square root of and also the sums and products thereof and so on This chain of extensions canonically embeds the natural numbers in the other number systems br Properties of the natural numbers such as divisibility and the distribution of prime numbers are studied in number theory Problems concerning counting and ordering such as partitioning and enumerations are studied in combinatorics br br br History br br br Ancient roots br br The most primitive method of representing a natural number is to use one s fingers as in finger counting Putting down a tally mark for each object is another primitive method Later a set of objects could be tested for equality excess or shortage by striking out a mark and removing an object from the set br The first major advance in abstraction was the use of numerals to represent numbers This allowed systems to be developed for recording large numbers The ancient Egyptians developed a powerful system of numerals with distinct hieroglyphs for and all powers of up to over million A stone carving from Karnak dating back from around BCE and now at the Louvre in Paris depicts as hundreds tens and ones and similarly for the number The Babylonians had a place value system based essentially on the numerals for and using base sixty so that the symbol for sixty was the same as the symbol for one its value being determined from context br A much later advance was the development of the idea that can be considered as a number with its own numeral The use of a digit in place value notation within other numbers dates back as early as BCE by the Babylonians who omitted such a digit when it would have been the last symbol in the number The Olmec and Maya civilizations used as a separate number as early as the st century BCE but this usage did not spread beyond Mesoamerica The use of a numeral in modern times originated with the Indian mathematician Brahmagupta in CE However had been used as a number in the medieval computus the calculation of the date of Easter beginning with Dionysius Exiguus in CE without being denoted by a numeral Standard Roman numerals do not have a symbol for instead nulla or the genitive form nullae from nullus the Latin word for none was employed to denote a value br The first systematic study of numbers as abstractions is usually credited to the Greek philosophers Pythagoras and Archimedes Some Greek mathematicians treated the number differently than larger numbers sometimes even not as a number at all Euclid for example defined a unit first and then a number as a multitude of units thus by his definition a unit is not a number and there are no unique numbers e g any two units from indefinitely many units is a However in the definition of perfect number which comes shortly afterward Euclid treats as a number like any other br Independent studies on numbers also occurred at around the same time in India China and Mesoamerica br br br Emergence as a term br Nicolas Chuquet used the term progression naturelle natural progression in The earliest known use of natural number as a complete English phrase is in The Encyclopaedia Britannica defines natural numbers in the logarithm article br Starting at or has long been a matter of definition In Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle wrote that his notions of distance and element led to defining the natural numbers as including or excluding In Giuseppe Peano used N for the positive integers and started at but he later changed to using N and N Historically most definitions have excluded but many mathematicians such as George A Wentworth Bertrand Russell Nicolas Bourbaki Paul Halmos Stephen Cole Kleene and John Horton Conway have preferred to include br Mathematicians have noted tendencies in which definition is used such as algebra texts including number theory and analysis texts excluding logic and set theory texts including dictionaries excluding school books through high school level excluding and upper division college level books including There are exceptions to each of these tendencies and as of no formal survey has been conducted Arguments raised include division by zero and the size of the empty set Computer languages often start from zero when enumerating items like loop counters and string or array elements Including began to rise in popularity in the s The ISO standard included in the natural numbers in its first edition in and this has continued through its present edition as ISO br br br Formal construction br In th century Europe there was mathematical and philosophical discussion about the exact nature of the natural numbers Henri Poincar stated that axioms can only be demonstrated in their finite application and concluded that it is the power of the mind which allows conceiving of the indefinite repetition of the same act Leopold Kronecker summarized his belief as God made the integers all else is the work of man br The constructivists saw a need to improve upon the logical rigor in the foundations of mathematics In the s Hermann Grassmann suggested a recursive definition for natural numbers thus stating they were not really natural but a consequence of definitions Later two classes of such formal definitions were constructed later still they were shown to be equivalent in most practical applications br Set theoretical definitions of natural numbers were initiated by Frege He initially defined a natural number as the class of all sets that are in one to one correspondence with a particular set However this definition turned out to lead to paradoxes including Russell s paradox To avoid such paradoxes the formalism was modified so that a natural number is defined as a particular set and any set that can be put into one to one correspondence with that set is said to have that number of elements br In Charles Sanders Peirce provided the first axiomatization of natural number arithmetic within this second class of definitions In Richard Dedekind proposed another axiomatization of natural number arithmetic and in Peano published a simplified version of Dedekind s axioms in his book The principles of arithmetic presented by a new method Latin Arithmetices principia nova methodo exposita This approach is now called Peano arithmetic It is based on an axiomatization of the properties of ordinal numbers each natural number has a successor and every non zero natural number has a unique predecessor Peano arithmetic is equiconsistent with several weak systems of set theory One such system is ZFC with the axiom of infinity replaced by its negation Theorems that can be proved in ZFC but cannot be proved using the Peano Axioms include Goodstein s theorem br br br Notation br The set of all natural numbers is standardly denoted N or br br br br br N br br br br br displaystyle mathbb N br br Older texts have occasionally employed J as the symbol for this set br Since natural numbers may contain or not it may be important to know which version is referred to This is often specified by the context but may also be done by using a subscript or a superscript in the notation such as br br Naturals without zero br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br N br br br br br br br br

Alternatively since the natural numbers naturally form a subset of the integers often denoted br br br br br Z br br br br displaystyle mathbb Z br br they may be referred to as the positive or the

section juxtaposed variables such as ab indicate the product a b and the standard order of operations is assumed br A total order on the natural numbers is defined by letting a b if and only if there exists another natural number c where a c b This order is compatible with the arithmetical operations in the following sense if a b and c are natural numbers and a b then a c b c and ac bc br An important property of the natural numbers is that they are well ordered every non empty set of natural numbers has a least element The rank among well ordered sets is expressed by an ordinal number for the natural numbers this is denoted as omega br br br Division br In this section juxtaposed variables such as ab indicate the product a b and the standard order of operations is assumed br While it is in general not possible to divide one natural number by another and get a natural number as result the procedure of division with remainder or Euclidean division is available as a substitute for any two natural numbers a and b with b there are natural numbers q and r such that br br br br br a br br b br q br br r br br and br br r br br b br br br br displaystyle a bq r text and r b br br br The number q is called the quotient and r is called the remainder of the division of a by b The numbers q and r are uniquely determined by a and b This Euclidean division is key to the several other properties divisibility algorithms such as the Euclidean algorithm and ideas in number theory br br br Algebraic properties satisfied by the natural numbers br The addition and multiplication

Associativity for all natural numbers a b and c a b c a b c and a b c a b c br Commutativity for all natural numbers a and b a b b a and a b b a br Existence of identity elements for every natural number a a a and a a br If the natural numbers are taken as excluding and starting at then for every natural number a a a However the existence of additive identity element property is not satisfied br Distributivity of multiplication over addition for all natural numbers a b and c a b c a b a c br No nonzero zero divisors if a and b are natural numbers such that a b then a or b or both br br br Generalizations br Two important generalizations of natural numbers arise from the two uses of counting and ordering cardinal numbers and ordinal numbers br br A natural number can be used to express the size of a finite set more precisely a cardinal number is a measure for the size of a set which is even suitable for infinite sets The numbering of cardinals usually begins at zero to accommodate the empty set br br br br br br br displaystyle emptyset br br This concept of size relies on maps between sets such that two sets have the same size exactly if there exists a bijection between them The set of natural numbers itself and any bijective image of it is said to be countably infinite and to have cardinality aleph null br Natural numbers are also used as linguistic ordinal numbers first second third and so forth The numbering of ordinals usually begins at zero to accommodate the order type of the empty set br br br br br br br displaystyle emptyset br br This way they can be assigned to the elements of a totally ordered finite set and also to the elements of any well ordered countably infinite set without limit points This assignment can be generalized to general well orderings with a cardinality beyond countability to yield the ordinal numbers An ordinal number may also be used to describe the notion of size for a well ordered set in a sense different from cardinality if there is an order isomorphism more than a bijection between two well ordered sets they have the same ordinal number The first ordinal number that is not a natural number is expressed as this is also the ordinal number of the set of natural numbers itself br The least ordinal of cardinality that is the initial ordinal of is but many well ordered sets with cardinal number have an ordinal number greater than br For finite well ordered sets there is a one to one correspondence between ordinal and cardinal numbers therefore they can both be expressed by the same natural number the number of elements of the set This number can also be used to describe the position of an element in a larger finite or an infinite sequence br A countable non standard model of arithmetic satisfying the Peano Arithmetic that is the first order Peano axioms was developed by Skolem in The hypernatural numbers are an uncountable model that can be constructed from the ordinary natural numbers via the ultrapower construction Other generalizations are discussed in Number Extensions of the concept br Georges Reeb used to claim provocatively that The na ve integers don t fill up br br br br br N br br br br displaystyle mathbb N br br br br br Formal definitions br There are two standard methods for formally defining natural numbers The first one named for Giuseppe Peano consists of an autonomous axiomatic theory called Peano arithmetic based on few axioms called Peano axioms br The second definition is based on set theory It defines the natural numbers as specific sets More precisely each natural number n is defined as an explicitly defined set whose elements allow counting the elements of other sets in the sense that the sentence a set S has n elements means that there exists a one to one correspondence between the two sets n and S br The sets used to define natural numbers satisfy Peano axioms It follows that every theorem that can be stated and proved in Peano arithmetic can also be proved in set theory However the two definitions are not equivalent as there are theorems that can be stated in terms of Peano arithmetic and proved in set theory which are not provable inside Peano arithmetic A probable example is Fermat s Last Theorem br The definition of the integers as sets satisfying Peano axioms provide a model of Peano arithmetic inside set theory An important consequence is that if set theory is consistent as it is usually guessed then Peano arithmetic is consistent In other words if a contradiction could be proved in Peano arithmetic then set theory would be contradictory and every theorem of set theory would be both true and wrong br br br Peano axioms br br The five Peano axioms are the following br br is a natural number br Every natural number has a successor which is also a natural number br is not the successor of any natural number br If the successor of br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br equals the successor of br br br br y br br br displaystyle y br br then br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br equals br br br br y br br br displaystyle y br br br The axiom of induction If a statement is true of and if the truth of that statement for a number implies its truth for the successor of that number then the statement is true for every natural number br These are not the original axioms published by Peano but are named in his honor Some forms of the Peano axioms have in place of In ordinary arithmetic the successor of br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br is br br br br x br br br br br displaystyle x br br br br br Set theoretic definition br br Intuitively the natural number n is the common property of all sets that have n elements So it seems natural to define n as an equivalence class under the relation can be made in one to one correspondence This does not work in set theory as such an equivalence class would not be a set because of Russell s paradox The standard solution is to define a particular set with n elements that will be called the natural number n br The following definition was first published by John von Neumann although Levy attributes the idea to unpublished work of Zermelo in As this definition extends to infinite set as a definition of ordinal number the sets considered below are sometimes called von Neumann ordinals br The definition proceeds as follows br br Call the empty set br Define the successor S a of any set a by S a a a br By the axiom of infinity there exist sets which contain and are closed under the successor function Such sets are said to be inductive The intersection of all inductive sets is still an inductive set br This intersection is the set of the natural numbers br It follows that the natural numbers are defined iteratively as follows br br br br br br n n n n br etc br It can be checked that the natural numbers satisfy the Peano axioms br With this definition given a natural number n the sentence a set S has n elements can be formally defined as there exists a bijection from n to S This formalizes the operation of counting the elements of S Also n m if and only if n is a subset of m In other words the set inclusion defines the usual total order on the natural numbers This order is a well order br It follows from the definition that each natural number is equal to the set of all natural numbers less than it This definition can be extended to the von Neumann definition of ordinals for defining all ordinal numbers including the infinite ones each ordinal is the well ordered set of all smaller ordinals br If one does not accept the axiom of infinity the natural numbers may not form a set Nevertheless the natural numbers can still be individually defined as above and they still satisfy the Peano axioms br There are other set theoretical constructions In particular Ernst Zermelo provided a construction that is nowadays only of historical interest and is sometimes referred to as Zermelo ordinals It consists in defining as the empty set and S a a br With this definition each natural number is a singleton set So the property of the natural numbers to represent cardinalities is not directly accessible only the ordinal property being the nth element of a sequence is immediate Unlike von Neumann s construction the Zermelo ordinals do not extend to infinite ordinals br br br See also br br Canonical
