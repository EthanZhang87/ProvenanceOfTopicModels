Chromaticity is an objective specification of the quality of a color regardless of its luminance Chromaticity consists of two independent parameters often specified as hue h and colorfulness s where the latter is alternatively called saturation chroma intensity or excitation purity This number of parameters follows from trichromacy of vision of most humans which is assumed by most models in color science br br br Quantitative description br In color science the white point of an illuminant or of a display is a neutral reference characterized by a chromaticity all other chromaticities may be defined in relation to this reference using polar coordinates The hue is the angular component and the purity is the radial component normalized by the maximum radius for that hue br Purity is roughly equivalent to the term saturation in the HSV color model The property hue is as used in general color theory and in specific color models such as HSL and HSV color spaces though it is more perceptually uniform in color models such as Munsell CIELAB or CIECAM br Some color spaces separate the three dimensions of color into one luminance dimension and a pair of chromaticity dimensions For example the white point of an sRGB display is an x y chromaticity of where x and y coordinates are used in the xyY space br br These pairs determine a chromaticity as affine coordinates on a triangle in a D space which contains all possible chromaticities These x and y are used because of simplicity of expression in CIE see below and have no inherent advantage Other coordinate systems on the same X Y Z triangle or other color triangles can be used br On the other hand some color spaces such as RGB and XYZ do not separate out chromaticity but chromaticity is defined by a mapping that normalizes out intensity and its coordinates such as r and g or x and y can be calculated through the division operation such as x X X Y Z and so on br The xyY space is a cross between the CIE XYZ and its normalized chromaticity coordinates xyz such that the luminance Y is preserved and augmented with just the required two chromaticity dimensions br br br See also br br CIE xyY chromaticity diagram br Chrominance br rg chromaticity br Impossible color br Color index in astronomy br br br br br br External links br Stanford University CS interactive Flash demo explaining chromaticity diagrams br JOES application software for calculation and plotting of CIE and from spectra
