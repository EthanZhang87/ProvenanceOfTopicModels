Thomas Young FRS June May was a British polymath who made notable contributions to the fields of vision light solid mechanics energy physiology language musical harmony and Egyptology He was instrumental in the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs specifically the Rosetta Stone br Young has been described as The Last Man Who Knew Everything His work influenced that of William Herschel Hermann von Helmholtz James Clerk Maxwell and Albert Einstein Young is credited with establishing Christiaan Huygens wave theory of light in contrast to the corpuscular theory of Isaac Newton Young s work was subsequently supported by the work of Augustin Jean Fresnel br br br Personal life br Young belonged to a Quaker family of Milverton Somerset where he was born in the eldest of ten children By the age of fourteen Young had learned Greek Latin French Italian Syriac Samaritan Hebrew Arabic Biblical Aramaic Persian Turkish and Ge ez br Young began to study medicine in London at St Bartholomew s Hospital in moved to the University of Edinburgh Medical School in and a year later went to G ttingen Lower Saxony Germany where he obtained the degree of doctor of medicine in from the University of G ttingen In he entered Emmanuel College Cambridge In the same year he inherited the estate of his grand uncle Richard Brocklesby which made him financially independent and in he established himself as a physician at Welbeck Street London now recorded with a blue plaque Young published many of his first academic articles anonymously to protect his reputation as a physician br In Young was appointed professor of natural philosophy mainly physics at the Royal Institution In two years he delivered lectures In he was appointed foreign secretary of the Royal Society of which he had been elected a fellow in He resigned his professorship in fearing that its duties would interfere with his medical practice His lectures were published in in the Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and contain a number of anticipations of later theories br In Young became physician to St George s Hospital and in he served on a committee appointed to consider the dangers involved in the general introduction of gas for lighting into London In he was secretary of a commission charged with ascertaining the precise length of the seconds pendulum the length of a pendulum whose period is exactly seconds and in he became secretary to the Board of Longitude and superintendent of the HM Nautical Almanac Office br Young was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in A few years before his death he became interested in life insurance and in he was chosen as one of the eight foreign associates of the French Academy of Sciences In the same year he became a first class corresponding member living abroad of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands In he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences br In Young married Eliza Maxwell They had no children br Young died in his th year in London on May having suffered recurrent attacks of asthma His autopsy revealed atherosclerosis of the aorta His body was buried in the graveyard of St Giles Church at Farnborough in the county of Kent Westminster Abbey houses a white marble tablet in memory of Young bearing an epitaph by Hudson Gurney br br Sacred to the memory of Thomas Young M D Fellow and Foreign Secretary of the Royal Society Member of the National Institute of France a man alike eminent in almost every department of human learning Patient of unintermitted labour endowed with the faculty of intuitive perception who bringing an equal mastery to the most abstruse investigations of letters and of science first established the undulatory theory of light and first penetrated the obscurity which had veiled for ages the hieroglyphs of Egypt Endeared to his friends by his domestic virtues honoured by the World for his unrivalled acquirements he died in the hopes of the Resurrection of the just Born at Milverton in Somersetshire June Died in Park Square London May in the th year of his age br Young was highly regarded by his friends and colleagues He was said never to impose his knowledge but if asked was able to answer even the most difficult scientific question with ease Although very learned he had a reputation for sometimes having difficulty in communicating his knowledge It was said by one of his contemporaries that His words were not those in familiar use and the arrangement of his ideas seldom the same as those he conversed with He was therefore worse calculated than any man I ever knew for the communication of knowledge br br br Religious views br Though he sometimes dealt with religious topics of history in Egypt and wrote about the history of Christianity in Nubia not much is known about Young s personal religious views On George Peacock s account Young never spoke to him about morals metaphysics or religion though according to Young s wife his attitudes showed that his Quaker upbringing had strongly influenced his religious practices Authoritative sources have described Young in terms of a cultural Christian Quaker br Hudson Gurney informed that before his marriage Young had to join the Church of England and was baptized later Gurney stated that Young retained a good deal of his old creed and carried to his scriptural studies his habit of inquisition of languages and manners rather than the habit of proselytism Yet the day before his death Young participated in religious sacraments as reported in David Brewster s Edinburgh Journal of Science After some information concerning his affairs and some instructions concerning the hierographical papers in his hands he said that perfectly aware of his situation he had taken the sacraments of the church on the day preceding His religious sentiments were by himself stated to be liberal though orthodox He had extensively studied the Scriptures of which the precepts were deeply impressed upon his mind from his earliest years and he evidenced the faith which he professed in an unbending course of usefulness and rectitude br br br Research br br br Wave theory of light br br In Young s own judgment of his many achievements the most important was to establish the wave theory of light set out by Christiaan Huygens in his Treatise on Light To do so he had to overcome the century old view expressed in the venerable Newton s Opticks that light is a particle Nevertheless in the early th century Young put forth a number of theoretical reasons supporting the wave theory of light and he developed two enduring demonstrations to support this viewpoint With the ripple tank he demonstrated the idea of interference in the context of water waves With Young s interference experiment the predecessor of the double slit experiment he demonstrated interference in the context of light as a wave br br Young speaking on November to the Royal Society of London began his now classic description of the historic experiment br br The experiments I am about to relate may be repeated with great ease whenever the sun shines and without any other apparatus than is at hand to every one br In his subsequent paper titled Experiments and Calculations Relative to Physical Optics Young describes an experiment in which he placed a card measuring approximately millimetres in in a beam of light from a single opening in a window and observed the fringes of colour in the shadow and to the sides of the card He observed that placing another card in front or behind the narrow strip so as to prevent the light beam from striking one of its edges caused the fringes to disappear This supported the contention that light is composed of waves br Young performed and analysed a number of experiments including interference of light from reflection off nearby pairs of micrometre grooves from reflection off thin films of soap and oil and from Newton s rings He also performed two important diffraction experiments using fibres and long narrow strips In his Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and the Mechanical Arts he gives Grimaldi credit for first observing the fringes in the shadow of an object placed in a beam of light Within ten years much of Young s work was reproduced and then extended by Augustin Jean Fresnel br br br Young s modulus br br Young described the characterization of elasticity that came to be known as Young s modulus denoted as E in and further described it in his Course of Lectures on Natural Philosophy and the Mechanical Arts br However the first use of the concept of Young s modulus in experiments was by Giordano Riccati in predating Young by years br Furthermore the idea can be traced to a paper by Leonhard Euler published in some years before Thomas Young s paper br The Young s modulus relates the stress pressure in a body to its associated strain change in length as a ratio of the original length that is stress E strain for a uniaxially loaded specimen Young s modulus is independent of the component under investigation that is it is an inherent material property the term modulus refers to an inherent material property Young s Modulus allowed for the first time prediction of the strain in a component subject to a known stress and vice versa Prior to Young s contribution engineers were required to apply Hooke s F kx relationship to identify the deformation x of a body subject to a known load F where the constant k is a function of both the geometry and material under consideration Finding k required physical testing for any new component as the F kx relationship is a function of both geometry and material Young s Modulus depends only on the material not its geometry thus allowing a revolution in engineering strategies br Young s problems in sometimes not expressing himself clearly were shown by his own definition of the modulus The modulus of the elasticity of any substance is a column of the same substance capable of producing a pressure on its base which is to the weight causing a certain degree of compression as the length of the substance is to the diminution of its length When this explanation was put to the Lords of the Admiralty their clerk wrote to Young saying Though science is much respected by their Lordships and your paper is much esteemed it is too learned in short it is not understood br br br Vision and colour theory br Young has also been called the founder of physiological optics In he explained the mode in which the eye accommodates itself to vision at different distances as depending on change of the curvature of the crystalline lens in he was the first to describe astigmatism and in his lectures he presented the hypothesis afterwards developed by Hermann von Helmholtz the Young Helmholtz theory that colour perception depends on the presence in the retina of three kinds of nerve fibres This foreshadowed the modern understanding of colour vision in particular the finding that the eye does indeed have three colour receptors which are sensitive to different wavelength ranges br br br Young Laplace equation br In Young developed the theory of capillary phenomena on the principle of surface tension He also observed the constancy of the angle of contact of a liquid surface with a solid and showed how from these two principles to deduce the phenomena of capillary action In Pierre Simon Laplace the French philosopher discovered the significance of meniscus radii with respect to capillary action br In Carl Friedrich Gauss the German mathematician unified the work of these two scientists to derive the Young Laplace equation the formula that describes the capillary pressure difference sustained across the interface between two static fluids br Young was the first to define the term energy in the modern sense He also did work on the theory of tides paralleling that of Laplace and anticipating more well known work by Airy br br br Young s equation and Young Dupr equation br br Young s equation describes the contact angle of a liquid drop on a plane solid surface as a function of the surface free energy the interfacial free energy and the surface tension of the liquid Young s equation was developed further some years later by Dupr to account for thermodynamic effects and this is known as the Young Dupr equation br br br Medicine br In physiology Young made an important contribution to haemodynamics in the Croonian lecture for on the Functions of the Heart and Arteries where he derived a formula for the wave speed of the pulse and his medical writings included An Introduction to Medical Literature including a System of Practical Nosology and A Practical and Historical Treatise on Consumptive Diseases br Young devised a rule of thumb for determining a child s drug dosage Young s Rule states that the child dosage is equal to the adult dosage multiplied by the child s age in years divided by the sum of plus the child s age br br br Languages br In an appendix to his G ttingen dissertation De corporis hvmani viribvs conservatricibvs there are four pages added proposing a universal phonetic alphabet so as not to leave these pages blank lit Ne vacuae starent hae paginae libuit e praelectione ante disputationem habenda tabellam literarum vniuersalem raptim describere It includes pure vowel symbols nasal vowels various consonants and examples of these drawn primarily from French and English br In his Encyclop dia Britannica article Languages Young compared the grammar and vocabulary of languages In a separate work in he introduced the term Indo European languages years after the Dutch linguist and scholar Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn proposed the grouping to which this term refers in br br br Egyptian hieroglyphs br br Young made significant contributions to the decipherment of ancient Egyptian writing systems He started his Egyptology work rather late in when the work was already in progress among other researchers br He began by using an Egyptian demotic alphabet of letters built up by Johan David kerblad in turned out to be incorrect kerblad was correct in stressing the importance of the demotic text in trying to read the inscriptions but he wrongly believed that demotic was entirely alphabetic br By Young had completely translated the enchorial text of the Rosetta Stone using a list with demotic words and then studied the hieroglyphic alphabet but initially failed to recognise that the demotic and hieroglyphic texts were paraphrases and not simple translations br There was considerable rivalry between Young and Jean Fran ois Champollion while both were working on hieroglyphic decipherment At first they briefly cooperated in their work but later from around a chill arose between them For many years they kept details of their work away from each other br Some of Young s conclusions appeared in the famous article Egypt he wrote for the edition of the Encyclop dia Britannica br When Champollion finally published a translation of the hieroglyphs and the key to the grammatical system in Young and many others praised his work Nevertheless a year later Young published an Account of the Recent Discoveries in Hieroglyphic Literature and Egyptian Antiquities with the aim of having his own work recognised as the basis for Champollion s system br Young had correctly found the sound value of six hieroglyphic signs but had not deduced the grammar of the language Young himself acknowledged that he was somewhat at a disadvantage because Champollion s knowledge of the relevant languages such as Coptic was much greater br Several scholars have suggested that Young s true contribution to Egyptology was his decipherment of the demotic script He made the first major advances in this area he also correctly identified demotic as being composed by both ideographic and phonetic signs br Subsequently Young felt that Champollion was unwilling to share the credit for the decipherment In the ensuing controversy strongly motivated by the political tensions of that time the British tended to champion Young while the French mostly championed Champollion Champollion did acknowledge some of Young s contribution but rather sparingly However after when Champollion was a curator in the Louvre he did offer Young access to demotic manuscripts br In England while Sir George Lewis still doubted Champollion s achievement as late as others were more accepting For example Reginald Poole and Sir Peter Le Page Renouf both defended Champollion br br br Music br Young developed Young temperament a method of tuning musical instruments br br br Legacy br Later scholars and scientists have praised Young s work although they may know him only through achievements he made in their fields His contemporary Sir John Herschel called him a truly original genius Albert Einstein praised him in the foreword to an edition of Isaac Newton s Opticks Other admirers include physicist Lord Rayleigh and Nobel Physics laureate Philip Anderson br Thomas Young s name has been adopted as the name of the London based Thomas Young Centre an alliance of academic research groups engaged in the theory and simulation of materials br Young Sound in eastern Greenland was named in his honour by William
