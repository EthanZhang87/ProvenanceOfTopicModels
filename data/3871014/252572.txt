title: Glory (optical phenomenon)
id: 252572
A glory is an optical phenomenon resembling an iconic saint s halo around the shadow of the observer s head caused by sunlight or more rarely moonlight interacting with the tiny water droplets that comprise mist or clouds The glory consists of one or more concentric successively dimmer rings each of which is red on the outside and bluish towards the centre Due to its appearance the phenomenon is sometimes mistaken for a circular rainbow but the latter has a much larger diameter and is caused by different physical processes br Glories arise due to wave interference of light internally refracted within small droplets br br br Appearance and observation br Depending on circumstances such as the uniformity of droplet size in the clouds one or more of the glory s rings can be visible The rings are rarely complete being interrupted by the shadow of the viewer The angular size of the inner and brightest ring is much smaller than that of a rainbow about to depending on the size of the droplets In the right conditions a glory and a rainbow can occur simultaneously br Glories can be seen on mountains and hillsides from aircraft and in sea fog and even indoors br Like a rainbow outdoor glories are centred on the antisolar or in case of the moon antilunar point which coincides with the shadow of the observer s head Because this point is diametrically opposite to the sun s or moon s position in the sky it usually lies below the observer s horizon except at sun or moon rise and set Outdoor glories are commonly observed from aircraft In the latter case if the plane is flying sufficiently low for its shadow to be visible on the clouds the glory always surrounds it This is sometimes called The Glory of the Pilot br In astronomers suggested that the existence of glory might explain certain observations of the exoplanet WASP b If this interpretation could be confirmed it would become the first extrasolar glory like phenomenon to be discovered br br br Brocken spectre br br When viewed from a mountain or tall building glories are often seen in association with a Brocken spectre also called Mountain spectre the apparently enormously magnified shadow of an observer cast when the sun is low on clouds below the mountain on which the viewer is standing The name derives from the Brocken the tallest peak of the Harz mountain range in Germany Because the peak is above the cloud level and the area is frequently misty conditions conducive to casting a shadow on a cloud layer are common Giant shadows that seemed to move by themselves due to movement of the cloud layer this movement is another part of the definition of the Brocken spectre and that were surrounded by glories may have contributed to the reputation the Harz mountains hold as a refuge for witches and evil spirits In Goethe s Faust the Brocken is called the Blocksberg and is the site of the Witches Sabbath on Walpurgis Night br br br Theory br br Modern theories of light first described by Henri Poincar in are able to explain the phenomenon of glories through the complex angular momentum rotation of the electromagnetic field of a light wave and do not need quantum theories A summary of rainbowlike phenomena was provided in Scientific American in and states br br It is gratifying to discover in the elegant but seemingly abstract theory of complex angular momentum an explanation for these two natural phenomena Glories and th order Rainbows and to find there an unexpected link between them br Most th century work on the phenomenon of rainbows and glories has focused on determining the correct intensity of light at each point in the phenomenon which does require quantum theories In the Dutch astronomer Hendrik van de Hulst suggested that surface waves are involved He speculated that the brightness of the coloured rings of the glory are caused by two ray interference between short and long path surface waves which are generated by light rays entering the droplets at diametrically opposite points both rays suffer one internal reflection A theory by Brazilian physicist Herch Moys s Nussenzveig suggests that the light energy beamed back by a glory originates mostly from classical wave tunneling synonymous in the paper to the evanescent wave coupling which is an interaction between an evanescent light wave traveling along the surface of the drop and the waves inside the drop br br br In culture br br C T R Wilson saw a glory while working as a temporary observer at the Ben Nevis weather station Inspired by the impressive sight he decided to build a device for creating clouds in the laboratory so that he could make a synthetic small scale glory His work led directly to the cloud chamber a device for detecting ionizing radiation for which he and Arthur Compton received the Nobel Prize for Physics in br In China the phenomenon is called Buddha s light or halo It is often observed on cloud shrouded high mountains such as Huangshan and Mount Emei Records of the phenomenon at Mount Emei date back to A D The colourful halo always surrounds the observer s own shadow and thus was often taken to show the observer s personal enlightenment associated with Buddha or divinity br Stylized glories appear occasionally in Western heraldry Two glories appear on the Great Seal of the United States A glory breaking through clouds surrounding a cluster of
