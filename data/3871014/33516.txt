In physics mathematics engineering and related fields a wave is a propagating dynamic disturbance change from equilibrium of one or more quantities Periodic waves oscillate repeatedly about an equilibrium resting value at some frequency When the entire waveform moves in one direction it is said to be a travelling wave by contrast a pair of superimposed periodic waves traveling in opposite directions makes a standing wave In a standing wave the amplitude of vibration has nulls at some positions where the wave amplitude appears smaller or even zero Waves are often described by a wave equation standing wave field of two opposite waves or a one way wave equation for single wave propagation in a defined direction br There are two types of waves that are most commonly studied in classical physics mechanical waves and electromagnetic waves In a mechanical wave stress and strain fields oscillate about a mechanical equilibrium A mechanical wave is a local deformation strain in some physical medium that propagates from particle to particle by creating local stresses that cause strain in neighboring particles too For example sound waves are variations of the local pressure and particle motion that propagate through the medium Other examples of mechanical waves are seismic waves gravity waves surface waves and string vibrations In an electromagnetic wave such as light coupling between the electric and magnetic fields sustains propagation of waves involving these fields according to Maxwell s equations Electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum and through some dielectric media at wavelengths where they are considered transparent Electromagnetic waves as determined by their frequencies or wavelengths have more specific designations including radio waves infrared radiation terahertz waves visible light ultraviolet radiation X rays and gamma rays br Other types of waves include gravitational waves which are disturbances in spacetime that propagate according to general relativity heat diffusion waves plasma waves that combine mechanical deformations and electromagnetic fields reaction diffusion waves such as in the Belousov Zhabotinsky reaction and many more Mechanical and electromagnetic waves transfer energy momentum and information but they do not transfer particles in the medium In mathematics and electronics waves are studied as signals On the other hand some waves have envelopes which do not move at all such as standing waves which are fundamental to music and hydraulic jumps br br A physical wave field is almost always confined to some finite region of space called its domain For example the seismic waves generated by earthquakes are significant only in the interior and surface of the planet so they can be ignored outside it However waves with infinite domain that extend over the whole space are commonly studied in mathematics and are very valuable tools for understanding physical waves in finite domains br A plane wave is an important mathematical idealization where the disturbance is identical along any infinite plane normal to a specific direction of travel Mathematically the simplest wave is a sinusoidal plane wave in which at any point the field experiences simple harmonic motion at one frequency In linear media complicated waves can generally be decomposed as the sum of many sinusoidal plane waves having different directions of propagation and or different frequencies A plane wave is classified as a transverse wave if the field disturbance at each point is described by a vector perpendicular to the direction of propagation also the direction of energy transfer or longitudinal wave if those vectors are aligned with the propagation direction Mechanical waves include both transverse and longitudinal waves on the other hand electromagnetic plane waves are strictly transverse while sound waves in fluids such as air can only be longitudinal That physical direction of an oscillating field relative to the propagation direction is also referred to as the wave s polarization which can be an important attribute br br br Mathematical description br br br Single waves br br A wave can be described just like a field namely as a function br br br br F br br x br br t br br br br displaystyle F x t br br where br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br is a position and br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br is a time br The value of br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br is a point of space specifically in the region where the wave is defined In mathematical terms it is usually a vector in the Cartesian three dimensional space br br br br br br R br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br However in many cases one can ignore one dimension and let br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br be a point of the Cartesian plane br br br br br br R br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br This is the case for example when studying vibrations of a drum skin One may even restrict br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br to a point of the Cartesian line br br br br br R br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br that is the set of real numbers This is the case for example when studying vibrations in a violin string or recorder The time br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br on the other hand is always assumed to be a scalar that is a real number br The value of br br br br F br br x br br t br br br br displaystyle F x t br br can be any physical quantity of interest assigned to the point br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br that may vary with time For example if br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br represents the vibrations inside an elastic solid the value of br br br br F br br x br br t br br br br displaystyle F x t br br is usually a vector that gives the current displacement from br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br of the material particles that would be at the point br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br in the absence of vibration For an electromagnetic wave the value of br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br can be the electric field vector br br br br E br br br displaystyle E br br or the magnetic field vector br br br br H br br br displaystyle H br br or any related quantity such as the Poynting vector br br br br E br br H br br br displaystyle E times H br br In fluid dynamics the value of br br br br F br br x br br t br br br br displaystyle F x t br br could be the velocity vector of the fluid at the point br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br or any scalar property like pressure temperature or density In a chemical reaction br br br br F br br x br br t br br br br displaystyle F x t br br could be the concentration of some substance in the neighborhood of point br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br of the reaction medium br For any dimension br br br br d br br br displaystyle d br br or the wave s domain is then a subset br br br br D br br br displaystyle D br br of br br br br br br R br br br d br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R d br br such that the function value br br br br F br br x br br t br br br br displaystyle F x t br br is defined for any point br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br in br br br br D br br br displaystyle D br br For example when describing the motion of a drum skin one can consider br br br br D br br br displaystyle D br br to be a disk circle on the plane br br br br br br R br br br br br br br br displaystyle mathbb R br br with center at the origin br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle br br and let br br br br F br br x br br t br br br br displaystyle F x t br br be the vertical displacement of the skin at the point br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br of br br br br D br br br displaystyle D br br and at time br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br br br br Superposition br br Waves of the same type are often superposed and encountered simultaneously at a given point in space and time The properties at that point are the sum of the properties of each component wave at that point In general the velocities are not the same so the wave form will change over time and space br br br Wave spectrum br br br Wave families br Sometimes one is interested in a single specific wave More often however one needs to understand large set of possible waves like all the ways that a drum skin can vibrate after being struck once with a drum stick or all the possible radar echos one could get from an airplane that may be approaching an airport br In some of those situations one may describe such a family of waves by a function br br br br F br br A br br B br br br br x br br t br br br br displaystyle F A B ldots x t br br that depends on certain parameters br br br br A br br B br br br br br displaystyle A B ldots br br besides br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br and br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br Then one can obtain different waves that is different functions of br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br and br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br by choosing different values for those parameters br br For example the sound pressure inside a recorder that is playing a pure note is typically a standing wave that can be written as br br br br br F br br A br br L br br n br br c br br x br br t br br br A br br br br cos br br br br x br br br br br n br br br br br br L br br br br br br br br br br cos br br br br c br t br br br br br n br br br br br br L br br br br br br br br br displaystyle F A L n c x t A left cos pi x frac n L right left cos pi ct frac n L right br br br The parameter br br br br A br br br displaystyle A br br defines the amplitude of the wave that is the maximum sound pressure in the bore which is related to the loudness of the note br br br br c br br br displaystyle c br br is the speed of sound br br br br L br br br displaystyle L br br is the length of the bore and br br br br n br br br displaystyle n br br is a positive integer that specifies the number of nodes in the standing wave The position br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br should be measured from the mouthpiece and the time br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br from any moment at which the pressure at the mouthpiece is maximum The quantity br br br br br br br L br br br br br br n br br br br br br displaystyle lambda L n br br is the wavelength of the emitted note and br br br br f br br c br br br br br br br displaystyle f c lambda br br is its frequency Many general properties of these waves can be inferred from this general equation without choosing specific values for the parameters br As another example it may be that the vibrations of a drum skin after a single strike depend only on the distance br br br br r br br br displaystyle r br br from the center of the skin to the strike point and on the strength br br br br s br br br displaystyle s br br of the strike Then the vibration for all possible strikes can be described by a function br br br br F br br r br br s br br x br br t br br br br displaystyle F r s x t br br br Sometimes the family of waves of interest has infinitely many parameters For example one may want to describe what happens to the temperature in a metal bar when it is initially heated at various temperatures at different points along its length and then allowed to cool by itself in vacuum In that case instead of a scalar or vector the parameter would have to be a function br br br br h br br br displaystyle h br br such that br br br br h br br x br br br br displaystyle h x br br is the initial temperature at each point br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br of the bar Then the temperatures at later times can be expressed by a function br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br that depends on the function br br br br h br br br displaystyle h br br that is a functional operator so that the temperature at a later time is br br br br F br br h br br x br br t br br br br displaystyle F h x t br br br br Differential wave equations br Another way to describe and study a family of waves is to give a mathematical equation that instead of explicitly giving the value of br br br br F br br x br br t br br br br displaystyle F x t br br only constrains how those values can change with time Then the family of waves in question consists of all functions br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br that satisfy those constraints that is all solutions of the equation br This approach is extremely important in physics because the constraints usually are a consequence of the physical processes that cause the wave to evolve For example if br br br br F br br x br br t br br br br displaystyle F x t br br is the temperature inside a block of some homogeneous and isotropic solid material its evolution is constrained by the partial differential equation br br br br br

br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br for example by chemical reactions happening there br br br br br x br br br br br br br x br br br br br br br x br br br br br br br displaystyle x x x br br are the Cartesian coordinates of the point br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br br br br br br F br br br br br t br br br displaystyle partial F partial t br br is the first derivative of br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br with respect to br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br and br br br br br br br br br br F br br br br br br x br br i br br br br br br br br displaystyle partial F partial x i br br is the second derivative of br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br relative to br br br br br x br br i br br br br br displaystyle x i br br The symbol br br br br br br br displaystyle partial br br is meant to signify that in the derivative with respect to some variable all other variables must be considered fixed br This equation can be derived from the laws of physics that govern the diffusion of heat in solid media For that reason it is called the heat equation in mathematics even though it applies to many other physical quantities besides temperatures br For another example we can describe all possible sounds echoing within a container of gas by a function br br br br F br br x br br t br br br br displaystyle F x t br br that gives the pressure at a point br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br and time br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br within that container If the gas was initially at uniform temperature and

p br br br displaystyle p br br br This same differential equation describes the behavior of mechanical vibrations and electromagnetic fields in a homogeneous isotropic non conducting solid Note that this equation differs from that of heat flow only in that the left hand side is br br br br br br br br br br F br br br br br br t br br br br br br br displaystyle partial F partial t br br the second derivative of br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br with respect to time rather than the first derivative br br br br br F br br br br br t br br br displaystyle partial F partial t br br Yet this small change makes a huge difference on the set of solutions br br br br F br br br displaystyle F br br This differential equation is called the wave equation in mathematics even though it describes only one very special kind of waves br br br Wave in elastic medium br br Consider a traveling transverse wave which may be a pulse on a string the medium Consider the string to have a single spatial dimension Consider this wave as traveling br br in the br br br br x br br br displaystyle x br br direction in space For example let the positive br br br br x br br br displaystyle x

constant velocity br br br br v br br br displaystyle v br br where br br br br v br br br displaystyle v br br is br independent of wavelength no dispersion br independent of amplitude linear media not nonlinear br with constant waveform or shape br This wave can then be described by the two dimensional functions br br or more generally by d Alembert s formula br br br br br u br br x br br t br

standing wave field the one way wave equation describes the propagation of single wave in a defined direction br br br Wave forms br br The form or shape of F in d Alembert s formula involves the argument x vt Constant values of this argument correspond to constant values of F and these constant values occur if x increases at the same rate that vt increases That is the wave shaped like the function F will move in the positive x direction at velocity v and G will propagate at the same speed in the negative x direction br In the case of a periodic function F with period that is F x vt F x vt the periodicity of F in space means that a snapshot of the wave at a given time t finds the wave varying periodically in space with period the wavelength of the wave In a similar fashion this periodicity of F implies a periodicity in time as well F x v t T F x vt provided vT so an observation of the wave at a fixed location x finds the wave undulating periodically in time with period T v br br br Amplitude and modulation br br The amplitude of a wave may be constant in which case the wave is a c w or continuous wave or may be modulated so as to vary with time and or position The outline of the variation in amplitude is called the envelope of the wave Mathematically the modulated wave can be written in the form br br br br br u br br x br br t br br br A br br x br br t br br sin br br br br br k br x br br br t br br br br br br br br br displaystyle u x t A x t sin left kx omega t phi right br br br where br br br br A br br x br br br t br br br br displaystyle A x t br br is the amplitude envelope of the wave br br br br k br br br displaystyle k br br is the wavenumber and br br br br br br br displaystyle phi br br is the phase If the group velocity br br br br br v br br g br br br br br displaystyle v g br br see below is wavelength independent this equation can be simplified as br br br br br u br br x br br t br br br A br br x br br br v br br g br br br t br br sin br br br br br k br x br br br t br br br br br br br br br displaystyle u x t A x v g t sin left kx omega t phi right br br br showing that the envelope moves with the group velocity and retains its shape Otherwise in cases where the group velocity varies with wavelength the pulse shape changes in a manner often described using an envelope equation br br br Phase velocity and group velocity br br There are two velocities that are associated with waves the phase velocity and the group velocity br Phase velocity is the rate at which the phase of the wave propagates in space any given phase of the wave for example the crest will appear to travel at the phase velocity The phase velocity is given in terms of the wavelength lambda and period T as br br br br br br v br br br p br br br br br br br br T br br br br br br displaystyle v mathrm p frac lambda T br br br Group velocity is a property of waves that have a defined envelope measuring propagation through space that is phase velocity of the overall shape of the waves amplitudes modulation or envelope of the wave br br br Special waves br br br Sine waves br br br Plane waves br br A plane wave is a kind of wave whose value varies only in one spatial direction That is its value is constant on a plane that is perpendicular to that direction Plane waves can be specified by a vector of unit length br br br br br br br n br br br br br br br displaystyle hat n br br indicating the direction that the wave varies in and a wave profile describing how the wave varies as a function of the displacement along that direction br br br br br br br n br br br br br br br br br x br br br br br br br displaystyle hat n cdot vec x br br and time br br br br t br br br displaystyle t br br Since the wave profile only depends on the position br br br br br br br x br br br br br br br displaystyle vec x br br in the combination br br br br br br br n br br br br br br br br br x br br br br br br br displaystyle hat n cdot vec x br br any displacement in directions perpendicular to br br br br br br br n br br br br br br br displaystyle hat n br br cannot affect the value of the field br Plane waves are often used to model electromagnetic waves far from a source For electromagnetic plane waves the electric and magnetic fields themselves are transverse to the direction of propagation and also perpendicular to each other br br br Standing waves br br A standing wave also known as a stationary wave is a wave whose envelope remains in a constant position This phenomenon arises as a result of interference between two waves traveling in opposite directions br The sum of two counter propagating waves of equal amplitude and frequency creates a standing wave Standing waves commonly arise when a boundary blocks further propagation of the wave thus causing wave reflection and therefore introducing a counter propagating wave For example when a violin string is displaced transverse waves propagate out to where the string is held in place at the bridge and the nut where the waves are reflected back At the bridge and nut the two opposed waves are in antiphase and cancel each other producing a node Halfway between two nodes there is an antinode where the two counter propagating waves enhance each other maximally There is no net propagation of energy over time br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Solitary waves br br A soliton or solitary wave is a self reinforcing wave packet that maintains its shape while it propagates at a constant velocity Solitons are caused by a cancellation of nonlinear and dispersive effects in the medium Dispersive effects are a property of certain systems where the speed of a wave depends on its frequency Solitons are the solutions of a widespread class of weakly nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations describing physical systems br br br Physical properties br br br Propagation br Wave propagation is any of the ways in which waves travel Single wave propagation can be calculated by second order wave equation standing wavefield or first order one way wave equation br With respect to the direction of the oscillation relative to the propagation direction we can distinguish between longitudinal wave and transverse waves br Electromagnetic waves propagate in vacuum as well as in material media Propagation of other wave types such as sound may occur only in a transmission medium br br br Reflection of plane waves in a half space br br The propagation and reflection of plane waves e g Pressure waves P wave or Shear waves SH or SV waves are phenomena that were first characterized within the field of classical seismology and are now considered fundamental concepts in modern seismic tomography The analytical solution to this problem exists and is well known The frequency domain solution can be obtained by first finding the Helmholtz decomposition of the displacement field which is then substituted into the wave equation From here the plane wave eigenmodes can be calculated br br br SV wave propagation br br The analytical solution of SV wave in a half space indicates that the plane SV wave reflects back to the domain as a P and SV waves leaving out special cases The angle of the reflected SV wave is identical to the incidence wave while the angle of the reflected P wave is greater than the SV wave For the same wave frequency the SV wavelength is smaller than the P wavelength This fact has been depicted in this animated picture br br br P wave propagation br Similar to the SV wave the P incidence in general reflects as the P and SV wave There are some special cases where the regime is different br br br Wave velocity br br Wave velocity is a general concept of various kinds of wave velocities for a wave s phase and speed concerning energy and information propagation The phase velocity is given as br br br br br br v br br br p br br br br br br br br k br br br br br br displaystyle v rm p frac omega k br br br where br br vp is the phase velocity with SI unit m s br is the angular frequency with SI unit rad s br k is the wavenumber with SI unit rad m br The phase speed gives you the speed at which a point of constant phase of the wave will travel for a discrete frequency The angular frequency cannot be chosen independently from the wavenumber k but both are related through the dispersion relationship br br br br br br br br br k br br br br br displaystyle omega Omega k br br br In the special case k ck with c a constant the waves are called non dispersive since all frequencies travel at the same phase speed c For instance electromagnetic waves in vacuum are non dispersive In case of other forms of the dispersion relation we have dispersive waves The dispersion relationship depends on the medium through which the waves propagate and on the type of waves for instance electromagnetic sound or water waves br The speed at which a resultant wave packet from a narrow range of frequencies will travel is called the group velocity and is determined from the gradient of the dispersion relation br br br br br br v br br br g br br br br br br br br br br br br br k br br br br br br displaystyle v rm g frac partial omega partial k br br br In almost all cases a wave is mainly a movement of energy through a medium Most often the group velocity is the velocity at which the energy moves through this medium br br Waves exhibit common behaviors under a number of standard situations for example br br br Transmission and media br br Waves normally move in a straight line that is rectilinearly through a transmission medium Such media can be classified into one or more of the following categories br br A bounded medium if it is finite in extent otherwise an unbounded medium br A linear medium if the amplitudes of different waves at any particular point in the medium can be added br A uniform medium or homogeneous medium if its physical properties are unchanged at different locations in space br An anisotropic medium if one or more of its physical properties differ in one or more directions br An isotropic medium if its physical properties are the same in all directions br br br Absorption br br Waves are usually defined in media which allow most or all of a wave s energy to propagate without loss However materials may be characterized as lossy if they remove energy from a wave usually converting it into heat This is termed absorption A material which absorbs a wave s energy either in transmission or reflection is characterized by a refractive index which is complex The amount of absorption will generally depend on the frequency wavelength of the wave which for instance explains why objects may appear colored br br br Reflection br br When a wave strikes a reflective surface it changes direction such that the angle made by the incident wave and line normal to the surface equals the angle made by the reflected wave and the same normal line br br br Refraction br br Refraction is the phenomenon of a wave changing its speed Mathematically this means that the size of the phase velocity changes Typically refraction occurs when a wave passes from one medium into another The amount by which a wave is refracted by a material is given by the refractive index of the material The directions of incidence and refraction are related to the refractive indices of the two materials by Snell s law br br br Diffraction br br A wave exhibits diffraction when it encounters an obstacle that bends the wave or when it spreads after emerging from an opening Diffraction effects are more pronounced when the size of the obstacle or opening is comparable to the wavelength of the wave br br br Interference br br When waves in a linear medium the usual case cross each other in a region of space they do not actually interact with each other but continue on as if the other one were not present However at any point in that region the field quantities describing those waves add according to the superposition principle If the waves are of the same frequency in a fixed phase relationship then there will generally be positions at which the two waves are in phase and their amplitudes add and other positions where they are out of phase and their amplitudes partially or fully cancel This is called an interference pattern br br br Polarization br br The phenomenon of polarization arises when wave motion can occur simultaneously in two orthogonal directions Transverse waves can be polarized for instance When polarization is used as a descriptor without qualification it usually refers to the special simple case of linear polarization A transverse wave is linearly polarized if it oscillates in only one direction or plane In the case of linear polarization it is often useful to add the relative orientation of that plane perpendicular to the direction of travel in which the oscillation occurs such as horizontal for instance if the plane of polarization is parallel to the ground Electromagnetic waves propagating in free space for instance are transverse they can be polarized by the use of a polarizing filter br Longitudinal waves such as sound waves do not exhibit polarization For these waves there is only one direction of oscillation that is along the direction of travel br br br Dispersion br br A wave undergoes dispersion when either the phase velocity or the group velocity depends on the wave frequency br Dispersion is most easily seen by letting white light pass through a prism the result of which is to produce the spectrum of colors of the rainbow Isaac Newton performed experiments with light and prisms presenting his findings in the Opticks that white light consists of several colors and that these colors cannot be decomposed any further br br br Doppler effect br br The Doppler effect or Doppler shift is the change in frequency of a wave in relation to an observer who is moving relative to the wave source It is named after the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler who described the phenomenon in br br br Mechanical waves br br A mechanical wave is an oscillation of matter and therefore transfers energy through a medium While waves can move over long distances the movement of the medium of transmission the material is limited Therefore the oscillating material does not move far from its initial position Mechanical waves can be produced only in media which possess elasticity and inertia There are three types of mechanical waves transverse waves longitudinal waves and surface waves br br br Waves on strings br br The transverse vibration of a string is a function of tension and inertia and is constrained by the length of the string as the ends are fixed This constraint limits the steady state modes that are possible and thereby the frequencies br The speed of a transverse wave traveling along a vibrating string v is directly proportional to the square root of the tension of the string T over the linear mass density br br br br br v br br br br br T br br br br br br br br displaystyle v sqrt frac T mu br br br where the linear density is the mass per unit length of the string br br br Acoustic waves br br Acoustic or sound waves are compression waves which travel as body waves at the speed given by

medium see speed of sound br br br Water waves br br Ripples on the surface of a pond are actually a combination of transverse and longitudinal waves therefore the points on the surface follow orbital paths br Sound a mechanical wave that propagates through gases liquids solids and plasmas br Inertial waves which occur in rotating fluids and are restored by the Coriolis effect br Ocean surface waves which are perturbations that propagate through water br br br Body waves br br Body waves travel through the interior of the medium along paths controlled by the material properties in terms of density and modulus stiffness The density and modulus in turn vary according to temperature composition and material phase This effect resembles the refraction of light waves Two types of particle motion result in two types of body waves Primary and Secondary waves br br br Seismic waves br br Seismic waves are waves of energy that travel through the Earth s layers and are a result of earthquakes volcanic eruptions magma movement large landslides and large man made explosions that give out low frequency acoustic energy They include body waves the primary P waves and secondary waves S waves and surface waves such as Rayleigh waves Love waves and Stoneley waves br br br Shock waves br br A shock wave is a type of propagating disturbance When a wave moves faster than the local speed of sound in a fluid it is a shock wave Like an ordinary wave a shock wave carries energy and can propagate through a medium however it is characterized by an abrupt nearly discontinuous change in pressure temperature and density of the medium br br br Shear waves br br Shear waves are body waves due to shear rigidity and inertia They can only be transmitted through solids and to a lesser extent through liquids with a sufficiently high viscosity br br br Other br Waves of traffic that is propagation of different densities of motor vehicles and so forth which can be modeled as kinematic waves br Metachronal wave refers to the appearance of a traveling wave produced by coordinated sequential actions br br br Electromagnetic waves br br An electromagnetic wave consists of two waves that are oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields An electromagnetic wave travels in a direction that is at right angles to the oscillation direction of both fields In the th century James Clerk Maxwell showed that in vacuum the electric and magnetic fields satisfy the wave equation both with speed equal to that of the speed of light From this emerged the idea that light is an electromagnetic wave The unification of light and electromagnetic waves was experimentally confirmed by Hertz in the end of the s Electromagnetic waves can have different frequencies and thus

continuous and the limits of each band are mostly arbitrary with the exception of visible light which must be visible to the normal human eye br br br Quantum mechanical waves br br br Schr dinger

density of a particle br br br Dirac equation br The Dirac equation is a relativistic wave equation detailing electromagnetic interactions Dirac waves accounted for the fine details of the hydrogen spectrum in a completely rigorous way The wave equation also implied the existence of a new form of matter antimatter previously unsuspected and unobserved and which was experimentally confirmed In the context of quantum field theory the Dirac equation is reinterpreted to describe quantum fields corresponding to spin particles br br br de Broglie waves br br Louis de Broglie postulated that all

momentum of the particle This hypothesis was at the basis of quantum mechanics Nowadays this wavelength is called the de Broglie wavelength For example the electrons in a CRT display have a de Broglie

with definite wavelength is not localized in space and so cannot represent a particle localized in space To localize a particle de Broglie proposed a superposition of different wavelengths ranging around a central value in a wave packet a waveform often used in quantum mechanics to describe the wave function of a particle In a wave packet the wavelength of the particle is not precise and the local wavelength deviates on either side of the main wavelength value br In representing the wave function of a localized particle the wave packet is often taken to have a Gaussian shape and is called a Gaussian wave packet Gaussian wave packets also are used to analyze water waves br For example a Gaussian wavefunction might take the form br br br br br br br x br br br t br br br br br A br exp
