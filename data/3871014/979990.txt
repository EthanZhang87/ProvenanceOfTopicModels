A secondary color is a color made by mixing two primary colors of a given color model in even proportions Combining two secondary colors in the same manner produces a tertiary color Secondary colors are special in traditional color theory but have no special meaning in color science br br br Overview br br br Primary color br br In traditional color theory it is believed that all colors can be mixed from universal primary or pure colors which were originally believed to be red yellow and blue pigments representing the RYB color model However modern color science does not recognize universal primary colors and only defines primary colors for a given color model or color space RGB and CMYK color models are popular color models in modern color science but are only chosen as efficient primaries in that their combination leads to a large gamut However any three primaries can produce a viable color gamut The RYB model continues to be used and taught as a color model for practical color mixing in the visual arts br br br Secondary color br A secondary color is an even mixture of two primary colors For a given color model secondary colors have no special meaning but are useful when comparing additive and subtractive color models br br br Intermediate color br An intermediate color is any mixture of a secondary and a primary color They are often visualized as even mixtures but intermediate colors can arise from any mixture proportion Therefore any color that is not a secondary or primary color is an intermediate color br br br Tertiary color br Tertiary color has two common conflicting definitions depending on context br In traditional color theory which applies mostly to practical painting a tertiary color is an even mixture between two secondary colors i e a mixture of three primaries in proportion This definition is used by color theorists such as Moses Harris and Josef Albers The result is approximately a less saturated form of the dominant primary color of the mixture Under this definition a color model has tertiary colors br More recently an alternative definition has emerged that is more applicable to digital media where a tertiary color is an intermediate color resulting from an even mixture of a primary and a secondary color i e a mixture of the primaries in proportion The result yields a maximum saturation for a given hue Under this definition a color model has tertiary colors br br br Quaternary color br A quaternary color is a seldom used descriptor that is the conceptual extension of a tertiary color Quaternary colors have no special use or status in color theory or color science br Under the traditional definition a quaternary color is the even mixture of two tertiary colors as demonstrated by Charles Hayter These quaternary colors have contributions from all three primaries in proportions so are very desaturated even mixtures of three primaries gives a neutral color zero saturation Under this definition a color model has quaternary colors br Under the modern definition a quaternary color is the even mixture of a tertiary color with either a secondary or primary color Quaternary colors are sometimes given a maximum saturation for their hue Under this definition a color model has quaternary colors br br br RGB and CMYK br br The RGB color model is an additive mixing model used to estimate the mixing of colored light with primary colors red green and blue The secondary colors are yellow cyan and magenta as demonstrated here br br The CMY color model is an analogous subtractive mixing color model used to estimate the mixing of colored pigments with primary colors cyan magenta and yellow equivalent to the secondary colors of the RGB color model The secondary colors of the CMY model are blue red and green equivalent to the primary colors of the RGB model as demonstrated here br br Under the modern definition the tertiary colors are conceptually equivalent between the color models and can be described by the even combinations of a primary and a secondary color br br A color model is a conceptual model and does not have specifically defined primary colors A color space based on the RGB color model most commonly sRGB has defined primaries and can be used to visualize the color mixing and yield approximate tertiary colors Also note that the color terms applied to tertiary and quaternary colors are not well defined br br br RYB color model br br RYB is a subtractive mixing color model used to estimate the mixing of pigments e g paint in traditional color theory with primary colors red yellow and blue The secondary colors are green purple and orange as demonstrated here br br Under the modern definition as even combinations of a primary and a secondary color tertiary colors are typically named by combining the names of the adjacent primary and secondary color However these tertiary colors have also been ascribed with common names amber marigold yellow orange vermilion cinnabar red orange magenta red purple violet blue purple teal aqua blue green and chartreuse lime green yellow green The tertiary colors are given br br Approximate colors and color names are given for the tertiary and quaternary colors However the names for the twelve quaternary colors are quite variable and defined here only as an approximation br br Under the traditional definition there are three tertiary colors approximately named russet orange purple slate purple green and citron green orange with the corresponding three quaternary colors plum russet slate sage slate citron buff citron russet with olive sometimes used for either slate or citron In every level of mixing saturation of the resultant decreases and mixing two quaternary colors approaches gray br The RYB color terminology outlined above and in the color samples shown below is ultimately derived from the book Chromatography an analysis of the RYB color wheel by George Field a chemist who specialized in
