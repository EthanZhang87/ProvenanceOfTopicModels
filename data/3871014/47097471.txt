Since the introduction of Crayola drawing crayons by Binney Smith in more than two hundred colors have been produced in a wide variety of assortments The line has undergone several major revisions notably in and Numerous specialty crayons have also been produced complementing the basic Crayola assortment br br br the original Crayola colors br br After several decades producing commercial pigments Binney Smith produced their first crayon the black Staonal Marking Crayon in The following year the company decided to enter the consumer market with its first drawing crayons The name Crayola was suggested by Alice Binney wife of company founder Edwin Binney combining craie French for chalk a reference to the pastels that preceded and lent their name to the first drawing crayons with the suffix ola meaning oleaginous a reference to the wax from which the crayons were made Initially this was just one of the brands produced by Binney Smith other crayons were produced under names such as Cerola Cerata Durel Perma and Boston among others but the Crayola brand proved the most successful and was produced in two lines Crayola Gold Medal School Crayons and Rubens Crayola Artists Crayons br Early Crayola advertising mentions thirty different colors although there is no official list in fact thirty eight different crayons are known from Crayola boxes of this period The largest labeled assortment was box No titled Crayola Young Artists Drawing Crayons which included twenty eight different crayons Other colors were found in different boxes including the Rubens No a twenty four crayon assortment The names of several crayons varied from box to box in general the larger assortments tended to use names associated with oil paints and in fact early Crayola literature frequently describes drawing with crayons as a form of painting br Over time simpler names were favored and several colors were discontinued by including Light and Dark Venetian Red Permanent Geranium Lake Celestial Blue Raw Sienna and Charcoal Gray the use of Purple as an alternative for Violet ended about and after Gold Silver and Copper were no longer available in assortments although Gold and Silver were still available in bulk br br br Munsell Crayola br br In Binney Smith acquired the Munsell Color Company s line of crayons based on the Munsell color system developed by Albert Henry Munsell This marked the first time that Crayola crayons incorporated the concept of the color wheel The Munsell color wheel consisted of five principal hues red yellow green blue and purple and five intermediate hues yellow red green yellow blue green blue purple and red purple Each color was available in either maximum chroma or with middle value and middle chroma Three different packages were offered a box of seven containing the five principal hues at maximum chroma plus Middle Gray and Black a box of twelve containing the five principal hues both at maximum chroma and at middle value and chroma plus Middle Gray and Black and a box of twenty two containing both the principal and intermediate hues each at maximum chroma as well as with middle value and chroma plus Middle Gray and Black br The Munsell color wheel prompted Binney Smith to adopt a similar color wheel concept for Crayola crayons in using six principal hues red orange yellow green blue and violet and six intermediate hues red orange yellow orange yellow green blue green blue violet and red violet for a twelve color wheel These were combined with Black Neutral Gray White and Brown to produce a sixteen color box Munsell Crayola boxes were discontinued in although the crayons were produced in specially marked Crayola boxes until when wartime shortages made many of the pigments necessary for crayon production unavailable Munsell crayons were not produced again after the war but the concept of the color wheel pioneered by Munsell remained a fundamental part of the Crayola lineup until br The Munsell colors are depicted in the table below br br br Changes through br br From to Binney Smith refined the Crayola line up discontinuing some colors adjusting others and incorporating the Munsell colors into its regular line In the company introduced the No assortment containing fifty two colors including all of the Munsell colors and all but six of the other crayons then being produced Although it was by far the largest Crayola assortment yet offered the No received little publicity and was only produced for about five years in wartime shortages made the pigments necessary to produce many colors unavailable br When full production was resumed in Binney Smith eliminated most of the Munsell colors and their significant overlap with other hues The new lineup was based around the twelve color Crayola color wheel first developed in the s While new crayons were added to the assortment the overall number of colors dropped to forty eight and the No box was formally discontinued in favor of the new No assortment containing all of the colors then being produced br While many older crayons were eliminated from the Crayola line several new colors representing light medium and dark shades of the principal and intermediate hues were added to create the most systematic assortment yet produced For ten years the No box was Crayola s largest collection and for decades afterward it remained an integral part of the line br br br Crayola No br br Introduced in the Crayola No was Binney Smith s largest regular assortment for more than thirty years and featured the last major changes to Crayola colors before The iconic flip top box arranged sixty four crayons in four rows of sixteen progressively raised to allow for easier access and a crayon sharpener built into the back of the box br Although a few of the colors from the No box were discontinued at this time most were retained sometimes with different names and several new crayons were added to the assortment including six new intermediate hues as the Crayola color wheel expanded from twelve to eighteen colors br br br Changes br The first changes to the No box were made in its first year of production as Light Blue and Brilliant Rose were replaced by Turquoise Blue and Magenta From then to no colors were replaced although in Flesh was formally renamed Peach partially in response to the civil rights movement the company said Flesh had been known as Flesh Tint until and was called Pink Beige from to In the flesh colored crayon was not featured in the commemorative box because Crayola felt it was insensitive They recognized that not all skin tones are the same br The s saw the introduction of Crayola s first specialty crayons eight fluorescent colors designed to glow under black light These were never added to the No box but were available separately or in a special box of crayons typically packaged with activity books or crayon stands Fabric crayons were introduced in as the Crayola brand
