In color science a color model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers typically as three or four values or color components When this model is associated with a precise description of how the components are to be interpreted viewing conditions etc taking account of visual perception the resulting set of colors is called color space br This article describes ways in which human color vision can be modeled and discusses some of the models in common use br br br Tristimulus color space br br One can picture this space as a region in three dimensional Euclidean space if one identifies the x y and z axes with the stimuli for the long wavelength L medium wavelength M and short wavelength S light receptors The origin S M L corresponds to black White has no definite position in this diagram rather it is defined according to the color temperature or white balance as desired or as available from ambient lighting The human color space is a horse shoe shaped cone such as shown here see also CIE chromaticity diagram below extending from the origin to in principle infinity In practice the human color receptors will be saturated or even be damaged at extremely high light intensities but such behavior is not part of the CIE color space and neither is the changing color perception at low light levels see Kruithof curve The most saturated colors are located at the outer rim of the region with brighter colors farther removed from the origin As far as the responses of the receptors in the eye are concerned there is no such thing as brown or gray light The latter color names refer to orange and white light respectively with an intensity that is lower than the light from surrounding areas One can observe this by watching the screen of an overhead projector during a meeting one sees black lettering on a white background even though the black has in fact not become darker than the white screen on which it is projected before the projector was turned on The black areas have not actually become darker but appear black relative to the higher intensity white projected onto the screen around it See also color constancy br The human tristimulus space has the property that additive mixing of colors corresponds to the adding of vectors in this space This makes it easy to for example describe the possible colors gamut that can be constructed from the red green and blue primaries in a computer display br br br CIE XYZ color space br br One of the first mathematically defined color spaces is the CIE XYZ color space also known as CIE color space created by the International Commission on Illumination in These data were measured for human observers and a degree field of view In supplemental data for a degree field of view were published br Note that the tabulated sensitivity curves have a certain amount of arbitrariness in them The shapes of the individual X Y and Z sensitivity curves can be measured with a reasonable accuracy However the overall luminosity function which in fact is a weighted sum of these three curves is subjective since it involves asking a test person whether two light sources have the same brightness even if they are in completely different colors Along the same lines the relative magnitudes of the X Y and Z curves are arbitrarily chosen to produce equal areas under the curves One could as well define a valid color space with an X sensitivity curve that has twice the amplitude This new color space would have a different shape The sensitivity curves in the CIE and xyz color space are scaled to have equal areas under the curves br Sometimes XYZ colors are represented by the luminance Y and chromaticity coordinates x and y defined by br br br br br x br br br br X br br X br br Y br br Z br br br br br br displaystyle x frac X X Y Z br br and br br br br y br br br br Y br br X br br Y br br Z br br br br br br displaystyle y frac Y X Y Z br br br Mathematically x and y are projective coordinates and the colors of the chromaticity diagram occupy a region of the real projective plane Because the CIE sensitivity curves have equal areas under the curves light with a flat energy spectrum corresponds to the point x y br The values for X Y and Z are obtained by integrating the product of the spectrum of a light beam and the published color matching functions br br br Additive and subtractive color models br br br RYB color model br br RYB is a subtractive color model used in art and applied design in which red yellow and blue pigments are considered primary colors The RYB color model relates specifically to color in the form of paint and pigment application in art and design Other common color models include the light model RGB and the paint pigment and ink CMY color model which is much more accurate in terms of color gamut and intensity compared to the traditional RYB color model the latter emerging in conjunction with the CMYK color model in the printing industry This model was used for printing by Jacob Christoph Le Blon in and called it Coloritto or harmony of colouring stating that the primitive primary colors are yellow red and blue while the secondary are orange green and purple or violet br br br RGB color model br br Media that transmit light such as television use additive color mixing with primary colors of red green and blue each of which stimulates one of the three types of the eye s color receptors with as little stimulation as possible of the other two This is called RGB color space Mixtures of light of these primary colors cover a large part of the human color space and thus produce a large part of human color experiences This is why color television sets or color computer monitors need only produce mixtures of red green and blue light See Additive color br Other primary colors could in principle be used but with red green and blue the largest portion of the human color space can be captured Unfortunately there is no exact consensus as to what loci in the chromaticity diagram the red green and blue colors should have so the same RGB values can give rise to slightly different colors on different screens br RGB is a device dependent color model different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently since the color elements such as phosphors or dyes and their response to the individual red green and blue levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer or even in the same device over time Thus an RGB value does not define the same color across devices without some kind of color management br br br CMY and CMYK color models br br It is possible to achieve a large range of colors seen by humans by combining cyan magenta and yellow transparent dyes inks on a white substrate These are the subtractive primary colors Often a fourth ink black is added to improve reproduction of some dark colors This is called the CMY or CMYK color space br The cyan ink absorbs red light but transmits green and blue the magenta ink absorbs green light but transmits red and blue and the yellow ink absorbs blue light but transmits red and green The white substrate reflects the transmitted light back to the viewer Because in practice the CMY inks suitable for printing also reflect a little bit of color making a deep and neutral black impossible the K black ink component usually printed last is needed to compensate for their deficiencies Use of a separate black ink is also economically driven when a lot of black content is expected e g in text media to reduce simultaneous use of the three colored inks The dyes used in traditional color photographic prints and slides are much more perfectly transparent so a K component is normally not needed or used in those media br br br Cylindrical coordinate color models br A number of color models exist in which colors are fit into conic cylindrical or spherical shapes with neutrals running from black to white along a central axis and hues corresponding to angles around the perimeter Arrangements of this type date back to the th century and continue to be developed in the most modern and scientific models br br br Background br br Different color theorists have each designed unique color solids Many are in the shape of a sphere whereas others are warped three dimensional ellipsoid figures these variations being designed to express some aspect of the relationship of the colors more clearly The color spheres conceived by Phillip Otto Runge and Johannes Itten are typical examples and prototypes for many other color solid schematics The models of Runge and Itten are basically identical and form the basis for the description below br Pure saturated hues of equal brightness are located around the equator at the periphery of the color sphere As in the color wheel contrasting or complementary hues are located opposite each other Moving toward the center of the color sphere on the equatorial plane colors become less and less saturated until all colors meet at the central axis as a neutral gray Moving vertically in the color sphere colors become lighter toward the top and darker toward the bottom At the upper pole all hues meet in white at the bottom pole all hues meet in black br The vertical axis of the color sphere then is gray all along its length varying from black at the bottom to white at the top All pure saturated hues are located on the surface of the sphere varying from light to dark down the color sphere All impure unsaturated hues created by mixing contrasting colors comprise the sphere s interior likewise varying in brightness from top to bottom br br br HSL and HSV br br HSL and HSV are both cylindrical geometries with hue their angular dimension starting at the red primary at passing through the green primary at and the blue primary at and then wrapping back to red at In each geometry the central vertical axis comprises the neutral achromatic or gray colors ranging from black at lightness or value the bottom to white at lightness or value the top br Most televisions computer displays and projectors produce colors by combining red green and blue light in varying intensities the so called RGB additive primary colors However the relationship between the constituent amounts of red green and blue light and the resulting color is unintuitive especially for inexperienced users and for users familiar with subtractive color mixing of paints or traditional artists models based on tints and shades br In an attempt to accommodate more traditional and intuitive color mixing models computer graphics pioneers at PARC and NYIT developed the HSV model in the mid s formally described by Alvy Ray Smith in the August issue of Computer Graphics In the same issue Joblove and Greenberg described the HSL model whose dimensions they labeled hue relative chroma and intensity and compared it to HSV Their model was based more upon how colors are organized and conceptualized in human vision in terms of other color making attributes such as hue lightness and chroma as well as upon traditional color mixing methods e g in painting that involve mixing brightly colored pigments with black or white to achieve lighter darker or less colorful colors br The following year at SIGGRAPH Tektronix introduced graphics terminals using HSL for color designation and the Computer Graphics Standards Committee recommended it in their annual status report These models were useful not only because they were more intuitive than raw RGB values but also because the conversions to and from RGB were extremely fast to compute they could run in real time on the hardware of the s Consequently these models and similar ones have become ubiquitous throughout image editing and graphics software since then br br br Munsell color system br br Another influential older cylindrical color model is the early th century Munsell color system Albert Munsell began with a spherical arrangement in his book A Color Notation but he wished to properly separate color making attributes into separate dimensions which he called hue value and chroma and after taking careful measurements of perceptual responses he realized that no symmetrical shape would do so he reorganized his system into a lumpy blob br Munsell s system became extremely popular the de facto reference for American color standards used not only for specifying the color of paints and crayons but also e g electrical wire beer and soil color because it was organized based on perceptual measurements specified colors via an easily learned and systematic triple of numbers because the color chips sold in the Munsell Book of Color covered a wide gamut and remained stable over time rather than fading and because it was effectively marketed by Munsell s Company In the s the Optical Society of America made extensive measurements and adjusted the arrangement of Munsell colors issuing a set of renotations The trouble with the Munsell system for computer graphics applications is that its colors are not specified via any set of simple equations but only via its foundational measurements effectively a lookup table Converting from RGB Munsell requires interpolating between that table s entries and is extremely computationally expensive in comparison with converting from RGB HSL or RGB HSV which only requires a few simple arithmetic operations br br br Natural Color System br br The Swedish Natural Color System NCS widely used in Europe takes a similar approach to the Ostwald bicone at right Because it attempts to fit color into a familiarly shaped solid based on phenomenological instead of photometric or psychological characteristics it suffers from some of the same disadvantages as HSL and HSV in particular its lightness dimension differs from perceived lightness because it forces colorful yellow red green and blue into a plane br br br Preucil hue circle br In densitometry a model quite similar to the hue defined above is used for describing colors of CMYK process inks In Frank Preucil developed two geometric arrangements of hue the Preucil hue circle and the Preucil hue hexagon analogous to our H and H respectively but defined relative to idealized cyan yellow and magenta ink colors The Preucil hue error of an ink indicates the difference in the hue circle between its color and the hue of the corresponding idealized ink color The grayness of an ink is m M where m and M are the minimum and maximum among the amounts of idealized cyan magenta and yellow in a density measurement br br br CIELCHuv and CIELCHab br br The International Commission on Illumination CIE developed the XYZ model for describing the colors of light spectra in but its goal was to match human visual metamerism rather than to be perceptually uniform geometrically In the s and s attempts were made to transform XYZ colors into a more relevant geometry influenced by the Munsell system These efforts culminated in the CIELUV and CIELAB models The dimensions of these models L u v and L a b respectively are cartesian based on the opponent process theory of color but both are also often described using polar coordinates L C uv h uv and L C ab h ab respectively where L is lightness C is chroma and h is hue angle Officially both CIELAB and CIELUV were created for their color difference metrics E ab and E uv particularly for use defining color tolerances but both have become widely used as color order systems and color appearance models including in computer graphics and computer vision For example gamut mapping in ICC color management is usually performed in CIELAB space and Adobe Photoshop includes a CIELAB mode for editing images CIELAB and CIELUV geometries are much more perceptually relevant than many others such as RGB HSL HSV YUV YIQ YCbCr or XYZ but are not perceptually perfect and in particular have trouble adapting to unusual lighting conditions br The HCL color space seems to be synonymous with CIELCH br br br CIECAM br The CIE s most recent model CIECAM CAM stands for color appearance model is more theoretically sophisticated and computationally complex than earlier models Its aims are to fix several of the problems with models such as CIELAB and CIELUV and to explain not only responses in carefully controlled experimental environments but also to model the color appearance of real world scenes Its dimensions J lightness C chroma and h hue define a polar coordinate geometry br br br Color systems br There are various types of color systems that classify color and analyse their effects The American Munsell color system devised by Albert H Munsell is a famous classification that organises various colors into a color solid based on hue saturation and value Other important color systems include the Swedish Natural Color System NCS the Optical Society of America s Uniform Color Space OSA UCS and the Hungarian Coloroid system developed by Antal Nemcsics from the Budapest University of Technology and Economics Of those the NCS is based on the opponent process color model while the Munsell the OSA UCS and the Coloroid attempt to model color uniformity The American Pantone and the German RAL commercial color matching systems differ from the previous ones in that their color spaces are not based on an underlying color model br br br Other uses of color model br br br Models of mechanism of color vision br We also use color model to indicate a model or mechanism of color vision for explaining how color signals are processed from visual cones to ganglion cells For simplicity we call these models color mechanism models The classical color mechanism models are Young Helmholtz s trichromatic model and Hering s opponent process model Though these two theories were initially thought to be at odds it later came to be understood that the mechanisms responsible for color opponency receive signals from the three types of cones and process them at a more complex level A widely accepted model is called the zone model A symmetrical zone model compatible with the trichromatic theory the opponent theory and Smith s color transform model is called the decoding model br br br Vertebrate evolution of color vision br br Vertebrate animals were primitively tetrachromatic They possessed four types of cones long mid short wavelength cones and ultraviolet sensitive cones Today fish amphibians reptiles and birds are all tetrachromatic Placental mammals lost both the mid and short wavelength cones Thus most mammals do not have complex color vision they are dichromatic but they are sensitive to ultraviolet light though they cannot see its colors Human trichromatic color vision is a recent evolutionary novelty that first evolved in the common ancestor of the Old World Primates Our trichromatic color vision evolved by duplication of the long wavelength sensitive opsin found on the X chromosome One of these copies evolved to be sensitive to green light and constitutes our mid wavelength opsin At the same time our short wavelength opsin evolved from the ultraviolet opsin of our vertebrate and mammalian ancestors br Human red green color blindness occurs because the two copies of the red and green opsin genes remain in close proximity on the X chromosome Because of frequent recombination during meiosis these gene pairs can get easily rearranged creating versions of the genes that do not have distinct spectral sensitivities br br br See also br Color appearance model br
