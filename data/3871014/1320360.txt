In radiometry photometry and color science a spectral power distribution SPD measurement describes the power per unit area per unit wavelength of an illumination radiant exitance More generally the term spectral power distribution can refer to the concentration as a function of wavelength of any radiometric or photometric quantity e g radiant energy radiant flux radiant intensity radiance irradiance radiant exitance radiosity luminance luminous flux luminous intensity illuminance luminous emittance br Knowledge of the SPD is crucial for optical sensor system applications Optical properties such as transmittance reflectivity and absorbance as well as the sensor response are typically dependent on the incident wavelength br br br Physics br Mathematically for the spectral power distribution of a radiant exitance or irradiance one may write br br br br br M br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br A br br br br br br br br br br br br A br br br br br br br br br displaystyle M lambda frac partial Phi partial A partial lambda approx frac Phi A Delta lambda br br br where M is the spectral irradiance or exitance of the light SI units W m kg m s is the radiant flux of the source SI unit watt W A is the area over which the radiant flux is integrated SI unit square meter m and is the wavelength SI unit meter m Note that it is more convenient to express the wavelength of light in terms of nanometers spectral exitance would then be expressed in units of W m nm The approximation is valid when the area and wavelength interval are small br br br Relative SPD br br The ratio of spectral concentration irradiance or exitance at a given wavelength to the concentration of a reference wavelength provides the relative SPD This can be written as br br br br br br M br br br r br e br l br br br br br br br br br br br M br br br br br br M br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle M mathrm rel lambda frac M lambda M left lambda right br br br For instance the luminance of lighting fixtures and other light sources are handled separately a spectral power distribution may be normalized in some manner often to unity at or nanometers coinciding with the peak of the eye s luminosity function br br br Responsivity br The SPD can be used to determine the response of a sensor at a specified wavelength This compares the output power of the sensor to the input power as a function of wavelength This can be generalized in the following formula br br br br br R br br br br br br br br S br br br br br br M br br br br br br br br br displaystyle R lambda frac S lambda M lambda br br br Knowing the responsitivity is beneficial for determination of illumination interactive material components and optical components to optimize performance of a system s design br br br Source SPD and matter br The spectral power distribution over the visible spectrum from a source can have varying concentrations of relative SPDs The interactions between light and matter affect the absorption and reflectance properties of materials and subsequently produces a color that varies with source illumination br For example the relative spectral power distribution of the sun produces a white appearance if observed directly but when the sunlight illuminates the Earth s atmosphere the sky appears blue under normal daylight conditions This stems from the optical phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering which produces a concentration of shorter wavelengths and hence the blue color appearance br br br Source SPD and color appearance br br The human visual response relies on trichromacy to process color appearance While the human visual response integrates over all wavelengths the relative spectral power distribution will provide color appearance modeling information as the concentration of wavelength band s will become the primary contributors to the perceived color br This becomes useful in photometry and colorimetry as the perceived color changes with source illumination and spectral distribution and coincides with metamerisms where an object s color appearance changes br The spectral makeup of the source can also coincide with color temperature producing differences in color appearance due to the source s temperature br br br See also br br br br br br External links br Spectral Power Distribution Curves GE Lighting
