Ultraviolet UV light is electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths of nanometers shorter than that of visible light but longer than X rays UV radiation is present in sunlight and constitutes about of the total electromagnetic radiation output from the Sun It is also produced by electric arcs Cherenkov radiation and specialized lights such as mercury vapor lamps tanning lamps and black lights br The photons of ultraviolet have greater energy than those of visible light from about to electron volts around the minimum energy required to ionize atoms Although long wavelength ultraviolet is not considered an ionizing radiation because its photons lack sufficient energy it can induce chemical reactions and cause many substances to glow or fluoresce Many practical applications including chemical and biological effects are derived from the way that UV radiation can interact with organic molecules These interactions can involve absorption or adjusting energy states in molecules but do not necessarily involve heating Short wave ultraviolet light is ionizing radiation Consequently short wave UV damages DNA and sterilizes surfaces with which it comes into contact br For humans suntan and sunburn are familiar effects of exposure of the skin to UV light along with an increased risk of skin cancer The amount of UV light produced by the Sun means that the Earth would not be able to sustain life on dry land if most of that light were not filtered out by the atmosphere More energetic shorter wavelength extreme UV below nm ionizes air so strongly that it is absorbed before it reaches the ground However ultraviolet light specifically UVB is also responsible for the formation of vitamin D in most land vertebrates including humans The UV spectrum thus has effects both beneficial and detrimental to life br The lower wavelength limit of the visible spectrum is conventionally taken as nm so ultraviolet rays are not visible to humans although people can sometimes perceive light at shorter wavelengths than this Insects birds and some mammals can see near UV NUV i e slightly shorter wavelengths than what humans can see br br br Visibility br Ultraviolet rays are usually invisible to most humans The lens of the human eye blocks most radiation in the wavelength range of nm shorter wavelengths are blocked by the cornea Humans also lack color receptor adaptations for ultraviolet rays Nevertheless the photoreceptors of the retina are sensitive to near UV and people lacking a lens a condition known as aphakia perceive near UV as whitish blue or whitish violet Under some conditions children and young adults can see ultraviolet down to wavelengths around nm Near UV radiation is visible to insects some mammals and some birds Birds have a fourth color receptor for ultraviolet rays this coupled with eye structures that transmit more UV gives smaller birds true UV vision br br br History and discovery br Ultraviolet means beyond violet from Latin ultra beyond violet being the color of the highest frequencies of visible light Ultraviolet has a higher frequency thus a shorter wavelength than violet light br UV radiation was discovered in when the German physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter observed that invisible rays just beyond the violet end of the visible spectrum darkened silver chloride soaked paper more quickly than violet light itself He called them de oxidizing rays German de oxidierende Strahlen to emphasize chemical reactivity and to distinguish them from heat rays discovered the previous year at the other end of the visible spectrum The simpler term chemical rays was adopted soon afterwards and remained popular throughout the th century although some said that this radiation was entirely different from light notably John William Draper who named them tithonic rays The terms chemical rays and heat rays were eventually dropped in favor of ultraviolet and infrared radiation respectively In the sterilizing effect of short wavelength light by killing bacteria was discovered By the most effective wavelengths were known to be around nm In the effect of ultraviolet radiation on DNA was established br The discovery of the ultraviolet radiation with wavelengths below nm named vacuum ultraviolet because it is strongly absorbed by the oxygen in air was made in by German physicist Victor Schumann br br br Subtypes br The electromagnetic spectrum of ultraviolet radiation UVR defined most broadly as nanometers can be subdivided into a number of ranges recommended by the ISO standard ISO br br Several solid state and vacuum devices have been explored for use in different parts of the UV spectrum Many approaches seek to adapt visible light sensing devices but these can suffer from unwanted response to visible light and various instabilities Ultraviolet can be detected by suitable photodiodes and photocathodes which can be tailored to be sensitive to different parts of the UV spectrum Sensitive UV photomultipliers are available Spectrometers and radiometers are made for measurement of UV radiation Silicon detectors are used across the spectrum br Vacuum UV or VUV wavelengths shorter than nm are strongly absorbed by molecular oxygen in the air though the longer wavelengths around nm can propagate through nitrogen Scientific instruments can therefore use this spectral range by operating in an oxygen free atmosphere commonly pure nitrogen without the need for costly vacuum chambers Significant examples include nm photolithography equipment for semiconductor manufacturing and circular dichroism spectrometers br Technology for VUV instrumentation was largely driven by solar astronomy for many decades While optics can be used to remove unwanted visible light that contaminates the VUV in general detectors can be limited by their response to non VUV radiation and the development of solar blind devices has been an important area of research Wide gap solid state devices or vacuum devices with high cutoff photocathodes can be attractive compared to silicon diodes br Extreme UV EUV or sometimes XUV is characterized by a transition in the physics of interaction with matter Wavelengths longer than about nm interact mainly with the outer valence electrons of atoms while wavelengths shorter than that interact mainly with inner shell electrons and nuclei The long end of the EUV spectrum is set by a prominent He spectral line at nm EUV is strongly absorbed by most known materials but synthesizing multilayer optics that reflect up to about of EUV radiation at normal incidence is possible This technology was pioneered by the NIXT and MSSTA sounding rockets in the s and it has been used to make telescopes for solar imaging See also the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer satellite br Some sources use the distinction of hard UV and soft UV For instance in the case of astrophysics the boundary may be at the Lyman limit wavelength nm with hard UV being more energetic the same terms may also be used in other fields such as cosmetology optoelectronic etc The numerical values of the boundary between hard soft even within similar scientific fields do not necessarily coincide for example one applied physics publication used a boundary of nm between hard and soft UV regions br br br Solar ultraviolet br br Very hot objects emit UV radiation see black body radiation The Sun emits ultraviolet radiation at all wavelengths including the extreme ultraviolet where it crosses into X rays at nm Extremely hot stars such as O and B type emit proportionally more UV radiation than the Sun Sunlight in space at the top of Earth s atmosphere see solar constant is composed of about infrared light visible light and ultraviolet light for a total intensity of about W m in vacuum br The atmosphere blocks about of the Sun s UV when the Sun is highest in the sky at zenith with absorption increasing at shorter UV wavelengths At ground level with the sun at zenith sunlight is visible light ultraviolet and the remainder infrared Of the ultraviolet radiation that reaches the Earth s surface more than is the longer wavelengths of UVA with the small remainder UVB Almost no UVC reaches the Earth s surface The fraction of UVA and UVB which remains in UV radiation after passing through the atmosphere is heavily dependent on cloud cover and atmospheric conditions On partly cloudy days patches of blue sky showing between clouds are also sources of scattered UVA and UVB which are produced by Rayleigh scattering in the same way as the visible blue light from those parts of the sky UVB also plays a major role in plant development as it affects most of the plant hormones During total overcast the amount of absorption due to clouds is heavily dependent on the thickness of the clouds and latitude with no clear measurements correlating specific thickness and absorption of UVA and UVB br The shorter bands of UVC as well as even more energetic UV radiation produced by the Sun are absorbed by oxygen and generate the ozone in the ozone layer when single oxygen atoms produced by UV photolysis of dioxygen react with more dioxygen The ozone layer is especially important in blocking most UVB and the remaining part of UVC not already blocked by ordinary oxygen in air br br br Blockers absorbers and windows br Ultraviolet absorbers are molecules used in organic materials polymers paints etc to absorb UV radiation to reduce the UV degradation photo oxidation of a material The absorbers can themselves degrade over time so monitoring of absorber levels in weathered materials is necessary br In sunscreen ingredients that absorb UVA UVB rays such as avobenzone oxybenzone and octyl methoxycinnamate are organic chemical absorbers or blockers They are contrasted with inorganic absorbers blockers of UV radiation such as carbon black titanium dioxide and zinc oxide br For clothing the ultraviolet protection factor UPF represents the ratio of sunburn causing UV without and with the protection of the fabric similar to sun protection factor SPF ratings for sunscreen Standard summer fabrics have UPFs around which means that about of UV will pass through br Suspended nanoparticles in stained glass prevent UV rays from causing chemical reactions that change image colors A set of stained glass color reference chips is planned to be used to calibrate the color cameras for the ESA Mars rover mission since they will remain unfaded by the high level of UV present at the surface of Mars br Common soda lime glass such as window glass is partially transparent to UVA but is opaque to shorter wavelengths passing about of the light above nm but blocking over of the light below nm A study found that car windows allow of ambient UV to pass through especially if the UV was greater than nm Other types of car windows can reduce transmission of UV that is greater than nm Fused quartz depending on quality can be transparent even to vacuum UV wavelengths Crystalline quartz and some crystals such as CaF and MgF transmit well down to nm or nm wavelengths br Wood s glass is a deep violet blue barium sodium silicate glass with about nickel oxide developed during World War I to block visible light for covert communications It allows both infrared daylight and ultraviolet night time communications by being transparent between nm and nm and also the longer infrared and just barely visible red wavelengths Its maximum UV transmission is at nm one of the wavelengths of mercury lamps br br br Artificial sources br br br Black lights br br A black light lamp emits long wave UV A radiation and little visible light Fluorescent black light lamps work similarly to other fluorescent lamps but use a phosphor on the inner tube surface which emits UV A radiation instead of visible light Some lamps use a deep bluish purple Wood s glass optical filter that blocks almost all visible light with wavelengths longer than nanometers The purple glow given off by these tubes is not the ultraviolet itself but visible purple light from mercury s nm spectral line which escapes being filtered out by the coating Other black lights use plain glass instead of the more expensive Wood s glass so they appear light blue to the eye when operating br Incandescent black lights are also produced using a filter coating on the envelope of an incandescent bulb that absorbs visible light see section below These are cheaper but very inefficient emitting only a small fraction of a percent of their power as UV Mercury vapor black lights in ratings up to kW with UV emitting phosphor and an envelope of Wood s glass are used for theatrical and concert displays br Black lights are used in applications in which extraneous visible light must be minimized mainly to observe fluorescence the colored glow that many substances give off when exposed to UV light UV A UV B emitting bulbs are also sold for other special purposes such as tanning lamps and reptile husbandry br br br Short wave ultraviolet lamps br br Shortwave UV lamps are made using a fluorescent lamp tube with no phosphor coating composed of fused quartz or vycor since ordinary glass absorbs UV C These lamps emit ultraviolet light with two peaks in the UV C band at nm and nm due to the mercury within the lamp as well as some visible light From to of the UV produced by these lamps is at nm whereas only is at nm The fused quartz tube passes the nm radiation but blocks the nm wavelength Such tubes have two or three times the UV C power of a regular fluorescent lamp tube These low pressure lamps have a typical efficiency of approximately meaning that for every watts of electricity consumed by the lamp they will produce approximately watts of total UV output They also emit bluish white visible light due to mercury s other spectral lines These germicidal lamps are used extensively for disinfection of surfaces in laboratories and food processing industries and for disinfecting water supplies br br br Incandescent lamps br Black light incandescent lamps are also made from an incandescent light bulb with a filter coating which absorbs most visible light Halogen lamps with fused quartz envelopes are used as inexpensive UV light sources in the near UV range from to nm in some scientific instruments Due to its black body spectrum a filament light bulb is a very inefficient ultraviolet source emitting only a fraction of a percent of its energy as UV br br br Gas discharge lamps br br Specialized UV gas discharge lamps containing different gases produce UV radiation at particular spectral lines for scientific purposes Argon and deuterium arc lamps are often used as stable sources either windowless or with various windows such as magnesium fluoride These are often the emitting sources in UV spectroscopy equipment for chemical analysis br Other UV sources with more continuous emission spectra include xenon arc lamps commonly used as sunlight simulators deuterium arc lamps mercury xenon arc lamps and metal halide arc lamps br The excimer lamp a UV source developed in the early s is seeing increasing use in scientific fields It has the advantages of high intensity high efficiency and operation at a variety of wavelength bands into the vacuum ultraviolet br br br Ultraviolet LEDs br br Light emitting diodes LEDs can be manufactured to emit radiation in the ultraviolet range In following significant advances over the preceding five years UV A LEDs of nm and longer wavelength were available with efficiencies of at W output Currently the most common types of UV LEDs are in nm and nm wavelengths both of which are in the UV A spectrum The rated wavelength is the peak wavelength that the LEDs put out but light at both higher and lower wavelengths are present br The cheaper and more common nm UV LEDs are much closer to the visible spectrum and give off a purple color Other UV LEDs deeper into the spectrum do not emit as much visible light LEDs are used for applications such as UV curing applications charging glow in the dark objects such as paintings or toys and lights for detecting counterfeit money and bodily fluids UV LEDs are also used in digital print applications and inert UV curing environments Power densities approaching W cm kW m are now possible and this coupled with recent developments by photo initiator and resin formulators makes the expansion of LED cured UV materials likely br UV C LEDs are developing rapidly but may require testing to verify effective disinfection Citations for large area disinfection are for non LED UV sources known as germicidal lamps Also they are used as line sources to replace deuterium lamps in liquid chromatography instruments br br br Ultraviolet lasers br br Gas lasers laser diodes and solid state lasers can be manufactured to emit ultraviolet rays and lasers are available that cover the entire UV range The nitrogen gas laser uses electronic excitation of nitrogen molecules to emit a beam that is mostly UV The strongest ultraviolet lines are at nm and nm in wavelength Another type of high power gas lasers are excimer lasers They are widely used lasers emitting in ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet wavelength ranges Presently UV argon fluoride excimer lasers operating at nm are routinely used in integrated circuit production by photolithography The current wavelength limit of production of coherent UV is about nm characteristic of the Ar excimer laser br Direct UV emitting laser diodes are available at nm UV diode pumped solid state lasers have been demonstrated using cerium doped lithium strontium aluminum fluoride crystals Ce LiSAF a process developed in the s at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Wavelengths shorter than nm are commercially generated in diode pumped solid state lasers Ultraviolet lasers can also be made by applying frequency conversion to lower frequency lasers br Ultraviolet lasers have applications in industry laser engraving medicine dermatology and keratectomy chemistry MALDI free air secure communications computing optical storage and manufacture of integrated circuits br br br Tunable vacuum ultraviolet VUV br The vacuum ultraviolet V UV band nm can be generated by non linear wave mixing in gases by sum or difference frequency mixing of or more longer wavelength lasers The generation is generally done in gasses e g krypton hydrogen which are two photon resonant near nm or metal vapors e g magnesium By making one of the lasers tunable the V UV can be tuned If one of the lasers is resonant with a transition in the gas or vapor then the V UV production is intensified However resonances also generate wavelength dispersion and thus the phase matching can limit the tunable range of the wave mixing Difference frequency mixing i e f f f has an advantage over sum frequency mixing because the phase matching can provide greater tuning br In particular difference frequency mixing two photons of an ArF nm excimer laser with a tunable visible or near IR laser in hydrogen or krypton provides resonantly enhanced tunable V UV covering from nm to nm Practically the lack of suitable gas vapor cell window materials above the lithium fluoride cut off wavelength limit the tuning range to longer than about nm Tunable V UV wavelengths down to nm was achieved using window free configurations br br br Plasma and synchrotron sources of extreme UV br Lasers have been used to indirectly generate non coherent extreme UV E UV radiation at nm for extreme ultraviolet lithography The E UV is not emitted by the laser but rather by electron transitions in an extremely hot tin or xenon plasma which is excited by an excimer laser This technique does not require a synchrotron yet can produce UV at the edge of the X ray spectrum Synchrotron light sources can also produce all wavelengths of UV including those at the boundary of the UV and X ray spectra at nm br br br Human health related effects br br The impact of ultraviolet radiation on human health has implications for the risks and benefits of sun exposure and is also implicated in issues such as fluorescent lamps and health Getting too much sun exposure can be harmful but in moderation sun exposure is beneficial br br br Beneficial effects br UV light specifically UV B causes the body to produce vitamin D which is essential for life Humans need some UV radiation to maintain adequate vitamin D levels According to the World Health Organization br br There is no doubt that a little sunlight is good for you But minutes of casual sun exposure of hands face and arms two to three times a week during the summer months is sufficient to keep your vitamin D levels high br Vitamin D can also be obtained from food and supplementation Excess sun exposure produces harmful effects however br Vitamin D promotes the creation of serotonin The production of serotonin is in direct proportion to the degree of bright sunlight the body receives Serotonin is thought to provide sensations of happiness well being and serenity to human beings br br br Skin conditions br UV rays also treat certain skin conditions Modern phototherapy has been used to successfully treat psoriasis eczema jaundice vitiligo atopic dermatitis and localized scleroderma In addition UV light in particular UV B radiation has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest in keratinocytes the most common type of skin cell As such sunlight therapy can be a candidate for treatment of conditions such as psoriasis and exfoliative cheilitis conditions in which skin cells divide more rapidly than usual or necessary br br br Harmful effects br br In humans excessive exposure to UV radiation can result in acute and chronic harmful effects on the eye s dioptric system and retina The risk is elevated at high altitudes and people living in high latitude areas where snow covers the ground right into early summer and sun positions even at zenith are low are particularly at risk Skin the circadian system and the immune system can also be affected br The differential effects of various wavelengths of light on the human cornea and skin are sometimes called the erythemal action spectrum The action spectrum shows that UVA does not cause immediate reaction but rather UV begins to cause photokeratitis and skin redness with lighter skinned individuals being more sensitive at wavelengths starting near the beginning of the UVB band at nm and rapidly increasing to nm The skin and eyes are most sensitive to damage by UV at nm which is in the lower UV C band At still shorter wavelengths of UV damage continues to happen but the overt effects are not as great with so little penetrating the atmosphere The WHO standard ultraviolet index is a widely publicized measurement of total strength of UV wavelengths that cause sunburn on human skin by weighting UV exposure for action spectrum effects at a given time and location This standard shows that most sunburn happens due to UV at wavelengths near the boundary of the UV A and UV B bands br br br Skin damage br br Overexposure to UV B radiation not only can cause sunburn but also some forms of skin cancer However the degree of redness and eye irritation which are largely not caused by UV A do not predict the long term effects of UV although they do mirror the direct damage of DNA by ultraviolet br All bands of UV radiation damage collagen fibers and accelerate aging of the skin Both UV A and UV B destroy vitamin A in skin which may cause further damage br UVB radiation can cause direct DNA damage This cancer connection is one reason for concern about ozone depletion and the ozone hole br The most deadly form of skin cancer malignant melanoma is mostly caused by DNA damage independent from UV A radiation This can be seen from the absence of a direct UV signature mutation in of all melanoma Occasional overexposure and sunburn are probably greater risk factors for melanoma than long term moderate exposure UV C is the highest energy most dangerous type of ultraviolet radiation and causes adverse effects that can variously be mutagenic or carcinogenic br In the past UV A was considered not harmful or less harmful than UV B but today it is known to contribute to skin cancer via indirect DNA damage free radicals such as reactive oxygen species UV A can generate highly reactive chemical intermediates such as hydroxyl and oxygen radicals which in turn can damage DNA The DNA damage caused indirectly to skin by UV A consists mostly of single strand breaks in DNA while the damage caused by UV B includes direct formation of thymine dimers or cytosine dimers and double strand DNA breakage UV A is immunosuppressive for the entire body accounting for a large part of the immunosuppressive effects of sunlight exposure and is mutagenic for basal cell keratinocytes in skin br UVB photons can cause direct DNA damage UV B radiation excites DNA molecules in skin cells causing aberrant covalent bonds to form between adjacent pyrimidine bases producing a dimer Most UV induced pyrimidine dimers in DNA are removed by the process known as nucleotide excision repair that employs about different proteins Those pyrimidine dimers that escape this repair process can induce a form of programmed cell death apoptosis or can cause DNA replication errors leading to mutation br As a defense against UV radiation the amount of the brown pigment melanin in the skin increases when exposed to moderate depending on skin type levels of radiation this is commonly known as a sun tan The purpose of melanin is to absorb UV radiation and dissipate the energy as harmless heat protecting the skin against both direct and indirect DNA damage from the UV UV A gives a quick tan that lasts for days by oxidizing melanin that was already present and triggers the release of the melanin from melanocytes UV B yields a tan that takes roughly days to develop because it stimulates the body to produce more melanin br br br Sunscreen safety debate br br Medical organizations recommend that patients protect themselves from UV radiation by using sunscreen Five sunscreen ingredients have been shown to protect mice against skin tumors However some sunscreen chemicals produce potentially harmful substances if they are illuminated while in contact with living cells The amount of sunscreen that penetrates into the lower layers of the skin may be large enough to cause damage br Sunscreen reduces the direct DNA damage that causes sunburn by blocking UV B and the usual SPF rating indicates how effectively this radiation is blocked SPF is therefore also called UVB PF for UV B protection factor This rating however offers no data about important protection against UVA which does not primarily cause sunburn but is still harmful since it causes indirect DNA damage and is also considered carcinogenic Several studies suggest that the absence of UV A filters may be the cause of the higher incidence of melanoma found in sunscreen users compared to non users Some sunscreen lotions contain titanium dioxide zinc oxide and avobenzone which help protect against UV A rays br The photochemical properties of melanin make it an excellent photoprotectant However sunscreen chemicals cannot dissipate the energy of the excited state as efficiently as melanin and therefore if sunscreen ingredients penetrate into the lower layers of the skin the amount of reactive oxygen species may be increased The amount of sunscreen that penetrates through the stratum corneum may or may not be large enough to cause damage br In an experiment by Hanson et al that was published in the amount of harmful reactive oxygen species ROS was measured in untreated and in sunscreen treated skin In the first minutes the film of sunscreen had a protective effect and the number of ROS species was smaller After minutes however the amount of absorbed sunscreen was so high that the amount of ROS was higher in the sunscreen treated skin than in the untreated skin The study indicates that sunscreen must be reapplied within hours in order to prevent UV light from penetrating to sunscreen infused live skin cells br br br Aggravation of certain skin conditions br Ultraviolet radiation can aggravate several skin conditions and diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus Sj gren s syndrome Sinear Usher syndrome rosacea dermatomyositis Darier s disease Kindler Weary syndrome and Porokeratosis br br br Eye damage br br The eye is most sensitive to damage by UV in the lower UV C band at nm Radiation of this wavelength is almost absent from sunlight at the surface of the Earth but is emitted by artificial sources such as the electrical arcs employed in arc welding Unprotected exposure to these sources can cause welder s flash or arc eye photokeratitis and can lead to cataracts pterygium and pinguecula formation To a lesser extent UV B in sunlight from to nm also causes photokeratitis snow blindness and the cornea the lens and the retina can be damaged br Protective eyewear is beneficial to those exposed to ultraviolet radiation Since light can reach the eyes from the sides full coverage eye protection is usually warranted if there is an increased risk of exposure as in high altitude mountaineering Mountaineers are exposed to higher than ordinary levels of UV radiation both because there is less atmospheric filtering and because of reflection from snow and ice br Ordinary untreated eyeglasses give some protection Most plastic lenses give more protection than glass lenses because as noted above glass is transparent to UV A and the common acrylic plastic used for lenses is less so Some plastic lens materials such as polycarbonate inherently block most UV br br br Degradation of polymers pigments and dyes br br UV degradation is one form of polymer degradation that affects plastics exposed to sunlight The problem appears as discoloration or fading cracking loss of strength or disintegration The effects of attack increase with exposure time and sunlight intensity The addition of UV absorbers inhibits the effect br br Sensitive polymers include thermoplastics and speciality fibers like aramids UV absorption leads to chain degradation and loss of strength at sensitive points in the chain structure Aramid rope must be shielded with a sheath of thermoplastic if it is to retain its strength br Many pigments and dyes absorb UV and change colour so paintings and textiles may need extra protection both from sunlight and fluorescent lamps two common sources of UV radiation Window glass absorbs some harmful UV but valuable artifacts need extra shielding Many museums place black curtains over watercolour paintings and ancient textiles for example Since watercolours can have very low pigment levels they need extra protection from UV Various forms of picture framing glass including acrylics plexiglass laminates and coatings offer different degrees of UV and visible light protection br br br Applications br Because of its ability to cause chemical reactions and excite fluorescence in materials ultraviolet radiation has a number of applications The following table gives some uses of specific wavelength bands in the UV spectrum br br nm Extreme ultraviolet lithography br nm Photoionization ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy standard integrated circuit manufacture by photolithography br nm UV ID label tracking barcodes br nm Optical sensors various instrumentation br nm Disinfection decontamination of surfaces and water DNA absorption has a peak at nm germicidal lamps br nm Forensic analysis drug detection br nm Protein analysis DNA sequencing drug discovery br nm Medical imaging of cells br nm Light therapy in medicine br nm Curing of polymers and printer inks br nm Bug zappers flies are most attracted to light at nm br br br Photography br br Photographic film responds to ultraviolet radiation but the glass lenses of cameras usually block radiation shorter than nm Slightly yellow UV blocking filters are often used for outdoor photography to prevent unwanted bluing and overexposure by UV rays For photography in the near UV special filters may be used Photography with wavelengths shorter than nm requires special quartz lenses which do not absorb the radiation br Digital cameras sensors may have internal filters that block UV to improve color rendition accuracy Sometimes these internal filters can be removed or they may be absent and an external visible light filter prepares the camera for near UV photography A few cameras are designed for use in the UV br Photography by reflected ultraviolet radiation is useful for medical scientific and forensic investigations in applications as widespread as detecting bruising of skin alterations of documents or restoration work on paintings Photography of the fluorescence produced by ultraviolet illumination uses visible wavelengths of light br br In ultraviolet astronomy measurements are used to discern the chemical composition of the interstellar medium and the temperature and composition of stars Because the ozone layer blocks many UV frequencies from reaching telescopes on the surface of the Earth most UV observations are made from space br br br Electrical and electronics industry br Corona discharge on electrical apparatus can be detected by its ultraviolet emissions Corona causes degradation of electrical insulation and emission of ozone and nitrogen oxide br EPROMs Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory are erased by exposure to UV radiation These modules have a transparent quartz window on the top of the chip that allows the UV radiation in br br br Fluorescent dye uses br Colorless fluorescent dyes that emit blue light under UV are added as optical brighteners to paper and fabrics The blue light emitted by these agents counteracts yellow tints that may be present and causes the colors and whites to appear whiter or more brightly colored br UV fluorescent dyes that glow in the primary colors are used in paints papers and textiles either to enhance color under daylight illumination or to provide special effects when lit with UV lamps Blacklight paints that contain dyes that glow under UV are used in a number of art and aesthetic applications br Amusement parks often use UV lighting to fluoresce ride artwork and backdrops This often has the side effect of causing rider s white clothing to glow light purple br br To help prevent counterfeiting of currency or forgery of important documents such as driver s licenses and passports the paper may include a UV watermark or fluorescent multicolor fibers that are visible under ultraviolet light Postage stamps are tagged with a phosphor that glows under UV rays to permit automatic detection of the stamp and facing of the letter br UV fluorescent dyes are used in many applications for example biochemistry and forensics Some brands of pepper spray will leave an invisible chemical UV dye that is not easily washed off on a pepper sprayed attacker which would help police identify the attacker later br In some types of nondestructive testing UV stimulates fluorescent dyes to highlight defects in a broad range of materials These dyes may be carried into surface breaking defects by capillary action liquid penetrant inspection or they may be bound to ferrite particles caught in magnetic leakage fields in ferrous materials magnetic particle inspection br br br Analytic uses br br br Forensics br UV is an investigative tool at the crime scene helpful in locating and identifying bodily fluids such as semen blood and saliva For example ejaculated fluids or saliva can be detected by high power UV sources irrespective of the structure or colour of the surface the fluid is deposited upon UV vis microspectroscopy is also used to analyze trace evidence such as textile fibers and paint chips as well as questioned documents br Other applications include the authentication of various collectibles and art and detecting counterfeit currency Even materials not specially marked with UV sensitive dyes may have distinctive fluorescence under UV exposure or may fluoresce differently under short wave versus long wave ultraviolet br br br Enhancing contrast of ink br Using multi spectral imaging it is possible to read illegible papyrus such as the burned papyri of the Villa of the Papyri or of Oxyrhynchus or the Archimedes palimpsest The technique involves taking pictures of the illegible document using different filters in the infrared or ultraviolet range finely tuned to capture certain wavelengths of light Thus the optimum spectral portion can be found for distinguishing ink from paper on the papyrus surface br Simple NUV sources can be used to highlight faded iron based ink on vellum br br br Sanitary compliance br br Ultraviolet helps detect organic material deposits that remain on surfaces where periodic cleaning and sanitizing may have failed It is used in the hotel industry manufacturing and other industries where levels of cleanliness or contamination are inspected br Perennial news features for many television news organizations involve an investigative reporter using a similar device to reveal unsanitary conditions in hotels public toilets hand rails and such br br br Chemistry br UV Vis spectroscopy is widely used as a technique in chemistry to analyze chemical structure the most notable one being conjugated systems UV radiation is often used to excite a given sample where the fluorescent emission is measured with a spectrofluorometer In biological research UV radiation is used for quantification of nucleic acids or proteins In environmental chemistry UV radiation could also be used to detect Contaminants of emerging concern in water samples br In pollution control applications ultraviolet analyzers are used to detect emissions of nitrogen oxides sulfur compounds mercury and ammonia for example in the flue gas of fossil fired power plants Ultraviolet radiation can detect thin sheens of spilled oil on water either by the high reflectivity of oil films at UV wavelengths fluorescence of compounds in oil or by absorbing of UV created by Raman scattering in water UV absorbance can also be uesd to quantify contaminants in wastewater Most commonly used nm UV absorbance is genrally used as a surrogate parameters to quantify NOM Another form of light based detection method uses a wide spectrum of excitation emission matrix EEM to detect and identify contaminants based on their flourense properties EEM could be used to discriminate different groups of NOM based on the difference in light emission and excitation of fluorophores NOMs with certain molecular structures are reported to have fluorescent properties in a wide range of excitation emission wavelengths br br Ultraviolet lamps are also used as part of the analysis of some minerals and gems br br br Material science uses br br br Fire detection br br In general ultraviolet detectors use either a solid state device such as one based on silicon carbide or aluminium nitride or a gas filled tube as the sensing element UV detectors that are sensitive to UV in any part of the spectrum respond to irradiation by sunlight and artificial light A burning hydrogen flame for instance radiates strongly in the to nanometer range and only very weakly in the IR region whereas a coal fire emits very weakly in the UV band yet very strongly at IR wavelengths thus a fire detector that operates using both UV and IR detectors is more reliable than one with a UV detector alone Virtually all fires emit some radiation in the UVC band whereas the Sun s radiation at this band is absorbed by the Earth s atmosphere The result is that the UV detector is solar blind meaning it will not cause an alarm in response to radiation from the Sun so it can easily be used both indoors and outdoors br UV detectors are sensitive to most fires including hydrocarbons metals sulfur hydrogen hydrazine and ammonia Arc welding electrical arcs lightning X rays used in nondestructive metal testing equipment though this is highly unlikely and radioactive materials can produce levels that will activate a UV detection system The presence of UV absorbing gases and vapors will attenuate the UV radiation from a fire adversely affecting the ability of the detector to detect flames Likewise the presence of an oil mist in the air or an oil film on the detector window will have the same effect br br br Photolithography br Ultraviolet radiation is used for very fine resolution photolithography a procedure wherein a chemical called a photoresist is exposed to UV radiation that has passed through a mask The exposure causes chemical reactions to occur in the photoresist After removal of unwanted photoresist a pattern determined by the mask remains on the sample Steps may then be taken to etch away deposit on or otherwise modify areas of the sample where no photoresist remains br Photolithography is used in the manufacture of semiconductors integrated circuit components and printed circuit boards Photolithography processes used to fabricate electronic integrated circuits presently use nm UV and are experimentally using nm UV for extreme ultraviolet lithography br br br Polymers br Electronic components that require clear transparency for light to exit or enter photovoltaic panels and sensors can be potted using acrylic resins that are cured using UV energy The advantages are low VOC emissions and rapid curing br br Certain inks coatings and adhesives are formulated with photoinitiators and resins When exposed to UV light polymerization occurs and so the adhesives harden or cure usually within a few seconds Applications include glass and plastic bonding optical fiber coatings the coating of flooring UV coating and paper finishes in offset printing dental fillings and decorative fingernail gels br UV sources for UV curing applications include UV lamps UV LEDs and excimer flash lamps Fast processes such as flexo or offset printing require high intensity light focused via reflectors onto a moving substrate and medium so high pressure Hg mercury or Fe iron doped based bulbs are used energized with electric arcs or microwaves Lower power fluorescent lamps and LEDs can be used for static applications Small high pressure lamps can have light focused and transmitted to the work area via liquid filled or fiber optic light guides br The impact of UV on polymers is used for modification of the roughness and hydrophobicity of polymer surfaces For example a poly methyl methacrylate surface can be smoothed by vacuum ultraviolet br UV radiation is useful in preparing low surface energy polymers for adhesives Polymers exposed to UV will oxidize thus raising the surface energy of the polymer Once the surface energy of the polymer has been raised the bond between the adhesive and the polymer is stronger br br br Biology related uses br br br Air purification br Using a catalytic chemical reaction from titanium dioxide and UVC exposure oxidation of organic matter converts pathogens pollens and mold spores into harmless inert byproducts However the reaction of titanium dioxide and UVC is not a straight path Several hundreds of reactions occur prior to the inert byproducts stage and can hinder the resulting reaction creating formaldehyde aldehyde and other VOC s en route to a final stage Thus the use of titanium dioxide and UVC requires very specific parameters for a successful outcome The cleansing mechanism of UV is a photochemical process Contaminants in the indoor environment are almost entirely organic carbon based compounds which break down when exposed to high intensity UV at to nm Short wave ultraviolet radiation can destroy DNA in living microorganisms UVC s effectiveness is directly related to intensity and exposure time br UV has also been shown to reduce gaseous contaminants such as carbon monoxide and VOCs UV lamps radiating at and nm can remove low concentrations of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide if the air is recycled between the room and the lamp chamber This arrangement prevents the introduction of ozone into the treated air Likewise air may be treated by passing by a single UV source operating at nm and passed over iron pentaoxide to remove the ozone produced by the UV lamp br br br Sterilization and disinfection br br Ultraviolet lamps are used to sterilize workspaces and tools used in biology laboratories and medical facilities Commercially available low pressure mercury vapor lamps emit about of their radiation at nanometers nm with nm being the peak germicidal effectiveness curve UV at these germicidal wavelengths damage a microorganism s DNA RNA so that it cannot reproduce making it harmless even though the organism may not be killed Since microorganisms can be shielded from ultraviolet rays in small cracks and other shaded areas these lamps are used only as a supplement to other sterilization techniques br UV C LEDs are relatively new to the commercial market and are gaining in popularity Due to their monochromatic nature nm these LEDs can target a specific wavelength needed for disinfection This is especially important knowing that pathogens vary in their sensitivity to specific UV wavelengths LEDs are mercury free instant on off and have unlimited cycling throughout the day br Disinfection using UV radiation is commonly used in wastewater treatment applications and is finding an increased usage in municipal drinking water treatment Many bottlers of spring water use UV disinfection equipment to sterilize their water Solar water disinfection has been researched for cheaply treating contaminated water using natural sunlight The UV A irradiation and increased water temperature kill organisms in the water br Ultraviolet radiation is used in several food processes to kill unwanted microorganisms UV can be used to pasteurize fruit juices by flowing the juice over a high intensity ultraviolet source The effectiveness of such a process depends on the UV absorbance of the juice br Pulsed light PL is a technique of killing microorganisms on surfaces using pulses of an intense broad spectrum rich in UV C between and nm Pulsed light works with xenon flash lamps that can produce flashes several times per second Disinfection robots use pulsed UV br The antimicrobial effectiveness of filtered far UVC nm light on a range of pathogens including bacteria and fungi showed inhibition of pathogen growth and since it has lesser harmful effects it provides essential insights for reliable disinfection in healthcare settings such as hospitals and long term care homes UVC has also been shown to be effective at degrading SARS CoV virus br br br Biological br Some animals including birds reptiles and insects such as bees can see near ultraviolet wavelengths Many fruits flowers and seeds stand out more strongly from the background in ultraviolet wavelengths as compared to human color vision Scorpions glow or take on a yellow to green color under UV illumination thus assisting in the control of these arachnids Many birds have patterns in their plumage that are invisible at usual wavelengths but observable in ultraviolet and the urine and other secretions of some animals including dogs cats and human beings are much easier to spot with ultraviolet Urine trails of rodents can be detected by pest control technicians for proper treatment of infested dwellings br Butterflies use ultraviolet as a communication system for sex recognition and mating behavior For example in the Colias eurytheme butterfly males rely on visual cues to locate and identify females Instead of using chemical stimuli to find mates males are attracted to the ultraviolet reflecting color of female hind wings In Pieris napi butterflies it was shown that females in northern Finland with less UV radiation present in the environment possessed stronger UV signals to attract their males than those occurring further south This suggested that it was evolutionarily more difficult to increase the UV sensitivity of the eyes of the males than to increase the UV signals emitted by the females br Many insects use the ultraviolet wavelength emissions from celestial objects as references for flight navigation A local ultraviolet emitter will normally disrupt the navigation process and will eventually attract the flying insect br br The green fluorescent protein GFP is often used in genetics as a marker Many substances such as proteins have significant light absorption bands in the ultraviolet that are of interest in biochemistry and related fields UV capable spectrophotometers are common in such laboratories br Ultraviolet traps called bug zappers are used to eliminate various small flying insects They are attracted to the UV and are killed using an electric shock or trapped once they come into contact with the device Different designs of ultraviolet radiation traps are also used by entomologists for collecting nocturnal insects during faunistic survey studies br br br Therapy br br Ultraviolet radiation is helpful in the treatment of skin conditions such as psoriasis and vitiligo Exposure to UVA while the skin is hyper photosensitive by taking psoralens is an effective treatment for psoriasis Due to the potential of psoralens to cause damage to the liver PUVA therapy may be used only a limited number of times over a patient s lifetime br UVB phototherapy does not require additional medications or topical preparations for the therapeutic benefit only the exposure is needed However phototherapy can be effective when used in conjunction with certain topical treatments such as anthralin coal tar and vitamin A and D derivatives or systemic treatments such as methotrexate and Soriatane br br br Herpetology br Reptiles need UVB for biosynthesis of vitamin D and other metabolic processes Specifically cholecalciferol vitamin D which is needed for basic cellular neural functioning as well as the utilization of calcium for bone and egg production The UVA wavelength is also visible to many reptiles and might play a significant role in their ability survive in the wild as well as in visual communication between individuals Therefore in a typical reptile enclosure a fluorescent UV a b source at the proper strength spectrum for the species must be available for many captive species to survive Simple supplementation with cholecalciferol Vitamin D will not be enough as there s a complete biosynthetic pathway that is leapfrogged risks of possible overdoses the intermediate molecules and metabolites also play important functions in the animals health Natural sunlight in the right levels is always going to be superior to artificial sources but this might not be possible for keepers in different parts of the world br It is a known problem that high levels of output of the UVa part of the spectrum can both cause cellular and DNA damage to sensitive parts of their bodies especially the eyes where blindness is the result of an improper UVa b source use and placement photokeratitis For many keepers there must also be a provision for an adequate heat source this has resulted in the marketing of heat and light combination products Keepers should be careful of these combination light heat and UVa b generators they typically emit high levels of UVa with lower levels of UVb that are set and difficult to control so that animals can have their needs met A better strategy is to use individual sources of these elements and so they can be placed and controlled by the keepers for the max benefit of the animals br br br Evolutionary significance br The evolution of early reproductive proteins and enzymes is attributed in modern models of evolutionary theory to ultraviolet radiation UVB causes thymine base pairs next to each other in genetic sequences to bond together into thymine dimers a disruption in the strand that reproductive enzymes cannot copy This leads to frameshifting during genetic replication and protein synthesis usually killing the cell Before formation of the UV blocking ozone layer when early prokaryotes approached the surface of the ocean they almost invariably died out The few that survived had developed enzymes that monitored the genetic material and removed thymine dimers by nucleotide excision repair enzymes Many enzymes and proteins involved in modern mitosis and meiosis are similar to repair enzymes and are believed to be evolved modifications of the enzymes originally used to overcome DNA damages caused by UV br br br Photobiology br br Photobiology is the scientific study of the beneficial and harmful interactions of non ionizing radiation in living organisms conventionally demarcated around eV the first ionization energy of oxygen UV ranges roughly from to eV in energy Hence photobiology
