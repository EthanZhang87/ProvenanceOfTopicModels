title: High dynamic range
id: 4688909
High dynamic range HDR also known as wide dynamic range extended dynamic range or expanded dynamic range is a signal with a higher dynamic range than usual br The term is often used in discussing the dynamic ranges of images videos audio or radio It may also apply to the means of recording processing and reproducing such signals including analog and digitized signals br br br Imaging br In this context the term high dynamic range means there is a large amount of variation in light levels within a scene or an image The dynamic range refers to the range of luminosity between the brightest area and the darkest area of that scene or image br High dynamic range imaging HDRI refers to the set of imaging technologies and techniques that allow the dynamic range of images or videos to be increased It covers the acquisition creation storage distribution and display of images and videos br Modern movies have often been filmed with cameras featuring a higher dynamic range and legacy movies can be converted even if manual intervention will be needed for some frames as when black and white films are converted to color Also special effects especially those that mix real and synthetic footage require both HDR shooting and rendering HDR video is also needed in applications that demand high accuracy for capturing temporal aspects of changes in the scene This is important in monitoring of some industrial processes such as welding in predictive driver assistance systems in automotive industry in surveillance video systems and other applications br br br Capture br br In photography and videography a technique commonly named high dynamic range HDR allows the dynamic range of photos and videos to be captured beyond the native capability of the camera It consists of capturing multiple frames of the same scene but with different exposures and then combining them into one resulting into an image with a dynamic range higher than the individually captured frames br Some of the sensors on modern phones and cameras may even combine the two images on chip This also allows a wider dynamic range being directly available to the user for display or processing without in pixel compression br Some cameras designed for use in security applications can capture HDR videos by automatically providing two or more images for each frame with changing exposure For example a sensor for fps video will give out fps with the odd frames at a short exposure time and the even frames at a longer exposure time br Modern CMOS image sensors can often capture a high dynamic range images from a single exposure This reduces the need to use the multi exposure HDR capture technique br High dynamic range images are used in extreme dynamic range applications like welding or automotive work In security cameras the term used instead of HDR is wide dynamic range br Because of the nonlinearity of some sensors image artifacts can be common br br br Rendering br br High dynamic range rendering HDRR is the real time rendering and display of virtual environments using a dynamic range of or higher used in computer gaming and entertainment technology br br br Dynamic range compression or expansion br br The technologies used to store transmit display and print images have limited dynamic range When captured or created images have a higher dynamic range they must be tone mapped in order to reduce that dynamic range br br br Storage br High dynamic range formats for image and video files are able to store more dynamic range than traditional bit gamma formats These formats include br br Formats that are only used for storage purpose such as br Raw image formats br Formats that use a linear transfer function with high bit depth br Formats that use a logarithmic transfer function br OpenEXR br ACES br HDR formats that can be used for both storage and transmission to displays such as br HDR br HDR br Dolby Vision br HLG br Gain map approaches which adds a conversion layer on top of SDR data The result is backwards compatible br ISO AWI Gain map a unification of evolved from Apple and Adobe s proposals br Apple EDR used in macOS and iOS gain channel br Adobe Gain Map a gain map image in a JPEG image file and backwards compatible with SDR displays used by Android under the name Ultra HDR Supports gain on or channels br OpenEXR was created in by Industrial Light Magic ILM and released in as an open source software library OpenEXR is used for film and television production br Academy Color Encoding System ACES was created by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and released in December ACES is a complete color and file management system that works with almost any professional workflow and it supports both HDR and wide color gamut br br br Transmission to displays br br High dynamic range HDR is also the common name of a technology allowing to transmit high dynamic range videos and images to compatible displays That technology also improves other aspects of transmitted images such as color gamut br In this context br br HDR displays refers to displays compatible with that technology br HDR formats refers to formats such as HDR HDR Dolby Vision and HLG br HDR video refers to a video encoded in an HDR format Thoses HDR video have a greater bit depth luminance and color volume than standard dynamic range SDR video which uses a conventional gamma curve br On January the Ultra HD Alliance announced their certification requirements for an HDR display The HDR display must have either a peak brightness of over cd m and a black level less than cd m a contrast ratio of at least or a peak brightness of over cd m and a black level less than cd m a contrast ratio of at least The two options allow for different types of HDR displays such as LCD and OLED br Some options to use HDR transfer functions that better match the human visual system other than a conventional gamma curve include the HLG and perceptual quantizer PQ HLG and PQ require a bit depth of bits per sample br br br Display br br The dynamic range of a display refers to range of luminosity the display can reproduce from the black level to its peak brightness The contrast of a display refers to the ratio between the luminance of the brightest white and the darkest black that a monitor can produce Multiple technologies allowed to increase the dynamic range of displays br In May BrightSide Technologies demonstrated the first HDR display at the Display Week Symposium of the Society for Information Display The display used an array of individually controlled LEDs behind a conventional LCD panel in a configuration known as local dimming BrightSide later introduced a variety of related display and video technologies enabling visualization of HDR content In April BrightSide Technologies was acquired by Dolby Laboratories br OLED displays have high contrast MiniLED improves contrast br br br Realtime HDR vision br br In the s and s Steve Mann invented the Generation and Generation Digital Eye Glass as a vision aid to help people see better with some versions being built into welding helmets for HDR vision br br br Non imaging br br br Audio br In Audio the term high dynamic range means there is a lot of variation in the levels of the sound Here the dynamic range refers to the range between the highest volume and lowest volume of the sound br XDR audio is used to provide higher quality audio when using microphone sound systems or recording onto cassette tapes br HDR Audio is a dynamic mixing technique used in EA Digital Illusions CE Frostbite Engine to allow relatively louder sounds to drown out softer sounds br Dynamic range compression is a set of techniques used in audio recording and communication to put high dynamic range material through channels or media of lower dynamic range Optionally dynamic range expansion is used to restore the original high dynamic range on playback br br br Radio br In radio high dynamic range is important especially when there are potentially interfering signals Measures such as spurious free dynamic range are used to quantify the dynamic range of various system components such as frequency synthesizers HDR concepts are important in both conventional and software defined radio design br br br Instrumentation br In many fields instruments need to have a very high dynamic range For example in seismology HDR accelerometers are needed as in the ICEARRAY instruments br br br See also br Rec ITU R Recommendation for HDR br Ultra HD Forum Organization that has created standards for HDR br
