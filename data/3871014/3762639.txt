Ice pellets Canadian English or sleet American English is a form of precipitation consisting of small hard translucent balls of ice Ice pellets are different from graupel soft hail which is made of frosty white opaque rime and from a mixture of rain and snow which is a slushy liquid or semisolid Ice pellets often bounce when they hit the ground or other solid objects and make a higher pitched tap when striking objects like jackets windshields and dried leaves compared to the dull splat of liquid raindrops Pellets generally do not freeze into other solid masses unless mixed with freezing rain The METAR code for ice pellets is PL PE before November br br br Terminology br Ice pellets are known as sleet in the United States the official term used by the U S National Weather Service However the term sleet refers to a mixture of rain and snow in most Commonwealth countries instead including Canada Because of this Environment Canada never uses the term sleet and uses the terms ice pellets or wet snow instead br br br Formation br br Ice pellets form when a layer of above freezing air is located between and meters and ft above the ground with sub freezing air both above and below it This causes the partial or complete melting of any snowflakes falling through the warm layer the French term for sleet neige fondue literally means melted snow because of this As they fall back into the sub freezing layer closer to the surface they re freeze into ice pellets However if the sub freezing layer beneath the warm layer is too small the precipitation will not have time to re freeze before hitting the surface so it will become freezing rain and freeze on the surface instead A temperature profile showing a warm layer above the ground is most likely to be found in advance of a warm front during the cold season but can occasionally be found behind a passing cold front and often with a stationary front br br br Effects br In most parts of the world ice pellets only occur for brief periods and do not accumulate a significant and troublesome amount However across the eastern United States and southeastern Canada warm air flowing north from the Gulf of Mexico ahead of a strong synoptic scale storm system can overrun cold dense air at the surface for many hundreds of miles for an extended period of time In these areas ice pellet accumulations of cm in are not unheard of The effects of a significant accumulation of ice pellets are not unlike an accumulation of snow One significant difference however is that for the same volume of snow an equal volume of ice pellets is significantly heavier and thus more difficult to clear away Additionally a volume of ice pellets takes significantly longer to melt compared to an equal volume of fresh snowfall due to less surface area br br br See also br Freezing rain br Graupel br Hail br Sleet disambiguation br br br br br br External links
