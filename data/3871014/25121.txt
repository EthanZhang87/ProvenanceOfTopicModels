A polymath Greek romanized polymath s lit having learned much Latin homo universalis lit universal human or polyhistor Greek romanized poly stor lit well learned is an individual whose knowledge spans many different subjects known to draw on complex bodies of knowledge to solve specific problems br Embodying a basic tenet of Renaissance humanism that humans are limitless in their capacity for development the concept led to the notion that people should embrace all knowledge and develop their capacities as fully as possible This is expressed in the term Renaissance man often applied to the gifted people of that age who sought to develop their abilities in all areas of accomplishment intellectual artistic social physical and spiritual br br br Etymology br In Western Europe the first work to use the term polymathy in its title De Polymathia tractatio integri operis de studiis veterum was published in by Johann von Wowern a Hamburg philosopher Von Wowern defined polymathy as knowledge of various matters drawn from all kinds of studies ranging freely through all the fields of the disciplines as far as the human mind with unwearied industry is able to pursue them Von Wowern lists erudition literature philology philomathy and polyhistory as synonyms br The earliest recorded use of the term in the English language is from in the second edition of The Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton the form polymathist is slightly older first appearing in the Diatribae upon the first part of the late History of Tithes of Richard Montagu in Use in English of the similar term polyhistor dates from the late th century br br br Renaissance man br br The term Renaissance man was first recorded in written English in the early th century It is used to refer to great thinkers living before during or after the Renaissance Leonardo da Vinci has often been described as the archetype of the Renaissance man a man of unquenchable curiosity and feverishly inventive imagination Many notable polymaths lived during the Renaissance period a cultural movement that spanned roughly the th through to the th century that began in Italy in the Late Middle Ages and later spread to the rest of Europe These polymaths had a rounded approach to education that reflected the ideals of the humanists of the time A gentleman or courtier of that era was expected to speak several languages play a musical instrument write poetry and so on thus fulfilling the Renaissance ideal br The idea of a universal education was essential to achieving polymath ability hence the word university was used to describe a seat of learning However the original Latin word universitas refers in general to a number of persons associated into one body a society company community guild corporation etc At this time universities did not specialize in specific areas but rather trained students in a broad array of science philosophy and theology This universal education gave them a grounding from which they could continue into apprenticeship toward becoming a master of a specific field br When someone is called a Renaissance man today it is meant that rather than simply having broad interests or superficial knowledge in several fields the individual possesses a more profound knowledge and a proficiency or even an expertise in at least some of those fields br Some dictionaries use the term Renaissance man to describe someone with many interests or talents while others give a meaning restricted to the Renaissance and more closely related to Renaissance ideals br br br In academia br br br Robert Root Bernstein and colleagues br Robert Root Bernstein is considered the principal responsible for rekindling interest in polymathy in the scientific community His works emphasize the contrast between the polymath and two other types the specialist and the dilettante The specialist demonstrates depth but lacks breadth of knowledge The dilettante demonstrates superficial breadth but tends to acquire skills merely for their own sake without regard to understanding the broader applications or implications and without integrating it Conversely the polymath is a person with a level of expertise that is able to put a significant amount of time and effort into their avocations and find ways to use their multiple interests to inform their vocations br A key point in the work of Root Bernstein and colleagues is the argument in favor of the universality of the creative process That is although creative products such as a painting a mathematical model or a poem can be domain specific at the level of the creative process the mental tools that lead to the generation of creative ideas are the same be it in the arts or science These mental tools are sometimes called intuitive tools of thinking It is therefore not surprising that many of the most innovative scientists have serious hobbies or interests in artistic activities and that some of the most innovative artists have an interest or hobbies in the sciences br Root Bernstein and colleagues research is an important counterpoint to the claim by some psychologists that creativity is a domain specific phenomenon Through their research Root Bernstein and colleagues conclude that there are certain comprehensive thinking skills and tools that cross the barrier of different domains and can foster creative thinking creativity researchers who discuss integrating ideas from diverse fields as the basis of creative giftedness ask not who is creative but what is the basis of creative thinking From the polymathy perspective giftedness is the ability to combine disparate or even apparently contradictory ideas sets of problems skills talents and knowledge in novel and useful ways Polymathy is therefore the main source of any individual s creative potential In Life Stages of Creativity Robert and Mich le Root Bernstein suggest six typologies of creative life stages These typologies are based on real creative production records first published by Root Bernstein Bernstein and Garnier br br Type represents people who specialize in developing one major talent early in life e g prodigies and successfully exploit that talent exclusively for the rest of their lives br Type individuals explore a range of different creative activities e g through worldplay or a variety of hobbies and then settle on exploiting one of these for the rest of their lives br Type people are polymathic from the outset and manage to juggle multiple careers simultaneously so that their creativity pattern is constantly varied br Type creators are recognized early for one major talent e g math or music but go on to explore additional creative outlets diversifying their productivity with age br Type creators devote themselves serially to one creative field after another br Type people develop diversified creative skills early and then like Type individuals explore these serially one at a time br Finally his studies suggest that understanding polymathy and learning from polymathic exemplars can help structure a new model of education that better promotes creativity and innovation we must focus education on principles methods and skills that will serve them students in learning and creating across many disciplines multiple careers and succeeding life stages br br br Peter Burke br Peter Burke Professor Emeritus of Cultural History and Fellow of Emmanuel College at Cambridge discussed the theme of polymathy in some of his works He has presented a comprehensive historical overview of the ascension and decline of the polymath as what he calls an intellectual species br He observes that in ancient and medieval times scholars did not have to specialize However from the th century on the rapid rise of new knowledge in the Western world both from the systematic investigation of the natural world and from the flow of information coming from other parts of the world was making it increasingly difficult for individual scholars to master as many disciplines as before Thus an intellectual retreat of the polymath species occurred from knowledge in every academic field to knowledge in several fields and from making original contributions in many fields to a more passive consumption of what has been contributed by others br Given this change in the intellectual climate it has since then been more common to find passive polymaths who consume knowledge in various domains but make their reputation in one single discipline than proper polymaths who through a feat of intellectual heroism manage to make serious contributions to several disciplines br However Burke warns that in the age of specialization polymathic people are more necessary than ever both for synthesis to paint the big picture and for analysis He says It takes a polymath to mind the gap and draw attention to the knowledges that may otherwise disappear into the spaces between disciplines as they are currently defined and organized br Finally he suggests that governments and universities should nurture a habitat in which this endangered species can survive offering students and scholars the possibility of interdisciplinary work br br br Bharath Sriraman br Bharath Sriraman of the University of Montana also investigated the role of polymathy in education He poses that an ideal education should nurture talent in the classroom and enable individuals to pursue multiple fields of research and appreciate both the aesthetic and structural scientific connections between mathematics arts and the sciences br In Sriraman published a paper reporting a year study with pre service mathematics teachers and derived several implications for mathematics pre service education as well as interdisciplinary education He utilized a hermeneutic phenomenological approach to recreate the emotions voices and struggles of students as they tried to unravel Russell s paradox presented in its linguistic form They found that those more engaged in solving the paradox also displayed more polymathic thinking traits He concludes by suggesting that fostering polymathy in the classroom may help students change beliefs discover structures and open new avenues for interdisciplinary pedagogy br br br Michael Araki br Michael Araki is a professor at the UNSW Business School at the University of New South Wales Australia He sought to formalize in a general model how the development of polymathy takes place His Developmental Model of Polymathy DMP is presented in a article with two main objectives br br organize the elements involved in the process of polymathy development into a structure of relationships that is wed to the approach of polymathy as a life project and br provide an articulation with other well developed constructs theories and models especially from the fields of giftedness and education br The model which was designed to reflect a structural model has five major components br br polymathic antecedents br polymathic mediators br polymathic achievements br intrapersonal moderators br environmental moderators br br Regarding the definition of the term polymathy the researcher through an analysis of the extant literature concluded that although there are a multitude of perspectives on polymathy most of them ascertain that polymathy entails three core elements breadth depth and integration br Breadth refers to comprehensiveness extension and diversity of knowledge It is contrasted with the idea of narrowness specialization and the restriction of one s expertise to a limited domain The possession of comprehensive knowledge at very disparate areas is a hallmark of the greatest polymaths br Depth refers to the vertical accumulation of knowledge and the degree of elaboration or sophistication of one s sets of one s conceptual network Like Robert Root Bernstein Araki uses the concept of dilettancy as a contrast to the idea of profound learning that polymathy entails br Integration although not explicit in most definitions of polymathy is also a core component of polymathy according to the author Integration involves the capacity of connecting articulating concatenating or synthesizing different conceptual networks which in non polymathic persons might be segregated In addition integration can happen at the personality level when the person is able to integrate their diverse activities in a synergic whole which can also mean a psychic motivational emotional and cognitive integration br Finally the author also suggests that via a psychoeconomic approach polymathy can be seen as a life project That is depending on a person s temperament endowments personality social situation and opportunities or lack thereof the project of a polymathic self formation may present itself to the person as more or less alluring and more or less feasible to be pursued br br br Kaufman Beghetto and colleagues br James C Kaufman from the Neag School of Education at the University of Connecticut and Ronald A Beghetto from the same university investigated the possibility that everyone could have the potential for polymathy as well as the issue of the domain generality or domain specificity of creativity br Based on their earlier four c model of creativity Beghetto and Kaufman proposed a typology of polymathy ranging from the ubiquitous mini c polymathy to the eminent but rare Big C polymathy as well as a model with some requirements for a person polymath or not to be able to reach the highest levels of creative accomplishment They account for three general requirements intelligence motivation to be creative and an environment that allows creative expression that are needed for any attempt at creativity to succeed Then depending on the domain of choice more specific abilities will be required The more that one s abilities and interests match the requirements of a domain the better While some will develop their specific skills and motivations for specific domains polymathic people will display intrinsic motivation and the ability to pursue a variety of subject matters across different domains br Regarding the interplay of polymathy and education they suggest that rather than asking whether every student has multicreative potential educators might more actively nurture the multicreative potential of their students As an example the authors cite that teachers should encourage students to make connections across disciplines use different forms of media to express their reasoning understanding e g drawings movies and other forms of visual media br br br Waqas Ahmed br In his book The Polymath British author Waqas Ahmed defines polymaths as those who have made significant contributions to at least three different fields Rather than seeing polymaths as exceptionally gifted he argues that every human being has the potential to become one that people naturally have multiple interests and talents He contrasts this polymathic nature against what he calls the cult of specialisation For example education systems stifle this nature by forcing learners to specialise in narrow topics The book argues that specialisation encouraged by the production lines of the Industrial Revolution is counter productive both to the individual and wider society It suggests that the complex problems of the st century need the versatility creativity and broad perspectives characteristic of polymaths br For individuals Ahmed says specialisation is dehumanising and stifles their full range of expression whereas polymathy is a powerful means to social and intellectual emancipation which enables a more fulfilling life In terms of social progress he argues that answers to specific problems often come from combining knowledge and skills from multiple areas and that many important problems are multi dimensional in nature and cannot be fully understood through one specialism Rather than interpreting polymathy as a mix of occupations or of intellectual interests Ahmed urges a breaking of the thinker doer dichotomy and the art science dichotomy He argues that an orientation towards action and towards thinking support each other and that human beings flourish by pursuing a diversity of experiences as well as a diversity of knowledge He observes that successful people in many fields have cited hobbies and other peripheral activities as supplying skills or insights that helped them succeed br Ahmed examines evidence suggesting that developing multiple talents and perspectives is helpful for success in a highly specialised field He cites a study of Nobel Prize winning scientists which found them times more likely to sing dance or act than average scientists Another study found that children scored higher in IQ tests after having drum lessons and he uses such research to argue that diversity of domains can enhance a person s general intelligence br Ahmed cites many historical claims for the advantages of polymathy Some of these are about general intellectual abilities that polymaths apply across multiple domains For example Aristotle wrote that full understanding of a topic requires in addition to subject knowledge a general critical thinking ability that can assess how that knowledge was arrived at Another advantage of a polymathic mindset is in the application of multiple approaches to understanding a single issue Ahmed cites biologist E O Wilson s view that reality is approached not by a single academic discipline but via a consilience between them One argument for studying multiple approaches is that it leads to open mindedness Within any one perspective a question may seem to have a straightforward settled answer Someone aware of different contrasting answers will be more open minded and aware of the limitations of their own knowledge The importance of recognising these limitations is a theme that Ahmed finds in many thinkers including Confucius Al ibn Ab lib and Nicolas of Cusa He calls it the essential mark of the polymath A further argument for multiple approaches is that a polymath does not see diverse approaches as diverse because they see connections where other people see differences For example da Vinci advanced multiple fields by applying mathematical principles to each br br br Examples br br Polymaths include the great scholars and thinkers of the Renaissance and Enlightenment who excelled at several fields in science technology engineering mathematics and the arts In the Italian Renaissance the idea of the polymath was allegedly expressed by Leon Battista Alberti a polymath himself in the statement that a man can do all things if he will Well known and celebrated polymaths include Avicenna Leonardo da Vinci Michelangelo Robert Hooke Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Al Biruni Hildegard of Bingen Ibn al Haytham Rabindranath Tagore Mikhail Lomonosov Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Alan Turing Benjamin Franklin John von Neumann Omar Khayyam Charles Sanders Peirce Henri Poincar Isaac Asimov Nicolaus Copernicus Johann Weikhard von Valvasor Ren Descartes Aristotle Frederick

Nightingale Bertrand Russell B R Ambedkar Nicole Oresme Thomas Young Sequoyah Thomas Jefferson Pierre Simon Laplace Maya Angelou Friedrich Engels and William Whewell br br br Related terms br Aside from Renaissance man similar terms in use are homo universalis Latin and uomo universale Italian which translate to universal man The related term generalist contrasted with a specialist is used to describe a person with a general approach to knowledge br The term universal genius or versatile genius is also used with Leonardo da Vinci as the prime example again The term is used especially for people who made lasting contributions in at least one of the fields in which they were actively involved and when they took a universality of approach br When a person is described as having encyclopedic knowledge they exhibit a vast scope of knowledge However this designation may be anachronistic in the case of persons such as Eratosthenes whose reputation for having encyclopedic knowledge predates the existence of any encyclopedic object br br br See also br br br References and notes br br br Further reading
