title: Grayscale

In digital photography computer generated imagery and colorimetry a grayscale image is one in which the value of each pixel is a single sample representing only an amount of light that is it carries only intensity information Grayscale images a kind of black and white or gray monochrome are composed exclusively of shades of gray The contrast ranges from black at the weakest intensity to white at the strongest br Grayscale images are distinct from one bit bi tonal black and white images which in the context of computer imaging are images with only two colors black and white also called bilevel or binary images Grayscale images have many shades of gray in between br Grayscale images can be the result of measuring the intensity of light at each pixel according to a particular weighted combination of frequencies or wavelengths and in such cases they are monochromatic proper when only a single frequency in practice a narrow band of frequencies is captured The frequencies can in principle be from anywhere in the electromagnetic spectrum e g infrared visible light ultraviolet etc br A colorimetric or more specifically photometric grayscale image is an image that has a defined grayscale colorspace which maps the stored numeric sample values to the achromatic channel of a standard colorspace which itself is based on measured properties of human vision br If the original color image has no defined colorspace or if the grayscale image is not intended to have the same human perceived achromatic intensity as the color image then there is no unique mapping from such a color image to a grayscale image br br br Numerical representations br br The intensity of a pixel is expressed within a given range between a minimum and a maximum inclusive This range is represented in an abstract way as a range from or total absence black and or total presence white with any fractional values in between This notation is used in academic papers but this does not define what black or white is in terms of colorimetry Sometimes the scale is reversed as in printing where the numeric intensity denotes how much ink is employed in halftoning with representing the paper white no ink and being a solid black full ink br In computing although the grayscale can be computed through rational numbers image pixels are usually quantized to store them as unsigned integers to reduce the required storage and computation Some early grayscale monitors can only display up to sixteen different shades which would be stored in binary form using bits But today grayscale images intended for visual display are commonly stored with bits per sampled pixel This pixel depth allows different intensities i e shades of gray to be recorded and also simplifies computation as each pixel sample can be accessed individually as one full byte However if these intensities were spaced equally in proportion to the amount of physical light they represent at that pixel called a linear encoding or scale the differences between adjacent dark shades could be quite noticeable as banding artifacts while many of the lighter shades would be wasted by encoding a lot of perceptually indistinguishable increments Therefore the shades are instead typically spread out evenly on a gamma compressed nonlinear scale which better approximates uniform perceptual increments for both dark and light shades usually making these shades enough to avoid noticeable increments br Technical uses e g in medical imaging or remote sensing applications often require more levels to make full use of the sensor accuracy typically or bits per sample and to reduce rounding errors in computations Sixteen bits per sample levels is often a convenient choice for such uses as computers manage bit words efficiently The TIFF and PNG among other image file formats support bit grayscale natively although browsers and many imaging programs tend to ignore the low order bits of each pixel Internally for computation and working storage image processing software typically uses integer or floating point numbers of size or bits br br br Converting color to grayscale br br Conversion of an arbitrary color image to grayscale is not unique in general different weighting of the color channels effectively represent the effect of shooting black and white film with different colored photographic filters on the cameras br br br Colorimetric perceptual luminance preserving conversion to grayscale br A common strategy is to use the principles of photometry or more broadly colorimetry to calculate the grayscale values in the target grayscale colorspace so as to have the same luminance technically relative luminance as the original color image according to its colorspace In addition to the same relative luminance this method also ensures that both images will have the same absolute luminance when displayed as can be measured by instruments in its SI units of candelas per square meter in any given area of the image given equal whitepoints Luminance itself is defined using a standard model of human vision so preserving the luminance in the grayscale image also preserves other perceptual lightness measures such as L as in the CIE Lab color space which is determined by the linear luminance Y itself as in the CIE XYZ color space which we will refer to here as Ylinear to avoid any ambiguity br To convert a color from a colorspace based on a typical gamma compressed nonlinear RGB color model to a grayscale representation of its luminance the gamma compression function must first be removed via gamma expansion linearization to transform the image to a linear RGB colorspace so that the appropriate weighted sum can be applied to the linear color components br br br br br R br br

colorspace br For the common sRGB color space gamma expansion is defined as br br where Csrgb represents any of the three gamma compressed sRGB primaries Rsrgb Gsrgb and Bsrgb each in range and Clinear is the corresponding linear intensity value Rlinear Glinear and Blinear also in range Then linear luminance is calculated as a weighted sum of the three linear intensity values The sRGB color space is defined in terms of the CIE linear luminance Ylinear which is given by br br These three particular coefficients represent the intensity luminance perception of typical trichromat humans to light of the precise Rec additive primary colors chromaticities that are used in the definition of sRGB Human vision is most sensitive to green so this has the greatest coefficient value and least sensitive to blue so this has the smallest coefficient To encode grayscale intensity in linear RGB each of the three color components can be set to equal the calculated linear luminance br br br br br

linear br br to get this linear grayscale which then typically needs to be gamma compressed to get back to a conventional non linear representation For sRGB each of its three primaries is then set to the same gamma compressed Ysrgb given by the inverse of the gamma expansion above as br br Because the three sRGB components are then equal indicating that it is actually a gray image not color it is only necessary to store these values once and we call this the resulting grayscale image This is how it will normally be stored in sRGB compatible image formats that support a single channel grayscale representation such as JPEG or PNG Web browsers and other software that recognizes sRGB images should produce the same rendering for such a grayscale image as it would for a color sRGB image having the same values in all three color channels br br br Luma coding in video systems br br For images in color spaces such as Y UV and its relatives which are used in standard color TV and video systems such as PAL SECAM and NTSC a nonlinear luma component Y is calculated directly from gamma compressed primary intensities as a weighted sum which although not a perfect representation of the colorimetric luminance can be calculated more quickly without the gamma expansion and compression used in photometric colorimetric calculations In the Y UV and Y IQ models used by PAL and NTSC the rec luma Y component is computed as br br where we use the prime to distinguish these nonlinear values from the sRGB nonlinear values discussed above which use a somewhat different gamma compression formula and from the linear RGB components The ITU R BT standard used for HDTV developed by the ATSC uses different color coefficients computing the luma component as br br Although these are numerically the same coefficients used in sRGB above the effect is different because here they are being applied directly to gamma compressed values rather than to the linearized values The ITU R BT standard for HDR television uses yet different coefficients computing the luma component as br br Normally these colorspaces are transformed back to nonlinear R G B before rendering for viewing To the extent that enough precision remains they can then be rendered accurately br But if the luma component Y itself is instead used directly as a grayscale representation of the color image luminance is not preserved two colors can have the same luma Y but different CIE linear luminance Y and thus different nonlinear Ysrgb as defined above and therefore appear darker or lighter to a typical human than the original color Similarly two colors having the same luminance Y and thus the same Ysrgb will in general have different luma by either of the Y luma definitions above br br br Grayscale as single channels of multichannel color images br br Color images are often built of several stacked color channels each of them representing value levels of the given channel For example RGB images are composed of three independent channels for red green and blue primary color components CMYK images have four channels for cyan magenta yellow and black ink plates etc br Here is an example of color channel splitting of a full RGB color image The column at left shows the isolated color channels in natural colors while at right there are their grayscale equivalences br br The reverse is also possible to build a full color image from their separate grayscale channels By mangling channels using offsets rotating and other manipulations artistic effects can be achieved instead of accurately
