Additive color or additive mixing is a property of a color model that predicts the appearance of colors made by coincident component lights i e the perceived color can be predicted by summing the numeric representations of the component colors Modern formulations of Grassmann s laws describe the additivity in the color perception of light mixtures in terms of algebraic equations Additive color predicts perception and not any sort of change in the photons of light themselves These predictions are only applicable in the limited scope of color matching experiments where viewers match small patches of uniform color isolated against a gray or black background br Additive color models are applied in the design and testing of electronic displays that are used to render realistic images containing diverse sets of color using phosphors that emit light of a limited set of primary colors Examination with a sufficiently powerful magnifying lens will reveal that each pixel in CRT LCD and most other types of color video displays is composed of red green and blue light emitting phosphors which appear as a variety of single colors when viewed from a normal distance br Additive color alone does not predict the appearance of mixtures of printed color inks dye layers in color photographs on film or paint mixtures Instead subtractive color is used to model the appearance of pigments or dyes such as those in paints inks br The combination of two of the common three additive primary colors in equal proportions produces an additive secondary color cyan magenta or yellow Additive color is also used to predict colors from overlapping projected colored lights often used in theatrical lighting for plays concerts circus shows and night clubs br The full gamut of color available in any additive color system is defined by all the possible combinations of all the possible luminosities of each primary color in that system In chromaticity space a gamut is a plane convex polygon with corners at the primaries For three primaries it is a triangle br br br History br br Systems of additive color are motivated by the Young Helmholtz theory of trichromatic color vision which was articulated around by Hermann von Helmholtz based on earlier work by Thomas Young For his experimental work on the subject James Clerk Maxwell is sometimes credited as being the father of additive color He had the photographer Thomas Sutton photograph a tartan ribbon on black and white film three times first with a red then green then blue color filter over the lens The three black and white images were developed and then projected onto a screen with three different projectors each equipped with the corresponding red green or blue color filter used to take its image When brought into alignment the three images a black and red image a black and green image and a black and blue image formed a full color image thus demonstrating the principles of additive color br br br See also br br Color mixing br Color space br Color theory br Color motion picture film br Kinemacolor br Prizma Color br RGB color model br Subtractive color br Technicolor br William Friese Greene br br br br br br External links br RGB and CMYK Colour systems br http www edinphoto org uk P photographers maxwell htm Photos and stories from the James Clerk Maxwell Foundation br Stanford University CS interactive Flash demo comparing additive and subtractive color mixing
