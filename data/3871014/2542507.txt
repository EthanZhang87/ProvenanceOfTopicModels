In color theory a color scheme is a combination of or more colors used in aesthetic or practical design Aesthetic color schemes are used to create style and appeal Colors that create a harmonious feeling when viewed together are often used together in aesthetic color schemes Practical color schemes are used to inhibit or facilitate color tasks such as camouflage color schemes or high visibility color schemes Qualitative and quantitative color schemes are used to encode unordered categorical data and ordered data respectively Color schemes are often described in terms of logical combinations of colors on a color wheel or within a color space br br br Harmonious schemes br br Harmonious color schemes are designed to accomplish an aesthetic color task and enhance color harmony They do not represent any underlying variable The color scheme of a logo is typically purely aesthetic A color scheme in marketing is referred to as a trade dress and can sometimes be protected by trademark or trade dress laws as is the pink color of Owens Corning fiberglass br br br Achromatic br Any color that lacks strong chromatic content is said to be unsaturated achromatic or near neutral Pure achromatic colors include black white all grays and beiges near neutrals include browns tans pastels and darker colors Near neutrals can be of any hue or lightness For example the Achromatic use of a white background with black text is an example of a basic and commonly default color scheme in web design br Neutrals are obtained by mixing pure colors with white black or gray or by mixing two complementary colors In color theory neutral colors are colors easily modified by adjacent more saturated colors and they appear to take on the hue complementary to the saturated color Next to a bright red couch a gray wall will appear distinctly greenish br Black and white have long been known to combine well with almost any other colors black decreases the apparent saturation or brightness of colors paired with it and white shows off all hues to equal effect br br br Monochromatic br br Monochromatic color schemes may contain all the colors tints tones and shades of a single hue i e the base hue modified by the addition of black gray and white As a result the energy is more subtle and peaceful due to a lack of contrast of hue br br br Complementary br br A complementary color scheme comprises two colors that combine to form gray i e they are on opposite sides of the color wheel Fully saturated complementary colors maximize color contrast A split complementary also called compound harmony color scheme comprises three colors namely a base color and two colors that are degrees and degrees apart from the base color The split complementary color scheme has the same sharp visual contrast as the complementary color scheme but has less pressure br br br Analogous br br Analogous color schemes also called dominance harmony are groups of colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel with one being the dominant color which tends to be a primary or secondary color and two on either side complementing which tend to be tertiary A analogous color scheme tends to have a consistent temperature comprising only warm or only cool colors An analogous color scheme creates a rich semi monochromatic look However the scheme also lacks contrast and is less vibrant than complementary schemes Red reddish orange orange yellow orange is one example of a set of analogous colors br An accented analogous color scheme adds the complementary color of an analogous color scheme as the accent color used to create a dominant color grouping of three similar colors accented with the direct complement or the near complement of one of them The complementary accent color creates an interesting contrast against the dominant color grouping This scheme is frequently used to put a warm accent color with a cool analogous color palette or a cool accent color with a warm palette br br br Triadic br br The triadic color scheme is a three color combination consisting of base color and two colors that are degrees and degrees apart from the base color Triadic color schemes tend to be quite vibrant Even when using pale or unsaturated versions of hues it offers a higher degree of contrast while also retaining the color harmony This scheme is trendy among artists because it provides sharp visual contrast while maintaining balance and color richness The triadic scheme is not as contrasting as the complementary scheme but it is easier to accomplish balance and harmony with these colors br br br Tetradic br The tetradic also called double complementary color scheme is considered the richest because it uses four colors arranged into two complementary color pairs This scheme is hard to harmonize and requires a color to dominate or subdue the colors if all four colors are used in equal amounts the color scheme may look unbalanced br br The rectangle color scheme is a four color combination consisting of a base color and three colors that are degrees degrees and degrees apart from the base color Rectangle color schemes work best when one color is dominant br The square color scheme is a four color combination consisting of a base color and three colors that are degrees apart from the base color Square color schemes are rich in color and offer variations br br br Wave method br This method was discovered in The wave method of building harmonious color palette based on the relationship of color and acoustic waves and the concept of consonance in music theory Additional colors are selected to the base color depending on the wavelength ratio This ratio must satisfy the concept of consonance in music theory br br br Practical schemes br Practical color schemes combine colors outside typical aesthetic media and context for purely practical reasons generally focusing on maximizing or minimizing contrast instead of color harmony The most common practical color scheme is black and white which generally maximizes contrast This may be used for black text on a white background or prison uniforms Enhancing contrast against a background motivates some practical color schemes such as high visibility color schemes while inhibiting contrast against a background motivates others as in camouflage br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Qualitative schemes br br Qualitative color schemes represent categorical variables where the possible values of the variable are discrete and unordered An example of a categorical variable is U S states which has unordered values A qualitative color scheme is generally also called a color code Generally the number of colors in a qualitative color scheme is equal to the number of possible values for the categorical variable where each value is encoded to one color However the number of total colors can be decreased by encoding each value with multiple colors as in the pair color code which encodes values using only colors by assigning each value a color each from group A and group B each consisting of colors br A qualitative color scheme can be designed similarly to a harmonious color scheme However the goal of a qualitative color scheme is to solve a comparative color task rather than an aesthetic color task so enhancing color difference between the colors in the color scheme is generally more important than color harmony br br br Quantitative schemes br br Quantitative color schemes sometimes color maps represent quantitative data where the possible values of the variable are ordered and may be discrete or continuous br br Continuous Color schemes that have a smooth color gradient Continuous color schemes are intended to display sets of continuous ordered data and can represent both small and large data variations Continuous color schemes generally use more than a hundred individual color values br Discrete Color schemes that feature only a certain subset of a continuous color scheme that are clearly distinguishable from each other Color schemes in discrete form are intended to visualise a set or range of discrete data points but are also often used with continuous datasets br Quantitative schemes are fundamental to Thematic maps charts data science spreadsheets and other tools which use graphical means to visualize quantitative data They are common in heat maps choropleths and other forms of visualization These color schemes can be categorized into different classes depending on the nature of the underlying data Each of these color schemes can be continuous or discrete br br Sequential schemes are typical color schemes that form a color gradient between a minimum and maximum value The color gradient may be parallel to one of the axes of a D color space such as hue saturation luminance or may change two of these parameters at once This yields some common sequential schemes br Monochrome schemes use tints of a single hue or shades of gray Studies have shown that while humans are capable of seeing hundreds of shades of most colors they can only distinguish for practical use i e matching shade on the map to the corresponding shade in the legend br Spectral schemes use a gradient along the spectral colors or along the full range of hues generally with no variation in value Spectral schemes can be difficult to interpret with most data because hues do not naturally look like more or less than other hues br Part spectral schemes use a subset of the spectral scheme which reduces perceptual density but tend to be more intuitive They also often superimpose a luminosity gradient on to the hue gradient with examples like light yellow to dark green or light orange to dark red br Scientific schemes use perceptually uniform color gradients and maximize color blind accessibility by simultaneously adjusting the luminosity and blue yellow channels of a color space like CIELAB along the gradient More information on scientific schemes below br Diverging schemes represent data that has a minimum and maximum as well as some meaningful center value which may represent zero the median parity etc A diverging scheme comprises two different sequential schemes monochrome or part spectral sharing a common color usually white which represents the center value and the darkest colors at the maximum and minimum Their primary use is to emphasize by the principles of visual hierarchy the relationship to the center value br Cyclic schemes represent data that has no minimum or maximum namely periodic data sets like angular data terrain aspect wind direction seasonality or data from Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR interferometry which is used to display Earth s surface displacement Cyclic schemes use color gradients that have neither a beginning nor an end so are often represented by a spectral scheme which can map directly onto the hue dimension of the color wheel br br br Scientifically derived schemes br br Scientifically derived color schemes or scientific color maps seek to improve on traditionally color schemes spectral schemes such as rainbow or jet by incorporating a uniform color gradient and color blind accessibility In the s Cynthia Brewer performed a number of experiments on various color schemes for data visualization in maps especially working with those with color blindness Eventually this work led to a palette of several dozen color schemes designed to be reproducible on multiple devices and usable by the color blind which was collected into an interactive tool known as ColorBrewer in This palette quickly gained wide acceptance due to its reliable usability by non experts and has become a standard built into GIS and mapping software and other visualization tools Other pre made scientific color schemes that are distributed directly to users but also frequently built into common visualisation toolboxes include br br MPL Matplotlib color maps including default Viridis developed by St fan van der Walt and Nathaniel Smith br Cividis color map developed by Jamie R Nu ez and colleagues br CMOcean color maps developed by Kristen M Thyng and colleagues br CET color maps developed by Peter Kovesi br Scientific color maps developed by Fabio Crameri br br br Multivariate schemes br Bivariate or trivariate schemes use two or three orthogonal sequential schemes to represent separate but usually related variables with the various blended colors representing different combinations of values This scheme tends to work best when the hues for each axis are primary colors RGB on a black background CMY on a white background so that the mixed colors are as clear as possible When crafted well and with advantageous geography in which the variables tend to have broadly consistent patterns these color schemes are very effective at visualizing correlations and other patterns between the variables In other situations they can produce a seemingly random confusion of color br br br Connotative schemes br br Connotative color schemes use colors that reference a specific cultural meaning Red and green color schemes are connotative of Christmas In some countries a red white and blue color scheme connotes the Flag of the United States Even the ubiquitous Traffic light color scheme red yellow green that was originally a qualitative color scheme has transformed into a connotative color scheme as red means stop and green means go have solidified in culture and through their meaning have been adopted in non transportation related encoding like the Traffic Light Protocol or stop light parties br br br In culture br In hotel room designs the relationship between preferences of color schemes and gender was detected Male guests tend to prefer masculine color schemes while female guests favor feminine color schemes br br br See also br Color gradient br Light on dark color scheme br Color tool br Monochromatic color br
