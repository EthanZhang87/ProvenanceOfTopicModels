A set of primary colors or primary colours see spelling differences consists of colorants or colored lights that can be mixed in varying amounts to produce a gamut of colors This is the essential method used to create the perception of a broad range of colors in e g electronic displays color printing and paintings Perceptions associated with a given combination of primary colors can be predicted by an appropriate mixing model e g additive subtractive that reflects the physics of how light interacts with physical media and ultimately the retina The most common color mixing models are the additive primary colors red green blue and the subtractive primary colors cyan magenta yellow br Primary colors can also be conceptual not necessarily real either as additive mathematical elements of a color space or as irreducible phenomenological categories in domains such as psychology and philosophy Color space primaries are precisely defined and empirically rooted in psychophysical colorimetry experiments which are foundational for understanding color vision Primaries of some color spaces are complete that is all visible colors are described in terms of their primaries weighted by nonnegative primary intensity coefficients but necessarily imaginary that is there is no plausible way that those primary colors could be represented physically or perceived Phenomenological accounts of primary colors such as the psychological primaries have been used as the conceptual basis for practical color applications even though they are not a quantitative description in and of themselves br Sets of color space primaries are generally arbitrary in the sense that there is no one set of primaries that can be considered the canonical set Primary pigments or light sources are selected for a given application on the basis of subjective preferences as well as practical factors such as cost stability availability etc br The concept of primary colors has a long complex history The choice of primary colors has changed over time in different domains that study color Descriptions of primary colors come from areas including philosophy art history color order systems and scientific work involving the physics of light and perception of color br Art education materials commonly use red yellow and blue as primary colors sometimes suggesting that they can mix all colors No set of real colorants or lights can mix all possible colors however In physics the three primary colors are typically red green and blue after the different types of photoreceptor pigments in the cone cells br br br Color model primaries br A color model is an abstract model intended to describe the ways that colors behave especially in color mixing Most color models are defined by the interaction of multiple primary colors Since most humans are trichromatic color models that want to reproduce a meaningful portion of a human s perceptual gamut must use at least three primaries More than three primaries are allowed for example to increase the size of the gamut of the color space but the entire human perceptual gamut can be reproduced with just three primaries albeit imaginary ones as in the CIE XYZ color space br Some humans and most mammals are dichromats corresponding to specific forms of color blindness in which color vision is mediated by only two of the types of color receptors Dichromats require only two primaries to reproduce their entire gamut and their participation in color matching experiments was essential in the determination of cone fundamentals leading to all modern color spaces Despite most vertebrates being tetrachromatic and therefore requiring four primaries to reproduce their entire gamut there is only one scholarly report of a functional human tetrachromat for which trichromatic color models are insufficient br br br Additive models br br The perception elicited by multiple light sources co stimulating the same area of the retina is additive i e predicted via summing the spectral power distributions the intensity of each wavelength of the individual light sources assuming a color matching context For example a purple spotlight on a dark background could be matched with coincident blue and red spotlights that are both dimmer than the purple spotlight If the intensity of the purple spotlight was doubled it could be matched by doubling the intensities of both the red and blue spotlights that matched the original purple The principles of additive color mixing are embodied in Grassmann s laws Additive mixing is sometimes described as additive color matching to emphasize the fact the predictions based on additivity only apply assuming the color matching context Additivity relies on assumptions of the color matching context such as the match being in the foveal field of view under appropriate luminance etc br Additive mixing of coincident spot lights was applied in the experiments used to derive the CIE colorspace see color space primaries section The original monochromatic primaries of the wavelengths of nm violet nm green and nm red were used in this application due to the convenience they afforded to the experimental work br Small red green and blue elements with controllable brightness in electronic displays mix additively from an appropriate viewing distance to synthesize compelling colored images This specific type of additive mixing is described as partitive mixing Red green and blue light are popular primaries for partitive mixing since primary lights with those hues provide a large color triangle gamut br The exact colors chosen for additive primaries are a compromise between the available technology including considerations such as cost and power usage and the need for large chromaticity gamut For example in the NTSC specified primaries that were representative of the phosphors available in that era for color CRTs Over decades market pressures for brighter colors resulted in CRTs using primaries that deviated significantly from the original standard Currently ITU R BT primaries are typical for high definition television br br br Subtractive models br br The subtractive color mixing model predicts the resultant spectral power distribution of light filtered through overlaid partially absorbing materials usually in the context of an underlying reflective surface such as white paper Each layer partially absorbs some wavelengths of light from the illumination while letting others pass through resulting in a colored appearance The resultant spectral power distribution is predicted by the wavelength by wavelength product of the spectral reflectance of the illumination and the product of the spectral reflectances of all of the layers Overlapping layers of ink in printing mix subtractively over reflecting white paper while the reflected light mixes in a partitive way to generate color images Importantly unlike additive mixture the color of the mixture is not well predicted by the colors of the individual dyes or inks The typical number of inks in such a printing process is CMY or CMYK but can commonly range to e g Pantone hexachrome In general using fewer inks as primaries results in more economical printing but using more may result in better color reproduction br Cyan C magenta M and yellow Y are good chromatic subtractive primaries in that filters with those colors can be overlaid to yield a surprisingly large chromaticity gamut A black K ink from the older key plate is also used in CMYK systems to augment C M and Y inks or dyes due to both being more efficient in terms of time and expense and less likely to introduce visible defects Before the color names cyan and magenta were in common use these primaries were often known as blue and red respectively and their exact color has changed over time with access to new pigments and technologies Organizations such as Fogra European Color Initiative and SWOP publish colorimetric CMYK standards for the printing industry br br br Traditional red yellow and blue primary colors as a subtractive system br br Color theorists since the seventeenth century and many artists and designers since that time have taken red yellow and blue to be the primary colors see history below This RYB system in traditional color theory is often used to order and compare colors and sometimes proposed as a system of mixing pigments to get a wide range of or all colors br O Connor describes the role of RYB primaries in traditional color theory br br A cornerstone component of traditional color theory the RYB conceptual color model underpins the notion that the creation of an exhaustive gamut of color nuances occurs via intermixture of red yellow and blue pigments especially when applied in conjunction with white and black pigment color In the literature relating to traditional color theory and RYB color red yellow and blue are often referred to as primary colors and represent exemplar hues rather than specific hues that are more pure unique or proprietary variants of these hues br Traditional color theory is based on experience with pigments more than on the science of light In Snow and Froehlich explained br br It does not matter to the makers of dyes if as the physicist says red light and green light in mixture make yellow light when they find by experiment that red pigment and green pigment in mixture produce gray No matter what the spectroscope may demonstrate regarding the combination of yellow rays of light and blue rays of light the fact remains that yellow pigment mixed with the blue pigment produces green pigment br The widespread adoption of teaching of RYB as primary colors in post secondary art schools in the twentieth century has been attributed to the influence of the Bauhaus where Johannes Itten developed his ideas on color during his time there in the s and of his book on color published in br In discussing color design for the web Jason Beaird writes br br The reason many digital artists still keep a red yellow and blue color wheel handy is because the color schemes and concepts of traditional color theory are based on that model Even though I design mostly for the Web a medium that s displayed in RGB I still use red yellow and blue as the basis for my color selection I believe that color combinations created using the red yellow and blue color wheel are more aesthetically pleasing and that good design is about aesthetics br Of course the notion that all colors can be mixed from RYB primaries is not true just as it is not true in any system of real primaries br For example if the blue pigment is a deep Prussian blue then a muddy desaturated green may be the best that can be had by mixing with yellow To achieve a larger gamut of colors via mixing the blue and red pigments used in illustrative materials such as the Color Mixing Guide in the image are often closer to peacock blue a blue green or cyan and carmine or crimson or magenta respectively br Printers traditionally used inks of such colors known as process blue and process red before modern color science and the printing industry converged on the process colors and names cyan and magenta br this is not to say that RYB is the same as CMY or that it is exactly subtractive but that there is a range of ways to conceptualize traditional RYB as a subtractive system in the framework of modern color science br Faber Castell identifies the following three colors Cadmium yellow number for yellow Phthalo blue number for blue and Deep scarlet red number for red as the closest to primary colors for its Art Graphic color pencils range Cadmium yellow number for yellow Phthalo blue number for blue and Pale geranium lake number for red are provided as primary colors in its basic color Albrecht D rer watercolor marker set br br br Mixing pigments in limited palettes br br The first known use of red yellow and blue as simple or primary colors by Chalcidius ca AD was possibly based on the art of paint mixing br Mixing pigments for the purpose of creating realistic paintings with diverse color gamuts is known to have been practiced at least since Ancient Greece see history section The identity of a the set of minimal pigments to mix diverse gamuts has long been the subject of speculation by theorists whose claims have changed over time for example Pliny s white black one or another red and sil which might have been yellow or blue Robert Boyle s white black red yellow and blue and variations with more or fewer primary color or pigments Some writers and artists have found these schemes difficult to reconcile with the actual practice of painting Nonetheless it has long been known that limited palettes consisting of a small set of pigments are sufficient to mix a diverse gamut of colors br The set of pigments available to mix diverse gamuts of color in various media such as oil watercolor acrylic gouache and pastel is large and has changed throughout history There is no consensus on a specific set of pigments that are considered primary colors the choice of pigments depends entirely on the artist s subjective preference of subject and style of art as well as material considerations like lightfastness and mixing behavior A variety of limited palettes have been employed by artists for their work br The color of light i e the spectral power distribution reflected from illuminated surfaces coated in paint mixes is not well approximated by a subtractive or additive mixing model Color predictions that incorporate light scattering effects of pigment particles and paint layer thickness require approaches based on the Kubelka Munk equations but even such approaches are not expected to predict the color of paint mixtures precisely due to inherent limitations Artists typically rely on mixing experience and recipes to mix desired colors from a small initial set of primaries and do not use mathematical modeling br MacEvoy explains why artists often chose a palette closer to RYB than to CMY br br Because the optimal pigments in practice produce unsatisfactory mixtures because the alternative selections are less granulating more transparent and mix darker values and because visual preferences have demanded relatively saturated yellow to red mixtures obtained at the expense of relatively dull green and purple mixtures Artists jettisoned theory to obtain the best color mixtures in practice br br br Color space primaries br br A color space is a subset of a color model where the primaries have been defined either directly as photometric spectra or indirectly as a function of other color spaces For example sRGB and Adobe RGB are both color spaces based on the RGB color model However the green primary of Adobe RGB is more saturated than the equivalent in sRGB and therefore yields a larger gamut Otherwise choice of color space is largely arbitrary and depends on the utility to a specific application br br br Imaginary primaries br Color space primaries are derived from canonical colorimetric experiments that represent a standardized model of an observer i e a set of color matching functions adopted by Commission Internationale de l Eclairage CIE standards The abbreviated account of color space primaries in this section is based on descriptions in Colorimetry Understanding The CIE System br The CIE standard observer is derived from experiments in which participants observing a foveal bipartite field with a dark surround Half of the field is illuminated with a monochromatic test stimulus ranging from nm to nm and the other half is the matching stimulus illuminated with three coincident monochromatic primary lights nm for red R nm for green G and nm for blue B These primaries correspond to CIE RGB color space The intensities of the primary lights could be adjusted by the participant observer until the matching stimulus matched the test stimulus as predicted by Grassman s laws of additive mixing Different standard observers from other color matching experiments have been derived since The variations in experiments include choices of primary lights field of view number of participants etc but the presentation below is representative of those results br Matching was performed across many participants in incremental steps along the range of test stimulus wavelengths nm to nm to ultimately yield the color matching functions br br br br br br r br br br br br br br br br displaystyle overline r lambda br br br br br br br br g br br br br

as a tristimulus value and measures amounts in the adopted units No set of real primary lights can match another monochromatic light under additive mixing so at least one of the color matching functions is negative for each wavelength A negative tristimulus value corresponds to that primary being added to the test stimulus instead of the matching stimulus to achieve a match br The negative

and short wavelength S cones The three cone fundamentals are related to the original color matching functions by the following linear transformation specific to a field br br LMS color space comprises three primary lights L M and S that stimulate only the L M and S cones respectively A real primary that stimulates only the M cone is impossible and therefore these primaries are imaginary The LMS color space has significant physiological relevance as these three photoreceptors mediate trichromatic color vision in humans br Both XYZ and LMS color spaces are complete since all colors in the gamut of the standard observer are contained within their color spaces Complete color spaces must have imaginary primaries but color spaces with imaginary primaries are not necessarily complete e g ProPhoto RGB color space br br br Real primaries br br Color spaces used in color reproduction must use real primaries that can be reproduced by practical sources either lights in additive models or pigments in subtractive models Most RGB color spaces have real primaries though some maintain imaginary primaries For example all the sRGB primaries fall within the gamut of human perception and so can be easily represented by practical light sources including CRT and LED displays hence why sRGB is still the color space of choice for digital displays br A color in a color space is defined as a combination of its primaries where each primary must give a non negative contribution Any color space based on a finite number of real primaries is incomplete in that it cannot reproduce every color within the gamut of the standard observer br Practical color spaces such as sRGB and scRGB are typically at least partially defined in terms of linear transformations from CIE XYZ and color management often uses CIE XYZ as a middle point for transformations between two other color spaces br Most color spaces in the color matching context those defined by their relationship to CIE XYZ inherit its three dimensionality However more complex color appearance models like CIECAM require extra dimensions to describe colors appear under different viewing conditions br br br Psychological primaries br br The opponent process was proposed by Ewald Hering in which he described the four unique hues later called psychological primaries in some contexts red green yellow and blue To Hering the unique hues appeared as pure colors while all others were psychological mixes of two of them Furthermore these colors were organized in opponent pairs red vs green and yellow vs blue so that mixing could occur across pairs e g a yellowish green or a yellowish red but not within a pair i e reddish green cannot be imagined An achromatic opponent process along black and white is also part of Hering s explanation of color perception Hering asserted that we did not know why these color relationships were true but knew that they were Although there is a great deal of evidence for the opponent process in the form of neural mechanisms there is currently no clear mapping of the psychological primaries to neural correlates br The psychological primaries were applied by Richard S Hunter as the primaries for Hunter L a b colorspace that led to the creation of CIELAB The Natural Color System is also directly inspired by the psychological primaries br br br History br br br Philosophy br Philosophical writing from ancient Greece has described notions of primary colors but they can be difficult to interpret in terms of modern color science Theophrastus c BCE described Democritus position that the primary colors were white black red and green In Classical Greece Empedocles identified white black red and depending on the interpretation either yellow or green as primary colors Aristotle described a notion in which white and black could be mixed in different ratios to yield chromatic colors this idea had considerable influence in Western thinking about color Fran ois d Aguilon s notion of the five primary colors white yellow red blue black was influenced by Aristotle s idea of the chromatic colors being made of black and white The th century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein explored color related ideas using red green blue and yellow as primary colors br br br Light and color vision br Isaac Newton used the term primary color to describe the colored spectral components of sunlight A number of color theorists did not agree with Newton s work David Brewster advocated that red yellow and blue light could be combined into any spectral hue late into the s Thomas Young proposed red green and violet as the three primary colors while James Clerk Maxwell favored changing violet to blue Hermann von Helmholtz proposed a slightly purplish red a vegetation green slightly yellowish and an ultramarine blue as a trio Newton Young Maxwell and Helmholtz were all prominent contributors to modern color science that ultimately described the perception of color in terms of the three types of retinal photoreceptors br br br Colorants br John Gage s The Fortunes Of Apelles provides a summary of the history of primary colors as pigments in painting and describes the evolution of the idea as complex Gage begins by describing Pliny the Elder s account of notable Greek painters who used four primaries Pliny distinguished the pigments i e substances from their apparent colors white from Milos ex albis red from Sinope ex rubris Attic yellow sil and atramentum ex nigris Sil was historically confused as a blue pigment between the th and th centuries leading to claims about white black red and blue being the fewest colors required for painting Thomas Bardwell an th century Norwich portrait painter was skeptical of practical relevance of Pliny s account br Robert Boyle the Irish chemist introduced the term primary color in English in and claimed that there were five primary colors white black red yellow and blue The German painter Joachim von Sandrart eventually proposed removing white and black from the primaries and that one only needed red yellow blue and green to paint the whole creation br br Red yellow and blue as primaries became a popular notion in the th and th centuries Jacob Christoph Le Blon an engraver was the first to use separate plates for each color in mezzotint printmaking yellow red and blue plus black to add shades and contrast Le Blon used primitive in to describe red yellow and blue in a very similar sense as Boyle used primary Moses Harris an entomologist and engraver also describes red yellow and blue as primitive colors in L onor M rim e described red yellow and blue in his book on painting originally published in French in as the three simple primitive colors that can make a great variety of tones and colors found in nature George Field a chemist used the word primary to describe red yellow and blue in Michel Eug ne Chevreul also a chemist discussed red yellow and blue as primary colors in br br br Color order systems br br Historical perspectives on color order systems catalogs of color that were proposed in the th and th centuries describe them as using red yellow and blue pigments as chromatic primaries Tobias Mayer a German mathematician physicist and astronomer described a triangular bipyramid with red yellow and blue at the vertices in the same plane white at the top vertex and black and the bottom vertex in a public lecture in There are planes of colors between the white and black vertices inside the triangular bipyramid Mayer did not seem to distinguish between colored light and colorant though he used vermilion orpiment King s yellow and Bergblau azurite in partially complete colorings of planes in his solid Johann Heinrich Lambert a Swiss mathematician physicist and astronomer proposed a triangular pyramid with gamboge carmine and Prussian blue as primaries and only white at the top vertex since Lambert could produce a mixture that was sufficiently black with those pigments Lambert s work on this system was published in Philipp Otto Runge the Romantic German painter firmly believed in the theory of red yellow and blue as the primary colors again without distinguishing light color and colorant His color sphere was ultimately described in an essay titled Farben Kugel color ball published by Goethe in His spherical model of colors equally spaced red yellow and blue longitudinally with orange green and violet between them and white and black at opposite poles br br br Red yellow and blue as primary colors br br Numerous authors have taught that red yellow and blue RYB are the primary colors in art education materials since at least the th century following the ideas tabulated above from earlier centuries br A wide variety of contemporary educational sources also describe the RYB primaries These sources range from children s books and art material manufacturers to painting and color guides Art education materials often suggest that RYB primaries can be mixed to create all other colors br br br Criticism br Albert Munsell an American painter and creator of the Munsell color system referred to the notion of RYB primaries as mischief a widely accepted error and underspecified in his book A Color Notation first published in br Itten s ideas about RYB primaries have been criticized as ignoring modern color science with demonstrations that some of Itten s claims about mixing RYB primaries are impossible br br br See also br Color vision br RGB color model br Unique hues br br br
