In photography and cinematography a wide angle lens is a lens covering a large angle of view Conversely its focal length is substantially smaller than that of a normal lens for a given film plane This type of lens allows more of the scene to be included in the photograph which is useful in architectural interior and landscape photography where the photographer may not be able to move farther from the scene to photograph it br Another use is where the photographer wishes to emphasize the difference in size or distance between objects in the foreground and the background nearby objects appear very large and objects at a moderate distance appear small and far away br This exaggeration of relative size can be used to make foreground objects more prominent and striking while capturing expansive backgrounds br A wide angle lens is also one that projects a substantially larger image circle than would be typical for a standard design lens of the same focal length This large image circle enables either large tilt shift movements with a view camera br By convention in still photography the normal lens for a particular format has a focal length approximately equal to the length of the diagonal of the image frame or digital photosensor In cinematography a lens of roughly twice the diagonal is considered normal br br br Characteristics br Longer lenses magnify the subject more apparently compressing distance and when focused on the foreground blurring the background because of their shallower depth of field Wider lenses tend to magnify the distance between objects while allowing greater depth of field br Another result of using a wide angle lens is a greater apparent perspective distortion when the camera is not aligned perpendicularly to the subject parallel lines converge at the same rate as with a normal lens but converge more due to the wider total field For example buildings appear to be falling backward much more severely when the camera is pointed upward from ground level than they would if photographed with a normal lens at the same distance from the subject because more of the subject building is visible in the wide angle shot br Because different lenses generally require a different camera subject distance to preserve the size of a subject changing the angle of view can indirectly distort perspective changing the apparent relative size of the subject and foreground br br br Wide angle lenses for mm format br For a full frame mm camera with a mm by mm format the diagonal measures mm and by custom the normal lens adopted by most manufacturers is mm Also by custom a lens of focal length mm or less is considered wide angle br Ultra wide angle lenses have a focal length shorter than the short side of the film or sensor In mm an ultra wide angle lens has a focal length shorter than mm br Common wide angle lenses for a full frame mm camera are and mm the latter four being ultra wide br Many of the lenses in this range will produce a more or less rectilinear image at the film plane though some degree of barrel distortion is not uncommon br Ultra wide angle lenses that do not produce a rectilinear image i e exhibit barrel distortion are called fisheye lenses Common focal lengths for these in a mm camera is to mm which produce a circular image Lenses with focal lengths of to mm may be either rectilinear or fisheye designs br Wide angle lenses come in both fixed focal length and zoom varieties For mm cameras lenses producing rectilinear images can be found at focal lengths as short as mm including zoom lenses with ranges of that begin at mm br br br Digital camera considerations br br As of many interchangeable lens digital cameras have image sensors that are smaller than the film format of full frame mm cameras For the most part the dimensions of these image sensors are similar to the APS C image frame size i e approximately mm x mm Therefore the angle of view for any given focal length lens will be narrower than it would be in a full frame camera because the smaller sensor sees less of the image projected by the lens The camera manufacturers provide a crop factor sometimes called a field of view factor or a focal length multiplier to show how much smaller the sensor is than a full mm film frame For example one common factor is Nikon DX format and some others although many cameras have crop factors of most Canon DSLRs the early Sigma DSLRs and the Four Thirds and Micro Four Thirds cameras The indicates that the angle of view of a lens on the camera is the same as that of a times longer focal length on a mm full frame camera which explains why the crop factor is also known as a focal length multiplier For example a mm lens on the DSLR given a crop factor of would produce the angle of view of a mm lens on a full frame camera So to determine the focal length of a lens for a digital camera that will give the equivalent angle of view as one on a full frame camera the full frame lens focal length must be divided by the crop factor For example to get the equivalent angle of view of a mm lens on a full frame mm camera from a digital camera with a crop factor one would use a mm lens br Lens manufacturers have responded by making wide angle lenses of much shorter focal lengths for these cameras In doing this they limit the diameter of the image projected to slightly more than the diagonal measurement of the photosensor This gives the designers more flexibility in providing the optical corrections necessary to economically produce high quality images at these short focal lengths especially when the lenses are zoom lenses Examples are mm minimum focal length zoom lenses from several manufacturers At mm these lenses provide the angle of view of a mm lens on a full frame camera when the crop factor is br br br Construction br br There are two varieties of wide angle lens short focus lenses and retrofocus lenses br Short focus lenses are generally made up of multiple glass elements whose shapes are more or less symmetrical in front of and behind the diaphragm As the focal length decreases the distance of the rear element of the lens from the film plane or digital sensor also decreases br This makes short focus wide angle lenses undesirable for single lens reflex cameras unless they are used with the reflex mirrors locked up On large format view cameras and rangefinder cameras short focus lenses are widely used because they give less distortion than the retrofocus design and there is no need for a long back focal distance br br The retrofocus lens solves this proximity problem through an asymmetrical design that allows the rear element to be farther away from the film plane than its effective focal length would suggest See Ang nieux retrofocus br For example it is not uncommon for the rear element of a retrofocus lens of mm to be more than mm from the film plane This makes it possible to design wide angle lenses for single lens reflex cameras br The axial adjustment range for focusing Ultra wide angle lenses and some Wide angle lenses in large format cameras is usually very small br Some manufacturers e g Linhof have offered special focusing lens mounts so called wide angle focusing devices for their cameras that allow the lens to be focused precisely without moving the entire front standard br br br Development br The first wide angle lens was developed in the s by photographer Thomas Sutton It involved a water filled lens creating panoramic visuals without the use of a rotating body br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br
