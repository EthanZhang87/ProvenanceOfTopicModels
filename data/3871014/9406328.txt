In Dzogchen rainbow body br Tibetan Wylie ja lus Jal or Jalus is a level of realization This may or may not be accompanied by the rainbow body phenomenon The rainbow body phenomenon is pre Buddhist in origin and is a topic which has been treated fairly seriously in Tibet for centuries past and into the modern era Other Vajrayana teachings also mention rainbow body phenomena which occurs during or after the death process br br br Rigpa br br The rainbow body phenomenon is a third person perspective of someone else attaining complete knowledge Tibetan Wylie rigpa Knowledge is the absence of delusion regarding the display of the basis br Rigpa has three wisdoms which are kadag lhun grub and thugs rje Kadag deals with trekch The lhun grub aspect has to do with esoteric practices such as but not limited to t gal that self liberate the human body into a Sambhogak ya rainbow body phenomenon The symbol of Dzogchen is a Tibetan A wrapped in a thigle The A represents kadag while the thigle represents lhun grub The third wisdom thugs rje compassion is the inseparability of the previous two wisdoms br In Dzogchen a fundamental point of practice is to distinguish rigpa from sems mind br The ultimate fruition of the t gal practices is a body of pure light and the dissolution of the physical body at death this is called a rainbow body Wylie ja lus pronounced ja l If the four visions of t gal are not completed before death then during death from the point of view of an external observer the dying person starts to shrink until he or she disappears or vanish into light Usually fingernails toenails and hair are left behind see e g Togden Ugyen Tendzin Ayu Khandro Changchub Dorje br The attainment of the rainbow body is typically accompanied by the appearance of lights and rainbows br Exceptional practitioners are held to realize a higher type of rainbow body without leaving behind the hair or fingernails or dying a state named the Rainbow Body of Great Transference or jalu powa chemo Having completed the four visions before death the individual focuses on the lights that surround the fingers His or her physical body self liberates into a non material body of light a Sambhogak ya with the ability to exist and abide wherever and whenever as pointed by one s compassion br br br Eyewitness account br Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen s Heart Drops of Dharmakaya a Kunzang
