Snell s law also known as the Snell Descartes law the ibn Sahl law and the law of refraction is a formula used to describe the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction when referring to light or other waves passing through a boundary between two different isotropic media such as water glass or air br In optics the law is used in ray tracing to compute the angles of incidence or refraction and in experimental optics to find the refractive index of a material The law is also satisfied in meta materials which allow light to be bent backward at a negative angle of refraction with a negative refractive index br The law states that for a given pair of media the ratio of the sines of angle of incidence br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle theta br br

History br br Ptolemy in Alexandria Egypt had found a relationship regarding refraction angles but it was inaccurate for angles that were not small Ptolemy was confident he had found an accurate empirical law partially as a result of slightly altering his data to fit theory see confirmation bias br br The law was eventually named after Snell although it was first discovered by the Persian scientist Ibn Sahl at Baghdad court in In the manuscript On Burning Mirrors and Lenses Sahl used the law to derive lens shapes that focus light with no geometric aberration br Alhazen in his Book of Optics came close to rediscovering the law of refraction but he did not take this step br The law was rediscovered by Thomas Harriot in who however did not publish his results although he had corresponded with Kepler on this very subject In the Dutch astronomer Willebrord Snellius Snell derived a mathematically equivalent form that remained unpublished during his lifetime Ren Descartes independently derived the law using heuristic momentum conservation arguments in terms of sines in his essay Dioptrique and used it to solve a range of optical problems Rejecting Descartes solution Pierre de Fermat arrived at the same solution based solely on his principle of least time Descartes assumed the speed of light was infinite yet in his derivation of Snell s law he also assumed the denser the medium the greater the speed of light Fermat supported the opposing assumptions i e the speed of light is finite and his derivation depended upon the speed of light being slower in a denser medium Fermat s derivation also utilized his invention of adequality a mathematical procedure equivalent to differential calculus for finding maxima minima and tangents br In his influential mathematics book Geometry Descartes solves a problem that was worked on by Apollonius of Perga and Pappus of Alexandria Given n lines L and a point P L on each line find the locus of points Q such that the lengths of the line segments QP L satisfy certain conditions For example when n given the lines a b c and d and a point A on a B on b and so on find the locus of points Q such that the product QA QB equals the product QC QD When the lines are not all parallel Pappus showed that the loci are conics but when Descartes considered larger n he obtained cubic and higher degree curves To show that the cubic curves were interesting he showed that they arose naturally in optics from Snell s law br According to Dijksterhuis In De natura lucis et proprietate Isaac Vossius said that Descartes had seen Snell s paper and concocted his own proof We now know this charge to be undeserved but it has been adopted many times since Both Fermat and Huygens repeated this accusation that Descartes had copied Snell In French Snell s Law is sometimes called la loi de Descartes or more frequently loi de Snell Descartes br br In his Trait de la Lumi re Christiaan Huygens showed how Snell s law of sines could be explained by or derived from the wave nature of light using what we have come to call the Huygens Fresnel principle br With the development of modern optical and electromagnetic theory the ancient Snell s law was brought into a new stage In Nicolaas Bloembergen showed that at the boundary of nonlinear medium the Snell s law should be written in a general form In and plasmonic metasurfaces were also demonstrated to change the reflection and refraction directions of light beam br br br Explanation br br Snell s law is used to determine the direction of light rays through refractive media with varying indices of refraction The indices of refraction of the media labeled br br br br br n br br br br br br br displaystyle n br br br br br br br n br br br br br br br displaystyle n br br and so on are used to represent the factor by which a light ray s speed decreases when traveling through a refractive medium such as glass or water as opposed to its velocity in a vacuum br As light passes the border between media depending upon the relative refractive indices of the two media the light will either be refracted to a lesser angle or a greater one These angles are measured with respect to the normal line represented perpendicular to the boundary In the case of light traveling from air into water light would be refracted towards the normal line because the light is slowed down in water light traveling from water to air would refract away from the normal line br Refraction between two surfaces is also referred to as reversible because if all conditions were identical the angles would be the same for light propagating in the opposite direction br Snell s law is generally true only for isotropic or specular media such as glass In anisotropic media such as some crystals birefringence may split the refracted ray into two rays the ordinary or o ray which follows Snell s law and the other extraordinary or e ray which may not be co planar with the incident ray br When the light or other wave involved is monochromatic that is of a single frequency Snell s law can also be expressed in terms of a ratio of wavelengths in the two

lambda br br br br Derivations and formula br br Snell s law can be derived in various ways br br br Derivation from Fermat s principle br Snell s law can be derived from Fermat s principle which states that the light travels the path which takes the least time By taking the derivative of the optical path length the stationary point is found giving the path taken by the light There are situations of light violating Fermat s principle by not taking the least time path as in reflection in a spherical mirror In a classic analogy the area of lower refractive index is replaced by a beach the area of higher refractive index by the sea and the fastest way for a rescuer on the beach to get to a drowning person in the sea is to run along a path that follows Snell s law br br As shown in

Total internal reflection and critical angle br br When light travels from a medium with a higher refractive index to one with a lower refractive index Snell s law seems to require in some cases whenever the angle of incidence is large enough that the sine of the angle of refraction be greater than one This of course is impossible and the light in such cases is completely reflected by the boundary a phenomenon known as total internal reflection The largest possible angle of incidence which still results in a refracted ray is called the critical angle in this case the refracted ray travels along the boundary between the two media br br For example consider a ray of light moving from water to air with an angle of incidence of The refractive indices of water and air are approximately and respectively so Snell s law gives us the relation br br br br br sin br br br br br br br br br br br br n br br br br br br n br br br br br br br sin br br br br br br br br br br

circ br br br br Dispersion br br In many wave propagation media wave velocity changes with frequency or wavelength of the waves this is true of light propagation in most transparent substances other than a vacuum These media are called dispersive The result is that the angles determined by Snell s law also depend on frequency or wavelength so that a ray of mixed wavelengths such as white light will spread or disperse Such dispersion of light in glass or water underlies the origin of rainbows and other optical phenomena in which different wavelengths appear as different colors br In optical instruments dispersion leads to chromatic aberration a color dependent blurring that sometimes is the resolution limiting effect This was especially true in refracting telescopes before the invention of achromatic objective lenses br br br Lossy absorbing or conducting media br br In a conducting medium permittivity and index of refraction are complex valued Consequently so are the angle of refraction and the wave vector This implies that while the surfaces of constant real phase are planes whose normals make an angle equal to the angle of refraction with the interface normal the surfaces of constant amplitude in contrast are planes parallel to the interface itself Since these two planes do not in general coincide with each other the wave is said to be inhomogeneous The refracted wave is exponentially attenuated with exponent proportional to the imaginary component of the index of refraction br br br See also br Brachistochrone curve Fastest curve descent without
