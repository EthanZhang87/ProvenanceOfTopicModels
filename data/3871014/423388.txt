ideologies sometimes use similar colours As an example the colour red symbolizes left wing ideologies in many countries leading to such terms as Red Army and Red Scare while the colour blue is often used for conservatism the colour yellow is most commonly associated with liberalism and right libertarianism and Green politics is named after the ideology s political colour The political associations of a given colour vary from country to country and there are exceptions to the general trends for example red has historically been associated with Christianity but over time gained association with leftist politics while the United States differs from other countries in that conservatism is associated with red and liberalism with blue Mass media has driven a standardization of colour by political party to simplify messaging while historically the colour a candidate chose to identify with could have been chosen based on other factors such as family or regional variations br

to assign a single colour to a party has been in the production of political maps in graphical displays of election results In such cases there had been no consistent association of particular parties with particular colours Between the early s and most television networks used blue to denote states carried by the Democratic Party and red to denote states carried by the Republican Party in presidential elections A unified colour scheme blue for Democrats red for Republicans began to be implemented with the presidential election in the weeks following the election there arose the terminology of red states and blue states Political observers latched on to this association which resulted from the use of red for Republican victories and blue for Democratic victories on the display map of a television network As of November maps for presidential elections produced by the U S government also use blue for Democrats and red for Republicans In September the Democratic Party officially adopted an all blue logo Around the same time the official Republican website began using a red logo br This association has potential to confuse foreign observers in that as described above red is traditionally a left wing colour as used with the Democratic Socialists of America while blue is typically associated with right wing politics This is further complicated by the diversity of factions in the Democratic Party ranging from conservatives to right libertarians to democratic socialists alongside the dominant centrist and social liberal elements of the party that outside the United States often each use different political colours br The conservative Blue Dog Coalition within the Democratic Party adopted the colour blue at its founding before the election solidified the red blue convention br There is some historical use of blue for Democrats and red for Republicans in the late th century and early th century Texas county election boards used colour coding to help Spanish speakers and illiterates identify the parties but this system was not applied consistently in Texas and was not picked up on a national level For instance in Grover Cleveland and Benjamin Harrison used maps that coded blue for the Republicans the colour Harrison perceived to represent the Union and Lincoln s Party and red for the Democrats br In Puerto Rico the main conservative party the New Progressive Party uses blue while the Popular Democratic Party uses red and the Puerto Rican Independence Party uses green br br br See also br Political uniform br List of political
