id: 42797019
Optical phenomena are any observable events that result from the interaction of light and matter br All optical phenomena coincide with quantum phenomena Common optical phenomena are often due to the interaction of light from the Sun or Moon with the atmosphere clouds water dust and other particulates One common example is the rainbow when light from the Sun is reflected and refracted by water droplets Some phenomena such as the green ray are so rare they are sometimes thought to be mythical Others such as Fata Morganas are commonplace in favored locations br Other phenomena are simply interesting aspects of optics or optical effects For instance the colors generated by a prism are often shown in classrooms br br br Scope br Optical phenomena include those arising from the optical properties of the atmosphere the rest of nature other phenomena of objects whether natural or human made optical effects and of our eyes Entoptic phenomena Also listed here are unexplained phenomena that could have an optical explanation and optical illusions for which optical explanations have been excluded br There are many phenomena that result from either the particle or the wave nature of light Some are quite subtle and observable only by precise measurement using scientific instruments One famous observation is of the bending of light from a star by the Sun observed during a solar eclipse This demonstrates that space is curved as the theory of relativity predicts br br br Atmospheric optics br br br Non atmospheric optical phenomena br br Dichromatism br Gegenschein br Iridescence br Opposition effect br Shadow br Shade br Silhouette br Sylvanshine br Zodiacal light br br br Other optical effects br Asterism star gems such as star sapphire or star ruby br Aura a phenomenon in which gas or dust surrounding an object luminesces or reflects light from the object br Aventurescence also called the Schiller effect spangled gems such as aventurine quartz and sunstone br Baily s beads grains of sunlight visible in total solar eclipses br camera obscura br Cathodoluminescence br Caustics br Chatoyancy cat s eye gems such as chrysoberyl cat s eye or aquamarine cat s eye br Chromatic polarization br Diffraction the apparent bending and spreading of light waves when they meet an obstruction br Dispersion br Double refraction or birefringence of calcite and other minerals br Double slit experiment br Electroluminescence br Evanescent wave br Fluorescence also called luminescence or photoluminescence br Mie scattering Why clouds are white br Metamerism as of alexandrite br Moir pattern br Newton s rings br Phosphorescence br Pleochroism gems or crystals which seem many colored br Rayleigh scattering Why the sky is blue sunsets are red and associated phenomena br Reflection br Refraction br Sonoluminescence br Shrimpoluminescence br Synchrotron radiation br The separation of light into colors by a prism br Triboluminescence br Thomson scattering br Total internal reflection br Twisted light br Umov effect br Zeeman effect br The ability of light to travel through space or through a vacuum br br br Entoptic phenomena br br Diffraction of light through the eyelashes br Haidinger s brush br Monocular diplopia or polyplopia from reflections at boundaries between the various ocular media br Phosphenes from stimulation other than by light e g mechanical electrical of the rod cells and cones of the eye or of other neurons of the visual system br Purkinje images br br br Optical illusions br br The unusually large size of the Moon as it rises and sets the Moon illusion br The shape of the sky the sky bowl br br br Unexplained phenomena br br Some phenomena are yet to be conclusively explained and may possibly be some form of optical phenomena Some consider many of these mysteries to simply be local tourist attractions that are not worthy of thorough investigation br br Hessdalen lights br Min Min lights br Light of Saratoga br Naga fireballs br br br See also br List of optical topics br Optics br br br br br br Source br Ozerov Ruslan P Vorobyev Anatoli A Wave Optics and Quantum Optical Phenomena Physics for Chemists pp doi B ISBN br br br Further reading br Thomas D Rossing and Christopher J Chiaverina Light Science Physics and the Visual Arts Springer New York hardback ISBN br Robert Greenler Rainbows Halos and Glories Elton Wolf Publishing hardback ISBN br Polarized Light in Nature G P K nnen Translated by G A Beerling Cambridge University Press hardcover ISBN br M G J Minnaert Light and Color in the Outdoors ISBN br John Naylor Out of the Blue A hour Skywatcher s Guide CUP ISBN br Abenteuer im Erdschatten German br The Marine Observers Log br br br External links br br Atmospheric Optics Reference site br SpaceW Site for reporting Aurora activity data br Spaceweather com Official NASA site with many photos br Astronomy in New Zealand Many atmospheric optical effect photos and descriptions
