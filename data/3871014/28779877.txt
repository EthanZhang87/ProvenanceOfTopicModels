id: 28779877
Atmospheric optics is the study of the optical characteristics of the atmosphere or products of atmospheric processes including temporal and spatial resolutions beyond those discernible with the naked eye Meteorological optics is that part of atmospheric optics concerned with the study of patterns observable with the naked eye Nevertheless the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably br Meteorological optical phenomena as described in this article are concerned with how the optical properties of Earth s atmosphere cause a wide range of optical phenomena and visual perception phenomena br Examples of meteorological phenomena include br br The blue color of the sky This is from Rayleigh scattering which sends more higher frequency shorter wavelength blue sunlight into the eye of an observer than other frequencies wavelength br The reddish color of the Sun when it is observed through a thick atmosphere as during a sunrise or sunset This is because long wavelength red light is scattered less than blue light The red light reaches the observer s eye whereas the blue light is scattered out of the line of sight br Other colours in the sky such as glowing skies at dusk and dawn These are from additional particulate matter in the sky that scatter different colors at different angles br Halos afterglows coronas polar stratospheric clouds and sun dogs These are from scattering or refraction by ice crystals and from other particles in the atmosphere They depend on different particle sizes and geometries br Mirages These are optical phenomena in which light rays are bent due to thermal variations in the refractive index of air producing displaced or heavily distorted images of distant objects Other optical phenomena associated with this include the Novaya Zemlya effect in which the Sun has a distorted shape and rises earlier or sets later than predicted A spectacular form of refraction called the Fata Morgana occurs with a temperature inversion in which objects on the horizon or even beyond the horizon e g islands cliffs ships and icebergs appear elongated and elevated like fairy tale castles br Rainbows These result from a combination of internal reflection and dispersive refraction of light in raindrops Because rainbows are seen on the opposite side of the sky from the Sun rainbows are more visible the closer the Sun is to the horizon For example if the Sun is overhead any possible rainbow appears near an observer s feet making it hard to see and involves very few raindrops between the observer s eyes and the ground making any rainbow very sparse br Other phenomena that are remarkable because they are forms of visual illusions include br br Crepuscular rays br Anticrepuscular rays and br The apparent size of celestial objects such as the Sun and Moon br br br History br A book on meteorological optics was published in the sixteenth century but there have been numerous books on the subject since about The topic was popularised by the wide circulation of a book by Marcel Minnaert Light and Color in the Open Air in br br br Sun and Moon size br br In the Book of Optics AD Ibn al Haytham argued that vision occurs in the brain and that personal experience has an effect on what people see and how they see and that vision and perception are subjective Arguing against Ptolemy s refraction theory for why people perceive the Sun and Moon larger at the horizon than when they are higher in the sky he redefined the problem in terms of perceived rather than real enlargement He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer Critically Ibn al Haytham said that judging the size of an object depends on its judged distance an object that appears near appears smaller than an object having the same image size on the retina that appears far With the overhead Moon there is no uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies Hence it appears far and small With a horizon Moon there is an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies all the objects between the observer and the horizon so the Moon appears far and large Through works by Roger Bacon John Pecham and Witelo based on Ibn al Haytham s explanation the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon with Ptolemy s theory being rejected in the th century br For over years research on the Moon illusion has been conducted by vision scientists who invariably have been psychologists specializing in human perception After reviewing the many different explanations in their book The Mystery of the Moon Illusion Ross and Plug concluded No single theory has emerged victorious br br br Sky coloration br br The color of light from the sky is a result of Rayleigh scattering of sunlight which results in a perceived blue color On a sunny day Rayleigh scattering gives the sky a blue gradient darkest around the zenith and brightest near the horizon Light rays coming from the zenith take the shortest possible path through the air mass yielding less scattering Light rays coming from the horizon take the longest possible path through the air yielding more scattering br br The blueness is at the horizon because the blue light coming from great distances is also preferentially scattered This results in a red shift of the distant light sources that is compensated by the blue hue of the scattered light in the line of sight In other words the red light scatters also if it does so at a point a great distance from the observer it has a much higher chance of reaching the observer than blue light At distances nearing infinity the scattered light is therefore white Distant clouds or snowy mountaintops will seem yellow for that reason that effect is not obvious on clear days but very pronounced when clouds are covering the line of sight reducing the blue hue from scattered sunlight br The scattering due to molecule sized particles as in air is greater in the forward and backward directions than it is in the lateral direction Individual water droplets exposed to white light will create a set of colored rings If a cloud is thick enough scattering from multiple water droplets will wash out the set of colored rings and create a washed out white color Dust from the Sahara moves around the southern periphery of the subtropical ridge moves into the southeastern United States during the summer which changes the sky from a blue to a white appearance and leads to an increase in red sunsets Its presence negatively affects air quality during the summer since it adds to the count of airborne particulates br br The sky can turn a multitude of colors such as red orange pink and yellow especially near sunset or sunrise and black at night Scattering effects also partially polarize light from the sky most pronounced at an angle from the Sun br Sky luminance distribution models have been recommended by the International Commission on Illumination CIE for the design of daylighting schemes Recent developments relate to all sky models for modelling sky luminance under weather conditions ranging from clear sky to overcast br br br Cloud coloration br br The color of a cloud as seen from the Earth tells much about what is going on inside the cloud Dense deep tropospheric clouds exhibit a high reflectance to throughout the visible spectrum Tiny particles of water are densely packed and sunlight cannot penetrate far into the cloud before it is reflected out giving a cloud its characteristic white color especially when viewed from the top Cloud droplets tend to scatter light efficiently so that the intensity of the solar radiation decreases with depth into the gases As a result the cloud base can vary from a very light to very dark grey depending on the cloud s thickness and how much light is being reflected or transmitted back to the observer Thin clouds may look white or appear to have acquired the color of their environment or background High tropospheric and non tropospheric clouds appear mostly white if composed entirely of ice crystals and or supercooled water droplets br As a tropospheric cloud matures the dense water droplets may combine to produce larger droplets which may combine to form droplets large enough to fall as rain By this process of accumulation the space between droplets becomes increasingly larger permitting light to penetrate farther into the cloud If the cloud is sufficiently large and the droplets within are spaced far enough apart it may be that a percentage of the light which enters the cloud is not reflected back out before it is absorbed A simple example of this is being able to see farther in heavy rain than in heavy fog This process of reflection absorption is what causes the range of cloud color from white to black br Other colors occur naturally in clouds Bluish grey is the result of light scattering within the cloud In the visible spectrum blue and green are at the short end of light s visible wavelengths while red and yellow are at the long end The short rays are more easily scattered by water droplets and the long rays are more likely to be absorbed The bluish color is evidence that such scattering is being produced by rain sized droplets in the cloud A cumulonimbus cloud emitting green is a sign that it is a severe thunderstorm capable of heavy rain hail strong winds and possible tornadoes The exact cause of green thunderstorms is still unknown but it could be due to the combination of reddened sunlight passing through very optically thick clouds Yellowish clouds may occur in the late spring through early fall months during forest fire season The yellow color is due to the presence of pollutants in the smoke Yellowish clouds caused by the presence of nitrogen dioxide are sometimes seen in urban areas with high air pollution levels br Red orange and pink clouds occur almost entirely at sunrise and sunset and are the result of the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere When the angle between the Sun and the horizon is less than percent as it is just after sunrise or just prior to sunset sunlight becomes too red due to refraction for any colors other than those with a reddish hue to be seen The clouds do not become that color they are reflecting long and unscattered rays of sunlight which are predominant at those hours The effect is much like if a person were to shine a red spotlight on a white sheet In combination with large mature thunderheads this can produce blood red clouds Clouds look darker in the near infrared because water absorbs solar radiation at those wavelengths br br br Halos br br A halo also known as a nimbus icebow or gloriole is an optical phenomenon produced by the interaction of light from the Sun or Moon with ice crystals in the atmosphere resulting in colored or white arcs rings or spots in the sky Many halos are positioned near the Sun or Moon but others are elsewhere and even in the opposite part of the sky They can also form around artificial lights in very cold weather when ice crystals called diamond dust are floating in the nearby air br There are many types of ice halos They are produced by the ice crystals in cirrus or cirrostratus clouds high in the upper troposphere at an altitude of kilometres mi to kilometres mi or during very cold weather by ice crystals called diamond dust drifting in the air at low levels The particular shape and orientation of the crystals are responsible for the types of halo observed Light is reflected and refracted by the ice crystals and may split into colors because of dispersion The crystals behave like prisms and mirrors refracting and reflecting sunlight between their faces sending shafts of light in particular directions For circular halos the preferred angular distance are and degrees from the ice crystals which create them Atmospheric phenomena such as halos have been used as part of weather lore as an empirical means of weather forecasting with their presence indicating an approach of a warm front and its associated rain br br br Sun dogs br br Sun dogs are a common type of halo with the appearance of two subtly colored bright spots to the left and right of the Sun at a distance of about and at the same elevation above the horizon They are commonly caused by plate shaped hexagonal ice crystals These crystals tend to become horizontally aligned as they sink through the air causing them to refract the sunlight to the left and right resulting in the two sun dogs br As the Sun rises higher the rays passing through the crystals are increasingly skewed from the horizontal plane Their angle of deviation increases and the sundogs move further from the Sun However they always stay at the same elevation as the Sun Sun dogs are red colored at the side nearest the Sun Farther out the colors grade to blue or violet However the colors overlap considerably and so are muted rarely pure or saturated The colors of the sun dog finally merge into the white of the parhelic circle if the latter is visible br It is theoretically possible to predict the forms of sun dogs as would be seen on other planets and moons Mars might have sundogs formed by both water ice and CO ice On the giant gas planets Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune other crystals form the clouds of ammonia methane and other substances that can produce halos with four or more sundogs br br br Glory br br A common optical phenomenon involving water droplets is the glory A glory is an optical phenomenon appearing much like an iconic Saint s halo about the head of the observer produced by light backscattered a combination of diffraction reflection and refraction towards its source by a cloud of uniformly sized water droplets A glory has multiple colored rings with red colors on the outermost ring and blue violet colors on the innermost ring br The angular distance is much smaller than a rainbow ranging between and depending on the size of the droplets The glory can only be seen when the observer is directly between the Sun and cloud of refracting water droplets Hence it is commonly observed while airborne with the glory surrounding the airplane s shadow on clouds this is often called The Glory of the Pilot Glories can also be seen from mountains and tall buildings when there are clouds or fog below the level of the observer or on days with ground fog The glory is related to the optical phenomenon anthelion br br br Rainbow br br A rainbow is an optical and meteorological phenomenon that causes a spectrum of light to appear in the sky when sunlight shines on to droplets of moisture in the Earth s atmosphere It takes the form of a multicolored arc Rainbows caused by sunlight always appear in the section of sky directly opposite the Sun but originate no further than degrees above the horizon for observers on the ground To see them at higher angles an observer would need to be in an airplane or near a mountaintop since the rainbow would otherwise be below the horizon The bigger the droplets which formed the rainbow the brighter it will be Rainbows are most common near afternoon thunderstorms during the summer br A single reflection off the backs of an array of raindrops produces a rainbow with an angular size on the sky that ranges from to with red on the outside Double rainbows are produced by two internal reflections with angular size of to with violet on the outside Within the primary rainbow the lowest and also normally the brightest rainbow the arc of a rainbow shows red on the outer or upper part of the arc and violet on the inner section This rainbow is caused by light being reflected once in droplets of water In a double rainbow a second arc may be seen above and outside the primary arc and has the order of its colors reversed red faces inward toward the other rainbow in both rainbows This second rainbow is caused by light reflecting twice inside water droplets The region between a double rainbow is dark The reason for this dark band is that while light below the primary rainbow comes from droplet reflection and light above the upper secondary rainbow also comes from droplet reflection there is no mechanism for the region between a double rainbow to show any light reflected from water drops at all br A rainbow spans a continuous spectrum of colors the distinct bands including the number of bands are an artifact of human color vision and no banding of any type is seen in a black and white photograph of a rainbow only a smooth gradation of intensity to a maxima then fading to a minima at the other side of the arc For colors seen by a normal human eye the most commonly cited and remembered sequence in English is Isaac Newton s sevenfold red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet popularly memorized by mnemonics like Roy G Biv br br br Mirage br br br A mirage is a naturally occurring optical phenomenon in which light rays are bent to produce a displaced image of distant objects or the sky The word comes to English via the French mirage from the Latin mirare meaning to look at to wonder at This is the same root as for mirror and to admire Also it has its roots in the Arabic mirage br In contrast to a hallucination a mirage is a real optical phenomenon which can be captured on camera since light rays actually are refracted to form the false image at the observer s location What the image appears to represent however is determined by the interpretive faculties of the human mind For example inferior images on land are very easily mistaken for the reflections from a small body of water br Mirages can be categorized as inferior meaning lower superior meaning higher and Fata Morgana one kind of superior mirage consisting of a series of unusually elaborate vertically stacked images which form one rapidly changing mirage br Green flashes and green rays are optical phenomena that occur shortly after sunset or before sunrise when a green spot is visible usually for no more than a second or two above the Sun or a green ray shoots up from the sunset point Green flashes are actually a group of phenomena stemming from different causes and some are more common than others Green flashes can be observed from any altitude even from an aircraft They are usually seen at an unobstructed horizon such as over the ocean but are possible over cloud tops and mountain tops as well br A green flash from the Moon and bright planets at the horizon including Venus and Jupiter can also be observed br br br Fata Morgana br br This optical phenomenon occurs because rays of light are strongly bent when they pass through air layers of different temperatures in a steep thermal inversion where an atmospheric duct has formed A thermal inversion is an atmospheric condition where warmer air exists in a well defined layer above a layer of significantly cooler air This temperature inversion is the opposite of what is normally the case air is usually warmer close to the surface and cooler higher up In calm weather a layer of significantly warmer air can rest over colder dense air forming an atmospheric duct which acts like a refracting lens producing a series of both inverted and erect images br A Fata Morgana is an unusual and very complex form of mirage a form of superior mirage which like many other kinds of superior mirages is seen in a narrow band right above the horizon It is an Italian phrase derived from the vulgar Latin for fairy and the Arthurian sorcerer Morgan le Fay from a belief that the mirage often seen in the Strait of Messina were fairy castles in the air or false land designed to lure sailors to their death created by her witchcraft Although the term Fata Morgana is sometimes incorrectly applied to other more common kinds of mirages the true Fata Morgana is not the same as an ordinary superior mirage and is certainly not the same as an inferior mirage br Fata Morgana mirages tremendously distort the object or objects which they are based on such that the object often appears to be very unusual and may even be transformed in such a way that it is completely unrecognizable A Fata Morgana can be seen on land or at sea in polar regions or in deserts This kind of mirage can involve almost any kind of distant object including such things as boats islands and coastline br A Fata Morgana is not only complex but also rapidly changing The mirage comprises several inverted upside down and erect right side up images that are stacked on top of one another Fata Morgana mirages also show alternating compressed and stretched zones br br br Novaya Zemlya effect br br The Novaya Zemlya effect is a polar mirage caused by high refraction of sunlight between atmospheric thermoclines The Novaya Zemlya effect will give the impression that the sun is rising earlier or setting later than it actually should astronomically speaking Depending on the meteorological situation the effect will present the Sun as a line or a square which is sometimes referred to as the rectangular sun made up of flattened hourglass shapes The mirage requires rays of sunlight to have an inversion layer for hundreds of kilometres and depends on the inversion layer s temperature gradient The sunlight must bend to the Earth s curvature at least kilometres mi to allow an elevation rise of degrees for sight of the sun disk br The first person to record the phenomenon was Gerrit de Veer a member of Willem Barentsz ill fated third expedition into the polar region Novaya Zemlya the archipelago where de Veer first observed the phenomenon lends its name to the effect br br br Crepuscular rays br br Crepuscular rays are near parallel rays of sunlight moving through the Earth s atmosphere but appear to diverge because of linear perspective They often occur when objects such as mountain peaks or clouds partially shadow the Sun s rays like a cloud cover Various airborne compounds scatter the sunlight and make these rays visible due to diffraction reflection and scattering br Crepuscular rays can also occasionally be viewed underwater particularly in arctic areas appearing from ice shelves or cracks in the ice Also they are also viewed in days when the sun hits the clouds in a perfect angle shining upon the area br There are three primary forms of crepuscular rays br br Rays of light penetrating holes in low clouds also called Jacob s Ladder br Beams of light diverging from behind a cloud br Pale pinkish or reddish rays that radiate from below the horizon These are often mistaken for light pillars br They are commonly seen near sunrise and sunset when tall clouds such as cumulonimbus and mountains can be most effective at creating these rays br br br Anticrepuscular rays br br Anticrepuscular rays while parallel in reality are sometimes visible in the sky in the direction opposite the sun They appear to converge again at the distant horizon br br br Atmospheric refraction br br Atmospheric refraction influences the apparent position of astronomical and terrestrial objects usually causing them to appear higher than they actually are For this reason navigators astronomers and surveyors observe positions when these effects are minimal Sailors will only shoot a star when or more above the horizon astronomers try to schedule observations when an object is highest in the sky and surveyors try to observe in the afternoon when refraction is minimum
