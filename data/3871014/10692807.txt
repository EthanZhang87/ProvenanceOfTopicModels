A circumscribed halo is a type of halo an optical phenomenon typically in the form of a more or less oval ring that circumscribes the circular halo centred on the Sun or Moon br As the Sun rises above it essentially covers the halo Like many other halos it is slightly reddish on the inner edge facing the Sun or Moon and bluish on the outer edge br The shape of the circumscribed halo is strongly dependent on the distance of the Sun or Moon above the horizon Its top and bottom i e the points directly below and above the Sun or Moon always lie directly tangential to the halo but its left and right sides take on different shapes depending on solar or lunar elevation At an elevation between about the sides form two distinct downward drooping lobes outside of the halo As the Sun or Moon rises higher between c the drooping diminishes towards a more regular oval shape At an elevation of c or more the shape of the circumscribed halo approaches a circle and as such becomes nearly indistinguishable from the halo only to be identified by its tendency to show more saturated colors than the latter When the Sun or Moon is at an elevation lower than c the circumscribed halo breaks up into the upper tangent and lower tangent arcs br br br See also br Circumzenithal arc br Circumhorizontal arc br br br br br br External links br www paraselene de HaloSim Computer simulations of a circumscribed halo br Atmospheric Optics Circumscribed Halo solar altitude an animation showing how the shape of the phenomenon changes as the Sun or Moon rises
