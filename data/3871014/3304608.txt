title: Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world
id: 3304608
Medieval Islamic astronomy comprises the astronomical developments made in the Islamic world particularly during the Islamic Golden Age th th centuries and mostly written in the Arabic language These developments mostly took place in the Middle East Central Asia Al Andalus and North Africa and later in the Far East and India It closely parallels the genesis of other Islamic sciences in its assimilation of foreign material and the amalgamation of the disparate elements of that material to create a science with Islamic characteristics These included Greek Sassanid and Indian works in particular which were translated and built upon br Islamic astronomy played a significant role in the revival of ancient astronomy following the loss of knowledge during the early medieval period notably with the production of Latin translations of Arabic works during the th century Islamic astronomy also had an influence on Chinese astronomy br A significant number of stars in the sky such as Aldebaran Altair and Deneb and astronomical terms such as alidade azimuth and nadir are still referred to by their Arabic names A large corpus of literature from Islamic astronomy remains today numbering approximately manuscripts scattered throughout the world many of which have not been read or catalogued Even so a reasonably accurate picture of Islamic activity in the field of astronomy can be reconstructed br br br History br br br Pre Islamic Arabs br The Islamic historian Ahmad Dallal notes that unlike the Babylonians Greeks and Indians who had developed elaborate systems of mathematical astronomical study the pre Islamic Arabs relied upon empirical observations These were based on the rising and setting of particular stars and this indigenous constellation tradition was known as Anw The study of Anw was developed after Islamization when Arab astronomers introduced mathematics to their study of the night sky br br br Early period br The first astronomical texts that were translated into Arabic were of Indian and Persian origin The most notable was Zij al Sindhind a zij produced by Mu ammad ibn Ibr h m al Faz r and Ya q b ibn riq who translated an th century Indian astronomical work after with the assistance of Indian astronomers who were at the court of caliph Al Mansur Zij al Shah was also based upon Indian astronomical tables compiled in the Sasanian Empire over a period of two centuries Fragments of texts during this period show that Arab astronomers adopted the sine function from India in place of the chords of arc used in Greek trigonometry br Ptolemy s Almagest a geocentric spherical Earth cosmic model was translated at least five times in the late eighth and ninth centuries which was the main authoritative work that informed the Arabic astronomical tradition br The rise of Islam with its obligation to determine the five daily prayer times and the qibla the direction towards the Kaaba in the Sacred Mosque in Mecca inspired intellectual progress in astronomy br br br Astronomical methods br The philosopher Al Farabi d described astronomy in terms of mathematics music and optics He showed how astronomy could be used to describe the Earth s motion and the position and movement of celestial bodies and separated mathematical astronomy from science restricting astronomy to describing the position shape and size of distant objects Al Farabi used the writings of Ptolemy as described in his Analemma a way of calculating the Sun s position from any fixed location br br br Golden Age br br The House of Wisdom was an academy established in Baghdad under Abbasid caliph Al Ma mun in the early th century Astronomical research was greatly supported by al Mamun through the House of Wisdom br The first major Muslim work of astronomy was Zij al Sindhind produced by the mathematician Muhammad ibn Musa al Khwarizmi in It contained tables for the movements of the Sun the Moon and the planets Mercury Venus Mars Jupiter and Saturn The work introduced Ptolemaic concepts into Islamic science and marked a turning point in Islamic astronomy which had previously concentrated on translating works but which now began to develop new ideas br br br Doubts on Ptolemy br In the Abbasid astronomer Al Farghani wrote Kitab fi Jawami A compendium of the science of stars The book gave a summary of Ptolemic cosmography However it also corrected Ptolemy based on the findings of earlier Arab astronomers Al Farghani gave revised values for the obliquity of the ecliptic the precession of the apogees of the Sun and the Moon and the circumference of the Earth The book was circulated through the Muslim world and translated into Latin br By the th century texts had appeared that doubted that Ptolemy s works were correct Islamic scholars questioned the Earth s apparent immobility and position at the centre of the universe now that independent investigations into the Ptolemaic system were possible br The th century Egyptian astronomer Ibn Yunus found errors in Ptolemy s calculations Ptolemy calculated that the Earth s angle of axial precession varied by one degree every years Ibn Yunus calculated the rate of change to be one degree every years br Between and the polymath Ibn al Haytham wrote his Al Shukuk ala Batlamyus Doubts on Ptolemy While not disputing the existence of the geocentric model he criticized elements of the Ptolemy s theories Other astronomers took up the challenge posed in this work and went on to develop alternate models that resolved the difficulties identified by Ibn al Haytham In Abu Ubayd al Juzjani published the Tarik al Aflak in which he discussed the issues arising from Ptolemy s theory of equants and proposed a solution The anonymous work al Istidrak ala Batlamyus Recapitulation regarding Ptolemy produced in Al Andalus included a list of objections to Ptolemic astronomy br Nasir al Din al Tusi also exposed problems present in Ptolemy s work In he published his Tadkhira which contained fundamental problems he found with Ptolemaic astronomy and by doing this set off a chain of Islamic scholars that would attempt to solve these problems Scholars such as Qutb al Din al Shirazi Ibn al Shatir and Shams al Din al Khafri all worked to produce new models for solving Tusi s Problems and the models they worked to create would become widely adopted by astronomers for use in their own works br br Nasir al Din Tusi wanted to use the concept of Tusi couple to replace the equant concept in Ptolemic model Since the equant concept would result in the moon distance to change dramatically through each month at least by the factor of two if the math is done But with the Tusi couple the moon would just rotate around Earth resulting in the correct observation and applied concept Mu ayyad al Din al Urdi was another engineer scholar that tried to make sense of the motion of planets He came up with the concept of lemma which is a way of representing the epicyclical motion of planets without using Ptolemic method Lemma was intended to replace the concept of equant as well br br br Earth rotation br br Abu Rayhan Biruni b discussed the possibility of whether the Earth rotated about its own axis and around the Sun but in his Masudic Canon he set forth the principles that the Earth is at the center of the universe and that it has no motion of its own He was aware that if the Earth rotated on its axis this would be consistent with his astronomical parameters but he considered this a problem of natural philosophy rather than mathematics br His contemporary Abu Sa id al Sijzi accepted that the Earth rotates around its axis Al Biruni described an astrolabe invented by Sijzi based on the idea that the earth rotates br br The fact that some people did believe that the earth is moving on its own axis is further confirmed by an Arabic reference work from the th century which states According to the geometers or engineers muhandis n the earth is in a constant circular motion and what appears to be the motion of the heavens is actually due to the motion of the earth and not the stars br At the Maragha and Samarkand observatories the Earth s rotation was discussed by Najm al Din al Qazwini al Katibi d Tusi b and Qushji b The arguments and evidence used by Tusi and Qushji resemble those used by Copernicus to support the Earth s motion However it remains a fact that the Maragha school never made the big leap to heliocentrism br br br Alternative geocentric systems br In the th century non heliocentric alternatives to the Ptolemaic system were developed by some Islamic astronomers in al Andalus following a tradition established by Ibn Bajjah Ibn Tufail and Ibn Rushd br A notable example is Nur ad Din al Bitruji who considered the Ptolemaic model mathematical and not physical Al Bitruji proposed a theory on planetary motion in which he wished to avoid both epicycles and eccentrics He was unsuccessful in replacing Ptolemy s planetary model as the numerical predictions of the planetary positions in his configuration were less accurate than those of the Ptolemaic model One original aspects of al Bitruji s system is his proposal of a physical cause of celestial motions He contradicts the Aristotelian idea that there is a specific kind of dynamics for each world applying instead the same dynamics to the sublunar and the celestial worlds br br br Later period br In the late th century Nasir al Din al Tusi created the Tusi couple as pictured above Other notable astronomers from the later medieval period include Mu ayyad al Din al Urdi c Qutb al Din al Shirazi c Sadr al Sharia al Bukhari c Ibn al Shatir c and Ali Qushji c br In the th century the Timurid ruler Ulugh Beg of Samarkand established his court as a center of patronage for astronomy He studied it in his youth and in ordered the construction of Ulugh Beg Observatory which produced a new set of astronomical tables as well as contributing to other scientific and mathematical advances br Several major astronomical works were produced in the early th century including ones by Al Birjandi d or and Shams al Din al Khafri fl However the vast majority of works written in this and later periods in the history of Islamic sciences are yet to be studied br br br Influences br br br Africa br Islamic astronomy influenced Malian astronomy br br br Europe br br Several works of Islamic astronomy were translated to Latin starting from the th century br The work of al Battani d Kit b az Z j Book of Astronomical Tables was frequently cited by European astronomers and received several reprints including one with annotations by Regiomontanus Nicolaus Copernicus in his book that initiated the Copernican Revolution the De revolutionibus orbium coelestium mentioned al Battani no fewer than times and also mentions him in the Commentariolus Tycho Brahe Giovanni Battista Riccioli Johannes Kepler Galileo Galilei and others frequently cited him or his observations His data is still used in geophysics br Around al Bitruji published an alternative geocentric system to Ptolemy s model His system spread through most of Europe during the th century with debates and refutations of his ideas continued to the th century In Michael Scot finished a Latin translation of al Bitruji s Book of Cosmology Kit b al Hay ah which became a valid alternative to Ptolemy s Almagest in scholasticist circles Several European writers including Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon explained it in detail and compared it with Ptolemy s Copernicus cited his system in the De revolutionibus while discussing theories of the order of the inferior planets br Some historians maintain that the thought of the Maragheh observatory in particular the mathematical devices known as the Urdi lemma and the Tusi couple influenced Renaissance era European astronomy and thus Copernicus br Copernicus used such devices in the same planetary models as found in Arabic sources br Furthermore the exact replacement of the equant by two epicycles used by Copernicus in the Commentariolus was found in an earlier work by Ibn al Shatir d c of Damascus Copernicus lunar and Mercury models are also identical to Ibn al Shatir s br While the influence of the criticism of Ptolemy by Averroes on Renaissance thought is clear and explicit the claim of direct influence of the Maragha school postulated by Otto E Neugebauer in remains an open question Since the Tusi couple was used by Copernicus in his reformulation of mathematical astronomy there is a growing consensus that he became aware of this idea in some way It has been suggested that the idea of the Tusi couple may have arrived in Europe leaving few manuscript traces since it could have occurred without the translation of any Arabic text into Latin One possible route of transmission may have been through Byzantine science which translated some of al Tusi s works from Arabic into Byzantine Greek Several Byzantine Greek manuscripts containing the Tusi couple are still extant in Italy Other scholars have argued that Copernicus could well have developed these ideas independently of the late Islamic tradition Copernicus explicitly references several astronomers of the Islamic Golden Age th to th centuries in De Revolutionibus Albategnius Al Battani Averroes Ibn Rushd Thebit Th bit ibn Qurra Arzachel Al Zarqali and Alpetragius Al Bitruji but he does not show awareness of the existence of any of the later astronomers of the Maragha school br It has been argued that Copernicus could have independently discovered the Tusi couple or took the idea from Proclus s Commentary on the First Book of Euclid which Copernicus cited br Another possible source for Copernicus s knowledge of this mathematical device is the Questiones de Spera of Nicole Oresme who described how a reciprocating linear motion of a celestial body could be produced by a combination of circular motions similar to those proposed by al Tusi br br br China br br Islamic influence on Chinese astronomy was first recorded during the Song dynasty when a Hui Muslim astronomer named Ma Yize introduced the concept of seven days in a week and made other contributions br Islamic astronomers were brought to China in order to work on calendar making and astronomy during the Mongol Empire and the succeeding Yuan dynasty The Chinese scholar Yeh lu Chu tsai accompanied Genghis Khan to Persia in and studied their calendar for use in the Mongol Empire Kublai Khan brought Iranians to Beijing to construct an observatory and an institution for astronomical studies br Several Chinese astronomers worked at the Maragheh observatory founded by Nasir al Din al Tusi in under the patronage of Hulagu Khan in Persia One of these Chinese astronomers was Fu Mengchi or Fu Mezhai In the Persian astronomer Jamal ad Din who previously worked at Maragha observatory presented Kublai Khan with seven Persian astronomical instruments including a terrestrial globe and an armillary sphere as well as an astronomical almanac which was later known in China as the Wannian Li Ten Thousand Year Calendar or Eternal Calendar He was known as Zhamaluding in China where in he was appointed by Khan as the first director of the Islamic observatory in Beijing known as the Islamic Astronomical Bureau which operated alongside the Chinese Astronomical Bureau for four centuries Islamic astronomy gained a good reputation in China for its theory of planetary latitudes which did not exist in Chinese astronomy at the time and for its accurate prediction of eclipses br Some of the astronomical instruments constructed by the famous Chinese astronomer Guo Shoujing shortly afterwards resemble the style of instrumentation built at Maragheh In particular the simplified instrument jianyi and the large gnomon at the Gaocheng Astronomical Observatory show traces of Islamic influence While formulating the Shoushili calendar in Shoujing s work in spherical trigonometry may have also been partially influenced by Islamic mathematics which was largely accepted at Kublai s court These possible influences include a pseudo geometrical method for converting between equatorial and ecliptic coordinates the systematic use of decimals in the underlying parameters and the application of cubic interpolation in the calculation of the irregularity in the planetary motions br Hongwu Emperor r of the Ming dynasty in the first year of his reign conscripted Han and non Han astrology specialists from the astronomical institutions in Beijing of the former Mongolian Yuan to Nanjing to become officials of the newly established national observatory br That year the Ming government summoned for the first time the astronomical officials to come south from the upper capital of Yuan There were fourteen of them In order to enhance accuracy in methods of observation and computation Hongwu Emperor reinforced the adoption of parallel calendar systems the Han and the Hui In the following years the Ming Court appointed several Hui astrologers to hold high positions in the Imperial Observatory They wrote many books on Islamic astronomy and also manufactured astronomical equipment based on the Islamic system br The translation of two important works into Chinese was completed in Zij and al Madkhal fi Sina at Ahkam al Nujum Introduction to Astrology br In a Chinese astrolabe was made for observing stars based on the instructions for making multi purposed Islamic equipment In the apparatus was installed on a hill in northern Nanjing br Around during the Ming dynasty Hongwu Emperor ordered the Chinese translation and compilation of Islamic astronomical tables a task that was carried out by the scholars Mashayihei a Muslim astronomer and Wu Bozong a Chinese scholar official These tables came to be known as the Huihui Lifa Muslim System of Calendrical Astronomy which was published in China a number of times until the early th century though the Qing dynasty had officially abandoned the tradition of Chinese Islamic astronomy in The Muslim astronomer Yang Guangxian was known for his attacks on the Jesuit s astronomical sciences br br br Korea br In the early Joseon the Islamic calendar served as a basis for calendar reform being more accurate than the existing Chinese based calendars A Korean translation of the Huihui Lifa a text combining Chinese astronomy with Islamic astronomy works of Jamal ad Din was studied in Joseon Korea during the time of Sejong the Great in the th century br br br Observatories br br The first systematic observations in Islam are reported to have taken place under the patronage of al Mamun Here and in many other private observatories from Damascus to Baghdad meridian degree measurement were performed al Ma mun s arc measurement solar parameters were established and detailed observations of the Sun Moon and planets were undertaken br During the th century the Buwayhid dynasty encouraged the undertaking of extensive works in astronomy such as the construction of a large scale instruments with which observations were made in the year This is known through recordings made in the zij of astronomers such as Ibn al A lam The great astronomer Abd al Rahman al Sufi was patronised by prince Adud al Dawla who systematically revised Ptolemy s catalogue of stars Sharaf al Dawla also established a similar observatory in Baghdad Reports by Ibn Yunus and al Zarqali in Toledo and Cordoba indicate the use of sophisticated instruments for their time br It was Malik Shah I who established the first large observatory probably in Isfahan It was here where Omar Khayy m with many other collaborators constructed a zij and formulated the Persian Solar Calendar a k a the jalali calendar A modern version of this calendar the Solar Hijri calendar is still in official use in Iran and Afghanistan today br The most influential observatory was however founded by Hulegu Khan during the th century Here Nasir al Din al Tusi supervised its technical construction at Maragha The facility contained resting quarters for Hulagu Khan as well as a library and mosque Some of the top astronomers of the day gathered there and from their collaboration resulted important modifications to the Ptolemaic system over a period of years br br In prince Ulugh Beg himself an astronomer and mathematician founded another large observatory in Samarkand the remains of which were excavated in by Russian teams br And finally Taqi al Din Muhammad ibn Ma ruf founded a large observatory in Ottoman Constantinople in which was on the same scale as those in Maragha and Samarkand The observatory was short lived however as opponents of the observatory and prognostication from the heavens prevailed and the observatory was destroyed in While the Ottoman clergy did not object to the science of astronomy the observatory was primarily being used for astrology which they did oppose and successfully sought its destruction br As observatory development continued Islamicate scientists began to pioneer the planetarium The major difference between a planetarium and an observatory is how the universe is projected In an observatory you must look up into the night sky on the other hand planetariums allow for universes planets and stars to project at eye level in a room Scientist Ibn Firnas created a planetarium in his home that included artificial storm noises and was completely made of glass Being the first of its kind it very similar to what we see for planetariums today br br br Instruments br Our knowledge of the instruments used by Muslim astronomers primarily comes from two sources first the remaining instruments in private and museum collections today and second the treatises and manuscripts preserved from the Middle Ages br Muslim astronomers of the Golden Period made many improvements to instruments already in use before their time such as adding new scales or details br br br Celestial globes and armillary spheres br br Celestial globes were used primarily for solving problems in celestial astronomy Today such instruments remain worldwide the oldest from the th century The altitude of the Sun or the Right Ascension and Declination of stars could be calculated with these by inputting the location of the observer on the meridian ring of the globe The initial blueprint for a portable celestial globe to measure celestial coordinates came from Spanish Muslim astronomer Jabir ibn Aflah d Another skillful Muslim astronomer working on celestial globes was Abd al Rahman al Sufi b whose treatise the Book of Fixed Stars describes how to design the constellation images on the globe as well as how to use the celestial globe However it was in Iraq in the th century that astronomer Al Battani was working on celestial globes to record celestial data This was different because up until then the traditional use for a celestial globe was as an observational instrument Al Battani s treatise describes in detail the plotting coordinates for stars as well as how the stars should be marked An armillary sphere had similar applications No early Islamic armillary spheres survive but several treatises on the instrument with the rings were written In this context there is also an Islamic development the spherical astrolabe of which only one complete instrument from the th century has survived br br br Astrolabes br Brass astrolabes were an invention of Late Antiquity The first Islamic astronomer reported as having built an astrolabe is Muhammad al Fazari late th century Astrolabes were popular in the Islamic world during the Golden Age chiefly as an aid to finding the qibla The earliest known example is dated to AH br The device was incredibly useful and sometime during the th century it was brought to Europe from the Muslim world where it inspired Latin scholars to take up a vested interest in both math and astronomy Despite how much we know much about the tool many of the functions of the device have become lost to history Although it is true that there are many surviving instruction manuals historians have come to the conclusion that there are more functions of specialized astrolabes that we do not know of One example of this is an astrolabe created by Nasir al Din al Tusi in Aleppo in the year C E This particular astrolabe was special and is hailed by historians as the most sophisticated astrolabe ever made being known to have five distinct universal uses br The largest function of the astrolabe is it serves as a portable model of space that can calculate the approximate location of any heavenly body found within the solar system at any point in time provided the latitude of the observer is accounted for In order to adjust for latitude astrolabes often had a second plate on top of the first which the user could swap out to account for their correct latitude One of the most useful features of the device is that the projection created allows users to calculate and solve mathematical problems graphically which could otherwise be done only by using complex spherical trigonometry allowing for earlier access to great mathematical feats In addition to this use of the astrolabe allowed for ships at sea to calculate their position given that the device is fixed upon a star with a known altitude Standard astrolabes performed poorly on the ocean as bumpy waters and aggressive winds made use difficult so a new iteration of the device known as a Mariner s astrolabe was developed to counteract the difficult conditions of the sea br The instruments were used to read the time of the Sun rising and fixed stars al Zarqali of Andalusia constructed one such instrument in which unlike its predecessors did not depend on the latitude of the observer and could be used anywhere This instrument became known in Europe as the Saphea br br The astrolabe was arguably the most important instrument created and used for astronomical purposes in the medieval period Its invention in early medieval times required immense study and much trial and error in order to find the right method of which to construct it to where it would work efficiently and consistently and its invention led to several mathematic advances which came from the problems that arose from using the instrument The astrolabe s original purpose was to allow one to find the altitudes of the sun and many visible stars during the day and night respectively However they have ultimately come to provide great contribution to the progress of mapping the globe thus resulting in further exploration of the sea which then resulted in a series of positive events that allowed the world we know today to come to be The astrolabe has served many purposes over time and it has shown to be quite a key factor from medieval times to the present br The astrolabe required the use of mathematics and the development of the instrument incorporated azimuth circles which opened a series of questions on further mathematical dilemmas Astrolabes served the purpose of finding the altitude of the sun which also meant that they provided one the ability to find the direction of Muslim prayer or the direction of Mecca Aside from these purposes the astrolabe had a great influence on navigation specifically in the marine world This advancement made the calculation of latitude simpler which led to an increase in sea exploration and indirectly led to the Renaissance revolution an increase in global trade activity and ultimately the discovery of several of the world s continents br br br Mechanical calendar br Abu Rayhan Biruni designed an instrument he called Box of the Moon which was a mechanical lunisolar calendar employing a gear train and eight gear wheels This was an early example of a fixed wired knowledge processing machine This work of Al Biruni uses the same gear trains preserved in a th century Byzantine portable sundial br br br Sundials br br Muslims made several important improvements to the theory and construction of sundials which they inherited from their Indian and Greek predecessors Khwarizmi made tables for these instruments which considerably shortened the time needed to make specific calculations br Sundials were frequently placed on mosques to determine the time of prayer One of the most striking examples was built in the th century by the muwaqqit timekeeper of the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus ibn al Shatir br br br Quadrants br Several forms of quadrants were invented by Muslims Among them was the sine quadrant used for astronomical calculations and various forms of the horary quadrant used to determine the time especially the times of prayer by observations of the Sun or stars A center of the development of quadrants was th century Baghdad Abu Bakr ibn al Sarah al Hamawi d was a Syrian astronomer that invented a quadrant called al muqantarat al yusra He devoted his time to writing several books on his accomplishments and advancements with quadrants and geometrical problems His works on quadrants include Treatise on Operations with the Hidden Quadrant and Rare Pearls on Operations with the Circle for Finding Sines These instruments could measure the altitude between a celestial object and the horizon However as Muslim astronomers used them they began to find other ways to use them For example the mural quadrant for recording the angles of planets and celestial bodies Or the universal quadrant for latitude solving astronomical problems The horary quadrant for finding the time of day with the sun The almucantar quadrant which was developed from the astrolabe br br br Equatoria br Planetary equatoria were probably made by ancient Greeks although no findings nor descriptions have been preserved from that period In his comment on Ptolemy s Handy Tables th century mathematician Theon of Alexandria introduced some diagrams to geometrically compute the position of the planets based on Ptolemy s epicyclical theory The first description of the construction of a solar as opposed to planetary equatorium is contained in Proclus s th century work Hypotyposis where he gives instructions on how to construct one in wood or bronze br The earliest known description of a planetary equatorial is contained in early th century treatise by Ibn al Samh preserved only as a th century Castillian translation contained in the Libros del saber de astronomia Books of the knowledge of astronomy the same book contains also a treatise on the equatorial by Al Zarqali br br br Astronomy in Islamic art br Examples of cosmological imagery in Islamic art can be found in objects such as manuscripts astrological tools and palace frescoes and the study of the heavens by Islamic astronomers has translated into artistic representations of the universe and astrological concepts The Islamic world gleaned inspiration from Greek Iranian and Indian traditions to represent the stars and the universe br br The desert castle at Qasr Amra which was used as a Umayyad palace has a bath dome decorated with the Islamic zodiac and other celestial designs The Brethren of Purity described the Sun as being placed at the centre of the universe by God with the other celestial bodies orbiting around it br The Islamic zodiac and astrological visuals can be seen in examples of metalwork Ewers depicting the twelve zodiac symbols exist in order to emphasize elite craftsmanship and carry blessings such as one example now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Coinage also carried zodiac imagery that bears the sole purpose of representing the month in which the coin was minted As a result astrological symbols could have been used as both decoration and a means to communicate symbolic meanings or specific information br br br Notable astronomers br br Some of the below are from
