Gustav Adolf Feodor Wilhelm Ludwig Mie German mi September February was a German physicist His work included Mie scattering Mie potential the Mie Gr neisen equation of state and an early effort at classical unified field theories br br br Life br Mie was born in Rostock Mecklenburg Schwerin Germany in From he studied mathematics and physics at the University of Rostock In addition to his major subjects he also attended lectures in chemistry zoology geology mineralogy and astronomy as well as logic and metaphysics In he continued his studies at the University of Heidelberg and received a doctoral degree in mathematics in at the age of His thesis is titled Zum Fundamentalsatz ber die Existenz von Integralen partieller Differentialgleichungen On the fundamental theorem on the existence of integrals of partial differential equations and his supervisor was Leo K nigsberger br In he got his habilitation at the University of G ttingen in theoretical physics and in became extraordinary professor for theoretical physics at the University of Greifswald In he became full professor for experimental physics at Martin Luther University of Halle Wittenberg In he became professor at the University of Freiburg where he worked up to his retirement in br In Freiburg during the Nazi dictatorship Mie was member of the university opposition of the so called Freiburger Kreis Freiburg Circles and one of the participants of the original Freiburger Konzil br He died at Freiburg im Breisgau in br br br Work br During his Greifswald years Mie worked on the computation of scattering of an electromagnetic wave by a homogeneous dielectric sphere which was published in under the title of Contributions to the optics of turbid media particularly of colloidal metal solutions in Annalen der Physik The term Mie scattering is still related to his name Using Maxwell s electromagnetic theory applied to spherical gold particles Mie provided a theoretical treatment of plasmon resonance absorption of gold colloids The sharp absorption bands depend on the particle size and explain the change in colour that occurs as the size of the colloid nanoparticles is increased from to nm He wrote further important contributions to electromagnetism and also to relativity theory br In addition he was employed on measurements units and finally developed his Mie system of units in with the basic units Volt Ampere Coulomb and Second VACS system br In and Mie published the first attempt at a unified theory of matter in the th century His motivation was to explain the invisible electron and relate gravitation to matter his theory had three core assumptions electrical and magnetic fields exist inside of electrons special relativity and new states of ether would be sufficient to explain all phenomenon of the material world br br br Honors br A crater on Mars was named in his honor and also a building of the University of Freiburg as well as the Martin Luther University of Halle Wittenberg where he first became a full professor carries his name br br br Selected publications br Molek le Atome Welt ther Teubner Verlag br Molek le atome Welt ther Molecules atoms etheric world BG Teubner br Die Einsteinsche Gravitationstheorie Einstein s theory of gravitation S Hirzel br Die geistige Struktur der Physik G tersloh br Die g ttliche Ordnung in der Natur Furche Verlag br Lehrbuch der Elektrizit t und des Magnetismus F Enke Enke Verlag Enke Verlag br Die Grundlagen der Mechanik Enke Verlag br Beitr ge zur Optik tr ber Medien speziell kolloidaler Metall sungen Contributions to the optics of turbid media particularly of colloidal metal solutions Annalen der Physik in German IV Bibcode AnP M doi andp br br br See also br Classical unified field theories br Representative layer theory br br br br br Goldschmidt Nils Die Entstehung der Freiburger Kreise Historisch Politische Mitteilungen in German doi hpm ISSN X br Wolfram Hergert Gustav Mie und Albert Einstein Diskussionen zur Entwicklung der Allgemeinen Relativit tstheorie Scientia Halensis br Eckhard John Bernd Martin Marc M ck Hugo Ott Hrsg Die Freiburger Universit t in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus Ploetz Freiburg br Gunter Kohl Vorwort David E Rowe Relativit t in der Schwebe Die Rolle von Gustav Mie MPI f r Wissenschaftsgeschichte Berlin br Lilienfeld Pedro Gustav Mie the person Applied Optics Bibcode ApOpt L doi ao PMID S CID
