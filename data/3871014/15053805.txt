The Bogot savanna is a montane savanna located in the southwestern part of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense in the center of Colombia The Bogot savanna has an extent of square kilometres sq mi and an average altitude of metres ft The savanna is situated in the Eastern Ranges of the Colombian Andes br The Bogot savanna is crossed from northeast to southwest by the kilometres mi long Bogot River which at the southwestern edge of the plateau forms the Tequendama Falls Salto del Tequendama Other rivers such as the Subachoque Bojac Fucha Soacha and Tunjuelo Rivers tributaries of the Bogot River form smaller valleys with very fertile soils dedicated to agriculture and cattle breeding br Before the Spanish conquest of the Bogot savanna the area was inhabited by the indigenous Muisca who formed a loose confederation of various caciques named the Muisca Confederation The Bogot savanna known as Muyquyt was ruled by the zipa The people specialised in agriculture the mining of emeralds trade and especially the extraction of rock salt from rocks in Zipaquir Nemoc n Tausa and other areas on the Bogot savanna The salt extraction a task exclusively of the Muisca women gave the Muisca the name The Salt People br In April a group of around conquistadors left the relative safety of the Caribbean coastal city of Santa Marta to start a strenuous expedition up the Magdalena River the main fluvial artery of Colombia Word got around among the Spanish colonisers that deep in the unknown Andes a rich area with an advanced civilisation must exist These tales bore the not so much legend of El Dorado the city or man of gold The Muisca skilled goldworkers held a ritual in Lake Guatavita where the new zipa would cover himself in gold dust and jump from a raft into the cold waters of the metres ft high lake to the northeast of the Bogot savanna br After a journey of almost a year where the Spanish lost over of their soldiers the conquistadors following the Su rez River reached the Bogot savanna in March The zipa who ruled the Bogot savanna at the arrival of the Spanish was Tisquesusa The Muisca posed little resistance to the Spanish strangers and Tisquesusa was defeated in April in Funza in the centre of the savanna He fled towards the western hills and died of his wounds in Facatativ on the southwestern edge of the Bogot savanna The Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jim nez de Quesada established the New Kingdom of Granada with capital Santa Fe de Bogot on August This started a process of colonisation evangelisation and submittance of the Muisca to the new rule Between and of the indigenous people perished due to European diseases as smallpox and typhus The Spanish introduced new crops replacing many of the New World crops that the Muisca cultivated br Over the course of the th to early th century the Bogot savanna was sparsely populated and industrialised The rise in population during the twentieth century and the expansion of agriculture and urbanisation reduced the biodiversity and natural habitat of the Bogot savanna severely Today the Metropolitan Area of Bogot on the Bogot savanna hosts more than ten million people Bogot is the biggest city worldwide at altitudes above metres ft The many rivers on the savanna are highly contaminated and efforts to solve the environmental problems are conducted in the st century br br br Etymology br Bogot savanna is named after Bogot which is derived from Muysccubun Bacat which means Enclosure outside of the farm fields br br br Geography br br The Bogot savanna is the southwestern part of the larger Andean plateau the Altiplano Cundiboyacense The savanna is a montane savanna bordered to the east by the Eastern Hills the Sumapaz mountains in the south the hills of Tausa and Suesca in the north and western hills of Cundinamarca in the west The total surface area is square kilometres sq mi br br br Climate br The average temperature of the plateau is C F but this can fluctuate between and C and F The dry and rainy seasons alternate frequently during the year The driest months are December January February and March During the rainy months the temperature tends to be more stable with variations between and C and F June July and August are the months that present the largest variations of temperature and during the morning frost in the higher terrains surrounding the savanna is possible Sometimes also ground frost is present which has a negative impact on agriculture Hail is a relatively common phenomenon on the savanna br br br Hydrology br br br Rivers br Bogot River kilometres in

wetlands humedales that regulate the soil moisture acting like sponges for the rain waters Fifteen wetlands have a protected status with various wetlands as unprotected In the total surface area of the wetlands amounted to hectares acres but due to the urbanisation of the Colombian capital the total area has been reduced to hectares acres br br br Biodiversity br br Despite the continuous urbanisation and industrial activities the Bogot savanna is a rich biodiverse area with many bird species registered The diversity of mammals amphibians and reptiles is much lower Before the arrival of the European colonisers the savanna was populated predominantly by white tailed deer the main ingredient of the Muisca cuisine Today this species of deer as well as the once common spectacled bear is restricted to protected areas surrounding the Bogot savanna The Thomas van der Hammen Natural Reserve is a protected area in the north of Bogot br br br History br br The earliest confirmed inhabitation of present day Colombia was on the Bogot savanna with sites El Abra Tequendama and Tibit where semi nomadic hunter gatherers lived in caves and rock shelters One of the first evidences of settlement in open area space was Aguazuque whose oldest dated remains are analysed to be years old This prehistorical preceramic period was followed by the Herrera Period commonly defined from BCE to AD br br br Muisca Confederation br br At the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors the region was inhabited by the Muisca who lived in hundreds of small villages scattered across the plateau These villages were individually ruled by caciques who at the same time paid tribute to the zipa ruler of Bacat The Muisca were known as The Salt People thanks to their extraction of rock salt from brines in large pots heated over fires This process was the exclusive task of the Muisca women br The economy of the Muisca meaning person or people in their indigenous version of Chibcha Muysccubun was self sufficient due to the advanced agriculture on the fertile soils of the frequently flooding Bogot savanna More tropical and subtropical agricultural products as avocadoes and cotton were traded with their neighbours in particular the Guane and Lache in the north and northeast and the Guayupe Achagua and Tegua in the east br The Muisca were known as skilled goldworkers represented in the famous Muisca raft that symbolises the initiation ritual of the new zipa in Lake Guatavita This ritual where the zipa covered himself in gold dust and jumped in the metres ft altitude lake gave rise to the

crops that the Muisca cultivated br The Spanish colonizers engaged in the construction of Spanish style towns to replace all the indigenous villages and in the process of assimilation and religious convert of the Muisca The majority of those villages kept their indigenous names but some were slightly modified in time like Suacha which became Soacha Hyntiba becoming Fontib n and Bacat becoming
