Theodoric of Freiberg c c was a German member of the Dominican order and a theologian and physicist He was named provincial of the Dominican Order in Albert the Great s old post He is considered one of the notable philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages based on his career and writings br br br Early life br Theodoric became a Dominican friar very early on in his life and he studied and taught at the local convent in Freiberg around the year Teske He lived around the time of Albert the Great to Fuhrer and was greatly inspired by him Though other philosophers at this time followed in Albert s footsteps as well Theodoric showed the most marked tendency to Albert s universality of interests Fuhrer From the dates of Albert s life we can assume that Theodoric was still young when Albert s career was almost at its end and no assumption can be made as to whether or not Theodoric ever met or studied under Albert In medieval documents he is assigned the title of magister which tells us he had a great deal of university training at an advanced level Fuhrer br br br Career and early works br After teaching in Freiberg for some time he journeyed to Paris to study there between the years to Gillispie although we do not know with whom he may have studied In a book titled Treatise on the Intellect and the Intelligible translated by M L Fuhrer Fuhrer writes that in the second part of a treatise Theodoric talks about a solemn master in Paris Fuhrer goes on to say that Henry of Ghent was known as doctor solemnis by his students but ultimately states that there can be no certainty that they actually met or knew each other br Theodoric then returned home to Germany for a while before coming back to Paris Here he began his lectures on the Sentences in Pasnau Exactly how long he remained in Paris in not clear but it is agreed that he was made the prior of the Dominican convent in W rzburg around Fuhrer Further sources indicate that he was appointed provincial of Teutonia in as well Somerset Fiona Theodoric was then promoted to the Provincial Superior for the province of Germany the position previously held by Albert the Great Pasnau Fuhrer Around the years and he was named master of theology in Paris where he taught up to around Teske Theodoric became one of the two Germans the other being Abertus Magnus to earn this title of magister in the thirteenth century Theodoric was also present for the general chapter of the Dominican order at Toulouse and his name appears in the general chapter of the order in Piacenza The last position Theodoric was appointed to was Vicar provincial of Germany in Gillispie His name does not appear in any kind of document after this time br br br Physics br While th century authors failed to provide an accurate explanation for the rainbow at the turn of the fourteenth century Theodoric was able to give one of the first correct geometrical analyses of this phenomenon which was probably the most dramatic development of th and th century optics br br Drawing from his two earlier works on light and colour he wrote De iride et radialibus impressionibus On the Rainbow and the impressions created by irradiance c relying on geometry experiment falsification and other methods Among other properties he explained in detail br br the colors of the primary and secondary rainbows br the positions of the primary and secondary rainbows br the path of sunlight within a drop light beams are refracted when entering the atmospheric droplets then reflected inside the droplets and finally refracted again when leaving them br the formation of the rainbow he explains the role of the individual drops in creating the rainbow br the phenomenon of color reversal in the secondary rainbow br Using spherical flasks and glass globes filled with water Theodoric was able to simulate the water droplets during rainfall Still in its early stages experimental instrumentation would later expand to be used primarily for making measurements extending the human senses and creating an isolated environment for the experimenter During his experimentation with these glass globes he was correct in asserting that the colors formed by the interaction of sunlight with the water droplets br Recently scientists have found evidence of the experimental instrumentation used by him Currently on loan to universities in Providence Rhode Island the instrumentation does indeed simulate a droplet of water by which sunlight is reflected and refracted thereby creating a rainbow He studied refraction and reflection using transparent and opaque bodies e g magnifying glasses plane convex and concave mirrors prisms and transparent crystal spheres and beryls His experiments led to an explanation of the reflection refraction phenomenon of drops of water in clouds that form the rainbow br One of Theodoric s contemporaries Kamal al Din al Farisi offered the same experimentally established explanation of the rainbow without any contacts between them in his Kitab tanqih al manazir The Revision of the Optics Both authors however relied on the Book of Optics by Ibn al Haytham Alhacen Alhazen br br br Theology br Theodoric s theological works tend to be heavily Neoplatonic while his more secular philosophical works are more Aristotelian Dietrich disagreed with Thomas Aquinas on certain metaphysical issues and seems to have written in opposition to particular works by Aquinas br He had a remarkable influence on the years younger Meister Eckhart mainly via the treatises De visione beatifica Of the beatific vision and De intellectu et intelligibili Of the intellect and the intelligible Particularly his theory of transcendentals clarified Eckhart s theory of the negatio negationis It stressed the negative moment that determines privatio in general even in its privatio privationis formulation One of his extraordinary contributions to medieval philosophy was a theory of the soul that equalled the Aristotelian notion of agent intellect and the Augustinian notion of abditum mentis i e the hiddenness or hidden place of the soul br The theory of the agent intellect says that in knowing the mind is not merely passive it has to work on producing a conception of its object a conception which is then received and retained by the passive part of the mind The hiddenness of the soul in turn is the ground of the soul in which God s image is imprinted a spiritual apex of man s being by which he transcends space and time br br br Works br br br Theological works br De visione beatifica br De
