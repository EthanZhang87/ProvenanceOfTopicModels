In Nordic mythology Asgard Old Norse sgar r enclosure of the sir is a location associated with the gods It appears in several Old Norse sagas and mythological texts including the Eddas however it has also been suggested to be referred to indirectly in some of these sources It is described as the fortified home of the sir gods and is often associated with gold imagery and contains many other locations known in Nordic mythology such as Valh ll I av llr and Hlidskj lf br In some euhemeristic accounts Asgard is portrayed as being a city in Asia or Troy however in other accounts that likely more accurately reflect its conception in Old Nordic religion it is depicted as not conforming to a naturalistic geographical position In these latter accounts it is found in a range of locations such as over the rainbow bridge Bifr st in the middle of the world and over the sea br br br Etymology br The word sgar r is a compound formed from Old Norse ss god and gar r enclosure Possible anglicisations include sgarthr sgard segard sgardr Asgardr sgarth Asgarth Esageard and sgardhr br br br Attestations br br br The Poetic Edda br Asgard is named twice in Eddic poetry The first case is in Hymiskvi a when Thor and T r journey from Asgard to Hymir s hall to obtain a cauldron large enough to brew beer for a feast for gir and the gods The second instance is in rymskvi a when Loki is attempting to convince Thor to dress up as Freyja in order to get back Mj lnir by claiming that without his hammer to protect them j tnar would soon be living in Asgard br Gr mnism l contains among its cosmological descriptions a number of abodes of the gods such as lfheim N at n and Valhalla which some scholars have identified as being in Asgard It is to be noted however that Asgard is not mentioned at any point in the poem Furthermore V lusp references I av llr one of the most common meeting places of sir gods which in Gylfaginning Snorri locates in the centre of Asgard br br br The Prose Edda br br br Prologue br The Prose Edda s euhemeristic prologue portrays the sir gods as people that travelled from the East to northern territories According to Snorri Asgard represented the town of Troy before Greek warriors overtook it After the defeat Trojans moved to northern Europe where they became a dominant group due to their advanced technologies and culture Eventually other tribes began to perceive the Trojans and their leader Tr r Thor in Old Norse as gods br br br Gylfaginning br In Gylfaginning Snorri Sturluson describes how during the creation of the world the gods made the earth and surrounded it with the sea They made the sky from the skull of Ymir and settled the j tnar on the shores of the earth They set down the brows of Ymir forming Midgard and in the centre of the world they built Asgard which he identifies as Troy br br After Asgard is made the gods then built a hof named Gla sheimr at I av llr in the centre of the burg or walled city with a high seat for Odin and twelve seats for other gods It is described as like gold both on the inside and the outside and as the best of all buildings in the world They also built Ving lf for the female gods which is described as both a hall and a h rgr and a forge with which they crafted objects from gold After Ragnar k some gods such as V li and Baldr will meet at I av llr where Asgard once stood and discuss matters together There they will also find in the grass the golden chess pieces that the sir had once owned br Later the section describes how an unnamed j tunn came to the gods with his stallion Sva ilfari and offered help in building a burg for the gods in three winters asking in return for the sun moon and marriage with Freyja Despite Freyja s opposition together the gods agree to fulfill his request if he completes his work in just one winter As time goes on the gods grow desperate as it becomes apparent that the j tunn will construct the burg on time To their surprise his stallion contributes much of the progress swiftly moving boulders and rocks To deal with the problem Loki comes up with a plan whereupon he changes his appearance to that of a mare and distracts Sva ilfari to slow down construction Without the help of his stallion the builder realises he cannot complete his task in time and goes into a rage revealing his identity as a j tunn Thor then kills the builder with Mj llnir before any harm to the gods is done The chapter does not explicitly name Asgard as the fortress but they are commonly identified by scholars br In Gylfaginning the central cosmic tree Yggdrasil is described as having three roots that hold it up one of these goes to the sir which has been interpreted as meaning Asgard In Gr mnism l this root instead reaches over the realm of men The bridge Bifr st is told to span from the heavens to the earth and over it the sir cross each day to hold council beneath Yggdrasil at the Ur arbrunnr Based on this Bifr st is commonly interpreted as the bridge to Asgard br br br Sk ldskaparm l br Asgard is mentioned briefly throughout Sk ldskaparm l as the name for the home of the sir as in Gylfaginning In this section a number of locations are described as lying within Asgard including Valhalla and in front of its doors the golden grove Glasir It also records a name for Thor as Defender of sgard Old Norse verjandi sgar s br br br Ynglinga Saga br In the Ynglinga saga found in Heimskringla Snorri describes Asgard as a city in Asia based on a perceived but erroneous connection between the words for Asia and sir In the opening stanzas of the Saga of the Ynglings Asgard is the capital of Asaland a section of Asia east of the river Tana kv sl or Vana Kv sl kv sl is arm which Snorri explains is the river Tanais now Don flowing into the Black Sea Odin then leaves to settle in the northern part of the world and leaves his brothers Vili and V to rule over the city When the euhemerised Odin dies the account states that the Swedes believed he had returned to Asgard and would live there forever br br br Interpretation and discussion br Cosmology in Old Nordic religion is presented in a vague and often contradictory manner when viewed from a naturalistic standpoint Snorri places Asgard in the centre of the world surrounded by Midgard and then the lands inhabited by j tnar all of which are finally encircled by the sea He also locates the homes of the gods in the heavens This had led to the proposition of a system of concentric circles centred on Asgard or Yggdrasil and sometimes with a vertical axis leading upwards towards the heavens There is debate between scholars over whether the gods were conceived of as living in the heavens with some aligning their views with Snorri and others proposing that he at times presents the system in a Christian framework and that this organisation is not seen in either Eddic or skaldic poetry The concept of attempting to create a spatial cosmological model has itself been criticised by scholars who argue that the oral traditions did not form a naturalistic structured system that aimed to be internally geographically consistent An alternative proposal is that the world should be conceived of as a number of realms connected by passages that cannot be typically traversed This would explain how Asgard can be located both to the east and west of the realm of men over the sea and over Bifr st br It has been noted that the tendency to link Asgard to Troy is part of a wider European cultural practice of claiming Trojan origins for one s culture first seen in the Aeneid and also featuring in Geoffrey of Monmouth s Historia regum Britanniae for the founding of Britain br br br Depictions in popular culture br Thor first appeared in the Marvel Universe within comic series Journey into Mystery in the issues during August Following this release he becomes one of the central figures in the comics along with Loki and Odin In the Marvel Cinematic Universe Thor and Loki make their first appearance together in the film Thor After that Thor becomes a regular character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and reappears in several films including the Avengers series Asgard becomes the central element of the film Thor Ragnarok where it is destroyed following the Old Norse mythos These and other Norse mythology elements also appear in video games TV series and books based in and on the Marvel Universe although these depictions do not closely follow historical sources br Asgard is an explorable realm in the video game God of War Ragnar k a sequel to s Norse themed God of War br In the Assassin s Creed Valhalla video game Asgard is featured as part of a vision quest br br br See also br Mount Olympus home of the Olympian gods br br br Citations br br br
