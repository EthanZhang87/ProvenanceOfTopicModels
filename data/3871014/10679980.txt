A halo is an atmospheric optical phenomenon that consists of a halo with an apparent radius of approximately around the Sun or Moon Around the Sun it may also be called a sun halo Around the Moon it is also known as a moon ring storm ring or winter halo It forms as sunlight or moonlight is refracted by millions of hexagonal ice crystals suspended in the atmosphere Its radius as viewed from Earth is roughly the length of an outstretched hand at arm s length br br br Formation br br Even though it is one of the most common types of halo the shape and orientation of the ice crystals responsible for the halo are the topic of debate Hexagonal randomly oriented columns are usually put forward as the most likely candidate but this explanation presents problems such as the fact that the aerodynamic properties of such crystals leads them to be oriented horizontally rather than randomly Alternative explanations include the involvement of clusters of bullet shaped ice columns br As light passes through the apex angle of the hexagonal ice prisms it is deflected twice resulting in deviation angles ranging from to Given the angle of incidence onto the hexagonal ice prism br br br br br br br incidence br br br br br displaystyle theta text incidence br br and the refractive index inside the prism br br br br n br br br displaystyle n br br then the angle of deviation br br br br br br br deviation br br br br br displaystyle theta text deviation br br can be derived from Snell s law br br br br br br br br deviation br br br br br br br incidence br br br br br sin br br br br br br br br br br n br sin br br br br br br br br br br br br br sin br br br br br br br br br br sin br br br br br incidence br br br br n br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle theta text deviation theta text incidence sin left n sin left frac pi sin frac sin theta text incidence n right right frac pi br br br For br br br br n br br br displaystyle n br br the angle of minimum deviation is almost when br br br br br br br incidence br br br br br displaystyle theta text incidence br br More specifically the angle of minimum deviation is on average br br br br n br br br displaystyle n br br for red light br br br br n br br br displaystyle n br br and for blue light br br br br n br br br displaystyle n br br This wavelength dependent variation in refraction causes the inner edge of the circle to be reddish while the outer edge is bluish br The ice crystals in the clouds all deviate the light similarly but only the ones from the specific ring at degrees contribute to the effect for an observer at a set distance As no light is refracted at angles smaller than the sky is darker inside the halo br Another way to intuitively understand the formation of the halo is to consider the following logic br br All rays from the Sun Moon are incoming in a parallel manner towards the observer br We can consider a specific case when the source is right on top of the sky br Hexagonal water crystals can take on any orientation But any rotation beyond would be redundant when analyzing the angles subtended by the emerging rays This means that for all the incoming vertical rays we only need to consider incident angles in the range to that are incumbent on one edge of the hexagonal crystal these are the ones that will reach the observer br For the above range of incident angles we can find the angle of the outgoing ray with respect to the vertical which in fact is the angle subtended at the eye of the observer br Outgoing ray angles in the graphs on the right in the figure below were obtained from the equation at the bottom For a majority of rotation angles the average of outgoing ray angles for red hovers around and is slightly higher for blue br br Angle of rotation br br br br br br br displaystyle alpha br br br br br br br br br sin br br br br br br br br br br n br sin br br br br br br br br br br br br br sin br br br br br br br br br br sin br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br n br br br br br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle theta sin left n sin left frac pi sin frac sin left pi alpha right n right right alpha br br br Another phenomenon resulting in a ring around the Sun or Moon and therefore sometimes confused with the halo is the corona Unlike the halo however it is produced by water droplets instead of ice crystals and is much smaller and more colorful br br br Weather relation br br In folklore moon rings are said to warn of approaching storms Like other ice halos halos appear when the sky is covered by thin cirrus or cirrostratus clouds that often come a few days before a large storm front However the same clouds can also occur without any associated weather change making a halo unreliable as a sign of bad weather br br br See also br halo br Circumzenithal arc br Circumhorizontal arc br Sun dog br Parhelic circle br Moon dog br Moonbow br br br
