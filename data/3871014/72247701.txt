Color reproduction is an aspect of color science concerned with producing light spectra that evoke a desired color either through additive light emitting or subtractive surface color models It converts physical correlates of color perception CIE XYZ color space tristimulus values and related quantities into light spectra that can be experienced by observers In this way it is the opposite of colorimetry br It is concerned with the faithful reproduction of a color in one medium with a color in another so it is a central concept in color management and relies heavily on color calibration For example food packaging must be able to faithfully reproduce the colors of the foods therein in order to appeal to a customer This involves proper color calibration of at least four devices br br Lighting which must have a high color rendering index and not give a color cast to the object br Camera which measures the reflected spectrum of the object and converts to a trichromatic color space e g RGB br Screen which reproduces color so a designer can proof the captured image and make color corrections as necessary br Printer which reproduces the final color on paper br br br br br br Further reading
