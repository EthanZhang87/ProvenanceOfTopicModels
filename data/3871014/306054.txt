The Army National Guard ARNG in conjunction with the Air National Guard is an organized militia force and a federal military reserve force of the United States Army They are simultaneously part of two different organizations the ARNG of each state most territories and the District of Columbia also referred to as the Militia of the United States as well as the federal ARNG as part of the National Guard as a whole It is divided into subordinate units stationed in each state or insular area responsible to their respective governors or other head of government br The Guard s origins are usually traced to the city of Salem Massachusetts in That year a regiment of militia drilled for the first time to defend a multi community area within what is now the United States br br br Activation br The ARNG operates under Title of the United States Code when under federal control and Title of the United States Code and applicable state laws when under state control It may be called up for active duty by the state or territorial governors to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters such as those caused by hurricanes floods and earthquakes as well as civil disorder The District of Columbia Army National Guard is a federal militia controlled by the President of the United States with authority delegated to the Secretary of Defense and through him to the Secretary of the Army br Members or units of the ARNG may be ordered temporarily or indefinitely into United States service If mobilized for federal service the member or unit becomes part of the U S ARNG which is a reserve component of the U S Army Individuals volunteering for active federal service may do so subject to the consent of their governors Largely on the basis of a U S Supreme Court decision governors generally cannot veto involuntary activations of individuals or units for federal service either for training or national emergency br The President may also call up members and units of the ARNG in its status as the militia of the several states to repel invasion suppress rebellion or enforce federal laws The Army National Guard is one of two organizations administered by the National Guard Bureau the other being the Air National Guard The Director of the ARNG is the head of the organization and reports to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau Because the ARNG is both the militia of the several states and a federal reserve component of the Army neither the Chief of the National Guard Bureau nor the Director of the ARNG commands it This operational command authority is performed in each state or territory by the State Adjutant General and in the District of Columbia by the Commanding General of the D C National Guard when a unit is in its militia status While under federal activation the operational command authority is transferred to the commanders of the unified combatant commands who command all U S forces within their area of responsibility The Chief of the National Guard Bureau and the Director of the ARNG serve as the channel of communications between the Department of the Army and the ARNG in each state and territory and administer federal programs policies
