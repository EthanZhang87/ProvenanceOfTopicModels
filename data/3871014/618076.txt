Opticks or A Treatise of the Reflexions Refractions Inflexions and Colours of Light is a book by Isaac Newton that was published in English in a scholarly Latin translation appeared in The book analyzes the fundamental nature of light by means of the refraction of light with prisms and lenses the diffraction of light by closely spaced sheets of glass and the behaviour of color mixtures with spectral lights or pigment powders Opticks was Newton s second major book on physical science and it is considered one of the three major works on optics during the Scientific Revolution alongside Kepler s Astronomiae Pars Optica and Huygens Trait de la Lumi re Newton s name did not appear on the title page of the first edition of Opticks br br br Overview br The publication of Opticks represented a major contribution to science different from but in some ways rivalling the Principia yet Isaac Newton s name did not appear on the cover page of the first edition Opticks is largely a record of experiments and the deductions made from them covering a wide range of topics in what was later to be known as physical optics That is this work is not a geometric discussion of catoptrics or dioptrics the traditional subjects of reflection of light by mirrors of different shapes and the exploration of how light is bent as it passes from one medium such as air into another such as water or glass Rather the Opticks is a study of the nature of light and colour and the various phenomena of diffraction which Newton called the inflexion of light br In this book Newton sets forth in full his experiments first reported to the Royal Society of London in on dispersion or the separation of light into a spectrum of its component colours He demonstrates how the appearance of color arises from selective absorption reflection or transmission of the various component parts of the incident light br The major significance of Newton s work is that it overturned the dogma attributed to Aristotle or Theophrastus and accepted by scholars in Newton s time that pure light such as the light attributed to the Sun is fundamentally white or colourless and is altered into color by mixture with darkness caused by interactions with matter Newton showed just the opposite was true light is composed of different spectral hues he describes seven red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet and all colours including white are formed by various mixtures of these hues He demonstrates that color arises from a physical property of light each hue is refracted at a characteristic angle by a prism or lens but he clearly states that color is a sensation within the mind and not an inherent property of material objects or of light itself For example he demonstrates that a red violet magenta color can be mixed by overlapping the red and violet ends of two spectra although this color does not appear in the spectrum and therefore is not a color of light By connecting the red and violet ends of the spectrum he organised all colours as a color circle that both quantitatively predicts color mixtures and qualitatively describes the perceived similarity among hues br Newton s contribution to prismatic dispersion was the first to outline multiple prism arrays Multiple prism configurations as beam expanders became central to the design of the tunable laser more than years later and set the stage for the development of the multiple prism dispersion theory br br br Opticks and the Principia br br Opticks differs in many respects from the Principia It was first published in English rather than in the Latin used by European philosophers contributing to the development of a vernacular science literature The book is a model of popular science exposition although Newton s English is somewhat dated he shows a fondness for lengthy sentences with much embedded qualifications the book can still be easily understood by a modern reader In contrast few readers of Newton s time found the Principia accessible or even comprehensible His formal but flexible style shows colloquialisms and metaphorical word choice br Unlike the Principia Opticks is not developed using the geometric convention of propositions proved by deduction from either previous propositions lemmas or first principles or axioms Instead axioms define the meaning of technical terms or fundamental properties of matter and light and the stated propositions are demonstrated by means of specific carefully described experiments The first sentence of the book declares My Design in this Book is not to explain the Properties of Light by Hypotheses but to propose and prove them by Reason and Experiments In an Experimentum crucis or critical experiment Book I Part II Theorem ii Newton showed that the color of light corresponded to its degree of refrangibility angle of refraction and that this angle cannot be changed by additional reflection or refraction or by passing the light through a coloured filter br The work is a vade mecum of the experimenter s art displaying in many examples how to use observation to propose factual generalisations about the physical world and then exclude competing explanations by specific experimental tests Unlike the Principia which vowed Non fingo hypotheses or I make no hypotheses outside the deductive method the Opticks develops conjectures about light that go beyond the experimental evidence for example that the physical behaviour of light was due its corpuscular nature as small particles or that perceived colours were harmonically proportioned like the tones of a diatonic musical scale br br br Queries br br Opticks concludes with a set of Queries In the first edition these were sixteen such Queries that number was increased in the Latin edition published in and then in the revised English edition published in The first set of Queries were brief but the later ones became short essays filling many pages In the fourth edition of there were Queries and it was the famous st Query that over the next two hundred years stimulated a great deal of speculation and development on theories of chemical affinity br These Queries especially the later ones deal with a wide range of physical phenomena far transcending any narrow interpretation of the subject matter of optics They concern the nature and transmission of heat the possible cause of gravity electrical phenomena the nature of chemical action the way in which God created matter in the Beginning the proper way to do science and even the ethical conduct of human beings These Queries are not really questions in the ordinary sense They are almost all posed in the negative as rhetorical questions That is Newton does not ask whether light is or may be a body Rather he asks Is not Light a Body Not only does this form indicate that Newton had an answer but that it may go on for many pages Clearly as Stephen Hales a firm Newtonian of the early eighteenth century declared this was Newton s mode of explaining by Query br br br Reception br The Opticks was widely read and debated in England and on the Continent The early presentation of the work to the Royal Society stimulated a bitter dispute between Newton and Robert Hooke over the corpuscular or particle theory of light which prompted Newton to postpone publication of the work until after Hooke s death in On the Continent and in France in particular both the Principia and the Opticks were initially rejected by many natural philosophers who continued to defend Cartesian natural philosophy and the Aristotelian version of color and claimed to find Newton s prism experiments difficult to replicate Indeed the Aristotelian theory of the fundamental nature of white light was defended into the th century for example by the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in his Zur Farbenlehre Theory of Colours br Newtonian science became a central issue in the assault waged by the philosophes in the Age of Enlightenment against a natural philosophy based on the authority of ancient Greek or Roman naturalists or on deductive reasoning from first principles the method advocated by French philosopher Ren Descartes rather than on the application of mathematical reasoning to experience or experiment Voltaire popularised Newtonian science including the content of both the Principia and the Opticks in his Elements de la philosophie de Newton and after about the combination of the experimental methods exemplified by the Opticks and the mathematical methods exemplified by the Principia were established as a unified and comprehensive model of Newtonian science Some of the primary adepts in this new philosophy were such prominent figures as Benjamin Franklin Antoine Laurent Lavoisier and James Black br Subsequent to Newton much has been amended Thomas Young and Augustin Jean Fresnel showed that the wave theory Christiaan Huygens described in his Treatise on Light could prove that colour is the visible manifestation of light s wavelength Science also slowly came to recognize the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics The German poet Goethe with his epic diatribe Theory of Colours could not shake the Newtonian foundation but one hole Goethe did find in Newton s armour Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible He therefore thought that the object glasses of telescopes must for ever remain imperfect achromatism and refraction being incompatible This inference was proved by br Dollond to be wrong
