completed an undergraduate philosophy thesis at Reed College on Wittgenstein who she said cured her of studying philosophy br After school she served as a social worker in Portland for several years returning later to Harvard to study clinical psychology at the then Department of Social Relations Rosch delivered a paradigm changing doctoral thesis at Harvard about category formation under the direction of Roger Brown After a short stint at Brown University and Connecticut College Rosch joined the Department of Psychology at University of California Berkeley in br br br Research br From field experiments Rosch conducted alongside her then husband Karl Heider in the s with the Dani people of Papua New Guinea she concluded that when categorizing an everyday object or experience people rely less on abstract definitions of categories than on a comparison of the given object or experience with what they deem to be the object or experience best representing a category prototype br Although the Dani lack words for all the English colors their language contained only two color terms dividing all colors into either the light bright category or the dark cool category Rosch showed that they could still categorize objects by colors for which they had no words She argued that basic objects have a psychological import that transcends cultural differences and shapes how such objects are mentally represented She concluded that people in different cultures tend to categorize objects by using prototypes although the prototypes of particular categories may vary br Rosch contributed to multiple scholarly works of taxonomic analysis of objects based on these prototype chair and subordinate terms tall black leather chair She inferred that overuse of subordinate terms could be attributed to the attitude of snobbery and elitism br Her work has been often referenced by that of computer vision and deep learning researcher Aude Oliva who has built upon Rosch s object classifications to teach computers to recognize basic scenes instantly interpreted by humans br br br Publications br br br Books br with Lloyd B eds Cognition and Categorization Hillsdale NJ Lawrence
