In color theory hue is one of the main properties called color appearance parameters of a color defined technically in the CIECAM model as the degree to which a stimulus can be described as similar to or different from stimuli that are described as red orange yellow green blue violet within certain theories of color vision br Hue can typically be represented quantitatively by a single number often corresponding to an angular position around a central or neutral point or axis on a color space coordinate diagram such as a chromaticity diagram or color wheel or by its dominant wavelength or by that of its complementary color The other color appearance parameters are colorfulness saturation also known as intensity or chroma lightness and brightness Usually colors with the same hue are distinguished with adjectives referring to their lightness or colorfulness for example light blue pastel blue vivid blue and cobalt blue Exceptions include brown which is a dark orange br In painting a hue is a pure pigment one without tint or shade added white or black pigment respectively br The human brain first processes hues in areas in the extended V called globs br br br Deriving a hue br The concept of a color system with a hue was explored as early as with Philipp Otto Runge s color sphere The Munsell color system from the s was a great step forward as it was realized that perceptual uniformity means the color space can no longer be a sphere br As a convention the hue for red is set to for most color spaces with a hue br br br Opponent color spaces br In opponent color spaces in which two of the axes are perceptually orthogonal to lightness such as the CIE L a b CIELAB and L u v CIELUV color spaces hue may be computed together with chroma by converting these coordinates from rectangular form to polar form Hue is the angular component of the polar representation while chroma is the radial component br Specifically in CIELAB br br br br br br h br br a br b br br br br br a

plot which he termed a color circle Using R G and B one may compute hue angle using the following scheme determine which of the six possible orderings of R G and B prevail then apply the formula given

highest of R G and B L is the lowest and M is the mid one between the other two This is referred to as the Preucil hue error and was used in the computation of mask strength in photomechanical color reproduction br Hue angles computed for the Preucil circle agree with the hue angle computed for the Preucil hexagon at integer multiples of red yellow green cyan blue magenta and the colors midway between contiguous pairs and differ by approximately at odd integer multiples of based on the circle formula the maximal divergence between the two br The process of converting an RGB color into an HSL color space or HSV color space is usually based on a piece piecewise mapping treating the HSV cone as a hexacone or the HSL double cone as a double hexacone The formulae used are those in the table above br br Additional images for hue in the HSL and HSV systems br br br br br br br br br br br br br br One might notice that the HSL HSV hue circle do not appear to all be of the same brightness This is a known issue of this RGB based derivation of hue br br br Usage in art br Manufacturers of pigments use the word hue for example cadmium yellow hue to indicate that the original pigmentation ingredient often toxic has been replaced by safer or cheaper alternatives whilst retaining the hue of the original Replacements are often used for chromium cadmium and alizarin br br br Hue vs dominant wavelength br Dominant wavelength or sometimes equivalent wavelength is a physical analog to the perceptual attribute hue On a chromaticity diagram a line is drawn from a white point through the coordinates of the color in question until it intersects the spectral locus The wavelength at which the line intersects the spectrum locus is identified as the color s dominant wavelength if the point is on the same side of the white point as the spectral locus and as the color s complementary wavelength if the point is on the opposite side br br br Hue difference notation br There are two main ways in which hue difference is quantified The first is the simple difference between the two hue angles The symbol for this expression of hue difference is br br br br br br h br br a br b

color terms names One approach in color science is to use traditional color terms but try to give them more precise definitions See spectral color Spectral color terms for names of highly saturated colors with the hue from red up to violet and line of purples Table of highly saturated purple colors for color terms of the remaining part of the color wheel br Alternative approach is to use a systematic notation It can be a standard angle notation for certain color model such as HSL HSV mentioned above CIELUV or CIECAM Alphanumeric notations such as of Munsell color system NCS and Pantone
