Fulling also known as tucking or walking Scots waukin hence often spelled waulking in Scottish English is a step in woollen clothmaking which involves the cleansing of woven cloth particularly wool to eliminate lanolin oils dirt and other impurities and to make it shrink by friction and pressure The work delivers a smooth tightly finished fabric that is insulating and water repellent Well known examples are duffel cloth first produced in Flanders in the th century and loden produced in Austria from the th century on br Waulking could be done with the hands and feet In medieval Europe it was done in water powered fulling mills After the Industrial Revolution coal and electric power were used br Felting refers more generally to the interlocking of loose wool fibers they need not be spun and woven first br br br Process br Fulling involves two processes scouring cleaning and milling thickening Removing the oils encourages felting and the cloth is pounded to clean it and to encourage the fibers to felt so in practice the processes overlap br br br Scouring br br Urine was so important to the fulling business that it was taxed in Ancient Rome Stale urine known as wash or lant was a source of ammonium salts and assisted in cleansing and whitening the cloth and having its fibers intertwined br By the medieval period fuller s earth had been introduced for use in the process This is a soft clay like material occurring naturally as an impure hydrous aluminium silicate Worked through the cloth it absorbs oils and dirt It was used in conjunction with wash More recently soap has been used br br br Milling br The second function of fulling was to thicken cloth by matting the fibres together to give it strength and increase waterproofing felting This was vital in the case of woollens made from carded wool but not for worsted materials made from combed wool After this stage water was used to rinse out the foul smelling liquor used during cleansing Felting of wool occurs upon hammering or other mechanical agitation because the microscopic scales on the surface of wool fibres hook together somewhat like hook and loop fixings br br br Manual methods br br Originally fulling was carried out by the pounding of the woollen cloth with a club or the fuller s feet or hands br In Roman times fulling was conducted by slaves working the cloth while ankle deep in tubs of human urine br There are several Biblical references to fulling Kings Isaiah and Malachi Mark In addition to this at least one reference appears in the speeches of Lysias written in Athens during the th century BC br Scotland then a rather remote and un industrialized region retained manual methods into the s In Scottish Gaelic tradition this process was accompanied by waulking songs which women sang to set the pace br br br Mills br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br From the medieval period the fulling of cloth was often done in a water mill known as a fulling mill a walk mill or a tuck mill and in Wales a pandy They appear to have originated in th or th century in Europe The earliest known reference to a fulling mill in France which dates from about was discovered in Normandy There was a fulling mill established at Temple Guiting Gloucestershire which was documented in the Domesday Book also By the time of the Crusades in the late eleventh century fulling mills were active throughout the medieval world br The mills beat the cloth with wooden hammers known as fulling stocks or fulling hammers Fulling stocks were of two kinds falling stocks operating vertically that were used only for scouring and driving or hanging stocks In both cases the machinery was operated by cams on the shaft of a waterwheel or on a tappet wheel which lifted the hammer br Driving stocks were pivoted so that the foot the head of the hammer struck the cloth almost horizontally The stock had a tub holding the liquor and cloth This was somewhat rounded on the side away from the hammer so that the cloth gradually turned ensuring that all parts of it were milled evenly However the cloth was taken out about every two hours to undo plaits and wrinkles The foot was approximately triangular in shape with notches to assist the turning of the cloth br br br Post processing br br After fulling cloth was stretched on great frames known as tenters to which it is attached by tenterhooks whence the phrase being on tenterhooks The area where the tenters were erected was known as a tenterground br Cloth would also have the nap raised by napping or gigging The surface would then be sheared smooth The process might be repeated for a smoother finish br br br Legacy br The names for workers who performed these tasks fuller tucker and walker have become common surnames br The Welsh word for a fulling mill is pandy which appears in many place names for example Tonypandy fulling mill lea br br br See also br Beetling br Bleachfield br Dadeumi a similar
