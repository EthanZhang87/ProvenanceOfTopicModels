title: Color blindness
id: 7397
Color blindness or color vision deficiency CVD is the decreased ability to see color or differences in color The severity of color blindness ranges from mostly unnoticeable to full absence of color perception Color blindness is usually an inherited problem or variation in the functionality of one or more of the three classes of cone cells in the retina which mediate color vision The most common form is caused by a genetic condition called congenital red green color blindness including protan and deutan types which affects up to in males and in females The condition is more prevalent in males because the opsin genes responsible are located on the X chromosome Rarer genetic conditions causing color blindness include congenital blue yellow color blindness tritan type blue cone monochromacy and achromatopsia Color blindness can also result from physical or chemical damage to the eye the optic nerve parts of the brain or from medication toxicity Color vision also naturally degrades in old age br Diagnosis of color blindness is usually done with a color vision test such as the Ishihara test There is no cure for most causes of color blindness however there is ongoing research into gene therapy for some severe conditions causing color blindness Minor forms of color blindness do not significantly affect daily life and the color blind automatically develop adaptations and coping mechanisms to compensate for the deficiency However diagnosis may allow an individual or their parents teachers to actively accommodate the condition Color blind glasses e g EnChroma may help the red green color blind at some color tasks but they do not grant the wearer normal color vision or the ability to see new colors Some mobile apps can use a device s camera to identify colors br Depending on the jurisdiction the color blind are ineligible for certain careers such as aircraft pilots train drivers police officers firefighters and members of the armed forces The effect of color blindness on artistic ability is controversial but a number of famous artists are believed to have been color blind br br br Effects br A color blind person will have decreased or no color discrimination along the red green axis blue yellow axis or both However the vast majority of the color blind are only affected on their red green axis br The first indication of color blindness generally consists of a person using the wrong color for an object such as when painting or calling a color by the wrong name The colors that are confused are very consistent among people with the same type of color blindness br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Confusion colors br br Confusion colors are pairs or groups of colors that will often be mistaken by the color blind Confusion colors for red green color blindness include br br cyan and grey br rose pink and grey br blue and purple br yellow and neon green br red green orange brown br Confusion colors for tritan include br br yellow and grey br blue and green br dark blue violet and black br violet and yellow green br red and rose pink br These colors of confusion are defined quantitatively by straight confusion lines plotted in CIEXYZ usually plotted on the corresponding chromaticity diagram The lines all intersect at a copunctal point which varies with the type of color blindness Chromaticities along a confusion line will appear metameric to dichromats of that type Anomalous trichromats of that type will see the chromaticities as metameric if they are close enough depending on the strength of their CVD For two colors on a confusion line to be metameric the chromaticities first have to be made isoluminant meaning equal in lightness Also colors that may be isoluminant to the standard observer may not be isoluminant to a person with dichromacy br br br Color tasks br br Cole describes four color tasks all of which are impeded to some degree by color blindness br br Comparative When multiple colors must be compared such as with mixing paint br Connotative When colors are given an implicit meaning such as red stop br Denotative When identifying colors for example by name such as where is the yellow ball br Aesthetic When colors look nice or convey an emotional response but do not carry explicit meaning br The following sections describe specific color tasks with which the color blind typically have difficulty br br br Food br br Color blindness causes difficulty with the connotative color tasks associated with selecting or preparing food Selecting food for ripeness can be difficult the green yellow transition of bananas is particularly hard to identify It can also be difficult to detect bruises mold or rot on some foods to determine when meat is done by color to distinguish some varietals such as a Braeburn vs a Granny Smith apple or to distinguish colors associated with artificial flavors e g jelly beans sports drinks br br br Skin color br br Changes in skin color due to bruising sunburn rashes or even blushing are easily missed by the red green color blind br br br Traffic lights br br The colors of traffic lights can be difficult for the red green color blindness This difficulty includes distinguishing red amber lights from sodium street lamps distinguishing green lights closer to cyan from normal white lights and distinguishing red from amber lights especially when there are no positional clues available see image br br The main coping mechanism to overcome these challenges is to memorize the position of lights The order of the common triplet traffic light is standardized as red amber green from top to bottom or left to right Cases that deviate from this standard are rare One such case is a traffic light in Tipperary Hill in Syracuse New York which is upside down green amber red top to bottom due to the sentiments of its Irish American community However the light has been criticized due to the potential hazard it poses for color blind drivers br br There are other several features of traffic lights available that help accommodate the color blind British Rail signals use more easily identifiable colors The red is blood red the amber is yellow and the green is a bluish color Most British road traffic lights are mounted vertically on a black rectangle with a white border forming a sighting board so that drivers can more easily look for the position of the light In the eastern provinces of Canada traffic lights are sometimes differentiated by shape in addition to color square for red diamond for yellow and circle for green see image br br br Signal lights br br Navigation lights in marine and aviation settings employ red and green lights to signal the relative position of other ships or aircraft Railway signal lights also rely heavily on red green yellow colors In both cases these color combinations can be difficult for the red green color blind Lantern Tests are a common means of simulating these light sources to determine not necessarily whether someone is color blind but whether they can functionally distinguish these specific signal colors Those who cannot pass this test are generally completely restricted from working on aircraft ships or rail for example br br br Fashion br br Color analysis is the analysis of color in its use in fashion to determine personal color combinations that are most aesthetically pleasing Colors to combine can include clothing accessories makeup hair color skin color eye color etc Color analysis involves many aesthetic and comparative color task that can be difficult for the color blind br br br Art br Inability to distinguish color does not necessarily preclude the ability to become a celebrated artist The th century expressionist painter Clifton Pugh three time winner of Australia s Archibald Prize on biographical gene inheritance and other grounds has been identified as a person with protanopia th century French artist Charles M ryon became successful by concentrating on etching rather than painting after he was diagnosed as having a red green deficiency Jin Kim s red green color blindness did not stop him from becoming first an animator and later a character designer with Walt Disney Animation Studios br br br Advantages br Deuteranomals are better at distinguishing shades of khaki which may be advantageous when looking for predators food or camouflaged objects hidden among foliage Dichromats tend to learn to use texture and shape clues and so may be able to penetrate camouflage that has been designed to deceive individuals with normal color vision br Some tentative evidence finds that the color blind are better at penetrating certain color camouflages Such findings may give an evolutionary reason for the high rate of red green color blindness There is also a study suggesting that people with some types of color blindness can distinguish colors that people with normal color vision are not able to distinguish In World War II color blind observers were used to penetrate camouflage br In the presence of chromatic noise the color blind are more capable of seeing a luminous signal as long as the chromatic noise appears metameric to them This is the effect behind most reverse Pseudoisochromatic plates e g hidden digit Ishihara plates that are discernible to the color blind but unreadable to people with typical color vision br br br Digital design br br Color codes are useful tools for designers to convey information The interpretation of this information requires users to perform a variety of Color Tasks usually comparative but also sometimes connotative or denotative However these tasks are often problematic for the color blind when design of the color code has not followed best practices for accessibility For example one of the most ubiquitous connotative color codes is the red means bad and green means good or similar systems based on the classic signal light colors However this color coding will almost always be undifferentiable to deutans or protans and therefore should be avoided or supplemented with a parallel connotative system symbols smileys etc br Good practices to ensure design is accessible to the color blind include br br When possible e g in simple video games or apps allowing the user to choose their own colors is the most inclusive design practice br Using other signals that are parallel to the color coding such as patterns shapes size or order This not only helps the color blind but also aids understanding by normally sighted people by providing them with multiple reinforcing cues br Using brightness contrast different shades in addition to color contrast different hues br To achieve good contrast conventional wisdom suggests converting a digital design to grayscale to ensure there is sufficient brightness contrast between colors However this does not account for the different perceptions of brightness to different varieties of color blindness especially protan CVD tritan CVD and monochromacy br Viewing the design through a CVD Simulator to ensure the information carried by color is still sufficiently conveyed At a minimum the design should be tested for deutan CVD the most common kind of color blindness br Maximizing the area of colors e g increase size thickness or boldness of colored element makes the color easier to identify Color contrast improves as the angle the color subtends on the retina increases This applies to all types of color vision br Maximizing brightness value and saturation chroma of the colors to maximize color contrast br Converting connotative tasks to comparative tasks by including a legend even when the meaning is considered obvious e g red means danger br Avoiding denotative color tasks color naming when possible Some denotative tasks can be converted to comparative tasks by depicting the actual color whenever the color name is mentioned for example colored typography in purple purple or purple br For denotative tasks color naming using the most common shades of colors For example green and yellow are colors of confusion in red green CVD but it is not common to mix forest green with bright yellow Mistakes by the color blind increase drastically when uncommon shades are used e g neon green with dark yellow br For denotative tasks using colors that are classically associated with a color name For example use firetruck red instead of burgundy to represent the word red br br br Unordered Information br br A common task for designers is to select a subset of colors qualitative colormap that are as mutually differentiable as possible salient For example player pieces in a board game should be as different as possible br Classic advice suggests using Brewer palettes but several of these are not actually accessible to the color blind br Unfortunately the colors with the greatest contrast to the red green color blind tend to be colors of confusion to the blue yellow color blind and vice versa However since red green is much more prevalent than blue yellow CVD design should generally prioritize those users deutans then protans br br br Ordered Information br br A common task for data visualization is to represent a color scale or sequential colormap often in the form of a heat map or choropleth Several scales are designed with special consideration for the color blind and are widespread in academia including Cividis Viridis and Parula These comprise a light to dark scale superimposed on a yellow to blue scale making them monotonic and perceptually uniform to all forms of color vision br br br Classification br br Much terminology has existed and does exist for the classification of color blindness but the typical classification for color blindness follows the von Kries classifications which uses severity and affected cone for naming br br br Based on severity br Based on clinical appearance color blindness may be described as total or partial Total color blindness monochromacy is much less common than partial color blindness Partial color blindness includes dichromacy and anomalous trichromacy but is often clinically defined as mild moderate or strong br br br Monochromacy br br Monochromacy is often called total color blindness since there is no ability to see color Although the term may refer to acquired disorders such as cerebral achromatopsia it typically refers to congenital color vision disorders namely rod monochromacy and blue cone monochromacy br In cerebral achromatopsia a person cannot perceive colors even though the eyes are capable of distinguishing them Some sources do not consider these to be true color blindness because the failure is of perception not of vision They are forms of visual agnosia br Monochromacy is the condition of possessing only a single channel for conveying information about color Monochromats are unable to distinguish any colors and perceive only variations in brightness Congenital monochromacy occurs in two primary forms br br Rod monochromacy frequently called complete achromatopsia where the retina contains no cone cells so that in addition to the absence of color discrimination vision in lights of normal intensity is difficult br Cone monochromacy is the condition of having only a single class of cone A cone monochromat can have good pattern vision at normal daylight levels but will not be able to distinguish hues Cone monochromacy is divided into classes defined by the single remaining cone class However red and green cone monochromats have not been definitively described in the literature Blue cone monochromacy is caused by lack of functionality of L red and M green cones and is therefore mediated by the same genes as red green color blindness on the X chromosome Peak spectral sensitivities are in the blue region of the visible spectrum near nm People with this condition generally show nystagmus jiggling eyes photophobia light sensitivity reduced visual acuity and myopia nearsightedness Visual acuity usually falls to the to range br br br Dichromacy br br Dichromats can match any color they see with some mixture of just two primary colors in contrast to those with normal sight trichromats who can distinguish three primary colors Dichromats usually know they have a color vision problem and it can affect their daily lives Dichromacy in humans includes protanopia deuteranopia and tritanopia Out of the male population have severe difficulties distinguishing between red orange yellow and green orange and yellow are different combinations of red and green light Colors in this range which appear very different to a normal viewer appear to a dichromat to be the same or a similar color The terms protanopia deuteranopia and tritanopia come from Greek and respectively mean inability to see anopia with the first prot second deuter or third trit cone br br br Anomalous trichromacy br Anomalous trichromacy is the mildest type of color deficiency but the severity ranges from almost dichromacy strong to almost normal trichromacy mild In fact many mild anomalous trichromats have very little difficulty carrying out tasks that require normal color vision and some may not even be aware that they have a color vision deficiency The types of anomalous trichromacy include protanomaly deuteranomaly and tritanomaly It is approximately three times more common than dichromacy Anomalous trichromats exhibit trichromacy but the color matches they make differ from normal trichromats In order to match a given spectral yellow light protanomalous observers need more red light in a red green mixture than a normal observer and deuteranomalous observers need more green This difference can be measured by an instrument called an Anomaloscope where red and green lights are mixed by a subject to match a yellow light br br br Based on affected cone br There are two major types of color blindness difficulty distinguishing between red and green and difficulty distinguishing between blue and yellow These definitions are based on the phenotype of the partial color blindness Clinically it is more common to use a genotypical definition which describes which cone opsin is affected br br br Red green color blindness br Red green color blindness includes protan and deutan CVD Protan CVD is related to the L cone and includes protanomaly anomalous trichromacy and protanopia dichromacy Deutan CVD is related to the M cone and includes deuteranomaly anomalous trichromacy and deuteranopia dichromacy The phenotype visual experience of deutans and protans is quite similar Common colors of confusion include red brown green yellow as well as blue purple Both forms are almost always symptomatic of congenital red green color blindness so affects males disproportionately more than females This form of color blindness is sometimes referred to as daltonism after John Dalton who had red green dichromacy In some languages daltonism is still used to describe red green color blindness br br Protan of males Lacking or possessing anomalous L opsins for long wavelength sensitive cone cells Protans have a neutral point at a cyan like wavelength around nm see spectral color for comparison that is they cannot discriminate light of this wavelength from white For a protanope the brightness of red is much reduced compared to normal This dimming can be so pronounced that reds may be confused with black or dark gray and red traffic lights may appear to be extinguished They may learn to distinguish reds from yellows primarily on the basis of their apparent brightness or lightness not on any perceptible hue difference Violet lavender and purple are indistinguishable from various shades of blue A very few people have been found who have one normal eye and one protanopic eye These unilateral dichromats report that with only their protanopic eye open they see wavelengths shorter than neutral point as blue and those longer than it as yellow br br Deutan of males Lacking or possessing anomalous M opsins for medium wavelength sensitive cone cells Their neutral point is at a slightly longer wavelength nm a more greenish hue of cyan Deutans have the same hue discrimination problems as protans but without the dimming of long wavelengths Deuteranopic unilateral dichromats report that with only their deuteranopic eye open they see wavelengths shorter than neutral point as blue and longer than it as yellow br br br Blue yellow color blindness br Blue yellow color blindness includes tritan CVD Tritan CVD is related to the S cone and includes tritanomaly anomalous trichromacy and tritanopia dichromacy Blue yellow color blindness is much less common than red green color blindness and more often has acquired causes than genetic Tritans have difficulty discerning between bluish and greenish hues Tritans have a neutral point at nm yellowish br br Tritan of individuals Lacking or possessing anomalous S opsins or short wavelength sensitive cone cells Tritans see short wavelength colors blue indigo and spectral violet as greenish and drastically dimmed some of these colors even as black Yellow and orange are indistinguishable from white and pink respectively and purple colors are perceived as various shades of red Unlike protans and deutans the mutation for this color blindness is carried on chromosome Therefore it is not sex linked equally prevalent in both males and females The OMIM gene code for this mutation is Colorblindness Partial Tritanomaly br br Tetartan is the fourth type of color blindness and a type of blue yellow color blindness However its existence is hypothetical and given the molecular basis of human color vision it is unlikely this type could exist br br br Summary of cone complements br The below table shows the cone complements for different types of human color vision including those considered color blindness normal color vision and superior color vision The cone complement contains the types of cones or their opsins expressed by an individual br br br Causes br br Color blindness is any deviation of color vision from normal trichromatic color vision often as defined by the standard observer that produces a reduced gamut Mechanisms for color blindness are related to the functionality of cone cells and often to the expression of photopsins the photopigments that catch photons and thereby convert light into chemical signals br Color vision deficiencies can be classified as inherited or acquired br br Inherited inherited or congenital genetic color vision deficiencies are most commonly caused by mutations of the genes encoding opsin proteins However several other genes can also lead to less common and or more severe forms of color blindness br Acquired color blindness that is not present at birth may be caused by chronic illness accidents medication chemical exposure or simply normal aging processes br br br Genetics br br Color blindness is typically an inherited genetic disorder The most common forms of color blindness are associated with the Photopsin genes but the mapping of the human genome has shown there are many causative mutations that do not directly affect the opsins Mutations capable of causing color blindness originate from at least different chromosomes and different genes as shown online at the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man OMIM br br br Genetics of red green color blindness br br By far the most common form of color blindness is congenital red green color blindness Daltonism which includes protanopia protanomaly and deuteranopia deuteranomaly These conditions are mediated by the OPN LW and OPN MW genes respectively both on the X chromosome An affected gene is either missing as in Protanopia and Deuteranopia Dichromacy or is a chimeric gene as in Protanomaly and Deuteranomaly br Since the OPN LW and OPN MW genes are on the X chromosome they are sex linked and therefore affect males and females disproportionately Because the color blind affected alleles are recessive color blindness specifically follows X linked recessive inheritance Males have only one X chromosome XY and females have two XX Because the male only has one of each gene if it is affected the male will be color blind Because a female has two alleles of each gene one on each chromosome if only one gene is affected the dominant normal alleles will override the affected recessive allele and the female will have normal color vision However if the female has two mutated alleles she will still be color blind This is why there is a disproportionate prevalence of color blindness with of males exhibiting color blindness and of females br br br Genetics of blue yellow color blindness br Congenital blue yellow color blindness is a much rarer form of color blindness including tritanopia tritanomaly These conditions are mediated by the OPN SW gene on Chromosome which encodes the S opsin protein and follows autosomal dominant inheritance The cause of blue yellow color blindness is not analogous to the cause of red green color blindness i e the peak sensitivity of the S opsin does not shift to longer wavelengths Rather there are known point mutations of OPN SW that degrade the performance of the S cones The OPN SW gene is almost invariant in the human population Congenital tritan defects are often progressive with nearly normal trichromatic vision in childhood e g mild tritanomaly progressing to dichromacy tritanopia as the S cones slowly die Tritanomaly and tritanopia are therefore different penetrance of the same disease and some sources have argued that tritanomaly therefore be referred to as incomplete tritanopia br br br Other genetic causes br Several inherited diseases are known to cause color blindness including achromatopsia cone dystrophy Leber s congenital amaurosis and retinitis pigmentosa These can be congenital or commence in childhood or adulthood They can be static stationary or progressive Progressive diseases often involve deterioration of the retina and other parts of the eye so often progress from color blindness to more severe visual impairments up to and including total blindness br br br Non genetic causes br Physical trauma can cause color blindness either neurologically brain trauma which produces swelling of the brain in the occipital lobe or retinally either acute e g from laser exposure or chronic e g from ultraviolet light exposure br Color blindness may also present itself as a symptom of degenerative diseases of the eye such as cataract and age related macular degeneration and as part of the retinal damage caused by diabetes Vitamin A deficiency may also cause color blindness br Color blindness may be a side effect of prescription drug use For example red green color blindness can be caused by ethambutol a drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis Blue yellow color blindness can be caused by sildenafil an active component of Viagra Hydroxychloroquine can also lead to hydroxychloroquine retinopathy which includes various color defects Exposure to chemicals such as styrene or organic solvents can also lead to color vision defects br Simple colored filters can also create mild color vision deficiencies John Dalton s original hypothesis for his deuteranopia was actually that the vitreous humor of his eye was discolored br br I was led to conjecture that one of the humours of my eye must be a transparent but coloured medium so constituted as to absorb red and green rays principally I suppose it must be the vitreous humor br An autopsy of his eye after his death in showed this to be definitively untrue though other filters are possible Actual physiological examples usually affect the blue yellow opponent channel and are named Cyanopsia and Xanthopsia and are most typically an effect of yellowing or removal of the lens br The opponent channels can also be affected by the prevalence of certain cones in the retinal mosaic The cones are not equally prevalent and not evenly distributed in the retina When the number of one of these cone types is significantly reduced this can also lead to or contribute to a color vision deficiency This is one of the causes of tritanomaly br Some people are also unable to distinct between blue and green which appears to be a combination of culture and exposure to UV light br br br Diagnosis br br br Color vision test br br The main method for diagnosing a color vision deficiency is in testing the color vision directly The Ishihara color test is the test most often used to detect red green deficiencies and most often recognized by the public Some tests are clinical in nature designed to be fast simple and effective at identifying broad categories of color blindness Others focus on precision and are generally available only in academic settings br br Pseudoisochromatic plates a classification which includes the Ishihara color test and HRR test embed a figure in the plate as a number of spots surrounded by spots of a slightly different color These colors must appear identical metameric to the color blind but distinguishable to color normals Pseudoisochromatic plates are used as screening tools because they are cheap fast and simple but they do not provide precise diagnosis of CVD br Lanterns such as the Farnsworth Lantern Test project small colored lights to a subject who is required to identify the color of the lights The colors are those of typical signal lights i e red green and yellow which also happen to be colors of confusion of red green CVD Lanterns do not diagnose color blindness but they are occupational screening tests to ensure an applicant has sufficient color discrimination to be able to perform a job br br Arrangement tests can be used as screening or diagnostic tools The Farnsworth Munsell hue test is very sensitive but the Farnsworth D is a simplified version used specifically for screening for CVD In either case the subject is asked to arrange a set of colored caps or chips to form a gradual transition of color between two anchor caps br Anomaloscopes are typically designed to detect red green deficiencies and are based on the Rayleigh match which compares a mixture of red and green light in variable proportions to a fixed spectral yellow of variable luminosity The subject must change the two variables until the colors appear to match They are expensive and require expertise to administer so they are generally only used in academic settings br br br Genetic testing br While genetic testing cannot directly evaluate a subject s color vision phenotype most congenital color vision deficiencies are well correlated with genotype Therefore the genotype can be directly evaluated and used to predict the phenotype This is especially useful for progressive forms that do not have a strongly color deficient phenotype at a young age However it can also be used to sequence the L and M Opsins on the X chromosome since the most common alleles of these two genes are known and have even been related to exact spectral sensitivities and peak wavelengths A subject s color vision can therefore be classified through genetic testing but this is just a prediction of the phenotype since color vision can be affected by countless non genetic factors such as your cone mosaic br br br Management br Despite much recent improvement in gene therapy for color blindness there is currently no FDA approved treatment for any form of CVD and otherwise no cure for CVD currently exists Management of the condition by using lenses to alleviate symptoms or smartphone apps to aid with daily tasks is possible br br br Lenses br br There are three kinds of lenses that an individual can wear that can increase their accuracy in some color related tasks although none of these will fix color blindness or grant the wearer normal color vision br br A red tint contact lens worn over the non dominant eye will leverage binocular disparity to improve discrimination of some colors However it can make other colors more difficult to distinguish A review of various studies to evaluate the effect of the X chrom one brand contact lens concluded that while the lens may allow the wearer to achieve a better score on certain color vision tests it did not correct color vision in the natural environment A case history using the X Chrom lens for a rod monochromat is reported and an X Chrom manual is online br Tinted glasses e g Pilestone Colorlite glasses apply a tint e g magenta to incoming light that can distort colors in a way that makes some color tasks easier to complete These glasses can circumvent many color vision tests though this is typically not allowed br Glasses with a notch filter e g EnChroma glasses filter a narrow band of light that excites both the L and M cones yellow green wavelengths When combined with an additional stopband in the short wavelength blue region these lenses may constitute a neutral density filter have no color tint They improve on the other lens types by causing less distortion of colors and will essentially increase the saturation of some colors They will only work on trichromats anomalous or normal and unlike the other types do not have a significant effect on Dichromats The glasses do not significantly increase one s ability on color blind tests br br br Aids br Many mobile and computer applications have been developed to aid color blind individuals in completing color tasks br br Some applications e g color pickers can identify the name or coordinates within a color space of a color on screen or the color of an object by using the device s camera br Some applications will make images easier to interpret by the color blind by enhancing color contrast in natural images and or information graphics These methods are generally called daltonization algorithms br Some applications can simulate color blindness by applying a filter to an image or screen that reduces the gamut of an image to that of a specific type of color blindness While they do not directly help color blind people they allow those with normal color vision to understand how the color blind see the world Their use can help improve inclusive design by allowing designers to simulate their own images to ensure they are accessible to the color blind br In a cybernetic device called eyeborg was developed to allow the wearer to hear sounds representing different colors Achromatopsic artist Neil Harbisson was the first to use such a device in early the eyeborg allowed him to start painting in color by memorizing the sound corresponding to each color In at a TED Conference Harbisson explained how he could now perceive colors outside the ability of human vision br br br Epidemiology br br Color blindness affects a large number of individuals with protans and deutans being the most common types In individuals with Northern European ancestry as many as percent of men and percent of women experience congenital color deficiency Interestingly even Dalton s first paper already arrived upon this number br br it is remarkable that out of pupils I once had to whom I explained this subject were found to agree with me br br br History br br During the th and th century several philosophers hypothesized that not all individuals perceived colors in the same way br br there is no reason to suppose a perfect resemblance in the disposition of the Optic Nerve in all Men since there is an infinite variety in every thing in Nature and chiefly in those that are Material tis therefore very probable that all Men see not the same Colours in the same Objects br In the power of conceiving colors too there are striking differences among individuals and indeed I am inclined to suspect that in the greater number of instances the supposed defects of sight in this respect ought to be ascribed rather to a defect in the power of conception br Gordon Lynn Walls claims that the first well circulated case study of color blindness was published in a letter from Joseph Huddart to Joseph Priestley which described Harris the Shoemaker and several of his brothers with what would later be described as protanopia There appear to be no earlier surviving historical mentions of color blindness despite its prevalence br The phenomenon only came to be scientifically studied in when English chemist John Dalton gave the first account of color blindness in a paper to the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society which was published in as Extraordinary Facts relating to the Vision of Colours With Observations Genetic analysis of Dalton s preserved eyeball confirmed him as having deuteranopia in some years after his death br Influenced by Dalton German writer J W von Goethe studied color vision abnormalities in by asking two young subjects to match pairs of colors br In August Seebeck first discriminated between protans and deutans then as class I II He was also the first to develop an objective test method where subjects sorted colored sheets of paper and was the first to describe a female colorblind subject br In the Lagerlunda train crash in Sweden brought color blindness to the forefront Following the crash Professor Alarik Frithiof Holmgren a physiologist investigated and concluded that the color blindness of the engineer who had died had caused the crash Professor Holmgren then created the first test for color vision using multicolored skeins of wool to detect color blindness and thereby exclude the color blind from jobs in the transportation industry requiring color vision to interpret safety signals However there is a claim that there is no firm evidence that color deficiency did cause the collision or that it might have not been the sole cause br In Frederick William Edridge Green devised an alternative theory of color vision and color blindness based on Newton s classification of fundamental colors ROYGBIV Edridge Green classified color vision based on how many distinct colors a subject could see in the spectrum Normal subjects were termed hexachromic as they could not discern Indigo Subjects with superior color vision who could discern indigo were heptachromic The color blind were therefore dichromic equivalent to dichromacy or tri tetra or pentachromic anomalous trichromacy br br br Rights br In the United States under federal anti discrimination laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act color vision deficiencies have not been found to constitute a disability that triggers protection from workplace discrimination br A Brazilian court ruled that the color blind are protected by the Inter American Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Person with Disabilities At trial it was decided that the carriers of color blindness have a right of access to wider knowledge or the full enjoyment of their human condition br br br Occupations br Color blindness may make it difficult or impossible for a person to engage in certain activities Persons with color blindness may be legally or practically barred from occupations in which color perception is an essential part of the job e g mixing paint colors or in which color perception is important for safety e g operating vehicles in response to color coded signals This occupational safety principle originates from the aftermath of the Lagerlunda train crash which Alarik Frithiof Holmgren blamed on the color blindness of the engineer and created the first occupational screening test Holmgren s wool test against the color blind br br I consider that to Holmgren above all others do we owe the present and future control of color blindness on land and sea by which life and property are safer and the risks of travelling less br Color vision is important for occupations using telephone or computer networking cabling as the individual wires inside the cables are color coded using green orange brown blue and white colors Electronic wiring transformers resistors and capacitors are color coded as well using black brown red orange yellow green blue violet gray white silver and gold br Participation officiating and viewing sporting events can be impacted by color blindness Professional football players Thomas Delaney and Fabio Carvalho have discussed the difficulties when color clashes occur and research undertaken by FIFA has shown that enjoyment and player progression can be hampered by issues distinguishing the difference between the pitch and training objects or field markings Snooker World Champions Mark Williams and Peter Ebdon sometimes need to ask the referee for help distinguishing between the red and brown balls due to their color blindness Both have played foul shots on notable occasions by potting the wrong ball br br br Driving br br Red green color blindness can make it difficult to drive primarily due to the inability to differentiate red amber green traffic lights Protans are further disadvantaged due to the darkened perception of reds which can make it more difficult to quickly recognize brake lights In response some countries have refused to grant driver s licenses to individuals with color blindness br br In April Romania removed color blindness from its list of disqualifying conditions for learner driver s licenses It is now qualified as a condition that could potentially compromise driver safety therefore a driver may have to be evaluated by an authorized ophthalmologist to determine if they can drive safely As of May there is an ongoing campaign to remove the legal restrictions that prohibit color blind citizens from getting driver s licenses br In June India relaxed its ban on driver s licenses for the color blind to now only apply to those with strong CVD While previously restricted those who test as mild or moderate can now pass the medical requirements br Australia instituted a tiered ban on the color blind from obtaining commercial driver s licenses in This included a ban for all protans and a stipulation that deutans must pass the Farnsworth Lantern The stipulation on deutans was revoked in citing a lack of available test facilities and the ban on protans was revoked in br All color blind individuals are banned from obtaining a driver s license in China and since in Russia for dichromats br br br Piloting aircraft br br Although many aspects of aviation depend on color coding only a few of them are critical enough to be interfered with by some milder types of color blindness Some examples include color gun signaling of aircraft that have lost radio communication color coded glide path indications on runways and the like Some jurisdictions restrict the issuance of pilot credentials to persons with color blindness for this reason Restrictions may be partial allowing color blind persons to obtain certification but with restrictions or total in which case color blind persons are not permitted to obtain piloting credentials at all br In the United States the Federal Aviation Administration requires that pilots be tested for normal color vision as part of their medical clearance in order to obtain the required medical certificate a prerequisite to obtaining a pilot s certification If testing reveals color blindness the applicant may be issued a license with restrictions such as no night flying and no flying by color signals such a restriction effectively prevents a pilot from holding certain flying occupations such as that of an airline pilot although commercial pilot certification is still possible and there are a few flying occupations that do not require night flight and thus are still available to those with restrictions due to color blindness e g agricultural aviation The government allows several types of tests including medical standard tests e g the Ishihara Dvorine and others and specialized tests oriented specifically to the needs of aviation If an applicant fails the standard tests they will receive a restriction on their medical certificate that states Not valid for night flying or by color signal control They may apply to the FAA to take a specialized test administered by the FAA Typically this test is the color vision light gun test For this test an FAA inspector will meet the pilot at an airport with an operating control tower The color signal light gun will be shone at the pilot from the tower and they must identify the color If they pass they may be issued a waiver which states that the color vision test is no longer required during medical examinations They will then receive a new medical certificate with the restriction removed This was once a Statement of Demonstrated Ability SODA but the SODA was dropped and converted to a simple waiver letter early in the s br Research published in carried out by the City University of London s Applied Vision Research Centre sponsored by the UK s Civil Aviation Authority and the U S Federal Aviation Administration has established a more accurate assessment of color deficiencies in pilot applicants red green and yellow blue color range which could lead to a reduction in the number of prospective pilots who fail to meet the minimum medical threshold br br br
