id: 4543
Blue is one of the three primary colours in the RYB colour model traditional colour theory as well as in the RGB additive colour model It lies between violet and cyan on the spectrum of visible light The term blue generally describes colours perceived by humans observing light with a dominant wavelength that s between approximately and nanometres Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colours azure contains some green while ultramarine contains some violet The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering An optical effect called the Tyndall effect explains blue eyes Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called aerial perspective br Blue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times The semi precious stone lapis lazuli was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later in the Renaissance to make the pigment ultramarine the most expensive of all pigments In the eighth century Chinese artists used cobalt blue to colour fine blue and white porcelain In the Middle Ages European artists used it in the windows of cathedrals Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye woad until it was replaced by the finer indigo from America In the th century synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced organic dyes and mineral pigments Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later in the late th century for business suits Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the United Nations and the European Union br In the United States and Europe blue is the colour that both men and women are most likely to choose as their favourite with at least one recent survey showing the same across several other countries including China Malaysia and Indonesia Past surveys in the US and Europe have found that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony confidence masculinity knowledge intelligence calmness distance infinity the imagination cold and sadness br br br Etymology and linguistics br The modern English word blue comes from Middle English bleu or blewe from the Old French bleu a word of Germanic origin related to the Old High German word blao meaning shimmering lustrous In heraldry the word azure is used for blue br In Russian Spanish Mongolian Irish and some other languages there is no single word for blue but rather different words for light blue goluboj Celeste and dark blue sinij Azul see Colour term br Several languages including Japanese and Lakota Sioux use the same word to describe blue and green For example in Vietnamese the colour of both tree leaves and the sky is xanh In Japanese the word for blue ao is often used for colours that English speakers would refer to as green such as the colour of a traffic signal meaning go In Lakota the word t is used for both blue and green the two colours not being distinguished in older Lakota for more on this subject see Blue green distinction in language br Linguistic research indicates that languages do not begin by having a word for the colour blue Colour names often developed individually in natural languages typically beginning with black and white or dark and light and then adding red and only much later usually as the last main category of colour accepted in a language adding the colour blue probably when blue pigments could be manufactured reliably in the culture using that language br br br Optics and colour theory br The term blue generally describes colours perceived by humans observing light with a dominant wavelength between approximately and nanometres Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength gradually look more violet while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green Purer blues are in the middle of this range e g around nanometres br Isaac Newton included blue as one of the seven colours in his first description of the visible spectrum He chose seven colours because that was the number of notes in the musical scale which he believed was related to the optical spectrum He included indigo the hue between blue and violet as one of the separate colours though today it is usually considered a hue of blue br In painting and traditional colour theory blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments red yellow blue which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours Red and blue mixed together form violet blue and yellow together form green Mixing all three primary colours together produces a dark brown From the Renaissance onward painters used this system to create their colours see RYB colour model br The RYB model was used for colour printing by Jacob Christoph Le Blon as early as Later printers discovered that more accurate colours could be created by using combinations of cyan magenta yellow and black ink put onto separate inked plates and then overlaid one at a time onto paper This method could produce almost all the colours in the spectrum with reasonable accuracy br br br br br br br br br br br On the HSV colour wheel the complement of blue is yellow that is a colour corresponding to an equal mixture of red and green light On a colour wheel based on traditional colour theory RYB where blue was considered a primary colour its complementary colour is considered to be orange based on the Munsell colour wheel br br br LED br br In high brightness blue LEDs were demonstrated by Shuji Nakamura of Nichia Corporation In parallel Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano of Nagoya University were working on a new development which revolutionized LED lighting br Nakamura was awarded the Millennium Technology Prize for his invention br Nakamura Hiroshi Amano and Isamu Akasaki were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in for the invention of an efficient blue LED br br br Lasers br br Lasers emitting in the blue region of the spectrum became widely available to the public in with the release of inexpensive high powered nm laser diode technology Previously the blue wavelengths were accessible only through DPSS which are comparatively expensive and inefficient but still widely used by scientists for applications including optogenetics Raman spectroscopy and particle image velocimetry due to their superior beam quality Blue gas lasers are also still commonly used for holography DNA sequencing optical pumping among other scientific and medical applications br br br Shades and variations br br Blue is the colour of light between violet and cyan on the visible spectrum Hues of blue include indigo and ultramarine closer to violet pure blue without any mixture of other colours Azure which is a lighter shade of blue similar to the colour of the sky Cyan which is midway in the spectrum between blue and green and the other blue greens such as turquoise teal and aquamarine br Blue also varies in shade or tint darker shades of blue contain black or grey while lighter tints contain white Darker shades of blue include ultramarine cobalt blue navy blue and Prussian blue while lighter tints include sky blue azure and Egyptian blue for a more complete list see the List of colours br br br As a structural colour br br In nature many blue phenomena arise from structural colouration the result of interference between reflections from two or more surfaces of thin films combined with refraction as light enters and exits such films The geometry then determines that at certain angles the light reflected from both surfaces interferes constructively while at other angles the light interferes destructively Diverse colours therefore appear despite the absence of colourants br br br Colourants br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Artificial blues br Egyptian blue the first artificial pigment was produced in the third millennium BC in Ancient Egypt It is produced by heating pulverized sand copper and natron It was used in tomb paintings and funereal objects to protect the dead in their afterlife Prior to the s blue colourants for artwork were mainly based on lapis lazuli and the related mineral ultramarine A breakthrough occurred in when German druggist and pigment maker Johann Jacob Diesbach discovered Prussian blue The new blue arose from experiments involving heating dried blood with iron sulphides and was initially called Berliner Blau By it was being used by the French painter Antoine Watteau and later his successor Nicolas Lancret It became immensely popular for the manufacture of wallpaper and in the th century was widely used by French impressionist painters Beginning in the s Prussian blue was imported into Japan through the port of Nagasaki It was called bero ai or Berlin blue and it became popular because it did not fade like traditional Japanese blue pigment ai gami made from the dayflower Prussian blue was used by both Hokusai in his wave paintings and Hiroshige br In a French chemist Louis Jacques Th nard made a synthetic cobalt blue pigment which became immensely popular with painters br In the Societ pour l Encouragement d Industrie in France offered a prize for the invention of an artificial ultramarine which could rival the natural colour made from lapis lazuli The prize was won in by a chemist named Jean Baptiste Guimet but he refused to reveal the formula of his colour In another scientist Christian Gmelin then a professor of chemistry in T bingen found the process and published his formula This was the beginning of new industry to manufacture artificial ultramarine which eventually almost completely replaced the natural product br In German chemists synthesized indigo This product rapidly replaced natural indigo wiping out vast farms growing indigo It is now the blue of blue jeans As the pace of organic chemistry accelerated a succession of synthetic blue dyes were discovered including Indanthrone blue which had even greater resistance to fading during washing or in the sun and copper phthalocyanine br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Dyes for textiles and food br br Blue dyes are organic compounds both synthetic and natural Woad and true indigo were once used but since the early s all indigo is synthetic Produced on an industrial scale indigo is the blue of blue jeans br For food the triarylmethane dye Brilliant blue FCF is used for candies The search continues for stable natural blue dyes suitable for the food industry br br br Pigments for painting and glass br br Blue pigments were once produced from minerals especially lapis lazuli and its close relative ultramarine These minerals were crushed ground into powder and then mixed with a quick drying binding agent such as egg yolk tempera painting or with a slow drying oil such as linseed oil for oil painting Two inorganic but synthetic blue pigments are cerulean blue primarily cobalt II stanate Co SnO and Prussian blue milori blue primarily Fe CN The chromophore in blue glass and glazes is cobalt II Diverse cobalt II salts such as cobalt carbonate or cobalt II aluminate are mixed with the silica prior to firing The cobalt occupies sites otherwise filled with silicon br br br Inks br Methyl blue is the dominant blue pigment in inks used in pens Blueprinting involves the production of Prussian blue in situ br br br Inorganic compounds br br Certain metal ions characteristically form blue solutions or blue salts Of some practical importance cobalt is used to make the deep blue glazes and glasses It substitutes for silicon or aluminum ions in these materials Cobalt is the blue chromophore in stained glass windows such as those in Gothic cathedrals and in Chinese porcelain beginning in the Tang dynasty Copper II Cu also produces many blue compounds including the commercial algicide copper II sulfate CuSO H O Similarly vanadyl salts and solutions are often blue e g vanadyl sulfate br br br In nature br br br Sky and sea br br When sunlight passes through the atmosphere the blue wavelengths are scattered more widely by the oxygen and nitrogen molecules and more blue comes to our eyes This effect is called Rayleigh scattering after Lord Rayleigh and confirmed by Albert Einstein in br The sea is seen as blue for largely the same reason the water absorbs the longer wavelengths of red and reflects and scatters the blue which comes to the eye of the viewer The deeper the observer goes the darker the blue becomes In the open sea only about of light penetrates to a depth of metres see underwater and euphotic depth br The colour of the sea is also affected by the colour of the sky reflected by particles in the water and by algae and plant life in the water which can make it look green or by sediment which can make it look brown br The farther away an object is the more blue it often appears to the eye For example mountains in the distance often appear blue This is the effect of atmospheric perspective the farther an object is away from the viewer the less contrast there is between the object and its background colour which is usually blue In a painting where different parts of the composition are blue green and red the blue will appear to be more distant and the red closer to the viewer The cooler a colour is the more distant it seems Blue light is scattered more than other wavelengths by the gases in the atmosphere hence our blue planet br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Minerals br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Some of the most desirable gems are blue including sapphire and tanzanite Compounds of copper II are characteristically blue and so are many copper containing minerals br Azurite Cu CO OH with a deep blue colour was once employed in medieval years but it is unstable pigment losing its colour especially under dry conditions Lapis lazuli mined in Afghanistan for more than three thousand years was used for jewelry and ornaments and later was crushed and powdered and used as a pigment The more it was ground the lighter the blue colour became Natural ultramarine made by grinding lapis lazuli into a fine powder was the finest available blue pigment in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance It was extremely expensive and in Italian Renaissance art it was often reserved for the robes of the Virgin Mary br br br Plants and fungi br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Intense efforts have focused on blue flowers and the possibility that natural blue colourants could be used as food dyes Commonly blue colours in plants are anthocyanins the largest group of water soluble pigments found widespread in the plant kingdom In the few plants that exploit structural colouration brilliant colours are produced by structures within cells The most brilliant blue colouration known in any living tissue is found in the marble berries of Pollia condensata where a spiral structure of cellulose fibrils scattering blue light The fruit of quandong Santalum acuminatum can appear blue owing to the same effect br br br Animals br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Blue pigmented animals are relatively rare Examples of which include butterflies of the genus Nessaea where blue is created by pterobilin Other blue pigments of animal origin include phorcabilin used by other butterflies in Graphium and Papilio specifically P phorcas and P weiskei and sarpedobilin which is used by Graphium sarpedon Blue pigmented organelles known as cyanosomes exist in the chromatophores of at least two fish species the mandarin fish and the picturesque dragonet More commonly blueness in animals is a structural colouration an optical interference effect induced by organized nanometre sized scales or fibres Examples include the plumage of several birds like the blue jay and indigo bunting the scales of butterflies like the morpho butterfly collagen fibres in the skin of some species of monkey and opossum and the iridophore cells in some fish and frogs br br br Eyes br br Blue eyes do not actually contain any blue pigment Eye colour is determined by two factors the pigmentation of the eye s iris and the scattering of light by the turbid medium in the stroma of the iris In humans the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black The appearance of blue green and hazel eyes results from the Tyndall scattering of light in the stroma an optical effect similar to what accounts for the blueness of the sky The irises of the eyes of people with blue eyes contain less dark melanin than those of people with brown eyes which means that they absorb less short wavelength blue light which is instead reflected out to the viewer Eye colour also varies depending on the lighting conditions especially for lighter coloured eyes br Blue eyes are most common in Ireland the Baltic Sea area and Northern Europe and are also found in Eastern Central and Southern Europe Blue eyes are also found in parts of Western Asia most notably in Afghanistan Syria Iraq and Iran In Estonia of people have blue eyes In Denmark in only of the population had brown eyes though through immigration today that number is about In Germany about have blue eyes br In the United States as of out of every people or of the total population and of the white population have blue eyes compared with about half of Americans born in and a third of Americans born in Blue eyes are becoming less common among American children In the US males are more likely to have blue eyes than females br br br History br br br In the ancient world br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br As early as the th millennium BC lapis lazuli was mined in the Sar i Sang mines in Shortugai and in other mines in Badakhshan province in northeast Afghanistan br Lapis lazuli artifacts dated to BC have been found at Bhirrana which is the oldest site of Indus Valley civilisation Lapis was highly valued by the Indus Valley Civilisation BC Lapis beads have been found at Neolithic burials in Mehrgarh the Caucasus and as far away as Mauritania It was used in the funeral mask of Tutankhamun BC br A term for Blue was relatively rare in many forms of ancient art and decoration and even in ancient literature The Ancient Greek poets described the sea as green brown or the colour of wine The colour is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible as tekhelet Reds blacks browns and ochres are found in cave paintings from the Upper Paleolithic period but not blue Blue was also not used for dyeing fabric until long after red ochre pink and purple This is probably due to the perennial difficulty of making blue dyes and pigments On the other hand the rarity of blue pigment made it even more valuable br The earliest known blue dyes were made from plants woad in Europe indigo in Asia and Africa while blue pigments were made from minerals usually either lapis lazuli or azurite and required more Blue glazes posed still another challenge since the early blue dyes and pigments were not thermally robust In c BC the blue glaze Egyptian blue was introduced for ceramics as well as many other objects The Greeks imported indigo dye from India calling it indikon and they painted with Egyptian blue Blue was not one of the four primary colours for Greek painting described by Pliny the Elder red yellow black and white For the Romans blue was the colour of mourning as well as the colour of barbarians The Celts and Germans reportedly dyed their faces blue to frighten their enemies and tinted their hair blue when they grew old The Romans made extensive use of indigo and Egyptian blue pigment as evidenced in part by frescos in Pompeii br The Romans had many words for varieties of blue including caeruleus caesius glaucus cyaneus lividus venetus aerius and ferreus but two words both of foreign origin became the most enduring blavus from the Germanic word blau which eventually became bleu or blue and azureus from the Arabic word lazaward which became azure br Blue was widely used in the decoration of churches in the Byzantine Empire By contrast in the Islamic world blue was of secondary to green believed to be the favourite colour of the Prophet Mohammed At certain times in Moorish Spain and other parts of the Islamic world blue was the colour worn by Christians and Jews because only Muslims were allowed to wear white and green br br br In the Middle Ages br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br In the art and life of Europe during the early Middle Ages blue played a minor role This changed dramatically between and in Paris when the Abbe Suger rebuilt the Saint Denis Basilica Suger considered that light was the visible manifestation of the Holy Spirit He installed stained glass windows coloured with cobalt which combined with the light from the red glass filled the church with a bluish violet light The church became the marvel of the Christian world and the colour became known as the bleu de Saint Denis In the years that followed even more elegant blue stained glass windows were installed in other churches including at Chartres Cathedral and Sainte Chapelle in Paris br In the th century the Roman Catholic Church dictated that painters in Italy and the rest of Europe consequently to paint the Virgin Mary with blue which became associated with holiness humility and virtue In medieval paintings blue was used to attract the attention of the viewer to the Virgin Mary Paintings of the mythical King Arthur began to show him dressed in blue The coat of arms of the kings of France became an azure or light blue shield sprinkled with golden fleur de lis or lilies Blue had come from obscurity to become the royal colour br br br Renaissance through th century br Blue came into wider use beginning in the Renaissance when artists began to paint the world with perspective depth shadows and light from a single source In Renaissance paintings artists tried to create harmonies between blue and red lightening the blue with lead white paint and adding shadows and highlights Raphael was a master of this technique carefully balancing the reds and the blues so no one colour dominated the picture br Ultramarine was the most prestigious blue of the Renaissance being more expensive than gold Wealthy art patrons commissioned works with the most expensive blues possible In Richard Sackville commissioned a portrait of himself by Isaac Oliver with three different blues including ultramarine pigment for his stockings br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br An industry for the manufacture of fine blue and white pottery began in the th century in Jingdezhen China using white Chinese porcelain decorated with patterns of cobalt blue imported from Persia It was first made for the family of the Emperor of China then was exported around the world with designs for export adapted to European subjects and tastes The Chinese blue style was also adapted by Dutch craftsmen in Delft and English craftsmen in Staffordshire in the th th centuries in the th century blue and white porcelains were produced by Josiah Wedgwood and other British craftsmen br br br th th century br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br The early th century saw the ancestor of the modern blue business suit created by Beau Brummel who set fashion at the London Court It also saw the invention of blue jeans a highly popular form of workers s costume invented in by Jacob W Davis who used metal rivets to strengthen blue denim work clothing in the California gold fields The invention was funded by San Francisco entrepreneur Levi Strauss and spread around the world br br br br br br br br br br br Recognizing the emotional power of blue many artists made it the central element of paintings in the th and th centuries They included Pablo Picasso Pavel Kuznetsov and the Blue Rose art group and Kandinsky and Der Blaue Reiter The Blue Rider school Henri Matisse expressed deep emotions with blue A certain blue penetrates your soul In the second half of the th century painters of the abstract expressionist movement use blues to inspire ideas and emotions Painter Mark Rothko observed that colour was only an instrument his interest was in expressing human emotions tragedy ecstasy doom and so on br br br In society and culture br br br Uniforms br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br In the th century The Prince Elector of Brandenburg Frederick William I of Prussia chose Prussian blue as the new colour of Prussian military uniforms because it was made with Woad a local crop rather than Indigo which was produced by the colonies of Brandenburg s rival England It was worn by the German army until World War I with the exception of the soldiers of Bavaria who wore sky blue br In the Royal Navy adopted a dark shade of blue for the uniform of officers It was first known as marine blue now known as navy blue The militia organized by George Washington selected blue and buff the colours of the British Whig Party Blue continued to be the colour of the field uniform of the US Army until and is still the colour of the dress uniform br In the th century police in the United Kingdom including the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police also adopted a navy blue uniform Similar traditions were embraced in France and Austria It was also adopted at about the same time for the uniforms of the officers of the New York City Police Department br br br Religion br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Blue in Judaism In the Torah the Israelites were commanded to put fringes tzitzit on the corners of their garments and to weave within these fringes a twisted thread of blue tekhelet In ancient days this blue thread was made from a dye extracted from a Mediterranean snail called the hilazon Maimonides claimed that this blue was the colour of the clear noonday sky Rashi the colour of the evening sky According to several rabbinic sages blue is the colour of God s Glory Staring at this colour aids in mediation bringing us a glimpse of the pavement of sapphire like the very sky for purity which is a likeness of the Throne of God The Hebrew word for glory Many items in the Mishkan the portable sanctuary in the wilderness such as the menorah many of the vessels and the Ark of the Covenant were covered with blue cloth when transported from place to place br Blue in Christianity Blue is particularly associated with the Virgin Mary This was the result of a decree of Pope Gregory I who ordered that all religious paintings should tell a story which was clearly comprehensible to all viewers and that figures should be easily recognizable especially that of the figure of Mary If she was alone in the image her costume was usually painted with the finest blue ultramarine If she was with Christ her costume was usually painted with a less expensive pigment to avoid outshining him br Blue in Hinduism Many of the gods are depicted as having blue coloured skin particularly those associated with Vishnu who is said to be the preserver of the world and thus intimately connected to water Krishna and Rama Vishnu s avatars are usually depicted with blue skin Shiva the destroyer deity is also depicted in a light blue hue and is called N laka ha or blue throated for having swallowed poison to save the universe during the Samudra Manthana the churning of the ocean of milk Blue is used to symbolically represent the fifth and the throat chakra Vishuddha br Blue in Sikhism The Akali Nihangs warriors wear all blue attire Guru Gobind Singh also has a blue roan horse The Sikh Rehat Maryada states that the Nishan Sahib hoisted outside every Gurudwara should be xanthic Basanti in Punjabi or greyish blue modern day navy blue Surmaaee in Punjabi colour br Blue in Paganism Blue is associated with peace truth wisdom protection and patience It helps with healing psychic ability harmony and understanding br br br Sports br br br br br br br br br br br In sports blue is widely represented in uniforms in part because the majority of national teams wear the colours of their national flag For example the national men s football team of France are known as Les Bleus the Blues Similarly Argentina Italy and Uruguay wear blue shirts The Asian Football Confederation and the Oceania Football Confederation use blue text on their logos Blue is well represented in baseball Blue Jays basketball and American football and Ice hockey The Indian national cricket team wears blue uniform during One day international matches as such the team is also referred to as Men in Blue br br br Politics br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Unlike red or green blue was not strongly associated with any particular country religion or political movement As the colour of harmony it was chosen as the colour for the flags of the United Nations the European Union and NATO In politics blue is often used as the colour of conservative parties contrasting with the red associated with left wing parties Some conservative parties that use the colour blue include the Conservative Party UK Conservative Party of Canada Liberal Party of Australia Liberal Party of Brazil and Likud of Israel However in some countries blue is not associated main conservative party In the United States the liberal Democratic Party is associated with blue while the conservative Republican Party with red US states which have been won by the Democratic Party in four consecutive presidential elections are termed blue states while those that have been won by the Republican Party are termed red states South Korea also uses this colour model with the Democratic Party on the left using blue and the People Power Party on the right using red br br br See also br Engineer s blue br Lists of
