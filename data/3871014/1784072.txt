title: Atmospheric refraction
id: 1784072
Atmospheric refraction is the deviation of light or other electromagnetic wave from a straight line as it passes through the atmosphere due to the variation in air density as a function of height This refraction is due to the velocity of light through air decreasing the refractive index increases with increased density Atmospheric refraction near the ground produces mirages Such refraction can also raise or lower or stretch or shorten the images of distant objects without involving mirages Turbulent air can make distant objects appear to twinkle or shimmer The term also applies to the refraction of sound Atmospheric refraction is considered in measuring the position of both celestial and terrestrial objects br Astronomical or celestial refraction causes astronomical objects to appear higher above the horizon than they actually are Terrestrial refraction usually causes terrestrial objects to appear higher than they actually are although in the afternoon when the air near the ground is heated the rays can curve upward making objects appear lower than they actually are br Refraction not only affects visible light rays but all electromagnetic radiation although in varying degrees For example in the visible spectrum blue is more affected than red This may cause astronomical objects to appear dispersed into a spectrum in high resolution images br br Whenever possible astronomers will schedule their observations around the times of culmination when celestial objects are highest in the sky Likewise sailors will not shoot a star below above the horizon If observations of objects near the horizon cannot be avoided it is possible to equip an optical telescope with control systems to compensate for the shift caused by the refraction If the dispersion is also a problem in case of broadband high resolution observations atmospheric refraction correctors made from pairs of rotating glass prisms can be employed as well br Since the amount of atmospheric refraction is a function of the temperature gradient temperature pressure and humidity the amount of water vapor which is especially important at mid infrared wavelengths the amount of effort needed for a successful compensation can be prohibitive Surveyors on the other hand will often schedule their observations in the afternoon when the magnitude of refraction is minimum br Atmospheric refraction becomes more severe when temperature gradients are strong and refraction is not uniform when the atmosphere is heterogeneous as when turbulence occurs in the air This causes suboptimal seeing conditions such as the twinkling of stars and various deformations of the Sun s apparent shape soon before sunset or after sunrise br br br Astronomical refraction br br Astronomical refraction deals with the angular position of celestial bodies their appearance as a point source and through differential refraction the shape of extended bodies such as the Sun and Moon br Atmospheric refraction of the light from a star is zero in the zenith less than one arc minute at apparent altitude and still only at altitude it quickly increases as altitude decreases reaching at altitude at altitude and at the horizon all values are for C and hPa br in the visible part of the spectrum br On the horizon refraction is slightly greater than the apparent diameter of the Sun so when the bottom of the sun s disc appears to touch the horizon the sun s true altitude is negative If the atmosphere suddenly vanished at this moment one couldn t see the sun as it would be entirely below the horizon By convention sunrise and sunset refer to times at which the Sun s upper limb appears on or disappears from the horizon and the standard value for the Sun s true altitude is for the refraction and for the Sun s semi diameter The altitude of a celestial body is normally given for the center of the body s disc In the case of the Moon additional corrections are needed for the Moon s horizontal parallax and its apparent semi diameter both vary with the Earth Moon distance br Refraction near the horizon is highly variable principally because of the variability of the temperature gradient near the Earth s surface and the geometric sensitivity of the nearly horizontal rays to this variability As early as Friedrich Bessel had found that even after applying all corrections for temperature and pressure but not for the temperature gradient at the observer highly precise measurements of refraction varied by at two degrees above the horizon and by at a half degree above the horizon At and below the horizon values of refraction significantly higher than the nominal value of have been observed in a wide range of climates Georg Constantin Bouris measured refraction of as much of for stars on the horizon at the Athens Observatory and during his ill fated Endurance expedition Sir Ernest Shackleton recorded refraction of br The sun which had made positively his last appearance seven days earlier surprised us by lifting more than half its disk above the horizon on May A glow on the northern horizon resolved itself into the sun at am that day A quarter of an hour later the unreasonable visitor disappeared again only to rise again at am set at pm rise at pm and set lingeringly at pm These curious phenomena were due to refraction which amounted to at pm The temperature was below Fahr and we calculated that the refraction was above normal br Day to day variations in the weather will affect the exact times of sunrise and sunset as well as moon rise and moon set and for that reason it generally is not meaningful to give rise and set times to greater precision than the nearest minute More precise calculations can be useful for determining day to day changes in rise and set times that would occur with the standard value for refraction if it is understood that actual changes may differ because of unpredictable variations in refraction br Because atmospheric refraction is nominally on the horizon but only at above it the setting or rising sun seems to be flattened by about about of its apparent diameter br br br Calculating refraction br Young distinguished several regions where different methods for calculating astronomical refraction were applicable In the upper portion of the sky with a zenith distance of less than or an altitude over various simple refraction formulas based on the index of refraction and hence on the temperature pressure and humidity at the observer are adequate Between and of the horizon the temperature gradient becomes the dominant factor and numerical integration using a method such as that of Auer and Standish and employing the temperature gradient of the standard atmosphere and the measured conditions at the observer is required Closer to the horizon actual measurements of the changes with height of the local temperature gradient need to be employed in the numerical integration Below the astronomical horizon refraction is so variable that only crude estimates of astronomical refraction can be made for example the observed time of sunrise or sunset can vary by several minutes from day to day As The Nautical Almanac notes the actual values of the refraction at low altitudes may in extreme atmospheric conditions differ considerably from the mean values used in the tables br br Many different formulas have been developed for calculating astronomical refraction they are reasonably consistent differing among themselves by a few minutes of arc at the horizon and becoming increasingly consistent as they approach the zenith The simpler formulations involved nothing more than the temperature and pressure at the observer powers of the cotangent of the apparent altitude of the astronomical body and in the higher order terms the height of a fictional homogeneous atmosphere The simplest version of this formula which Smart held to be only accurate within of the zenith is br br br br br R br br br br n br br br

considered that this formula gave results within one arcsecond of Bessel s values for refraction from above the horizon to the zenith br A further expansion in terms of the third power of the cotangent of the apparent altitude incorporates H the height of the homogeneous atmosphere in addition to the usual conditions at the observer br br br br br R br br br br n br br br br br br br br br

approximately for every C decrease in temperature and decreases approximately for every C increase in temperature br br br Random refraction effects br br Turbulence in Earth s atmosphere scatters the light from stars making them appear brighter and fainter on a time scale of milliseconds The slowest components of these fluctuations are visible as twinkling also called scintillation br Turbulence also causes small sporadic motions of the star image and produces rapid distortions in its structure These effects are not visible to the naked eye but can be easily seen even in small telescopes They perturb astronomical seeing conditions Some telescopes employ adaptive optics to reduce this effect br br br Terrestrial refraction br br Terrestrial refraction sometimes called geodetic refraction deals with the apparent angular position and measured distance of terrestrial bodies It is of special concern for the production of precise maps and surveys Since the line of sight in terrestrial refraction passes near the earth s surface the magnitude of refraction depends chiefly on the temperature gradient near the ground which varies widely at different times of day seasons of the year the nature of the terrain the state of the weather and other factors br As a common approximation terrestrial refraction is considered as a constant bending of the ray of light or line of sight in which the ray can be considered as describing a circular path A common measure of refraction is the coefficient of refraction Unfortunately there are two different definitions of this coefficient One is the ratio of the radius of the Earth to the radius of the line of sight the other is the ratio of the angle that the line of sight subtends at the center of the Earth to the angle of refraction measured at the observer Since the latter definition only measures the bending of the ray at one end of the line of sight it is one half the value of the former definition br The coefficient of refraction is directly related to the local vertical temperature gradient and the atmospheric temperature and pressure The larger version of the coefficient k measuring the ratio of the radius of the Earth to the radius of the line of sight is given by br br br br br k br br br br br P br br T br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br d br T br br br d br h br br br br br br br br br br displaystyle k frac P T left frac dT dh right br br br where temperature T is given in kelvins pressure P in millibars and height h in meters The angle of refraction increases with the coefficient of refraction and with the length of the line of sight br Although the straight line from your eye to a distant mountain might be blocked by a closer hill the ray may curve enough to make the distant peak visible A convenient method to analyze the effect of refraction on visibility is to consider an increased effective radius of the Earth Reff given by br br br br br br R br br eff br br br br br br R br br br

ray in arcsec per meter P is the pressure in millibars T is the temperature in kelvins and is the angle of the ray to the horizontal Multiplying half the curvature by the length of the ray path gives

and is the refraction at the observer measured in arc seconds br A simple approximation is to consider that a mountain s apparent altitude at your eye in degrees will exceed its true altitude by its distance in kilometers divided by This assumes a fairly horizontal line of sight and ordinary air density if the mountain is very high so much of the sightline is in thinner air divide by instead br
