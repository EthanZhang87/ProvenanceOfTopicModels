id: 22884719
The philosophy of color is a subset of the philosophy of perception that is concerned with the nature of the perceptual experience of color Any explicit account of color perception requires a commitment to one of a variety of ontological or metaphysical views distinguishing namely between externalism internalism which relate respectively to color realism the view that colors are physical properties that objects possess and color fictionalism the view that colors possess no such physical properties br br br History br Philosophical concerns about the nature of color can be traced back at least as far as Anaxagoras th century BCE who favoured color realism in his sophism Snow is frozen water But water is dark in color Therefore snow is dark in color Anaxagoras claimed that our perception deviated from the truth owing to the feebleness of the senses Later Democritus circa BCE would say By convention sweet by convention bitter by convention hot by convention cold by convention color but by verity atoms and void In direct refutation of Anaxagoras the Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus circa CE noted that different animals would have different perceptions of color due to differences in their eyes and that color was an attribute of a subject and not the object itself br br br Theories of color br One of the topics in the philosophy of color is the problem of the ontology of color The questions comprising this field of research are for example what kind of properties colors are i e are they physical properties of objects Or are they properties of their own kind but also problems about the representation of colors and the relationship between the representation of colors and their ontological constitution br Within the ontology of color there are various competing types of theories One way of posing their relationship is in terms of whether they posit colors as sui generis properties properties of a special kind that can t be reduced to more basic properties or constellations of such This divides color primitivism from color reductionism A primitivism about color is any theory that explains colors as irreducible properties A reductionism is the opposite view that colors are identical to or reducible to other properties Typically a reductionist view of color explains colors as an object s disposition to cause certain effects in perceivers or the very dispositional power itself this sort of view is often dubbed relationalism since it defines colors in terms of effects on perceivers but it also often called simply dispositionalism various forms of course exist An example of a notable theorist that defends this kind of view is the philosopher Jonathan Cohen br Another type of reductionism is color physicalism Physicalism is the view that colors are identical to certain physical properties of objects Most commonly the relevant properties are taken to be reflectance properties of surfaces though there are accounts of colors apart from surface colors too Byrne Hilbert and Kalderon defends versions of this view They identify colors with reflectance types br A reflectance type is a set or type of reflectances and a reflectance is a surface s disposition to reflect certain percentages of light specified for each wavelength within the visible spectrum br Both relationalism and physicalism of these kinds are so called realist theories since apart from specifying what colors are they maintain that colored things exist br Primitivism may be either realist or antirealist since primitivism simply claims that colors aren t reducible to anything else Some primitivists further accept that though colors are primitive properties no real or nomologically possible objects have them Insofar as we visually represent things as colored on this view we are victims of color illusions For this reason primitivism that denies that colors are ever instantiated is called an error theory br br br Color discourse br br If color fictionalism is true and the world has no colors should one just stop color discourse and all the time wear clothes that clash with each other Prescriptive color fictionalism would say no In prescriptive color fictionalism while color discourse is strictly speaking false one should continue using it in everyday life as though color properties do exist br Color vision became an important part of contemporary analytic philosophy due to the claim by scientists like Leo Hurvich that the physical and neurological aspects of color vision had become completely understood by empirical psychologists in the s An important work on the subject was C L Hardin s Color for Philosophers which explained stunning empirical findings by empirical psychologists to the conclusion that colors cannot possibly be part of the physical world but are instead purely mental features br David Hilbert and Alexander Byrne have devoted their careers to philosophical issues regarding color vision Byrne and Hilbert have taken a minority position that colors are part of the physical world Nigel J T Thomas provides a particularly clear presentation of the argument The psychologist George Boeree in the tradition of J J Gibson specifically assigns color to light and extends the idea of color realism to all sensory experience an approach he refers to as quality realism br Jonathan Cohen of UCSD and Michael Tye of UT Austin have also written many essays on color vision Cohen argues for the uncontroversial position of color relationalism with respect to semantics of color vision in Relationalist Manifesto In The Red and the Real Cohen argues for the position with respect to color ontology that generalizes from his semantics to his metaphysics Cohen s work marks the end of a vigorous debate on the topic of color that started with Hardin br Michael Tye argues among other things that there is only one correct way to see colors Therefore the colorblind and most mammals do not really have color vision because their vision differs from the vision of normal humans Similarly creatures with more advanced color vision although better able to distinguish objects than people are suffering from color illusions because their vision differs from humans Tye advanced this particular position in an essay called True Blue br Paul Churchland of UCSD has also commented extensively on the implication of color vision science on his version of reductive materialism In the s Paul Churchland s view located colors in the retina But his more recent view locates color in spectral opponency cells deeper in the color information stream Paul Churchland s view is similar to Byrne and Hilbert s view but differs in that it emphasized the subjective nature of color vision and identifies subjective colors with coding vectors in neural networks br Many philosophers follow empirical psychologists in endorsing color irrealism the view that colors are entirely mental constructs and not physical features of the world Surprisingly most philosophers who have extensively addressed the topic have attempted to defend color realism against the empirical psychologists who universally defend color antirealism br Jonathan Cohen has edited a collection of essays on the topic of color philosophy called Color Vision and Color Science Color Ontology and Color Science br br br Inverted spectrum br br The inverted spectrum is a thought experiment dating back to John Locke s An Essay Concerning Human Understanding It uses color to discuss the nature of qualia As explained by Locke br br Neither would it carry any Imputation of Falsehood to our simple Ideas if by the different Structure of our Organs it were so ordered That the same Object should produce in several Men s Minds different Ideas at the same time v g if the Idea that a Violet produced in one Man s Mind by his Eyes were the same that a Marigold produces in another Man s and vice vers For since this could never be known because one Man s Mind could not pass into another Man s Body to perceive what Appearances were produced by those Organs neither the Ideas hereby nor the Names would be at all confounded or any Falshood be in either For all Things that had the Texture of a Violet producing constantly the Idea which he called Blue and those which had the Texture of a Marigold producing constantly the Idea which he as constantly called Yellow whatever those Appearances were in his Mind he would be able as regularly to distinguish Things for his Use by those Appearances and understand and signify those distinctions marked by the Names Blue and Yellow as if the Appearances or Ideas in his Mind received from those two Flowers were exactly the same with the Ideas in other Men s Minds br Color fictionalists argue that since we can imagine perceiving an inverted color spectrum it must follow that color represents a property that determines the way things look to us yet has no physical basis br br br Mary s room br br Mary s room is a thought experiment underpinning the knowledge argument It was an argument to counter color realism and more broadly physicalism The thought experiment was originally proposed by Frank Jackson as follows br br Mary is a brilliant scientist who is for whatever reason forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor She specializes in the neurophysiology of vision and acquires let us suppose all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes or the sky and use terms like red blue and so on She discovers for example just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina and exactly how this produces via the central nervous system the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence The sky is blue What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a color television monitor Will she learn anything or not br br br See also br Fictionalism br Qualia br Realism br br br Notes br br br br Maund Barry December Color
