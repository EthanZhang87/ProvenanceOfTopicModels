SPIE formerly the Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers later the Society of Photo Optical Instrumentation Engineers is an international not for profit professional society for optics and photonics technology founded in It organizes technical conferences trade exhibitions and continuing education programs for researchers and developers in the light based fields of physics including optics photonics and imaging engineering The society publishes peer reviewed scientific journals conference proceedings monographs tutorial texts field guides and reference volumes in print and online SPIE is especially well known for Photonics West one of the laser and photonics industry s largest combined conferences and tradeshows which is held annually in San Francisco SPIE also participates as partners in leading educational initiatives and in for example provided more than million in support of optics education and outreach programs around the world br br br Former names br On July SPIE was founded as the Society of Photographic Instrumentation Engineers in California to specialize in the application of photographic instrumentation In the society changed its name to the Society of Photo Optical Instrumentation Engineers br In SPIE moved its headquarters to Bellingham Washington and in the Society began doing business as DBA SPIE The International Society for Optical Engineering to reflect a changing membership In the society ended its DBA and is now referred to simply as SPIE the international society for optics and photonics br br br Conferences and exhibitions br br SPIE Conferences and Exhibitions connect optical science and the optics retail industry The society is affiliated with over meetings and events each year br br br Publications br The society s first publication SPIE Newsletter was launched in In the society published its first book SPIE Photographic Instrumentation Catalog The newsletter morphed into the society s first journal now known as Optical Engineering SPIE s flagship monthly journal Throughout the years SPIE has created many publications including journals magazines newspapers websites and books br SPIE publishes br br Fifteen
