rallies commemorations community days dance parties and festivals br Common symbols of pride include the rainbow flag and other pride flags the lowercase Greek letter lambda the pink triangle and the black triangle these latter two reclaimed from use as badges of shame in Nazi concentration camps br br br Terminology origins br br The term Gay Pride was claimed to be coined either by Jack Baker and Michael McConnell an activist couple in Minnesota or by Thom Higgins another gay rights activist in Minnesota Brenda Howard along with the bisexual activist Robert A Martin aka Donny the Punk and gay activist L Craig Schoonmaker are credited with popularizing the word Pride to describe these festivities br br br Historical background br br br Pride precursors br br Karl Heinrich Ulrichs was one of the first openly gay activists and is considered a predecessor of the LGBT pride movement br br br Annual Reminders br The s and s in the United States constituted an extremely repressive legal and social period for LGBT people In this context American homophile organizations such as the Daughters of Bilitis and the Mattachine Society coordinated some of the earliest demonstrations of the modern LGBT rights movement These two organizations in particular carried out pickets called Annual Reminders to inform and remind Americans that LGBT people did not receive basic civil rights protections Annual Reminders began in and took place each July at Independence Hall in Philadelphia br br br Gay is Good br The anti LGBT discourse of these times equated both male and female homosexuality with mental illness Inspired by Stokely Carmichael s Black is Beautiful gay civil rights pioneer and participant in the Annual Reminders Frank Kameny originated the slogan Gay is Good in to counter social stigma and personal feelings of guilt and shame br br br Christopher Street Liberation Day br br Early on the morning of Saturday June lesbian gay bisexual and transgender persons rioted following a police raid on the Stonewall Inn a gay bar at Christopher Street in Greenwich Village Manhattan New York City This riot and further protests and rioting over the following nights were the watershed moment in the modern LGBT rights movement and the impetus for organizing LGBT pride marches on a much larger public scale br On November Craig Rodwell his partner Fred Sargeant Ellen Broidy and Linda Rhodes proposed the first pride march to be held in New York City by way of a resolution at the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations ERCHO meeting in Philadelphia br br br That the Annual Reminder in order to be more relevant reach a greater number of people and encompass the ideas and ideals of the larger struggle in which we are engaged that of our fundamental human rights be moved both in time and location br We propose that a demonstration be held annually on the last Saturday in June in New York City to commemorate the spontaneous demonstrations on Christopher Street and this demonstration be called CHRISTOPHER STREET LIBERATION DAY No dress or age regulations shall be made for this demonstration br br We also propose that we contact Homophile organizations throughout the country and suggest that they hold parallel demonstrations on that day We propose a nationwide show of support br All attendees to the ERCHO meeting in Philadelphia voted for the march except for Mattachine Society of New York which abstained Members of the Gay Liberation Front GLF attended the meeting and were seated as guests of Rodwell s group Homophile Youth Movement in Neighborhoods HYMN br Meetings to organize the march began in early January at Rodwell s apartment in Bleecker Street At first there was difficulty getting some of the major New York City organizations like Gay Activists Alliance GAA to send representatives Craig Rodwell and his partner Fred Sargeant Ellen Broidy Michael Brown Marty Nixon and Foster Gunnison Jr of Mattachine made up the core group of the CSLD Umbrella Committee CSLDUC For initial funding Gunnison served as treasurer and sought donations from the national homophile organizations and sponsors while Sargeant solicited donations via the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop customer mailing list and Nixon worked to gain financial support from GLF in his position as treasurer for that organization Other mainstays of the organizing committee were Judy Miller Jack Waluska Steve Gerrie and Brenda Howard of GLF Believing that more people would turn out for the march on a Sunday and so as to mark the date of the start of the Stonewall uprising the CSLDUC scheduled the date for the first march for Sunday June With Dick Leitsch s replacement as president of Mattachine NY by Michael Kotis in April opposition to the march by Mattachine ended br br Christopher Street Liberation Day on June marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with the march which was the first Gay Pride march in New York history and covered the blocks to Central Park The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers The New York Times reported on the front page that the marchers took up the entire street for about city blocks Reporting by The Village Voice was positive describing the out front resistance that grew out of the police raid on the Stonewall Inn one year ago There was also an assembly on Christopher Street br br br Spread br br On Saturday June Chicago Gay Liberation organized a march from Washington Square Park Bughouse Square to the Water Tower at the intersection of Michigan and Chicago avenues which was the route originally planned and then many of the participants extemporaneously marched on to the Civic Center now Richard J Daley Plaza The date was chosen because the Stonewall events began on the last Saturday of June and because organizers wanted to reach the maximum number of Michigan Avenue shoppers Subsequent Chicago parades have been held on the last Sunday of June coinciding with the date of many similar parades elsewhere Subsequently during the same weekend gay activist groups on the West Coast of the United States held a march in Los Angeles and a march and Gay in in San Francisco br The next year Gay Pride marches took place in Boston Dallas Milwaukee London Paris West Berlin and Stockholm By the participating cities included Atlanta Brighton Buffalo Detroit Washington D C Miami and Philadelphia as well as San Francisco br Frank Kameny soon realized the pivotal change brought by the Stonewall riots An organizer of gay activism in the s he was used to persuasion trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different from themselves When he and other people marched in front of the White House the State Department and Independence Hall only five years earlier their objective was to look as if they could work for the U S government Ten people marched with Kameny then and they alerted no press to their intentions Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in he later observed By the time of Stonewall we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country A year later there were at least fifteen hundred By two years later to the extent that a count could be made it was twenty five hundred br Similar to Kameny s regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as one of the greatest mistakes of his life The image of gays retaliating against police after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals Kay Lahusen who photographed the marches in stated Up to this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale br br br s and s br br In the s there was a major cultural shift in the Stonewall Riot commemorations The previous more loosely organized grassroots marches and parades were taken over by more organized and less radical elements of the gay community The marches began dropping Liberation and Freedom from their names under pressure from more conservative members of the community replacing them with the philosophy of Gay Pride in San Francisco the name of the gay parade and celebration was not changed from Gay Freedom Day Parade to Gay Pride Day Parade until The Greek lambda symbol and the pink triangle which had been revolutionary symbols of the Gay Liberation Movement were tidied up and incorporated into the Gay Pride or Pride movement providing some symbolic continuity with its more radical beginnings The pink triangle was also the inspiration for the homomonument in Amsterdam commemorating all gay men and lesbians who have been subjected to persecution because of their homosexuality br br br LGBT Pride Month br br LGBT Pride Month occurs in the United States to commemorate the Stonewall riots which occurred at the end of June As a result many pride events are held during this month to recognize the impact LGBT people have had in the world br br Three presidents of the United States have officially declared a pride month First President Bill Clinton declared

Trump became the first Republican president to acknowledge LGBT Pride Month in but he did so through tweeting rather than an official proclamation the tweet was later released as an official Statement from the President br Beginning in Google displayed some LGBT related search results with different rainbow colored patterns each year during June In Google also included rainbow coloured streets on Google Maps to display Gay Pride marches occurring across the world br At many colleges which are not in session in June LGBT pride is instead celebrated during April which is dubbed Gaypril br Pride

picture of the flying American and Pride flags on its Abu Dhabi residence stating that it supported dignity and equality of all people While the move was remarkable it faced backlash online and was extensively criticized by the locals over social media Many called it disrespectful and insulting br The term Wrath Month which started as a Twitter meme in eventually came to be used by some as a response to the perceived tameness of Pride Month br br br Criticism br From both outside and inside the LGBT community there is criticism and protest against pride events Bob Christie s documentary Beyond Gay The Politics of Pride evaluates gay pride events in different countries within the context of local opposition br br br Initiatives and criticism by governments and political leaders br br br Brazil br br In August S o Paulo city alderman Carlos Apolin rio of the right wing Democrats Party sponsored a bill to organize and sponsor Heterosexual Pride Day on the third Sunday of December Apolin rio an Evangelical Protestant stated that the intent of the parade was a struggle against excesses and privileges Members of Gay Group of Bahia and the Workers Party opposed the bill as enhancing the possibility of discrimination and prejudice The bill was nevertheless passed by the city council but never received the signature of mayor Gilberto Kassab br A Brazilian photographer was

Chief Marlon Macedo the police alleged that the photographer was interfering with their work did not have identification and became aggressive when he was asked to move Ben denied the allegations saying the police were belligerent and that the scene was witnessed by over people reported Ag ncia Estado br br br Spain br In a interview for the biography La Reina muy cerca The Queen Up Close by Spanish journalist and writer Pilar Urbano Queen Sof a of Spain sparked controversy by voicing her disapproval of LGBT pride This was in addition to overstepping her official duties as a member of the Royal Family by censoring the Spanish Law on Marriage in how it names same sex unions as matrimonio marriage Without using the slogan Straight Pride Queen Sof a was directly quoted as saying that if heterosexuals were to take the streets as the LGBT community does for Gay Pride parades that the former collective would bring Madrid to a standstill br Even though the Royal Household of Spain

order br br br Uganda br In Ugandan police broke up a gay pride event in the capital Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda br br br In group br In a special queer issue of The Stranger in openly gay author pundit and journalist Dan Savage questioned the relevance of pride thirty years later writing that pride was an effective antidote to shame imposed on LGBT people but that pride is now making LGBT people dull and slow as a group as well as being a constant reminder of shame however he also states that pride in some simpler forms is still useful to individuals struggling with shame Savage writes that gay pride can also lead to disillusionment where an LGBT individual realizes the reality that sexual orientation does not say much about a person s personality after being led by the illusion that LGBT individuals are part of a co supportive and inherently good group of people br The growth and commercialization of Christopher Street Days coupled with their de politicization has led to an alternative CSD in Berlin the so called Kreuzberger CSD or Transgenialer Transgenial Trans Ingenious CSD Political party members are not invited for speeches nor can parties or companies sponsor floats After the parade there is a festival with a stage for political speakers and entertainers Groups discuss lesbian transsexual transgender gay or queer perspectives on issues such as poverty and unemployment benefits Hartz IV gentrification or Fortress Europe br In June American philosopher and theorist Judith Butler refused the Civil Courage Award Zivilcouragepreis of the Christopher Street Day Parade in Berlin Germany at the award ceremony arguing and lamenting in a speech that the parade had become too commercial and was ignoring the problems of racism and the double discrimination facing homosexual or transsexual migrants According to Butler even the organizers themselves promote racism The general manager of the CSD committee Robert Kastl countered Butler s allegations and pointed out that the organizers already awarded a counseling center for lesbians dealing with double discrimination in Regarding the allegations of commercialism Kastl further explained that the CSD organizers do not require small groups to pay a participation fee which starts at and goes up to He also distanced himself from all forms of racism and Islamophobia br Some social movements and associations have criticized modern iterations of pride viewing it as a depletion of the claims of such demonstrations and the merchandization of the parade In this respect they defend in countries like Spain the United States or Canada a Critical Pride celebration to give the events a political meaning again Gay Shame a radical movement within the LGBT community opposes the assimilation of LGBT people into mainstream heteronormative society the commodification of non heterosexual identity and culture and in particular the over commercialization of pride events br br br Straight pride analogy br br Straight pride and heterosexual pride are analogies and slogans that contrast heterosexuality with homosexuality by copying the phrase gay pride Originating from the culture wars in the United States straight pride is a form of conservative backlash as there is no straight or heterosexual civil rights movement br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br Alwood
