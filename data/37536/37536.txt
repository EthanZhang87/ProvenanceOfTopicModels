Central Park is an urban park between the Upper West Side and Upper East Side neighborhoods of Manhattan in New York City that was the first landscaped park in the United States It is the sixth largest park in the city containing acres ha and the most visited urban park in the United States with an estimated million visitors annually as of br The creation of a large park in Manhattan was first proposed in the s and a acre ha park approved in In landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux won a design competition for the park with their Greensward Plan Construction began in existing structures including a majority Black settlement named Seneca Village were seized through eminent domain and razed The park s first areas were opened to the public in late Additional land at the northern end of Central Park was purchased in and the park was completed in After a period of decline in the early th century New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses started a program to clean up Central Park in the s The Central Park Conservancy created in to combat further deterioration in the late th century refurbished many parts of the park starting in the s br The park s main attractions include the Ramble and Lake Hallett Nature Sanctuary the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir and Sheep Meadow amusement attractions such as Wollman Rink Central Park Carousel and the Central Park Zoo formal spaces such as the Central Park Mall and Bethesda Terrace and the Delacorte Theater The biologically diverse ecosystem has several hundred species of flora and fauna Recreational activities include carriage horse and bicycle tours bicycling sports facilities and concerts and events such as Shakespeare in the Park Central Park is traversed by a system of roads and walkways and is served by public transportation br Its size and cultural position make it a model for the world s urban parks Its influence earned Central Park the designations of National Historic Landmark in and of New York City scenic landmark in Central Park is owned by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation but has been managed by the Central Park Conservancy since under a contract with the municipal government in a public private partnership The Conservancy a non profit organization raises Central Park s annual operating budget and is responsible for all basic care of the park br br br Description br br Central Park is bordered by Central Park North at th Street Central Park South at th Street Central Park West at Eighth Avenue and Fifth Avenue on the east The park is adjacent to the neighborhoods of Harlem to the north Midtown Manhattan to the south the Upper West Side to the west and the Upper East Side to the east It measures miles km from north to south and miles km from west to east br br br Design and layout br Central Park is split into three sections the North End extending above the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir Mid Park between the reservoir to the north and the Lake and Conservatory Water to the south and South End below the Lake and Conservatory Water The park has five visitor centers Charles A Dana Discovery Center Belvedere Castle Chess Checkers House the Dairy and Columbus Circle br The park has been described as the first landscaped park in the United States It has natural looking plantings and landforms having been almost entirely landscaped when built in the s and s It has eight lakes and ponds that were created artificially by damming natural seeps and flows There are several wooded sections lawns meadows and minor grassy areas There are children s playgrounds and miles km of drives br Central Park is the fifth largest park in New York City behind Pelham Bay Park the Staten Island Greenbelt Van Cortlandt Park and Flushing Meadows Corona Park with an area of acres ha sq mi km Central Park constitutes its own United States census tract numbered According to American Community Survey five year estimates the park was home to four females with a median age of Though the United States Census recorded residents within the census tract park officials have rejected the claim of anyone permanently living there br br br Visitors br Central Park is the most visited urban park in the United States and one of the most visited tourist attractions worldwide with million visitors in The number of unique visitors is much lower a Central Park Conservancy report conducted in found that between eight and nine million people visited Central Park with to million visits between them By comparison there were million visitors in and million in br The number of tourists as a proportion of total visitors is much lower in one fifth of the million park visitors recorded that year were estimated to be tourists The Conservancy report gave a similar ratio of park usage only of visits are by people visiting Central Park for the first time According to the report nearly two thirds of visitors are regular park users who enter the park at least once weekly and about of visitors live in New York City Moreover peak visitation occurred during summer weekends and most visitors used the park for passive recreational activities such as walking or sightseeing rather than for active sport br br br Governance br The park is managed and maintained by the Central Park Conservancy a private not for profit organization under contract with the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation NYC Parks The president of the Conservancy is the ex officio administrator of Central Park who effectively oversees the work of both the park s private and public employees under the authority of the publicly appointed Central Park Administrator who reports to both the parks commissioner and the Conservancy s president The Central Park Conservancy was founded in as a nonprofit organization with a citizen board to assist with the city s initiatives to clean up and rehabilitate the park The Conservancy took over the park s management duties from NYC Parks in though NYC Parks retained ownership of Central Park The conservancy provides maintenance support and staff training programs for other public parks in New York City and has assisted with the development of new parks such as the High Line and Brooklyn Bridge Park br Central Park is patrolled by its own New York City Police Department precinct the nd Central Park Precinct at the th Street transverse The precinct employs both regular police and auxiliary officers The nd Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the s with crimes across all categories having decreased by between and The precinct saw no murders three rapes robberies nine felony assaults five burglaries grand larcenies and no grand larcenies auto in The citywide New York City Parks Enforcement Patrol patrols Central Park and the Central Park Conservancy sometimes hires seasonal Parks Enforcement Patrol officers to protect certain features such as the Conservatory Garden br A free volunteer medical emergency service the Central Park Medical Unit operates within Central Park The unit operates a rapid response patrol with bicycles ambulances and an all terrain vehicle Before the unit was established in municipal EMS often took over minutes to respond to incidents in the park br br br History br br br Planning br Between and New York City s population nearly quadrupled As the city expanded northward up Manhattan people were drawn to the few existing open spaces mainly cemeteries for passive recreation These were seen as escapes from the noise and chaotic life in the city which at the time was almost entirely centered on Lower Manhattan The Commissioners Plan of the outline for Manhattan s modern street grid included several smaller open spaces but not Central Park As such John Randel Jr had surveyed the grounds for the construction of intersections within the modern day park site The only remaining surveying bolt from his survey is embedded in a rock north of the present Dairy and the th Street transverse marking the location where West th Street would have intersected Sixth Avenue br br br Site br br By the s members of the city s elite were publicly calling for the construction of a new large park in Manhattan At the time Manhattan s seventeen squares comprised a combined acres ha of land the largest of which was the acre ha Battery Park at Manhattan island s southern tip These plans were endorsed in by New York Evening Post editor William Cullen Bryant and in by Andrew Jackson Downing one of the first American landscape designers br Mayor Ambrose Kingsland in a message to the New York City Common Council on May set forth the necessity and benefits of a large new park and proposed the council move to create such a park Kingsland s proposal was referred to the council s Committee of Lands which endorsed the proposal The committee chose Jones s Wood a acre ha tract of land between th and th streets on the Upper East Side as the park s site as Bryant had advocated for Jones Wood The acquisition was controversial because of its location small size relative to other potential uptown tracts and cost A bill to acquire Jones s Wood was invalidated as unconstitutional so attention turned to a second site a acre ha area known as Central Park bounded by th and th streets between Fifth and Eighth avenues Croton Aqueduct Board president Nicholas Dean who proposed the Central Park site chose it because the Croton Aqueduct s acre ha million US gallon L collecting reservoir would be in the geographical center In July the New York State Legislature passed the Central Park Act authorizing the purchase of the present day site of Central Park br The board of land commissioners conducted property assessments on more than lots in the area completing them by July While the assessments were ongoing proposals to downsize the plans were vetoed by mayor Fernando Wood At the time the site was occupied by free black people and Irish immigrants who had developed a property owning community there since Most of the Central Park site s residents lived in small villages such as Pigtown Seneca Village or in the school and convent at Mount St Vincent s Academy Clearing began shortly after the land commission s report was released in October and approximately residents were evicted under eminent domain Though supporters claimed that the park would cost just million the total cost of the land ended up being million equivalent to million in more than the price that the United States would pay for Alaska a few years later br br br Design contest br In June Fernando Wood appointed a consulting board of seven people headed by author Washington Irving to inspire public confidence in the proposed development Wood hired military engineer Egbert Ludovicus Viele as the park s chief engineer tasking him with a topographical survey of the site The following April the state legislature passed a bill to authorize the appointment of four Democratic and seven Republican commissioners who had exclusive control over the planning and construction process Though Viele had already devised a plan for the park the commissioners disregarded it and retained him to complete only the topographical surveys The Central Park Commission began hosting a landscape design contest shortly after its creation The commission specified that each entry contain extremely detailed specifications as mandated by the consulting board Thirty three firms or organizations submitted plans br In April the park commissioners selected Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux s Greensward Plan as the winning design Three other plans were designated as runners up and featured in a city exhibit Unlike many of the other designs which effectively integrated Central Park with the surrounding city Olmsted and Vaux s proposal introduced clear separations with sunken transverse roadways The plan eschewed symmetry instead opting for a more picturesque design It was influenced by the pastoral ideals of landscaped cemeteries such as Mount Auburn in Cambridge Massachusetts and Green Wood in Brooklyn The design was also inspired by Olmsted s visit to Birkenhead Park in Birkenhead England which is generally acknowledged as the first publicly funded civil park in the world According to Olmsted the park was of great importance as the first real Park made in this country a democratic development of the highest significance br br br Construction br Construction of Central Park s design was executed by a gamut of professionals Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux were the primary designers assisted by board member Andrew Haswell Green architect Jacob Wrey Mould master gardener Ignaz Anton Pilat and engineer George E Waring Jr Olmsted was responsible for the overall plan while Vaux designed some of the finer details Mould who worked frequently with Vaux designed the Central Park Esplanade and the Tavern on the Green building Pilat was the park s chief landscape architect whose primary responsibility was the importation and placement of plants within the park A corps of construction engineers and foremen managed by superintending engineer William H Grant were tasked with the measuring and constructing architectural features such as paths roads and buildings Waring was one of the engineers working under Grant s leadership and was in charge of land drainage br Central Park was difficult to construct because of the generally rocky and swampy landscape Around five million cubic feet m of soil and rocks had to be transported out of the park and more gunpowder was used to clear the area than was used at the Battle of Gettysburg during the American Civil War More than cubic yards m of topsoil were transported from Long Island and New Jersey because the original soil was neither fertile nor sufficiently substantial to sustain the flora specified in the Greensward Plan Modern steam powered equipment and custom tree moving machines augmented the work of unskilled laborers In total over individuals helped construct Central Park Because of extreme precautions taken to minimize collateral damage five laborers died during the project at a time when fatality rates were generally much higher br During the development of Central Park Superintendent Olmsted hired several dozen mounted police officers who were classified into two types of keepers park keepers and gate keepers The mounted police were viewed favorably by park patrons and were later incorporated into a permanent patrol The regulations were sometimes strict For instance prohibited actions included games of chance speech making large congregations such as picnics or picking flowers or other parts of plants These ordinances were effective by there had been nearly eight million visits and only arrests in the park s history br br br Late s br br In late August workers began building fences clearing vegetation draining the land and leveling uneven terrain By the following month chief engineer Viele reported that the project employed nearly workers Olmsted employed workers using day labor hiring men directly without any contracts and paying them by the day Many of the laborers were Irish immigrants or first or second generation Irish Americans and some Germans and Italians there were no black or female laborers The workers were often underpaid and workers would often take jobs at other construction projects to supplement their income A pattern of seasonal hiring was established wherein more workers would be hired and paid at higher rates during the summers br For several months the park commissioners faced funding issues and a dedicated workforce and funding stream was not secured until June The landscaped Upper Reservoir was the only part of the park that the commissioners were not responsible for constructing instead the Reservoir would be built by the Croton Aqueduct board Work on the Reservoir started in April The first major work in Central Park involved grading the driveways and draining the land in the park s southern section The Lake in Central Park s southwestern section was the first feature to open to the public in December followed by the Ramble in June The same year the New York State Legislature authorized the purchase of an additional acres ha at the northern end of Central Park from th to th Streets The section of Central Park south of th Street was mostly completed by br The park commissioners reported in June that million had been spent on the construction to date As a result of the sharply rising construction costs the commissioners eliminated or downsized several features in the Greensward Plan Based on claims of cost mismanagement the New York State Senate commissioned the Swiss engineer Julius Kellersberger to write a report on the park Kellersberger s report submitted in stated that the commission s management of the park was a triumphant success br br br s br br Olmsted often clashed with the park commissioners notably with Chief Commissioner Green Olmsted resigned in June and Green was appointed to Olmsted s position Vaux resigned in because of what he saw as pressure from Green As superintendent of the park Green accelerated construction though having little experience in architecture He implemented a style of micromanagement keeping records of the smallest transactions in an effort to reduce costs Green finalized the negotiations to purchase the northernmost acres ha of the park which was later converted into a rugged woodland and the Harlem Meer waterway br When the American Civil War began in the park commissioners decided to continue building Central Park since significant parts of the park had already been completed Only three major structures were completed during the Civil War the Music Stand and the Casino restaurant both later demolished and the Bethesda Terrace and Fountain By late the park south of nd Street had been completed except for various fences Work had begun on the northern section of the park but was complicated by a need to preserve the historic McGowan s Pass The Upper Reservoir was completed the following year br During this period Central Park began to gain popularity One of the main attractions was the Carriage Parade a daily display of horse drawn carriages that traversed the park Park patronage grew steadily by Central Park accommodated nearly three million pedestrians horses and million vehicles annually The park had activities for New Yorkers of all social classes While the wealthy could ride horses on bridle paths or travel in horse drawn carriages almost everyone was able to participate in sports such as ice skating or rowing or listen to concerts at the Mall s bandstand br Olmsted and Vaux were re hired in mid Several structures were erected including the Children s District the Ballplayers House and the Dairy in the southern part of Central Park Construction commenced on Belvedere Castle Harlem Meer and structures on Conservatory Water and the Lake br br br completion br br The Tammany Hall political machine which was the largest political force in New York at the time was in control of Central Park for a brief period beginning in April A new charter created by Tammany boss William M Tweed abolished the old member commission and replaced it with one with five men composed of Green and four other Tammany connected figures Subsequently Olmsted and Vaux resigned again from the project in November After Tweed s embezzlement was publicly revealed in leading to his imprisonment Olmsted and Vaux were re hired and the Central Park Commission appointed new members who were mostly in favor of Olmsted br One of the areas that remained relatively untouched was the underdeveloped western side of Central Park though some large structures would be erected in the park s remaining empty plots By Manhattan Square had been reserved for the American Museum of Natural History founded three years before at the Arsenal A corresponding area on the East Side originally intended as a playground would later become the Metropolitan Museum of Art In the final years of Central Park s construction Vaux and Mould designed several structures for Central Park The park s sheepfold now Tavern on the Green and Ladies Meadow were designed by Mould in followed by the administrative offices on the th Street transverse in Even though Olmsted and Vaux s partnership was dissolved by the end of the park was not officially completed until br br br Late th and early th centuries first decline br br By the s the park s patrons increasingly came to include the middle and working class and strict regulations were gradually eased such as those against public gatherings Because of the heightened visitor count neglect by the Tammany administration and budget cuts demanded by taxpayers the maintenance expenses for Central Park had reached a nadir by Olmsted blamed politicians real estate owners and park workers for Central Park s decline though high maintenance costs were also a factor By the s the park faced several challenges cars were becoming commonplace and with the proliferation of amusements and refreshment stands people were beginning to see the park as a recreational attraction The opening of the New York City Subway displaced Central Park as the city s predominant leisure destination as New Yorkers could travel to farther destinations such as Coney Island beaches or Broadway theaters for a five cent fare br In the late th century the landscape architect Samuel Parsons took the position of New York City parks superintendent A onetime apprentice of Calvert Vaux Parsons helped restore the nurseries of Central Park in Parsons closely followed Olmsted s original vision for the park restoring Central Park s trees while blocking the placement of several large statues in the park Under Parsons leadership two circles now Duke Ellington and Frederick Douglass Circles were constructed at the northern corners of the park He was removed in May following a lengthy dispute over whether an expense to replace the soil in the park was unnecessary A succession of Tammany affiliated Democratic mayors were indifferent toward Central Park br Several park advocacy groups were formed in the early th century To preserve the park s character the citywide Parks and Playground Association and a consortium of multiple Central Park civic groups operating under the Parks Conservation Association were formed in the s and s These associations advocated against such changes to the park as the construction of a library sports stadium a cultural center and an underground parking lot A third group the Central Park Association was created in The Central Park Association and the Parks and Playgrounds Association were merged into the Park Association of New York City two years later br The Heckscher Playground named after philanthropist August Heckscher who donated the play equipment opened near its southern end in and quickly became popular with poor immigrant families The following year Mayor Jimmy Walker commissioned landscape designer Hermann W Merkel to create a plan to improve Central Park Merkel s plans would combat vandalism and plant destruction rehabilitate paths and add eight new playgrounds at a cost of million One of the suggested modifications underground irrigation pipes were installed soon after Merkel s report was submitted The other improvements outlined in the report such as fences to mitigate plant destruction were postponed due to the Great Depression br br br s to s Moses rehabilitation br In Republican Fiorello La Guardia was elected mayor of New York City He unified the five park related departments then in existence Newly appointed city parks commissioner Robert Moses was given the task of cleaning up the park and he summarily fired many of the Tammany era staff At the time the lawns were filled with weeds and dust patches while many trees were dying or already dead Monuments had been vandalized equipment and walkways were broken and ironwork was rusted Moses s biographer Robert Caro later said The once beautiful Mall looked like a scene of a wild party the morning after Benches lay on their backs their legs jabbing at the sky br During the following year the city s parks department replanted lawns and flowers replaced dead trees and bushes sandblasted walls repaired roads and bridges and restored statues The park menagerie was transformed into the modern Central Park Zoo and a rat extermination program was instituted within the zoo Another dramatic change was Moses removal of the Hoover valley shantytown at the north end of Turtle Pond which became the acre ha Great Lawn The western part of the Pond at the park s southeast corner became an ice skating rink called Wollman Rink roads were improved or widened and twenty one playgrounds were added These projects used funds from the New Deal program and donations from the public Moses removed Sheep Meadow s sheep to make way for the Tavern on the Green restaurant br Renovations in the s and s include a restoration of the Harlem Meer completed in and a new boathouse completed in Moses began construction on several other recreational features in Central Park such as playgrounds and ball fields One of the more controversial projects proposed during this time was a dispute over a parking lot for Tavern in the Green The controversy placed Moses an urban planner known for displacing families for other large projects around the city against a group of mothers who frequented a wooded hollow at the site of a parking lot Though opposed by the parents Moses approved the destruction of part of the hollow Demolition work commenced after Central Park was closed for the night and was only halted after the threat of a lawsuit br br br s and s Events Era and second decline br Moses left his position in May No park commissioner since then has been able to exercise the same degree of power nor did NYC Parks remain in as stable a position in the aftermath of his departure Eight commissioners held the office in the twenty years following his departure The city experienced economic and social changes with some residents moving to the suburbs Interest in Central Park s landscape had long since declined and it was now mostly being used for recreation Several unrealized additions were proposed for Central Park in that decade such as a public housing development a golf course and a revolving world s fair br The s marked the beginning of an Events Era in Central Park that reflected the widespread cultural and political trends of the period The Public Theater s annual Shakespeare in the Park festival was settled in the Delacorte Theater and summer performances were instituted on the Sheep Meadow and the Great Lawn by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and the Metropolitan Opera During the late s the park became the venue for rallies and cultural events such as the love ins and be ins of the period The same year Lasker Rink opened in the northern part of the park the facility served as an ice rink in winter and Central Park s only swimming pool in summer br By the mid s managerial neglect resulted in a decline in park conditions A report noted that the park suffered from severe erosion and tree decay and that individual structures were being vandalized or neglected The Central Park Community Fund was subsequently created based on the recommendation of a report from a Columbia University professor The Fund then commissioned a study of the park s management and suggested the appointment of both a NYC Parks administrator and a board of citizens In Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis established the Office of Central Park Administrator and appointed Elizabeth Barlow the executive director of the Central Park Task Force to the position The Central Park Conservancy a nonprofit organization with a citizen board was founded the following year br br br s to s restoration br br Under the leadership of the Central Park Conservancy the park s reclamation began by addressing needs that could not be met within NYC Parks existing resources The Conservancy hired interns and a small restoration staff to reconstruct and repair unique rustic features undertaking horticultural projects and removing graffiti under the broken windows theory which advocated removing visible signs of decay The first structure to be renovated was the Dairy which reopened as the park s first visitor center in The Sheep Meadow which reopened the following year was the first landscape to be restored Bethesda Terrace and Fountain the USS Maine National Monument and the Bow Bridge were also rehabilitated By then the Conservancy was engaged in design efforts and long term restoration planning and in Davis and Barlow announced a year million Central Park Management and Restoration Plan The long closed Belvedere Castle was renovated and reopened in while the Central Park Zoo closed for a full reconstruction that year To reduce the maintenance effort large gatherings such as free concerts were canceled br On completion of the planning stage in the Conservancy launched its first campaign and mapped out a year restoration plan Over the next several years the campaign restored landmarks in the southern part of the park such as Grand Army Plaza and the police station at the th Street transverse while Conservatory Garden in the northeastern corner of the park was restored to a design by Lynden B Miller Real estate developer Donald Trump renovated the Wollman Rink in after plans to renovate it were delayed repeatedly The following year the Zoo reopened after a million four year renovation br Work on the northern end of the park began in A million campaign announced in resulted in the restoration of bridle trails the Mall the Harlem Meer and the North Woods and the construction of the Dana Discovery Center on the Harlem Meer This was followed by the Conservancy s overhaul of the acres ha near the Great Lawn and Turtle Pond which was completed in The Upper Reservoir was decommissioned as a part of the city s water supply system in and was renamed after former U S first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis the next year During the mid s the Conservancy hired additional volunteers and implemented a zone based system of management throughout the park The Conservancy assumed much of the park s operations in early br Renovations continued through the first decade of the st century and a project to restore the pond was commenced in Four years later the Conservancy replaced a chain link fence with a replica of the original cast iron fence that surrounded the Upper Reservoir It started refurbishing the ceiling tiles of the Bethesda Arcade which was completed in Soon after the Central Park Conservancy began restoring the Ramble and Lake in a project that was completed in Bank Rock Bridge was restored and the Gill which empties into the lake was reconstructed to approximate its dramatic original form The final feature to be restored was the East Meadow which was rehabilitated in br br br s to present br In the New York City Council proposed a study on the viability of banning vehicular traffic from the park s drives The next year mayor Bill de Blasio announced that West and East drives north of nd Street would be closed to vehicular traffic because the city s data showed that closing the roads did not adversely impact traffic flows Subsequently in June the remaining drives south of nd Street were closed to vehicular traffic br Several structures were renovated Belvedere Castle was closed in for an extensive renovation reopening in June Later in it was announced that the Delacorte Theater would be closed from to for a million rebuild The Central Park Conservancy further announced that Lasker Rink would be closed for a million renovation between and br In March in response to the coronavirus pandemic temporary field hospitals were set up within the park to treat overflow patients from area hospitals By mid the New York City government was considering erecting tents in Central Park to temporarily house asylum seekers This move came after the federal government repealed an order authorizing Title expulsions of migrants which had been implemented during the COVID pandemic A renovation of the Chess and Checkers House was completed in June In addition pickleball courts were added to Wollman Rink in and became permanent the next year The Central Park Conservancy allocated million in early to fix sidewalks on blocks immediately surrounding the park br br br Landscape features br br br Geology br br There are four different types of bedrock in Manhattan In Central Park Manhattan schist and Hartland schist which are both metamorphosed sedimentary rock are exposed in various outcroppings The other two types Fordham gneiss an older deeper layer and Inwood marble metamorphosed limestone which overlays the gneiss do not surface in the park Fordham gneiss which consists of metamorphosed igneous rocks was formed a billion years ago during the Grenville orogeny that occurred during the creation of an ancient super continent Manhattan schist and Hartland schist were formed in the Iapetus Ocean during the Taconic orogeny in the Paleozoic era about million years ago when the tectonic plates began to merge to form the supercontinent Pangaea Cameron s Line a fault zone that traverses Central Park on an east west axis divides the outcroppings of Hartland schist to the south and Manhattan schist to the north br Various glaciers have covered the area of Central Park in the past with the most recent being the Wisconsin glacier which receded about years ago Evidence of past glaciers can be seen throughout the park in the form of glacial erratics large boulders dropped by the receding glacier and north south glacial striations visible on stone outcroppings Alignments of glacial erratics called boulder trains are present throughout Central Park The most notable of these outcroppings is Rat Rock also known as Umpire Rock a circular outcropping at the southwestern corner of the park It measures feet m wide and feet m tall with different east west and north faces Boulderers sometimes congregate there A single glacial pothole with yellow clay is near the southwest corner of the park br The underground geology of Central Park was altered by the construction of several subway lines underneath it and by the New York City Water Tunnel No approximately feet m underground Excavations for the project have uncovered pegmatite feldspar quartz biotite and several metals br br br Wooded areas and lawns br br There are three wooded areas in Central Park North Woods the Ramble and Hallett Nature Sanctuary North Woods the largest of the woodlands is at the northwestern corner of Central Park It covers about acres ha adjacent to North Meadow The name sometimes applies to other attractions in the park s northern end these adjacent features plus the area of North Woods can be acres ha North Woods contains the acre ha Ravine a forest with deciduous trees on its northwestern slope and the Loch a small stream that winds diagonally through North Woods br The Ramble is in the southern third of the park next to the Lake Covering to acres to ha it contains a series of winding paths The area contains a diverse selection of vegetation and other flora which attracts a plethora of birds At least species of birds have been spotted in the Ramble over the years Historically the Ramble was known as a place for private homosexual encounters due to its seclusion br The Hallett Nature Sanctuary is at the southeastern corner of Central Park It is the smallest wooded area at acres ha Originally known as the Promontory it was renamed after civic activist and birder George Hervey Hallett Jr in The Hallett Sanctuary was closed to the public from to May when it was reopened allowing limited access br The Central Park Conservancy classifies its remaining green space into four types of lawns labeled alphabetically based on usage and the amount of maintenance needed There are seven high priority A Lawns collectively covering acres ha that are heavily used Sheep Meadow Great Lawn North Meadow East Meadow Conservatory Garden Heckscher Ballfields and the Lawn Bowling and Croquet Greens near Sheep Meadow These are permanently surrounded by fences are constantly maintained and are closed during the off season Another lawns covering acres ha are classed as B Lawns and are fenced off only during off seasons while an additional acres ha are C Lawns and are only occasionally fenced off The lowest prioritized type of turf D Lawns cover acres ha and are open year round with few barriers or access restrictions br br br Watercourses br br Central Park is home to numerous bodies of water The northernmost lake Harlem Meer is near the northeastern corner of the park and covers nearly acres ha Located in a wooded area of oak cypress and beech trees it was named after Harlem one of Manhattan s first suburban communities and was built after the completion of the southern portion of the park Harlem Meer allows catch and release fishing It is fed by two interconnected water features the Pool a pond within the North Woods fed by drinking water and the Loch a small stream with three cascades that winds through the North Woods These are all adapted from a single watercourse called Montayne s Rivulet originally fed from a natural spring but later replenished by the city s water system Lasker Rink is above the mouth of the Loch where it drains into the Harlem Meer br South of Harlem Meer and the Pool is Central Park s largest lake the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir known as the Central Park Reservoir before It was constructed between and Covering an area of acres ha between th and th streets the reservoir reaches a depth of more than feet m in places and contains about billion U S gallons billion liters of water The Onassis Reservoir was created as a new landscaped storage reservoir to the north of the Croton Aqueduct s rectangular receiving reservoir Because of the Onassis Reservoir s shape East Drive was built as a straight path with little clearance between the reservoir to the west and Fifth Avenue to the east It was decommissioned in and renamed after Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis the following year after her death br The Turtle Pond is at the southern edge of the Great Lawn The pond was originally part of the Croton receiving reservoir The receiving reservoir was drained starting in and the dry reservoir bed was temporarily used as a homeless encampment when filling stopped during the Great Depression The Great Lawn was completed in on the site of the reservoir Until it was known as Belvedere Lake after the castle at its southwestern corner br The Lake south of the th Street transverse covers nearly acres ha Originally it was part of the Sawkill Creek which flowed near the American Museum of Natural History The Lake was among the first features to be completed opening to skaters in December It was intended to accommodate boats in the summer and ice skaters in winter The Loeb Boathouse on the eastern shore of the Lake rents out rowboats kayaks and gondolas and houses a restaurant The Lake is spanned by Bow Bridge at its center and its northern inlet Bank Rock Bay is spanned by the Bank Rock or Oak Bridge Ladies Pond spanned by two bridges on the western end of the Lake was infilled in the s br Directly east of the Lake is Conservatory Water on the site of an unbuilt formal garden The shore of Conservatory Water contains the Kerbs Memorial Boathouse where patrons can rent and navigate model boats br In the park s southeast corner is the Pond with an area of acres ha The Pond was adapted from part of the former DeVoor s Mill Stream which used to flow into the East River at the modern day neighborhood of Turtle Bay The western section of the Pond was converted into Wollman Rink in br br br Wildlife br Central Park is biologically diverse A survey of park species by William E Macaulay Honors College found total species including species that were not previously known to live there br br br Flora br According to a survey Central Park had more than trees representing a decrease from the trees that were recorded in the park in The majority of them are native to New York City but there are several clusters of non native species With few exceptions the trees in Central Park were mostly planted or placed manually Over four million trees shrubs and plants representing approximately species were planted or imported to the park In Central Park s earliest years two plant nurseries were maintained within the park boundaries a demolished nursery near the Arsenal and the still extant Conservatory Garden Central Park Conservancy later took over regular maintenance of the park s flora allocating gardeners to one of zones for maintenance purposes br Central Park contains ten great tree clusters that are specially recognized by NYC Parks These include four individual American elms and one American elm grove the pine trees in the Arthur Ross Pinetum a black tupelo in the Ramble Yoshino cherries on the east side of the Onassis Reservoir one of the park s oldest London plane trees at th Street and an Euodia at Heckscher Playground The American elms in Central Park are the largest remaining stands in the Northeastern United States protected by their isolation from the Dutch elm disease that devastated the tree throughout its native range There are several tree walks that run through Central Park br br br Fauna br br Central Park contains various migratory birds during their spring and fall migration on the Atlantic Flyway The first official list of birds observed in Central Park which numbered species was published in Forest and Stream in by Augustus G Paine Jr and Lewis B Woodruff Overall bird species have been seen in the park since the first official list of records was published and an estimated species are spotted every season No single group is responsible for tracking Central Park s bird species Some of the more famous birds include a male red tailed hawk called Pale Male who made his perch on an apartment building overlooking Central Park in A mandarin duck nicknamed Mandarin Patinkin received international media attention in late and early due to its colorful appearance and the species presence outside its native range in East Asia Another bird an Eurasian eagle owl named Flaco gained attention in when he escaped from the Central Park Zoo after his enclosure was vandalized More infamously Eugene Schieffelin released imported European starlings in Central Park in which led to them becoming an invasive species across North America br Central Park has approximately ten species of mammals as of Bats a nocturnal order have been found in dark crevices Because of the prevalence of raccoons the Parks Department posts rabies advisories Eastern gray squirrels eastern chipmunks and Virginia opossums inhabit the park A squirrel census found there were Eastern Gray squirrels in Central Park br There are invertebrate species in Central Park Nannarrup hoffmani a centipede species discovered in Central Park in is one of the smallest centipedes in the world at about inches mm long The more prevalent Asian long horned beetle is an invasive species that has infected trees in Long Island and Manhattan including in Central Park br Turtles fish and frogs live in Central Park There are five turtle species red eared sliders snapping turtles painted turtles musk turtles and box turtles Most of the turtles live in Turtle Pond and many of these are former pets that were released into the park The fish are scattered more widely but they include several freshwater species such as the snakehead an invasive species Catch and

though only five percent of the city was able to afford a carriage One of the main attractions in the park s early years was the introduction of the Carriage Parade a daily display of horse drawn carriages that traversed the park The introduction of the automobile caused the carriage industry to die out by World War I though the carriage horse tradition was revived in The carriages have become a symbolic institution of the city for instance in a much publicized event after the September attacks Mayor Rudy Giuliani went to the stables to ask the drivers to go back to work to help return a sense of normality br Some activists celebrities and politicians have questioned the ethics of the carriage horse industry and called for its end The history of accidents involving spooked horses came under scrutiny in the s and s after reports of horses collapsing and even dying Supporters of the trade say it needs to be reformed rather than shut down Some replacements have been proposed including electric vintage cars Bill de Blasio in his successful mayoral campaign pledged to eliminate horse carriage tours if he was elected as of August had only succeeded in relocating the carriage pick up areas br Pedicabs operate mostly in the southern part of the park as horse carriages do The pedicabs have been criticized there have been reports of pedicab drivers charging exorbitant fares of several hundred dollars br br br Recreation br The park s drives which are miles km long are used heavily by runners joggers pedestrians bicyclists and inline skaters The park drives contain protected

ice skating rinks Wollman Rink in its southern portion and Lasker Rink in its northern portion During summer the former is the site of Victorian Gardens seasonal amusement park and the latter converts to an outdoor swimming pool br Central Park s glaciated rock outcroppings attract climbers especially boulderers but the quality of the stone is poor and the climbs present so little challenge that it has been called one of America s most pathetic boulders The two most renowned spots for boulderers are Rat Rock and Cat Rock Other rocks frequented by climbers mostly at the south end of the park include Dog Rock Duck Rock Rock N Roll Rock and Beaver Rock br br br Concerts and performances br br Central Park has been the site of concerts almost since its inception Originally they were hosted in the Ramble but these were moved to the Concert Ground next to the Mall in the s The weekend concerts hosted in the Mall drew tens of thousands of visitors from all social classes Since concerts have been held in Naumburg Bandshell a bandshell of Indiana limestone on the Mall Named for banker Elkan Naumburg who funded its construction the bandshell has deteriorated over the years but has never been fully restored The oldest free classical music concert series in the United States the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts founded in is hosted in the bandshell Other large concerts include The

and from until the Metropolitan Opera presented two operas in concert each year Every August since the Central Park Conservancy has hosted the Central Park Film Festival a series of free film screenings br br br Transportation br Central Park incorporates a system of pedestrian walkways scenic drives bridle paths and transverse roads to aid traffic circulation and it is easily accessible via several subway stations and bus routes br br br Public transport br br The New York City Subway s IND Eighth Avenue Line A B C and D trains runs along the western edge of the park Most of the Eighth Avenue Line stations on Central Park West serve only the local B and C trains while the th Street Columbus Circle station is additionally served by the express A and D trains and the IRT Broadway Seventh Avenue Line train The IRT Lenox Avenue Line and trains has a station at Central Park North From there the line curves southwest under the park and heads west under th Street On the southeastern corner of the park the BMT Broadway Line N R and W trains has a station at Fifth Avenue and th Street The rd Street lines F and F and Q trains pass underneath without stopping and the line contains a single ventilation shaft within the park west of Fifth Avenue and rd Street br Various bus routes pass through Central Park or stop along its boundaries The M bus stops along Central Park West while the M and part of the M runs along Central Park South and the M M and M run along Central Park North The M M M and M run southbound along Fifth Avenue with corresponding northbound bus service on Madison Avenue The M M M SBS Select Bus Service M SBS M and M buses use the transverse roads across Central Park The M M and M only serve Columbus Circle on the south end of the park and the M and M run on th Street two blocks from the park s south end but do not stop on the boundaries of the park br Some of the buses running on the edge of Central Park replaced former streetcar routes that formerly traveled across Manhattan These streetcar routes included the Sixth Avenue line which became the M bus and the Eighth Avenue line which became the M Only one streetcar line traversed Central Park the th Street Crosstown Line the predecessor to the M bus br br br Transverse roads br br Central Park contains four transverse roadways that carry crosstown traffic across the park From south to north they are at th Street th Street th Street and th Street the transverse roads were originally numbered sequentially in that order The th Street transverse connects the discontinuous sections of th and th streets on either side of the park The th Street transverse likewise joins the disconnected segments of th and th streets The th Street transverse links West st and East th streets while the th Street transverse links West th Street with East th and th streets Each roadway carries two lanes one in each direction and is sunken below the level of the rest of the park to minimize the transverses visual impact on it The transverse roadways are open even when the park is closed br The th Street transverse was the first to be finished having opened in December The th Street transverse which passed under Vista Rock Central Park s second highest point was completed by a railroad contractor because of their experience in drilling through hard rock it opened in December The th and th Street transverses opened in late By the s maintenance had decreased to the point where the th Street transverse handled most crosstown traffic because the other transverse roads had been so poorly maintained Both ends of the th Street transverse were widened in to accommodate increased traffic Generally the transverses were not maintained as frequently as the rest of the park though being used more frequently than the park proper br br br Scenic drives br br The park has three scenic drives that travel through it vertically They have multiple traffic lights at the intersections with pedestrian paths although there are some arches and bridges where pedestrian and drive traffic can cross without intersection To discourage park patrons from speeding the designers incorporated extensive curves in the park drives br West Drive is the westernmost of the park s three vertical drives The road which carries southbound bicycle and horse carriage traffic winds through the western part of Central Park connecting Lenox Avenue Central Park North with Seventh Avenue Central Park South and Central Drive br Center Drive also known as the Central Park Lower Loop connects northbound bicycle and carriage traffic from Midtown at Central Park South Sixth Avenue to East Drive near the th Street transverse The street generally goes east and then north forming the bottom part of the Central Park loop The attractions along Center Drive include Victorian Gardens the Central Park Carousel and the Central Park Mall br East Drive the easternmost of the three drives connects northbound bicycle and carriage traffic from Midtown to the Upper West Side at Lenox Avenue The street is renowned for its country scenery and free concerts It generally straddles the east side of the park along Fifth Avenue The drive passes by the Central Park Zoo around rd Street and the Metropolitan Museum of Art from th to th Streets Unlike the rest of the drive system which is generally serpentine East Drive is straight between the th and th Street transverses because it is between Fifth Avenue and the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir East Drive is known as the Elite Carriage Parade because it was where the carriage procession occurred at the time of the park s opening and because only five percent of the city was able to afford the carriage In the late th century West and East Drives were popular places for carriage rides br Two other scenic drives cross the park horizontally Terrace Drive is at nd Street and connects West and East Drives passing over Bethesda Terrace and Fountain The nd Street Crossing further north near the street of the same name is a former carriage drive connecting West and East Drives br br br Modifications and closures br In Central Park s earliest years the speed limits were set at miles per hour km h for carriages and mph km h for horses which were later raised to and mph and km h respectively Commercial vehicles and buses were banned from the park Automobiles became more common in Central Park during the s and s and they often broke the speed limits resulting in crashes To increase safety the gravel roads were paved in and the carriage speed limit was raised to mph km h two years later With the proliferation of cars among the middle class in the s traffic increased on the drives to as many as eight thousand cars per hour in The roads were still dangerous in the first ten months of eight people were killed and were injured in separate collisions br In November the scenic drives were converted from two way traffic to unidirectional traffic Further improvements were made in when forty two traffic lights were installed along the scenic drives and the speed limit was lowered to miles per hour km h The signals were coordinated so that drivers could go through all of the green lights if they maintained a steady speed of miles per hour km h The drives were experimentally closed to automotive traffic on weekends beginning in for exclusive use by pedestrians and bicyclists In subsequent years the scenic drives were closed to automotive traffic for most of the day during the summer By the drives were only open during rush hours and late evenings during the summer br Legislation was proposed in October to conduct a study to make the park car free in summer In Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the permanent closure of West and East Drives north of nd Street to vehicular traffic as it was proven that closing the roads did not adversely impact traffic After most of the Central Park loop drives were closed to vehicular traffic the city performed a follow up study The city found that West Drive was open for two hours during the morning rush period and was used by an average of vehicles a day while East Drive was open hours a day and was used by an average of vehicles daily Subsequently all cars were banned from East Drive in January In April de Blasio announced that the entirety of the three loop drives would be closed permanently to traffic The closure was put into effect in June br During the early st century there were numerous collisions in Central Park involving cyclists The death of Jill Tarlov after she was hit by a cyclist on West rd Street called attention to the issue In residents of nearby communities unsuccessfully petitioned the NYPD to increase enforcement of cycling rules within the park br br br Issues br br br Crime and neglect br In the mid th century Central Park had a reputation for being very dangerous especially after dark Such a viewpoint was reinforced following a incident when year old Jerome Dore fatally stabbed year old James O Connell in the northern section of the park Local tabloids cited this incident and several other crimes as evidence of a highly exaggerated crime wave Though recorded crime had indeed increased since Central Park opened in the late s this was in line with crime trends seen in the rest of the city Central Park s reputation for crime was reinforced by its worldwide name recognition and the fact that crimes in the park were covered disproportionately compared to crimes in the rest of the city For instance in The New York Times wrote stories about of murders that occurred citywide but wrote about three of the four murders that took place in Central Park that year By the s and s the number of murders in the police precincts north of Central Park was times higher than the number of murders within the park itself and even in the precincts south of the park the number of murders was three times as high br The park was the site of numerous high profile crimes during the late th century Of these two particularly notable cases shaped public perception against the park In Robert Chambers murdered Jennifer Levin in what was later called the preppy murder Three years later an investment banker was raped and brutally beaten in what came to be known as the Central Park jogger case Conversely other crimes such as the gang rape of two homeless women were barely reported After World War II it was feared that gay men perpetrated sex crimes and attracted violence Other problems in the s and s included a drug epidemic a large homeless presence vandalism and neglect br As crime has declined in New York City many of these negative perceptions have waned Safety measures keep the number of crimes in the park to fewer than per year as of down from approximately in the early s Some well publicized crimes have occurred since then for instance on June following the Puerto Rican Day Parade gangs of drunken men sexually assaulted women in the park br br br Other issues br Permission to hold issue centered rallies in Central Park similar to the be ins of the s has been met with increasingly stiff resistance from the city During some protests the organization United for Peace and Justice wanted to hold a rally on the Great Lawn during the Republican National Convention The city denied an application for a permit stating that such a mass gathering would be harmful to the grass and the damage would make it harder to collect private donations to maintain the park A judge of the New York Supreme Court s New York County branch upheld the refusal br During the s and s new supertall skyscrapers were constructed along the southern end of Central Park in a corridor commonly known as Billionaires Row According to a Municipal Art Society report such buildings cast long shadows over the southern end of the park A analysis by The New York Times found that some of the tallest and skinniest skyscrapers such as One Central Park Tower and Central Park South would cast shadows that can be as much as mile km long during the winter covering up to a third of the park s length In the New York City Council proposed legislation that would restrict the construction of skyscrapers near city parks br br br Impact br br br Cultural significance br br Central Park s size and cultural position has served as a model for many urban parks Olmsted believed landscape design was a way to improve the feeling of community and had intended the park as the antithesis of the stresses of the city s daily life The Greensward Plan radical at the time of its construction led to widespread changes in park designs and urban planning in particular parks were designed to incorporate landscapes whose elements were related to each other br As a New York City icon Central Park is one of the most filmed locations in the world A December report found that movies had used it for on location shoots more than the movies that had filmed in Greenwich Village or the movies that had filmed in Times Square Some of the movies filmed at Central Park such as the film The Age of Innocence reflect ideals of the past Other films including The Fisher King Marathon Man The Out of Towners and Home Alone Lost in New York use the park for dramatic conflict scenes Central Park has been used in romance films such as Maid in Manhattan Going on or Hitch and fantasy live action animated films such as Enchanted In an estimated days of film shoots were hosted or an average of more than ten film shoots per day accounting for million in city revenue br Because of its cultural and historical significance Central Park has been a National Historic Landmark since and a New York City scenic landmark since It was placed on UNESCO s list of tentative World Heritage Sites in br br br Real estate and economy br br The value of the surrounding land started rising significantly in the mid s during the park s construction The completion of Central Park immediately increased the surrounding area s real estate prices in some cases by up to percent between and It also resulted in the creation of the zoning plan in Upper Manhattan Upscale districts grew on both sides of Central Park following its completion On the Upper East Side a portion of Fifth Avenue abutting lower Central Park became known as Millionaires Row by the s due to the concentration of wealthy families in the area The Upper West Side took longer to develop but row houses and luxury apartment buildings came to predominate the neighborhood and some were later included in the Central Park West Historic District Though most of the city s rich formerly lived in mansions they moved into apartments close to Central Park during the late th and early th centuries br During the late th century until Central Park s restoration in the s proximity to the park did not have a significant positive effect on real estate values Following Central Park s restoration some of the city s most expensive properties have been sold or rented near the park The value of the land in Central Park was estimated to be about billion in December though this was based on the park s impact on the average value of nearby land br In the modern day it is estimated that Central Park has resulted in billions of dollars in economic impact A study found that the city received annual tax revenue of more than million visitors spent more than million due to the park in park businesses such as concessions generated million and the hours of annual film shoots and other photography generated million of economic output In about people lived within a ten minute walk about miles or kilometers of the park s boundaries and million more people could get to the park within a half hour subway ride br br br br br br Notes br br br Citations br br br Sources br br br External links br br Official website New York City Department of Parks and
