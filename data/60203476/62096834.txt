ugliness in Franklin s story sexual assault domestic abuse alcoholism and it s to the film s credit that it resists the temptation to treat these issues salaciously But Respect never goes deeper than a surface level exploration of how these traumas affected Franklin br Writing for Variety Peter Debruge called the film an overly respectful biopic that steers clear of revealing the traumas that shaped the soul legend and said Though Respect can feel a little soft in the drama department it delivers the added pleasure of hearing Hudson re create Franklin s key songs from the early jazz standards she covered for Columbia to her reinvention of the Otis Redding single that lends the film its name Also writing for Variety Cassie Da Costa praised Hudson s portrayal of Franklin saying Bringing an incredible mix of gestural subtlety and musical power it cannot be said enough what Hudson achieves here by transmitting a rich sense of interiority staying true to who Franklin was in private with every look given word spoken and melisma sung br Pete Hammond of Deadline also praised Hudson s performance saying This is Jennifer Hudson s triumph merged with the spirit and guidance from an even greater voice above Hudson s performance is an electrifying sight to behold Sasha Stone from Awards Daily praised the film and especially Hudson s performance saying Hudson s performance is partly her incredible voice She suspends time in reverie whenever she sings But this performance also establishes her as an actress capable of navigating the ever changing waters of Franklin s complicated life from a young wife who doesn t quite understand exactly what kind of gift she actually has through to finding a way to honor her own creative spirit Writing for Time Stephanie Zacharek called Respect both entertaining and emotionally revelatory and praised the performances of the cast especially Hudson s saying It s Hudson s job to play the adult version of that girl and she shoulders it with something like tenderness The easy thing when you re playing a strong potent character is to bite down Hudson never does This is a terrific performance underplayed in all the right ways an emotionally detailed portrait of a woman who knew what she wanted and knew she could deliver but who also moved through life knowing that she d been cruelly robbed of that thing we so sentimentally call childhood br br br Accolades br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br Official website br Respect at IMDb br Official screenplay
