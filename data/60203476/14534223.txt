Naval Air Station South Weymouth was an operational United States Navy airfield from to in South Weymouth Massachusetts It was first established as a regular Navy blimp base during World War II During the postwar era the base became part of the Naval Air Reserve Training Command hosting a variety of Navy and Marine Corps reserve aircraft squadrons and other types of reserve units Like most BRAC sites environmental contamination was detected in and since numerous remedies and long term monitoring of ground water are in place Since over acres have been transferred to the affected towns for reuse and in the Navy signed a million contract to transfer its remaining land br br In the site was surveyed as a possible location for a municipal airport which was never built Construction work on the base began in September and the base was commissioned as the United States Naval Air Station South Weymouth on March During World War II the base s primary mission was to provide support for anti submarine blimp operations In its original as built format South Weymouth s main facilities consisted of two gigantic blimp hangars the earlier LTA Hangar One or The Big Hangar of steel construction and the second LTA Hangar Two of the more common World War II standardized design of nearly all wooden construction employed to conserve rationed metals The base also had a foot diameter m Macadamized blimp landing mat six mooring circles and a foot long m cinder surfaced turf runway br Throughout the war with Germany NAS South Weymouth served as the home base of airship patrol squadron ZP which operated up to twelve K class blimps employed on ASW patrols and convoy escort missions in and around Massachusetts Bay and the Gulf of Maine Some historians and former Navy personnel allege that a ZP blimp the K which crashed with loss of life off the coast of Bar Harbor Maine on July was actually shot down by a German submarine br In addition to ZP NAS South Weymouth also hosted wartime detachments of airship patrol squadron ZP based at NAS Lakehurst New Jersey and airship utility squadron ZJ based at Meacham Field in Key West Florida ZJ was unique being the only airship utility squadron in the Navy ZJ s South Weymouth detachment Detachment flew K and G class airships in support of electronics research projects conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology performed aerial photography missions and helped to recover test torpedoes for the Navy torpedo station in Newport Rhode Island A sub detachment operated from Elizabeth Field on Fisher s Island New York br br In NAS South Weymouth was the starting point for the first transatlantic crossings of non rigid airships United States Navy K ships blimps K and K from Blimp Squadron also known as ZP Blimpron or The Africa Squadron left South Weymouth on May and landed at Argentia Newfoundland about hours later The two K ships then flew approximately hours to Lagens Field on Terceira Island in the Azores The last leg of the flight was a hour flight to their destination with Fleet Air Wing FAW at Port Lyautey French Morocco now Kenitra Morocco Blimps K K were followed by K K and K K which left South Weymouth on and June respectively in These six blimps initially conducted nighttime anti submarine warfare operations to complement the daytime missions flown by FAW aircraft PBYs and B s using magnetic anomaly detection to locate U boats in the relatively shallow waters around the Straits of Gibraltar Later ZP K ships conducted minespotting and minesweeping operations in key Mediterranean ports and various escort missions including that of the convoy carrying Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill to the Yalta Conference in early br br South Weymouth was downgraded from a naval air station to a naval air facility on August after Germany surrendered thus ending the U Boat threat to the east coast and was thereafter used to store surplus naval aircraft that were awaiting final disposition Many of these aircraft especially Eastern Grumman TBM TBF Avengers were subjected to elaborate cocooning and preservation methods in the two huge blimp hangars During this period of South Weymouth s history the base was known as a naval aircraft parking station or NAPS Naval Air Facility South Weymouth was placed into caretaker status on June and downgraded again to an auxiliary landing field or ALF br br In the Navy decided to close Squantum Naval Air Station traditionally the focus of Navy and Marine Corps reserve aviation training in New England and move the reserve program to ALF South Weymouth The decision to close NAS Squantum resulted from increasing incidents of airspace conflicts with Boston s commercial airport modern day Logan International Airport in nearby East Boston and due to the fact that Squantum s relatively short and landlocked waterlocked runways were not capable of supporting high performance jet aircraft br Between and NAAF South Weymouth was rebuilt to make it more suitable for supporting conventional aircraft operations In its original World War II format the base was not really intended for regular use by heavier than air aircraft Its cinder covered turf runways were only intended for transient aircraft the station s Beech GB Traveler and other light utility aircraft During the reconstruction effort LTA Hangar Two the wooden blimp hangar was razed three new paved runways foot m north south runway foot m east west runway and foot m diagonally aligned runway were built and a CPN ground controlled approach facility and modern control tower the wartime base s control towers were located on top of LTA Hangar One were established South Weymouth was reactivated as a reserve training base and fully fledged naval air station on December br Though officially a reserve base NAS South Weymouth hosted an unusual regular Navy unit between and This was a secretive research and development outfit called the Naval Air Development Unit known as NADU for short The NADU which derived in a way from Special Project Unit SPU CAST based at Squantum Naval Air Station during World War II was tasked with providing flight testing support for research projects associated with the MIT Lincoln Laboratories and other defense contractors Mainly these research projects involved experimental electronic equipment such as radars associated with air defense and anti submarine warfare systems The NADU operated a diverse aircraft fleet that included among other things Lockheed WV Warning Stars Douglas F D Skyrays Douglas A D Skywarriors Lockheed P V Neptunes and the ZPG W which were the world s largest blimps br br In December a new hangar Hangar No was completed adjacent to runway to support the fixed wing ASW and attack squadrons Runway was lengthened to feet during The construction work required on the eastern end of this runway permanently severed Union Street which had served as a major thoroughfare connecting the towns of Rockland and Weymouth Blimp operations were discontinued at NAS South Weymouth in July in advance of the disestablishment of the Naval Air Development Unit on October br In March a ZPG the Snow Bird piloted by Commander Jack Hunt USN took off from South Weymouth and landed days later at Naval Air Station Key West after making two crossings of the Atlantic Ocean The airship with a crew of set a new distance record of miles and an endurance record without refueling All told Snow Bird spent just over eleven days aloft in covering miles without refueling For his performance on the flight the airship commander CDR Jack R Hunt USN received the Harmon International Trophy e g Harmon Trophy for Aeronautics br Two reserve anti submarine squadrons were activated at NAS South Weymouth during the Berlin Crisis VS which was based at NAS South Weymouth was activated on October It was joined by VS transferred from NAS Grosse Ile MI on November Both squadrons flew operational ASW patrols from NAS South Weymouth and detachment sites such as Key West and Guantanamo Bay Cuba for nearly a year br During the s the station hosted a pair of unique Anti Submarine Warfare Operational Flight Trainers These consisted of two retired aircraft fuselages a Grumman S A Tracker crash damaged and a Lockheed SP E Neptune fire damaged that were placed on the flat roof of the so called lean to on the southern side of LTA Hangar One The radar scopes and other ASW sensors positioned at the tactical crew positions in these two aircraft fuselages were connected to signal generating devices located in the ASW Training Department spaces in the hangar allowing them to serve as fixed tactical training simulators for reserve aircrewmen br Steel blimp hangar LTA Hangar One a local landmark was demolished in and replaced with a much smaller concrete arch hangar Hangar The new hangar was not completed until November due in large part to a disaster on August when several concrete arches collapsed killing two civilian crane operators The base had target ranges at the nearby Nomans Land Island and the Liberty Ship SS James Longstreet The base hosted the Navy Weymouth Aero Club from until the club s closure in br br The Base Realignment and Closure Commission decided to close the base in its recommendations It was decided against because of the community s objections br br The Base Realignment and Closure Commission decided to close the base in its recommendations The community argued that it was important and was ranked higher than other bases scheduled for realignment This argument was acknowledged as well as the fact that the commission did not include demographics in its decision The base remained open for the time being br br The Base Realignment and Closure Commission of recommended that South Weymouth close in and its last remaining squadrons be realigned VP which flew P Orions and VR which flew C Hercules transports went to NAS Brunswick Maine before the base was officially deactivated and closed by order of the BRAC In it was awarded the Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation ribbon for the years br br In March an initial reuse plan was approved by a three town vote for office retail use senior housing golf course and ballfields Current site status In the Massachusetts Legislature established the South Shore Tri Town Development Corporation representing Abington Rockland and Weymouth the three towns that were part of the station in Tri Town selected a master developer of the site which in sold its interests to developer Starwood Land Venture an affiliate of Starwood Capital Group br In a revised reuse plan incorporating many of EPA s Smart Growth concepts was approved by the three affected towns Current site status br In December a deal was reached to build a movie studio complex on the site The million complex to be called SouthField Studios was planned to include sound stages production offices and other office space Construction was set to begin in August but stalled due to financing difficulties br A condominium community development called SouthField was planned construction work began during December and the first homes were sold and occupied by summer Over acres have already been transferred to the local reuse authority the U S Coast Guard and the Federal Aviation Administration Current site status In November the Navy and Tri Town signed a purchase and sales agreement for the remaining acres of the base about acres of the acres are available for transfer and acres will be leased until the property has been cleaned up or closed out and deemed suitable for transfer by the EPA Current site status br As of June the master developer Starwood wanted state lawmakers to approve legislation that would rewrite oversight of the project by the end of the formal legislative session on July and that it could walk away from the project if that doesn t happen Starwood wants responsibility for providing public services and collecting property taxes to shift from Tri Town to the three towns Tri Town asked the Navy to intervene which has declined In August the state Senate enacted Starwood Land Ventures proposed legislation and thus reduced Tri Town s role br Tri Town was reconstituted as the Southfield Redevelopment Authority that month As of the development is known as Union Point planned as a smart city with self driving cars from Optimus Ride about homes million square feet m of commercial space green roofs ponds and open space including hiking and biking trails Plans include a market in the former hangar arch college campus movie theatre hotel and sports complex The development is adjacent to the South Weymouth station on the Old Colony Lines of the MBTA Commuter Rail The development presented a bid for siting of Amazon HQ but did not make the finalist round of br On March a fire broke out in abandoned buildings on the grounds of the former Naval Air Station about feet m from the nearest housing The buildings formerly officer barracks were destroyed in what officials considered a suspicious fire Days later investigators determined it was arson br br The U S Coast Guard maintains a buoy maintenance facility near the old railroad spur to the station An A Skyhawk jet mounted on a pedestal in a small park called the Shea Memorial Grove named for Squantum reservist CDR John Jack Shea who was killed in action when the aircraft carrier USS Wasp was sunk during World War II remains as a perpetual reminder of the site s naval heritage The jet the park and a small Navy museum the Shea Field Naval Aviation Historical Museum located in the former base gymnasium building The Shea Fitness Center are maintained by a local veterans organization called the Association of Naval
