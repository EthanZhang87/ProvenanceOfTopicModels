Half Life is a first person shooter FPS game developed and published by Valve Corporation It was published for Windows on Valve s digital distribution service Steam Like the original Half Life Half Life combines shooting puzzles and storytelling and adds new features such as vehicles and physics based gameplay The player controls Gordon Freeman who joins a resistance to liberate Earth from the Combine an interplanetary alien empire br Half Life was created using Valve s Source game engine which was developed simultaneously Development lasted five years and cost US million Valve s president Gabe Newell set his team the goal of redefining the FPS genre They integrated Ipion Virtual Physics licensed from Havok which simulates real world physics to reinforce the sense of presence and create new gameplay They also developed the characterization with more detailed character models and animations br Valve announced Half Life at E with a release date of September of that year They failed to meet the release date leading to fan backlash A year before its release an unfinished version was stolen by a hacker and published online which damaged the team s morale and slowed their work br Half Life was released on Steam on November It won Game of the Year awards and has been cited as one of the best games ever made It was ported to Xbox Xbox PlayStation macOS and Linux By it had sold million copies Half Life was followed by the free extra level Lost Coast and the episodic sequels Episode One and Episode Two In after canceling Episode Three and several further Half Life projects Valve released a prequel Half Life Alyx br br br Gameplay br br Like the original Half Life Half Life is a single player first person shooter FPS in which players control Gordon Freeman It has similar mechanics to Half Life including health and weapon systems though with fewer overall weapons and periodic physics puzzles except with the newer Source engine and improved graphics The player starts without items and widens their arsenal over the course of the game While the game is mainly linear effort was put into making exploration rewarding and interesting many optional areas can be missed or avoided br A diverse set of enemies is present which usually require being approached with different tactics some coordinate in groups to out maneuver or out position the player others such as the Manhack fly directly at the player through small openings and tight corridors Others use predictable but powerful attacks while others hide before swiftly attacking the player Gordon can kill most enemies with his weapons or make use of indirect means exploiting environmental hazards such as explosive pressurized canisters gas fires or improvised traps In chapters ten and eleven Gordon can be joined by up to four armed Resistance soldiers or medics and can send his team further from him or call them back br Many of the features use the Source engine s detailed physics simulation Two sections of the game involve driving vehicles Instead of button oriented puzzles from Half Life environmental puzzles are also introduced with makeshift mechanical systems revolving around the player s new ability to pick up move and place objects Solutions involve objects physical properties such as shape weight and buoyancy For example In chapter three Route Kanal the player is required to stack cinder blocks on a makeshift see saw ramp to proceed over a wall Alternatively the player can build a crude staircase with the blocks so the puzzle may be solved in multiple ways br Part way through the game Gordon acquires the Gravity Gun which allows him to draw distant objects towards himself or forcefully push them away as well as the ability to manipulate larger and heavier objects which he otherwise cannot control These abilities are required to solve puzzles later in the game They can also be used in combat to throw heavy objects at enemies or to shield themselves from gunfire br The game never separates the player with pre rendered cutscenes or events the story proceeds via exposition from other characters and in world events and the player can control Gordon for the entirety of the game Most of the backstory to the game is simply alluded to or told through the environment Even tutorials are mostly placed in the environment or in dialogue The few pop ups that appear inform the player only of keyboard bindings for actions br br br Plot br After the alien invasion at the Black Mesa Research Facility a multidimensional alien empire known as the Combine invaded and subjugated Earth Approximately twenty years after being placed in stasis Gordon Freeman the player character is awoken by the G Man Michael Shapiro who cryptically informs Gordon that his time has come again before celestially inserting him into a moving passenger train bound for City an Eastern European city probably in Russia as most of the posters and signs are in Russian which houses the Citadel a several miles tall tower which serves as the headquarters of the Combine on Earth Helped by the undercover Resistance member Barney Calhoun Shapiro Gordon attempts to reach the laboratory of Dr Isaac Kleiner Harry S Robins before being beaten and arrested by Combine officers He is rescued by Alyx Vance Merle Dandridge who takes him to Dr Kleiner s lab During Dr Kleiner s attempt to teleport Gordon to the main Resistance base at Black Mesa East Gordon is accidentally briefly teleported to the Citadel office of Dr Wallace Breen Robert Culp the Combine s puppet ruler of Earth alerting Dr Breen to Gordon s presence Gordon is subsequently forced to progress to the base using the city s canal system navigating it on an airboat br Upon his arrival at Black Mesa East Gordon reunites with Eli Vance Robert Guillaume and meets Dr Judith Mossman Michelle Forbes Alyx introduces Gordon to her pet robot Dog and gives Gordon a Gravity Gun Black Mesa East is suddenly attacked by Combine forces who capture Eli and Judith Gordon is forced to escape through the zombie infested ghost town of Ravenholm aided by its lone inhabitant Father Grigori Jim French Escaping the town Gordon reaches a Resistance outpost whose inhabitants provide him with a dune buggy He drives across Highway to reach the Combine prison of Nova Prospekt where Eli and Judith are being held He breaks into the prison and reunites with Alyx They locate Eli and discover that Judith is a Combine spy Before they can stop her Judith teleports herself and Eli to the Citadel The teleporter explodes moments after Gordon and Alyx use it to escape Nova Prospekt br Returning to Dr Kleiner s lab Gordon and Alyx learn that the teleporter malfunctioned and that a week has passed during which time the Resistance has launched a full scale armed rebellion against the Combine Aided by Barney and Dog Gordon fights his way inside the Citadel He makes some progress in climbing the tower before he is captured and taken in a transport pod to Dr Breen s private office near the tower s apex where he and Judith are waiting with Eli and Alyx as captives Dr Breen reveals that he intends to use his captives as leverage during negotiations with the Combine which contradicts what he had previously told Judith Angered Judith frees the three captives before Dr Breen can teleport them off world Dr Breen attempts to escape using a teleporter on the Citadel s roof but Gordon destroys the Citadel s reactor using the Gravity Gun causing Dr Breen to fall into the abyss though it has never been made clear whether he falls to his death Just as the reactor explodes the G Man reappears and freezes time praises Gordon s actions and places him back into stasis br br br Development br br Development of Half Life began in June six months after the release of the original Half Life It was developed by a team of With voice actors included this number is Valve s president Gabe Newell wanted to redefine the FPS genre saying Why spend four years of your life building something that isn t innovative and is basically pointless If Half Life isn t viewed as the best PC game of all time it s going to completely bum out most of the guys on this team Newell gave his team no deadline and a virtually unlimited budget promising to fund the project himself if necessary They used Valve s new in house game engine Source developed simultaneously br br br Setting and characters br Whereas Half Life was set in a single location the Black Mesa research facility Valve wanted a much more epic and global feel for the sequel One concept had the player teleporting between planets which was discarded as it would make continuity between levels difficult At the suggestion of the art director Viktor Antonov who was Bulgarian the team settled on a city in an Eastern European location In this early concept players would start the game by boarding the Borealis an icebreaker bound for the city Nova Prospekt was conceived as a small rail depot built on an old prison in the wasteland and grew from a stopping off point to the destination itself br After observing how players had connected to minor characters in Half Life the team developed the characterization with more detailed character models and realistic animation The animator Ken Birdwell studied the work of psychologist Paul Ekman who had researched how facial muscles express emotion The writer Marc Laidlaw created family relationships between the characters saying as it was a basic dramatic unit everyone understands rarely used in games br br br Physics and design br The team integrated the Havok physics engine which simulates real world physics to reinforce the player s sense of presence and create new gameplay To experiment the team created a minigame Zombie Basketball in which players used a physics manipulating gun to throw zombies through hoops In mid to test the engine Valve built a street war between rioting citizens and police featuring tanks Molotov cocktails hand to hand fighting and looting The designer John Guthrie described it as an early attempt at getting something anything in the game that used non player characters and physics br In late Valve began creating a showreel hoping to demonstrate it at E For several months Newell let the team work without his input so he could provide unbiased feedback and focused on developing Steam Valve s upcoming digital distribution service The team presented the showreel to Newell showcasing physics environments such as the Borealis and a dialogue heavy scene with the scientist character Dr Kleiner Newell felt the showreel did not adequately show how the physics would affect gameplay and that the Kleiner scene was overlong Reflecting on the feedback Laidlaw said The dramatic scenes with the characters are important but they have to be in service of the interactivity and gameplay br In September the team completed a second showreel featuring a buggy race along the City coast an encounter with headcrabs on a pier an alien strider attacking the city and a greatly shortened Kleiner sequence In October Newell told the team they would announce Half Life at E and release it by the end of the year As with the original Half Life the team split into cabals working on different levels Designers created levels using placeholder shapes and surfaces which then were worked on by the artists br br br Announcement and delay br Valve announced Half Life at E with demonstrations of the characters animation and physics The reaction was positive and the game won the E Game of the Show award Newell also announced a release date of September hoping this would motivate the team They worked long hours to meet the deadline but by July it was clear they would miss it Rumors spread of a delay On September Valve released a statement targeting a release for the holiday season leading to fan backlash br Newell had been hesitant to announce a delay without a new release date He said later We were paralyzed We knew we weren t going to make the date we promised and that was going to be a huge fiasco and really embarrassing But we didn t have a new date to give people either The graphics card manufacturer ATI had arranged a promotional event on Alcatraz Island to coincide with the planned release of Half Life Unable to pull out of the event Newell gave a prepared speech demonstrated the Source engine and left without addressing questions br br br Leak and final months br On September the Half Life source code was obtained by a German hacker Axel Gembe who had infiltrated Valve s internal network months earlier According to Gembe he shared it with another person who leaked the code online in early October Fans soon compiled a playable version of Half Life revealing how unfinished it was The leaks damaged morale at Valve and slowed development In March Gembe contacted Newell and identified himself saying he was a fan and had not acted maliciously Newell worked with the FBI to invite Gembe to a fake job interview planning to have him arrested in the United States however police arrested him in Germany In November Gembe was sentenced to two years probation br In the Valve staff returned after Christmas to long hours stressful working conditions and no guarantee that the game which was costing million a month to develop would be finished soon However Newell felt that progress was speeding up with the team producing about three hours of gameplay per month In March they created the first version playable from start to finish and stopped production for a week to play through the game Major changes by this point included the cutting of the Borealis the replacement of the jet ski with a hovercraft and introducing the physics manipulating gravity gun earlier in the game Feedback was positive across the company Newell recalled The fact that you could go from one end of the game to the other was a really big thing for us Then we knew it just had to get better but it was all there After several months of bug fixes and playtesting Half Life was completed on October br br br Release br Valve made a GB portion of Half Life available for download in an encrypted format through Steam on August On the day of release Steam customers were able to pay unlock the files and play the game immediately without having to wait for the game to download In retail distribution of the game was handled by Vivendi Universal Games through their Sierra Entertainment subsidiary br Half Life was

released a deathmatch mode in In fans discovered that the texture used for a corpse model originated from a real photograph of a corpse published in a medical textbook on treating burns leading to criticism br br br Dispute with Vivendi br On September GameSpot reported that Sierra s parent company Vivendi Universal Games was in a legal battle with Valve over the distribution of Half Life to cyber caf s Cyber caf s were important for the gaming market in Asia where PC and broadband penetration per capita were much lower in most territories br According to Vivendi the distribution contract they signed with Valve included cyber caf s This would mean that only Vivendi could distribute Half Life to cyber caf s not Valve through the Steam system On November Judge Thomas S Zilly of U S Federal District Court in Seattle Washington ruled that Vivendi and its affiliates are not authorized to distribute directly or indirectly Valve games through cyber caf s for pay to play activities according to the parties current publishing agreement Zilly also ruled in favor of the Valve motion regarding the contractual limitation of liability allowing Valve to recover copyright damages for any infringement as allowed by law without regard to the publishing agreement s limitation of liability clause br On April Valve and Vivendi announced a settlement Vivendi would cease distributing all retail packaged versions of Valve games by August Vivendi was also to notify distributors and cyber caf s that had been licensed by Vivendi that only Valve had the authority to distribute cyber caf
