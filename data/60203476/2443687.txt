The Outfield were an English rock band based in London The band achieved success in the mid s and are best remembered for their hit single Your Love The band s lineup consisted of guitarist John Spinks vocalist and bassist Tony Lewis and drummer Alan Jackman br They had an unusual experience for a British band in that they enjoyed commercial success in the United States but never in their homeland The band began recording in the mid s and released their first album Play Deep in through Columbia Records The album reached No on the Billboard list and then reached triple platinum in the United States The band s single Your Love reached No on the Billboard Hot as well as No on the Mainstream Rock chart and it became their signature song The band continued to record and tour through the s and then into the early s While subsequent albums Bangin and Voices of Babylon saw some chart successes the group s popularity waned br After drummer Alan Jackman left in the Outfield became a duo and recorded Diamond Days in Following the disappointing response to their album Rockeye which represented a shift towards progressive rock and arena rock the group essentially disbanded in the s They resumed touring in and thereafter released two live albums via their website along with a new studio album Any Time Now in which was later re released in In the band released their final album

songwriter John Spinks and drummer Alan Jackman played together in the late s in a power pop band called Sirius B After rehearsing for about six months and playing several gigs their style did not match the punk rock that was surging in popularity in England and they broke up Several years afterward the three gathered back together in London s East End under the name the Baseball Boys They performed in and around England until a demo got them signed to Columbia CBS Records in br Spinks adopted the name Baseball Boys from a teen gang called The Baseball Furies in the cult film The Warriors a movie that he had just seen Although he used the name as a joke and just to be outrageous record company people responded favourably The band got a reputation as a very American sounding group and signed in the United States after playing for just a few months in England Their manager an American living in England recommended a new band name with a similar attitude since Baseball Boys seemed too tacky and tongue in cheek Spinks has said The Outfield was the most left wing kind of thing we liked br Spinks expressed an interest in baseball while also being a devoted fan of association football He claimed that the group didn t know what an outfield was until they visited the U S and that We re just learning about baseball It s an acquired taste and we re trying to acquire a taste for it He expounded upon this in a Chicago Tribune piece br br The thing about American sports baseball and football is that they re far more show business far more a spectacle than British sports In England it s just sort of everyday soccer matches You get people in the freezing cold in the middle of winter watching guys chase around in mud In America you have the sunny days and the baseball diamond is really nicely laid out In England you d see these guys covered in mud within minutes It s not such a nice spectacle to watch br br br Play Deep br Their debut album Play Deep produced by William Wittman was issued in and was a success The album reached triple platinum sales status and the top in the US album charts it also featured a top single entry with Your Love which peaked at No It went on to be featured in a number of s themed compilation albums and over covers and remixes by other artists have been released physically and or online The band toured extensively opening for Journey and Starship Spinks made a point of mentioning in interviews that the band was totally into not smoking or doing drugs br br br Bangin br saw the release of their second album Bangin This album did not achieve the acclaim of Play Deep but it did spawn a top single Since You ve Been Gone not to be confused with the s Rainbow and Head East hit of the same name which also hit No on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart Furthermore they had a minor radio MTV hit with No Surrender The album sold reasonably well and was certified gold in the United States A US summer tour opening for Night Ranger followed br br br Voices of Babylon br For the group s third album s Voices of Babylon a new producer David Kahne and sound was evident The title track was a top single and hit No on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart The follow up song My Paradise was a mid sized album rock hit reaching No on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart but overall the group s popularity continued to decline br br br Diamond Days br After the Babylon LP Alan Jackman parted ways with the band and was replaced for a concert tour by Paul Read Spinks and Lewis continued as a duo switched labels and began recording Diamond Days for MCA Playing drums on the disc was session drummer Simon Dawson The LP released in produced a top US hit For You Quick to follow was One Hot Country included on the soundtrack to the action film If Looks Could Kill br br br Later years and aftermath br The Outfield returned with s Rockeye Its leadoff single Closer to Me was a near top hit and a second release Winning It All gained some notice due to extensive play during NBC s NBA Finals coverage the NBA Superstars series featuring Larry Bird the Summer Olympics Chicago Bulls championship ring ceremonies and the film The Mighty Ducks Simon Dawson who played on Rockeye would eventually become the band s official third member The band took an extended hiatus during the mid s as changing musical fashions especially the popularity of edgier bands such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam made life difficult for older bands with a less fashionable aesthetic br The Outfield returned to their East End roots and often played low key gigs at a local pub where much of the clientele were unaware that the group had sold millions of records in the US Unfortunately this situation was typical of the problems the Outfield had faced in their homeland little recognition and a much smaller following than they had experienced in the US Nevertheless the band would reappear with a fan club only release entitled It Ain t Over and resume touring Soon thereafter in they released Extra Innings an odds and ends compilation of new and older unreleased songs br In the early s the band issued two live collections via their official website Live in Brazil and The Outfield Live In the band released Any Time Now a new studio album through Tower Records and later released a new version of the album in March through Sidewinder Records br In the original line up of John Spinks Tony Lewis and Alan Jackman returned to a London recording studio to record their first album together since

br After taking a few years off from music lead singer bassist Tony Lewis announced his return with a solo album Out of the Darkness which was released on June through Madison Records and with the help of his wife Carol and their collaborative songwriting br On October singer Tony Lewis died suddenly and unexpectedly at his home near London leaving only Alan Jackman as the last surviving member br br br Style and influences br The Outfield were considered a pop rock power pop or a new wave group Annelise Wamsley of the Tampa Bay Times described the band s style in the Outfield specializes in what you could call an early s American Sound It s music by recipe You to take hyper macho hard rock and tone it down so it will appeal to the over set You need a simple hook that can be repeated a dozen or so times lots of electric guitar solos a standard rock beat and basic lyrics Indeed the Outfield were so American sounding and literally took their name from America s national pastime they were much more popular in the US than they were in their homeland None of their albums made the UK charts and only three of their singles could scratch their way onto the British singles listings with Voices of Babylon peaking at br John Spinks said in interview with the Los Angeles Times that he was very influenced by the music that gives me a rush and that he grew up on the Beatles Interestingly it was also said that the band wanted to be a car stereo sort of poppy version of the band Rush Seconds and Mystery Man are evidence of this He also cited contemporaries Journey Foreigner and Mr Mister particularly the latter s hit Broken Wings In that interview he expanded upon the band s strong foundation in melody br br I love melodic music When you look at that music you have to take it for what it is I can write a pretty melody That takes some talent It may not be complicated and maybe it doesn t challenge anybody but so what Some people obviously like it You don t have to analyze my lyrics to understand them You enjoy these songs or you don t You can put these songs on while you re driving They make you feel good What more can you ask br Wamsely made a similar remark writing This is the stuff people listen to in their cars on the way to work or play at high school dances br Criticism often centered on their generic sound The music is hopelessly numbingly derivative of just about every Journey Foreigner Cars clich in the book with none of the style that makes those bands special said Matt Damsker rock critic for the Hartford Courant br Yet writing for the issue of the Rolling Stone Album guide Paul Evans described The Outfield as having an ambition no more complicated than to sound like a monster on the radio And it does br br br Members br Alan Jackman drums
