the butt of her own jokes Fey is also well known for practicing self deprecating humor as demonstrated throughout her performance as Liz Lemon in Rock In an article ranking Fey s six greatest jokes David Renshaw of The Guardian wrote that the performer s work continues to feature her trademark mix of snark self deprecation and pop culture smarts Fey s self deprecating comedic style inspired Ashley Fetters of The Atlantic to recognize her as comedian Phyllis Diller s successor because of their similar humor Critics have been divided in their opinions and discussions of Fey s use of self deprecating humor and its effect on women as a female comic while blogger Kate Harding disapproved of Fey s performance in Rock because I m torn between being sad that she apparently doesn t see beauty in herself and being pissed off that she s reinforcing the idea that having brown hair glasses and a figure that s maybe a size instead of a actually equals ugly Jessica G of Jezebel defended the actress writing that Fey s performance is supposed to be parodying precisely the kinds of media that reinforce ideas that unconventional women are unworthy Writing that Harding misunderstood Fey s intentions the author concluded that her self deprecation is precisely what makes her relatable elaborating that women have many moments of self doubt and seeing someone as successful as Tina Fey be self deprecating gives us all permission to be imperfect Sophie Caldecott of Verily defended Fey s modesty and tendency to downplay her own physical appearance She mocks her own appearance sure but she does so in a way that consistently shows up our culture for placing so much importance on how women look as if that s the most interesting thing about us Her comic persona on Rock Liz Lemon can be laughed at for many things but her career managerial style and ability is not one of them Caldecott concluded In reality self deprecation is an art that comedians everywhere dabble in In fact I defy you to find a good male comedian who isn t a master of self deprecation Comedians make fun of themselves for many reasons mostly because it is the most readily accessible source of inspiration but also because it is the most generous one Observing that Fey s material lacks whining Gina Barreca of the Hartford Courant wrote that Fey s comedy is not simply an iteration of self deprecating femininity passing itself off as humor In itself this demarcates the current generation of female humorists from earlier generations of performers who were told more or less to use themselves not as a sounding board for ideas but as a punching bag for insults Fey has also garnered criticism for being politically incorrect but she defends her right to write borderline jokes saying that she has chosen to opt out of the culture of demanding apologies br As an actress Fey has developed a reputation for portraying the hilarious self deprecating unmarried career woman in most of her films to

about only taking on parts for which she actually seems suited Fey explained that she approaches each role asking herself Would I be plausible in this role in this job However her role as Kate Ellis in s Sisters provided Fey with an opportunity to stray from playing the type A female characters for which she has become known The New York Times film critic A O Scott wrote We re used to seeing Ms Fey as an anxious overthinker using her caustic sarcasm as a weapon against both her own insecurities and the flakes and train wrecks who surround her This time she gets to be the train wreck In Rock
