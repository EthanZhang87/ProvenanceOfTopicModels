SimCity is an open ended city building video game franchise originally designed by Will Wright The first game in the series SimCity was published by Maxis in and was followed by several sequels and many other spin off Sim titles including s The Sims which itself became a best selling computer game and franchise Maxis developed the series independently until and continued under the ownership of Electronic Arts until EA commissioned various spinoffs from other companies during the s focusing on console and mobile releases A EA Maxis reboot was subject to what has been described as one of the most disastrous launches in history which may have triggered the shutdown of Maxis Emeryville and the end of the franchise br br SimCity titles are real time management and construction simulators Across most titles the player acting as mayor is given a blank map to begin and must expand the city with the budget provided As the city matures the player may be able to add government and other special buildings such as a mayor s house or courthouse depending on how large the city is Proper management of the city requires citizens to be provided with basic utilities electricity water and sometimes waste management along with public services such as health education safety parks and leisure facilities These are provided by building relevant buildings or infrastructure with each building covering a circular range in its vicinity Inadequate funding of these services can lead to strikes or even urban decline br The primary source of income is taxation though some income can be generated by legalizing gambling or placing certain special buildings such as military bases or prisons The player may make deals with neighbouring cities to sell or buy services as long as a connection is made to the neighbour for that service such as electricity cables The player may have to deal with disasters such as fires and tornadoes or fictional crises such as monster attacks SimCity titles are predominantly single player games with a few exceptions including the Network Edition of SimCity the Unix port of the original SimCity and SimCity SimCity provided a limited form of multiplayer gaming with the ability to share regional maps and cities with other players allowing players to collaborate but not to interact in real time gameplay br Depending on the title there may scenarios with city performance related goals and time limits in which to complete them br br Development of the original SimCity began in under game designer Will Wright and the game was published in Wright was inspired by a map creation feature of the game Raid on Bungeling Bay that led him to discover that he enjoyed creating maps more than playing the actual game While developing SimCity Wright cultivated a love of the intricacies and theories of urban planning and acknowledges the influence of Jay Wright Forrester s book Urban Dynamics In addition Wright was inspired by reading The Seventh Sally a short story by Stanis aw Lem from The Cyberiad published in the collection The Mind s I in which an engineer encounters a deposed tyrant and creates a miniature city with artificial citizens for the tyrant to oppress br The first version of the game was developed for the Commodore under the working title Micropolis The game represented an unusual paradigm in computer gaming in that it could neither be won nor lost as a result game publishers did not believe it was possible to market and sell such a game successfully Br derbund declined to publish the title when Wright proposed it and he pitched it to a range of major game publishers without success Founder Jeff Braun of then tiny Maxis agreed to publish SimCity as one of two initial games for the company Wright and Braun returned to Br derbund to formally clear the rights to the game in when SimCity was near completion Br derbund executives Gary Carlston and Don Daglow saw that the title was infectious and fun and signed Maxis to a distribution deal for both of its initial games With that four years after initial development SimCity was released for the Amiga and Macintosh platforms followed by the IBM PC and Commodore later in br SimCity was released in on the ZX Spectrum K and K by Infogrames The SNES port was very similar to the original edition but had some unique features including Reward buildings a Mario statue and possible attacks by a giant Bowser br The unexpected and enduring success of the original SimCity combined with other Sim titles relative lack of success at the time motivated the development of a sequel SimCity released in with an isometric view instead of overhead Underground layers were introduced for water pipes and subways along with many new buildings more elaborate financial controls and many other improvements br br Maxis was purchased by Electronic Arts in and the company would gain control of the SimCity brand Will Wright continued to work at the company moving on to work on The Sims with development on future SimCity titles being led by other Maxis staff such as Christine McGavran The next title SimCity was released in It introduced many features including waste management agriculture business deals and expanded inter city relations The game maintained the pseudo isometric dimetric perspective of its predecessor though the landscape became more complex and colorful br The Japanese exclusive SimCity was released in and featured the ability to view the city at night pedestrian level free roaming and individual road vehicles and pedestrians which could only be seen while in the free roaming mode Cities in the game were also presented in D hybrid graphics a first for the franchise br SimCity was released on January Among various changes cities were now located in regions which were divided into individual segments Each region represents the metropolitan area of a city while individual segment maps represented districts The zoning system was updated and buildings were classified into several wealth levels types and building size stages which were affected by the region s population and condition Urban decay and gentrification were simulated with buildings deteriorating or improving accordingly Residents and neighbourhoods were transferrable between SimCity and The Sims br br After the release of SimCity EA had Tilted Mill Entertainment develop the next major title in the franchise rather than Maxis The group developed SimCity Societies which was significantly different from prior games owing to a small scale social engineering focus and less detailed simulation Rather than placing zones buildings were constructed individually for example similar to Monte Cristo s game City Life Six social energies called societal values allowed players to learn about the characteristics of the citizens Cities behaviour responded to the energies the players chose and the reward system from SimCity returned The game was met with mixed reviews Wright at the time developing Spore later commented on the move away from Maxis I didn t have anything to do with that decision Honestly I didn t even play Societies I read some of the reviews of it though br SimCity DS a heavily modified version of SimCity was released that year The game made use of the handheld s dual screen to display additional interfaces at once System specific features were prominent such as the microphone which was used to blow out fires and the touch screen which was used to control the interface A sequel introduced a challenge mode in which players guided their city through different historical periods For instance the player could create a medieval city or a pre historic city br On January the source code of the original game was released under the free software GPL license The release of the source code was related to the donation of SimCity software to the One Laptop Per Child laptop as one of the principles of the OLPC laptop is the use of free and open source software The open source version was called Micropolis since EA retained the trademark SimCity br SimCity Creator for the Wii was announced on February The title featured the ability to directly draw roads and train tracks on the ground using the pointer function of the Wii Remote as well as several customizable themes for the city s buildings It was released worldwide in September br The late s and early s also saw several games re released for mobile devices This included SimCity SimCity Deluxe and SimCity for Blackberry playbook br br SimCity s sixth major release was announced on March for Windows and Mac OS X by Maxis at the game changers event Titled SimCity it was a dramatic departure from previous SimCity games featuring full D graphics online multiplayer gameplay the new Glassbox engine as well as many other feature and gameplay changes Director Ocean Quigley discussed issues that occurred during the development of the title which stemmed from two conflicting visions coming from EA and Maxis EA wanted to emphasize multiplayer collaborative gameplay with some of the simulation work conducted on remote servers in part to combat piracy In contrast Maxis wanted to focus on graphical improvements with the new title Quigley described the resultant title as a poor compromise between these two objectives with only shallow multiplayer features and a small city size limit one quarter of the land area of previous titles in the franchise br The game was released for Windows on March and on Mac in August Medium would later refer to the release as one of the most disastrous launches in history The game required a constant internet connection even during single player activity and server outages caused connection errors for many users Multiplayer elements were shallow at best with departing players leaving abandoned cities behind in public regions Users were unable to save their game with the servers instead intended to handle this and so when users were disconnected they would often lose hours of progress The game was also plagued by numerous bugs which persisted long after launch br The title was heavily criticized in user reviews and developer plans for post launch updates were scrapped EA announced that they would offer a free game from their library to all those who bought SimCity as compensation for the problems and they concurred that the way the launch had been set up was dumb As a result of this problem Amazon temporarily stopped selling the game in the week after release The always online requirement even in single play was highly criticised particularly after gamers determined that the internet connection requirement could be easily removed An offline mode was subsequently made available by EA in March and a mobile port entitled SimCity BuildIt was released later that year br It has been suggested that the poor performance of SimCity was responsible for the closure of Maxis Emeryville studios and the end of the franchise br br During the s a large number of games were developed under the Sim nomenclature started by Maxis in This list includes only spin offs that directly relate to SimCity br br SimFarm was released in for DOS Windows and Mac and is a spinoff of SimCity SimFarm focuses on developing a farm allowing the player to plant crops and grow their farm br br Sim City The Card Game is an out of print collectible card game based on the video game SimCity It was released in by Mayfair Games Several city expansions followed adding location and politician cards from various cities including Chicago Washington New York City and Atlanta A Toronto expansion was planned but never released Allen Varney of The Duelist said it offers fine solitaire play and that the game eventually offered stand alone city sets br br SimTown is a video game published by Maxis much like SimCity but on a smaller scale SimTown allows the player to construct a town consisting of streets houses businesses and parks and control the people in it SimTown was targeted more towards children br br In Maxis introduced SimGolf a video game where players have the freedom to design their own golf courses complete with terrain adjustments and various hazards Players can also opt to play on pre designed courses by golf course architect Robert Trent Jones Jr br br SimCopter puts the player in the role of a helicopter pilot There are two modes of play free mode and career mode The free mode lets the player import and fly through imported SimCity cities or any of the cities supplied with the game However user cities sometimes need to be designed with SimCopter in mind and most of the time the player must increase the number of police stations fire stations and hospitals to allow for speedier dispatches The second mode the heart of the game is the career mode This puts the player in the shoes of a pilot doing various jobs around the city The game is notable for being the debut of the Simlish language br The game gained controversy when a designer named Jacques Servin inserted sprites of shirtless himbos male bimbos in Speedo trunks who hugged and kissed each other and appeared in great numbers from time to time The easter egg was caught shortly after release and removed from future copies of the game br br Streets of SimCity is a racing and vehicular combat computer game published by Maxis One of the game s main attractions was the ability to explore any cities created in SimCity by car in a cinematic style The game like SimCopter is in full D and the player s vehicle can be controlled using a keyboard a joystick or a gamepad Another notable feature is the game s network mode in which players can play deathmatches with up to seven other individuals It is one of the few games in the Maxis series that Will Wright did not work on and the last Maxis game to be developed and released without supervision by Electronic Arts which acquired Maxis in and assisted development of Maxis games thereafter br br Originating as a spinoff The Sims quickly evolved into one of the most successful video game franchises of all time Early releases retained a level of interconnectivity with SimCity such as the ability to transfer neighbourhoods from SimCity to The Sims A crossover title SimsVille was earmarked for and would have allowed the player to build the city as well as make sims and play them The game was cancelled so that Maxis could focus on future Sims expansions and development for The Sims br br SimCityEDU Pollution Challenge is an educational version of SimCity designed by GlassLab br br The first two games were well received and sold well during the s with the franchise achieving a total of million sales by SimCity in particular was among the highest selling games of the s and in was featured at of IGN s top video games of all time SimCity marked the high point in the franchise s GameRankings score at The reboot was very poorly received with Green Man Gaming comparing its effect on the franchise to the destruction of the city of Pompeii br The cities presented in the franchise have been criticised for being unrealistic lacking parking and cycle lanes for example SimCity games are also built on the premise that simply adding police stations reduces crime nearby which may not be the case br br The franchise has been credited with inspiring a generation of urban planners transport officials and local government figures who experienced the games at a younger age and took on those careers in later life Various editions of the game have been used in education to simulate urban planning for students in elementary through college classes br While there were a handful of city building games before SimCity popularized the genre and laid the groundwork for many titles inspired by it including Cities Skylines which was greenlit after the poor reception of the reboot More broadly the lack of a win condition in favor of open ended play was a novelty at the time that gave rise to Maxis software toys design concept which influenced many other titles from the company br br List of city building video games br br Official website
