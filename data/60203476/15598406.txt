and his other possessions made him think about adapting that life experience into a game When Wright initially took his ideas to the Maxis board of directors they were skeptical and gave little support or financing for the game The directors at Electronic Arts which bought Maxis in were more receptive SimCity had been a great success for them and they foresaw the possibility of building a strong Sim franchise br Wright has stated that The Sims was meant as a satire of U S consumer culture Wright took ideas from the architecture and urban design book A Pattern Language American
