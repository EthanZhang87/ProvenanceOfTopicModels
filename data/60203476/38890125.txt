Merenkahre and Shepseheret may be able to restore the tablet s power but that they are in the British Museum Larry convinces museum curator Dr McPhee who was fired due to the planetarium incident to

review praising the visual effects and calling the production values topnotch and admiring Guillermo Navarro s work He added A most enjoyable capper to director Shawn Levy and producer Chris Columbus cheerfully silly and sneakily smart family entertainment juggernaut offers little in the way of secrets of surprises but should add much holiday cheer to Fox s box office coffers Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the film three stars out of five and said The third part in what absolutely no one is calling the Night at the Museum trilogy turns out to be a good natured and entertainingly surreal panto fantasy Glenn Kenny awarded the film stars out of praising the Indiana Jones themed set while criticizing the performances of the cast and said As talent packed as any Night at the Museum picture may be in this third installment one doesn t come to a movie of this sort expecting anybody s best work Or at least one certainly shouldn t because it won t materialize Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review saying The third installment Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb may be the best and even the generally wound too tight Ben Stiller once again playing a bemused Museum of Natural History guard is easy to tolerate Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying Where the previous films felt frenetic and forced this outing feels breezier more enjoyable and less contrived Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News gave the film three out of five stars saying There s a serenity to museum visits especially if it s a place you know and love Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb amazingly recaptures that feeling in big studio franchise form br Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film two out of five stars saying Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb is a rather lackluster affair a cash grab that tries to aim a little higher but confuses sappy shortcuts with real emotion Joe McGovern of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B saying It s kind of fun unembarrassingly and not least of all because the people who made it look like they had a good time doing so Tom Long of The Detroit News gave the film a B saying There are some key elements that make this Night at the Museum sequel work better than its predecessor Stephen Whitty of the Newark Star Ledger gave the film two out of four stars saying The exhibits in this Night at the Museum may still come to life nightly But their latest movie stays stubbornly inert Tom Russo of The Boston Globe gave the film two and a half stars out of four saying Seeing Ben Stiller the late Robin Williams and their magically roused gang together again this time in London is initially all about indulgent nostalgic smiles rather than new wows But then comes the movie s exceptionally clever and fresh final act which delivers genuine surprise along with many laughs Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave the film three out of five stars saying The third Night at the Museum film starts strongly with its heart in the past It s an exciting opening and perhaps too exciting for the film s own good It s hard not to be disappointed when the plot moves back to the present and settles into the time honoured formula of digitised creatures running riot and famous people in fancy dress doing shtick Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review saying Despite relocating across the pond to the esteemed British Museum the creaky Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb fails to capitalize on the comic potential provided by that change of venue br Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A V Club gave the film a C saying Secret of the Tomb plays it as a source of corny jokes pop culture references and father son bonding moments In other words it s exactly the kind of film that shouldn t be expected to engage with its assorted bizarre subtexts but what a movie it could be if it did Sara Stewart of the New York Post gave the film two out of four stars saying For piquing kids interest in history and nature you could do worse than this goofy Ben Stiller franchise But its third installment is more meh than manic too reliant on wide shots of the ragtag Museum of Natural History cohorts striding down corridors You get the feeling returning director Shawn Levy is ready to hang it up Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun Times gave the film one and a half stars out of five saying The dialogue is schmaltzy and often painfully unfunny The special effects are often so s bad one wonders if it was a deliberate choice to make the creepy visuals of sculptures dancing and paintings moving less frightening to young viewers Time and again terrific actors sink in the equivalent of cinematic quicksand helpless against the sucking sound of this movie Drew Hunt of Slant Magazine gave the film one out of four stars saying None of the entries in the Night at the Museum series could ever pass for high art but a wealth of comedic talent gave the first two installments a madcap energy that somewhat forgave their childish premises Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb the third and supposedly final edition in the franchise is nothing more than an uncomfortably transparent contractual obligation br br br Accolades br br br Sequel br br In August following the purchase of st Century Fox and its assets by The
