Production br Most of the scenes were filmed in Atlanta Georgia and at the Georgia Institute of Technology which posed as a double for the Googleplex since the company normally does not allow filming on the actual Googleplex for security and productivity reasons Vaughn came up with the idea after watching a Minutes segment on Google s work culture and subsequently brought the idea to director Shawn Levy Google agreed to work with the film producers with founder Larry Page noting that computer science has a marketing problem Google also felt it would help further explain their Don t be evil mantra Although Reuters reported that as part of the deal Google asked for creative control Levy denied the company was involved with the script insisting that Google only assisted from a technical perspective CNN reported that the studio did give some control to Google over the depiction of its products br br br Reception br On Rotten Tomatoes The Internship has an approval rating of based on

Here s why Google is so successful It s figured out a way for Twentieth Century Fox to make a two hour Google commercial disguised as a summer comedy Stephen Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote on his review The Internship itself would be kind of charming too if this Google recruitment film this minute commercial for Googliness weren t so downright creepy The Guardian s David Cox described the movie as a two hour corporate video while British film critic Mark Kermode called the film the longest advert I ve seen in the cinema He dismissed it as one of the most witless humourless vomit inducing horribly self satisfied smug unfunny comedies I have ever seen br Another critique was that combining Vaughn and Wilson with Google was poorly timed and that the film would have been much more successful had it been released on the heels of Vaughn and Wilson s success in s Wedding Crashers This fact of timing was satirized by a video news story run by The Onion a satirical newspaper
