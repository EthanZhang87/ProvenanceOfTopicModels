id: 61843
The Academy Award for Best Visual Effects is presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences AMPAS for the best achievement in visual effects It has been handed to four members of the team directly responsible for creating the film s visual effects since br br The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences first recognized the technical contributions of special effects to movies at its inaugural dinner in presenting a plaque for Best Engineering Effects to the first Best Picture Oscar winner the World War I flying drama Wings br Producer David O Selznick then production head at RKO Studios petitioned the Academy Board of Governors to recognize the work of animator Willis O Brien for his groundbreaking work on s King Kong However the Academy did not have a category to acknowledge its visual achievements at the time br It was not until when a film was actually recognized for its effects work when a Special Achievement Award for Special Effects was given to the Paramount film Spawn of the North The following year Best Special Effects became a recognized category although on occasion the Academy has chosen to honor a single film outright rather than nominate two or more films From to it was an award for a film s visual effects as well as audio effects so it was often given to two persons although some years only one or the other type of effect was recognized In it was given only for visual effects and the following year the name of the category was changed to Best Special Visual Effects br Honorees for this award have been bestowed several times as a Special Achievement Academy Award In the category was given its current name Best Visual Effects For decades shortlisted finalists were selected by a steering committee They are presently chosen by the visual effects branch executive committee was the last year there were no official nominees Back to the Future Part III Dick Tracy Ghost and Total Recall advanced to a second stage of voting but only Total Recall received a requisite average and it was given a special achievement Oscar br There have been three wholly animated films nominated in this category The Nightmare Before Christmas in Kubo and the Two Strings in and The Lion King in There have been three semi animated films nominated which also won Mary Poppins in Bedknobs and Broomsticks in and Who Framed Roger Rabbit in In Godzilla Minus One became the first non English language film ever to win in the category br br In there were five films nominated For most of the next three decades there were three nominees a year although at some times there were two and at others a single film was given the award outright br In it was decided that a list of no more than eligible films would be chosen from which a maximum of seven would be shortlisted for further consideration A vote would then proceed with a maximum of three nominees Since there are ten shortlisted finalists which using a form of range voting produce five nominees No more than four people may be nominated for a single film br According to the official Academy Award rules the criteria are br br a consideration of the contribution the visual effects make to the overall production and br b the artistry skill and fidelity with which the visual illusions are achieved br br A number of filmmakers have had their movies honored for their achievements in visual effects i e six by director James Cameron who began his career in Hollywood as an effects technician five films produced by George Pal five by director producer George Lucas four by directors Richard Fleischer Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson three by directors Robert Zemeckis and Christopher Nolan and two by directors Clarence Brown Cecil B DeMille Mark Robson Ridley Scott Robert Stevenson and Denis Villeneuve br Only two directors have won in the same category Four time Best Director nominee Stanley Kubrick s only Oscar win for s A Space Odyssey and Japanese filmmaker Takashi Yamazaki s first Oscar win for s Godzilla Minus One The credits for list four effects contributors including Douglas Trumbull However according to the rules of the Academy in effect at the time only three persons could be nominated for their work on a single film which would have resulted in the omission of either Trumbull Tom Howard Con Pederson or Wally Veevers Ultimately it was Kubrick s name that was submitted as a nominee in this category resulting in his winning the award which many consider a slight to the four men whose work contributed to the film s success br br The
