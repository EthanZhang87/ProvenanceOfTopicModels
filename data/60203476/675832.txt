and Leff were eventually credited with the story of the film but not the screenplay br Several script doctors did uncredited work on the script including Carrie Fisher Larry Ferguson and William

publicity after a rough cut of it was shown to a preview audience in May Sony then destroyed the test cards and the word of mouth proved to be catastrophic for the film br The shooting and editing schedule were so demanding and so close to the June release date that after the movie s release a source close to the film said that they shouldn t have had Siskel and Ebert telling us the movie is minutes too long br Sony was even more humiliated the weekend after the film opened when the movie lost of its opening weekend audience and had TriStar s Sleepless in Seattle open as the number two

after Jurassic Park which went on to break box office records as one of the top grossing films of all time br Schwarzenegger states that he tried to persuade his coproducers to postpone the film s June release in the United States by four weeks but they turned a deaf ear on the grounds that the film would have lost millions of dollars in revenue for every weekend of the summer it ended up

received mixed reviews from critics On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of based on reviews and an average rating of The site s critical consensus reads Last Action Hero has most of the right ingredients for a big budget action spoof but its scattershot tone and uneven structure only add up to a confused chaotic mess On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of out of based on critics indicating mixed or average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of C on an A to F scale br Roger Ebert gave the film stars out of writing that despite some entertaining moments Last Action Hero plays more like a bright idea than like a movie that was thought through It doesn t evoke the mystery of the barrier between audience and screen the way Woody Allen did in The Purple Rose of Cairo and a lot of the time it simply seems to be standing around commenting on itself br Vincent Canby likened the film to a two hour Saturday Night Live sketch and called it something of a mess but a frequently enjoyable one br Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote Last Action Hero makes such a strenuous show of winking at the audience and itself that it seems to be celebrating nothing so much as its own awfulness In a sense the movie s incipient commercial failure completes it aesthetically br Variety called it a joyless soulless machine of a movie an million plus mishmash of fantasy industry in jokes self referential parody film buff gags and too big action set pieces Halliwell s Film Guide described it as a film that tries to have it both ways simultaneously mocking and celebrating the conventions of action movies which leaves audiences as well as the actors and director in a state of bewildered confusion John Ferguson of Radio Times was more positive awarding it four stars out of five and stating An Arnold Schwarzenegger backlash had been on the cards for some time and when this extravaganza was released the knives were well and truly out It was actually all a little unfair because this is a smart funny blockbuster Schwarzenegger has rarely been better and he is backed up by a never ending stream of star names in cameo roles And although McTiernan has fun spoofing the conventions of the action genre he still manages to slip in some spectacular set pieces br br br Legacy br About the film s failure and critical response John McTiernan said Initially it was a wonderful Cinderella story with a nine year old boy We had a pretty good script by Bill Goldman charming And this ludicrous hype machine got hold of it and it got buried under bullshit It was so overwhelmed with baggage And then it was whipped out unedited practically assembled right out of the camera It was in the theater five or six weeks after I finished shooting It was kamikaze stupid no good reason for it And then to open the week after Jurassic Park God To get to the depth of bad judgment involved in that you d need a snorkel Later Schwarzenegger blamed the film s poor performance on bad press and the election of Democratic president Bill Clinton which he said influenced audiences to see s action film stars as lowbrow In he said streaming services gave the film its chance to reach new audiences unencumbered by the bad press In Netflix s three part docuseries Arnold released in the actor recalled how the failure of the movie affected him When Last Action Hero came out I had reached my peak after Terminator having the most successful movie of the year worldwide I cannot tell you how upset that I was about the negative Last Action Hero reviews It hurts you It hurts your feelings It s embarrassing I didn t want to see anyone for a week but you keep plodding along Director James Cameron said that he had called Schwarzenegger the weekend after Last Action Hero opened and recalled that it was the only time he s ever heard him down Cameron continued He took it as a deep blow to his brand I think it really shook him br Shane Black was very critical of the movie It was a mess There was a movie in there struggling to emerge which would have pleased me But what they d made was a jarring random collection of scenes br In the years since the release of Last Action Hero the film has developed a strong cult following Schwarzenegger singled out that movie as his most underrated Last Action Hero was great it wasn t fantastic but it was underrated Now more and more people are seeing it and saying I love this movie I m getting the residual checks so I know it s true It made money that s always an important thing for me Because it s show business right Later Charles Dance said I think they just didn t time the release very well It came out more or less at the same time as something very big referring to Jurassic Park But it was fun to do He also praised Schwarzenegger Arnold is a very smart man oh yes Very definitely And very funny and very aware br br br Accolades br The film was
