February The Rising Star Award nominees which is the only category voted for by the British public were announced on February the nomination and eventual win of Lashana Lynch confused commentators who did not consider her rising br The epic science fiction film Dune received the most nominations with eleven The Power of the Dog and Belfast followed with eight and six respectively The former ultimately won two Best Film and Best Director Jane Campion Dune received the most wins with five but did not take home any major category awards br The ceremony was hosted by actress and comedian Rebel Wilson Many winners were not present to collect their awards though the ceremony was exclusively in person This allowed the speeches of winners who were present to go on at length While many awards were won by frontrunners in the Oscars race a surprise win came in the Best Actress category already populated by no Oscar nominees for Welsh actress Joanna Scanlan for her performance in After Love br br br Winners and nominees br br The nominees were announced on February The winners were announced on March br This year BAFTA did not hand out two of its honorary awards BAFTA Fellowship and

listed first and highlighted in boldface br br br Ceremony information br br The ceremony was broadcast on BBC One BBC One HD and BBC iPlayer at p m on March the day of the ceremony and was available to stream exclusively on BritBox in North America and South Africa simultaneously with the UK broadcast The broadcast was not live with the awards presentation and some parts were edited out including host Rebel Wilson ranting about a film production gone awry and cursing the production company Wilson was selected as host after having presented an award at the previous in person BAFA ceremony in February in his live coverage of the ceremony for The Guardian British film journalist Stuart Heritage wrote that Wilson had been the only funny part of the ceremony br While Heritage enjoyed many parts of Wilson s opening monologue at the ceremony including jokes about the demise of the BAF T As and her own weight loss he was unimpressed with her wordplay regarding Tom Hiddleston s low key Loki appearance at the ceremony Heritage went on to note throughout the broadcast that Wilson s various skits including drawing nipples on a flip chart inviting Andy Serkis to defile a cake shaped like Benedict Cumberbatch and throwing her bras into the audience were bad NME wrote that while the hosting was troubled Wilson improved towards the end of the ceremony particularly her one liners Digital Spy by collecting popular tweets about the ceremony reported that many viewers were off put by Wilson s unfunny hosting though some enjoyed the fact she did not hold back when it came to topical humour The BBC which broadcast the ceremony agreed that Wilson s monologue and one liners were her strongest points writing that some of her other jokes fell flat but they thought on the whole she did a fine job The Telegraph was instead highly negative of Wilson s hosting and the mismatched tone of the ceremony she created but praised her ability to plough on anyway it also noted that in coming on after a strong opening song Wilson was already at a disadvantage br The de facto theme of the ceremony was all things Bond Opening the ceremony to mark the th anniversary of the James Bond franchise Dame Shirley Bassey who is connected with the franchise after contributing to the soundtrack of multiple Bond films throughout her career performed a rendition of the title song from Diamonds Are Forever the seventh installment of the franchise with NME praising that her voice was as good as ever writing At her voice remains fully capable of filling the Royal Albert Hall to the rafters Before the ceremony it was announced that Bassey would perform an iconic Bond theme only to be revealed on the night Also performing live during the ceremony was English actress and singer Emilia Jones nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her performance in CODA She performed a rendition of Joni Mitchell s Both Sides Now which her character sings in the film she was joined by two translators signing the song in American Sign Language ASL and British Sign Language BSL br Jones performance was introduced by Wilson who while welcoming the interpreters joked that the sign for Vladimir Putin was instead universal holding up a middle finger to the camera The same gesture had been made in a different context a week earlier at the th Independent Spirit Awards by its hosts Megan Mullally and Nick Offerman and presenter Kristen Stewart Deaf journalist Liam O Dell wrote that Wilson s version was offensive to sign language users as it reduced their language and accessibility to a punchline Other political humour included Wilson saying she cut a planned musical number about Prince Andrew called Pizza Express and a lengthy but earnest joke Serkis made about the policies of Home Secretary Priti Patel while introducing the award for Best Director Serious statements regarding the War in Ukraine were also made by Wilson following the In Memoriam montage and by BAFTA Chair Krishnendu Majumdar in his opening speech condemning the Russian invasion and reading a message from the Ukrainian Film Academy For the second year in a row Prince William Duke of Cambridge BAFTA President did not attend the ceremony instead delivering a speech via a pre recorded video that aired during the ceremony br The acceptance speeches during the ceremony were noted for their excessive length Heritage found some of them overlong but several of them instead moving He also noted that the speeches could afford to run long because the lack of winners present at the ceremony naturally cut down on speech time Heritage was more critical towards the nominees for not attending saying that they BAFTA could have held this ceremony in a minivan for all the people who turned up to collect their awards and before the In Memoriam montage that people featured in it actually have a good excuse for not being there While hosting Wilson made a poorly received joke about the personal life of Best Actor in a Leading Role winner Will Smith and at the response commented that it was deserved as Smith had not shown up to the ceremony The high number of absent nominees may be attributed to the ceremony taking place on the same day as the th Critics Choice Awards which rescheduled their ceremony shortly beforehand and stated that there were no other possible dates acknowledging the clash and setting up a parallel venue in London in addition to usual city Los Angeles to encourage people to attend both ceremonies br In a series of long speeches Lady Gaga introduced last year s Rising Star Award winner Bukky Bakray so that Bakray could present the award Lashana Lynch ultimately won Heritage was also critical of this explaining his outlook by noting that Lynch had already risen quite high playing main characters in major movies including Captain Marvel plus other Marvel Cinematic Universe entries and the Bond film No Time to Die and so her career did not need the profile boost of the Rising Star Award NME was more positive writing that the award underlines her rise Lynch s acceptance speech referred to her family migrating as part of the Windrush generation and how they taught her about failure about noes and what noes mean and how to celebrate your yeses preparing her for the film industry br Unusually none of the Best Actress nominees were also nominated in the same category at the th Academy Awards Additionally of the actresses nominated for the BAFA only Lady Gaga had been nominated at the th Screen Actors Guild Awards American film journalist Anne Thompson described Joanna Scanlan s nomination in the category as bizarre Scanlan ultimately won and was surprised herself In her speech she thanked BAFTA in Welsh NME and British film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote that she was a deserving winner In winning the award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role CODA actor Troy Kotsur became the first deaf actor to win a BAFA as well as the first deaf actor to win a BAFTA in a major category and first deaf male actor to win a BAFTA Bradshaw had worried that Belfast winning Outstanding British Film and thus being labelled British could have been controversial but was very pleased to see it was not significantly so attributing this to the quality of the film br Overall Bradshaw felt that the winners were well judged and satisfying Heritage also noted that the BAFA winners at the ceremony gave little fresh insight to the likely Oscar winners with a mix of frontrunner and left field wins br br br Statistics br br br In Memoriam br The In Memoriam montage this year was played to the song Send In the Clowns by Stephen Sondheim who was included within the montage br The following appeared br br br See also br br br br
