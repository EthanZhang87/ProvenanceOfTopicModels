br br Television br br br Legion br br After completing work on the first season of Fargo at FX in Noah Hawley was presented with the opportunity to develop the first live action television series based on the X Men comics of which he was a fan when growing up Hawley was initially pitched two different ideas for the potential series including an adaptation of the comics Hellfire Club but the ideas did not interest Hawley Instead he worked with X Men film series writer and producer Simon Kinberg to reverse engineer an idea for the series set in alternate continuity to that of the film series After discussing an interesting show in this genre that isn t being done the two settled on the character of David Haller Legion Hawley found the character interesting because of his mental illness and for the potential of the series to depict his unique mindset He pitched the series as a deconstruction of a villain and a love story br In October FX ordered a pilot for Legion with Marvel Television and FX Productions producing FX Productions would handle the physical production Hawley was set to write the pilot and executive produce the series alongside X Men film producers Lauren Shuler Donner Bryan Singer and Kinberg Marvel Television executives Jeph Loeb and Jim Chory and Hawley s Fargo collaborator John Cameron Steve Blackman Alan Fine Stan Lee Joe Quesada and Karim Zreik also executive produce Hawley s initial script for the series was described as less fractured cohesive and much more regular However he quickly reconceived the series and decided more Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Terrence Malick more whimsy more impressionistic and went in that direction By January FX President John Landgraf was confident that the series would be picked up by the network saying that the vast majority of things that we pilot do go forward to series and the scripts for Legion are extraordinary That May FX ordered an eight episode first season of Legion starring Dan Stevens as the title character alongside Rachel Keller Aubrey Plaza Jean Smart Jeremie Harris Amber Midthunder Katie Aselton Bill Irwin Jemaine Clement and Hamish Linklater with Navid Negahban and Lauren Tsai respectively joining the cast in the second and third seasons br In January Landgraf stated that the series would be set in a universe parallel to the X Men films where the US government is in the early days of being aware that something called mutants exist but the public is not He felt it was unlikely that characters would cross over between the show and films but noted that this could change between then and the premiere of the series In August Singer confirmed that Legion had actually been designed to fit into the X Men film series universe but also to stand alone so you wouldn t have to label the relationship between the series and the films He teased plans to have the series relate to future X Men movies At New York Comic Con Donner said that the series is far from the X Men movies but still lives in that universe The only way for X Men to keep moving forward is to be original and to surprise And this is a surprise It is very very different Hawley explained that because the series is depicting the title character s subjective reality it would not have to address any connections to the films straight away noting that Fargo which is connected to the film of the same name at first had to stand on its own feet before exploring its explicit continuity connections more We have to earn the right to be part of this universe My hope is we create something so strong that the people in the movie studio call and say they would be foolish enough not to connect these things He did state that you can t tell this story without acknowledging that Legion is the son of the same incarnation of Charles Xavier who appears in the films portrayed by Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy br Donner stated in January that having Hawley focus on Haller s perspective of reality rather than connections to the X Men films allowed the series to avoid the convoluted continuity of the films because we play with so many different timelines and we rebooted and not really rebooted and all that throughout the films Therefore the cinematic universe will not worry about Legion For the onscreen confirmation that Xavier is Haller s father in Chapter with Xavier s signature wheelchair shown in a brief flashback the series production was able to choose from any of the variant wheelchairs used throughout the film series They settled on the version from X Men Apocalypse with the prop used in that film being brought out of storage for the show In March Patrick Stewart was approached about reprising his role as Xavier from the film series in the series third season saying he was Absolutely willing to reprise the role while having Stewart return as a present day Xavier had been seriously considered by showrunner Noah Hawley he elected the older character s presence to be unnecessary upon deciding to have the season revolve around time travel and after finding James McAvoy to be unavailable for filming cast Harry Lloyd as a young Xavier br br br The Gifted br br In July after a series based on the Hellfire Club an X Men comic property did not move forward at Fox the network made a put pilot commitment for a different X Men based series The new

Television with th handling the physical production of the series and Nix executive producing alongside X Men film series producers Bryan Singer Lauren Shuler Donner and Simon Kinberg and Marvel Television executives Jeph Loeb and Jim Chory Nix pitched the series to executives as Running on Empty with mutants He created an elaborate presentation using Prezi which included photos of preferred actors that he had altered to look like mutants and graphics to explain how the series would fit in with the continuity of the X Men films On May Fox ordered the show to series as The Gifted The pilot had been called one of the hottest pilots of the broadcast development season by commentators The first season consists of episodes In August Len Wiseman joined as a director and executive producer for the season That October Nix said that he had planned a couple of seasons in broad strokes and stated that he wanted to be doing this show for a long time Noting a growing trend in shorter self contained television seasons Nix said that he wanted the show to feel more like a traditional long running story and so have each season end in a satisfying way that does not feel close ended br On

director James Mangold stated that it was related Marvel later officially classified the film as a separate universe from the film series in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A Z Within the Marvel multiverse the original timeline was officially designated as Earth the events of Deadpool as Earth the events of Logan as Earth while the new timeline consisting of the prequel films Deadpool

guzzling wham bang Hollywood franchise these three movies sport philosophy ideas a telethon load of causes and a highly elastic us versus them allegory Morris praised X Men The Last Stand for put ting the heroes of a mighty summer blockbuster in a rare mortal position Realism at this time of year How unorthodox Roger Ebert gave the films mostly positive reviews but criticized them for the amount of mutants stating their powers are so various and ill matched that it s hard to keep them all on the same canvas br The first two films were highly praised due to their cerebral tone However when director Bryan Singer left the series many criticized his successor Brett Ratner Colin Colvert of the Star Tribune felt Singer s sensitivity to the discrimination themes made the first two X Men films surprisingly resonant and soulful for comic based summer extravaganzas Singer is adept at juggling large casts of three dimensional characters Ratner makes shallow unimaginative bang ups James Berardinelli felt X Men The Last Stand isn t as taut or satisfying as X Men but it s better constructed and better paced than the original X Men The differences in quality between the three are minor however despite the change in directors there seems to be a single vision David Denby of The New Yorker praised the liquid beauty and the poetic fantasy of Singer s work but called Ratner s film a crude synthesizer of comedy and action tropes Singer s third film in the series X Men Days of Future Past was also well received Alonso Duralde of The Wrap felt that Singer keeps things moving along briskly enough that you can just go along with the ride of Superhero Stuff without getting bogged down Spider Man director Sam Raimi said he was a fan of the series particularly Singer s films Film historian Kim Newman also tonally compared Batman Begins to Singer s films Logan was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay br There was criticism of the large casts and the limited screen time available for all of them Richard George of IGN reacted well to the depictions of Wolverine Professor X Magneto Jean Grey Storm William Stryker Mystique Beast and Nightcrawler however George thought many of the younger X Men characters such as Rogue Iceman Pyro Angel and Kitty Pryde were adjectiveless teenagers and was disappointed by Cyclops characterization He observed the filmmakers were big fans of silent henchmen due to the small roles of the various villainous mutants such as Lady Deathstrike and Psylocke Jesse Schedeen of IGN stated that the continuity of the films does not make sense with dead characters returning with zero or little explanation different versions of the same character appearing across multiple films and plot points that are conveniently ignored in later films He also criticized th Century Fox for not mapping out the series from the beginning In his review of Dark Phoenix Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal characterized the entire X Men film series as being a notoriously erratic franchise br br br Legacy br Richard George of IGN stated that the success of the first X Men film paved the way for comic book film adaptations such as the Spider Man series Fantastic Four V for Vendetta and Singer s Superman Returns Chris Hewitt of Empire magazine called the first X Men film as the catalyst for films based on Marvel Comics characters stating Singer s film is the catalyst for everything that s come since good and bad Without it there s no Marvel Studios Comic book writer Mark Millar said that Singer s X Men
