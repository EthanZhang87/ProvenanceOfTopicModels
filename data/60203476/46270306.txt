who turned it down twice Steven Spielberg finally signed on to direct and produce the film which Kristie Macosko Krieger also produced along with De Line and Farah Cline and Penn made several revisions while adapting the novel to film Most of these changes were to eliminate scenes that would be uninteresting in a visual format such as when Wade beats a high score in Pac Man or recites all

some local businesses and residents to call emergency services as no prior notice was given by the production team Other locations in the city included the former industrial area of Digbeth and some of the city s landmarks were erased and replaced with CGI buildings to create a dystopian future Ohio Outside of Birmingham filming also took place at Warner Bros Studios Leavesden and at Solaris House the former Sun Microsystems headquarters in Surrey Principal photography wrapped on September br br Industrial Light Magic ILM Digital Domain and Territory Studio developed the visual effects with some pre visualization work done by The Third Floor For three hours three days a week Spielberg met with ILM which was in charge of the OASIS segments and produced the bulk of the visual effects shots with in total Spielberg remarked that this is the most difficult movie I ve done since Saving Private Ryan as three hour long meetings a week were necessitated to discuss the visual effects Visual effects supervisor Roger Guyett stated that the VFX team would collaborate with Spielberg and writers Cline and Penn What we did at one point was to have a card for every single character that we considered to be a hero character within the movie and we put them up on a board and Steven and everyone else spent hours assigning them to scenes We d say This is where we want whoever it would be Batman Chun Li or whoever And then we went through the whole movie doing that As the scenes developed we got an understanding of how many characters we needed br Part of the film takes place in a virtual space based on the Overlook Hotel in the film The Shining This was mostly a digital recreation using high quality telecine of the original film allowing new camera angles and shots that did not appear in the original Some original footage from The Shining was also used with ILM s modifications Only a few scenes in this sequence involved real actors such as the appearance of the Grady twins and required reproduction of The Shining s physical sets The Shining sequence was post processed with film grain and other aging effects to make the new footage closely resemble the original During the production of Ready Player One The VFX team built the sequence the Overlook Hotel in the digital realm Stanley Kubrick s blueprints were used to recreate the hotel in the film ILM also had to produce digital versions of the film s many cultural references including the DeLorean time machine from the Back to the Future films the Iron Giant Chucky and King Kong modeled after the film version The Tyrannosaurus rex from Jurassic Park was created from the base model ILM had created Digital Domain facilitated pre visualization with The Third Floor motion capture and virtual sets and also created visual effects shots for the primarily live action portions of the film The virtual sets were powered by game engines and were used congruently with the motion capture process with previsualization supervisor Scott Meadows explaining that in real time Spielberg would put on a headset and scout the sets and make adjustments br br On June John Williams was initially going to compose the film s score However in July Williams left the project in favor of scoring Spielberg s The Post and Alan Silvestri took over scoring duties for the film The official score was released by WaterTower Music as a two CD set on March with vinyl and cassette releases projected At Spielberg s request Silvestri references his own music from Back to the Future within the film s score as well as quoting music written by other composers including Max Steiner s theme from King Kong Akira Ifukube s main theme from Godzilla and the score by Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind from The Shining br br Ready Player One pays homage to popular culture from various time periods mainly the s and s but also extending to the s s and s reviewers have identified over a hundred references to films television shows music toys video games anime and comics from these eras Cline did not have any issues with these copyrighted elements when he published the book but was aware that securing all necessary rights would be a major obstacle for a film adaptation This task was eventually made easier thanks to Spielberg s reputation in the film industry In the end Spielberg estimated that they managed to get about of the copyrighted elements they desired The production was not able to secure the rights to Spielberg s own Close Encounters of the Third Kind from Columbia Pictures br The Dungeons Dragons module Tomb of Horrors features in an important episode of the book the Copper Key challenge but that reference was excluded from the film where the challenge features a huge car race in New York instead However the movie does reference the module artwork of the Tomb of Horrors demon appears on the back of Aech s van br Similarly Blade Runner which was integral to the plot of the book was shelved as Blade Runner was in production at the same time as Ready Player One and the producers at Alcon Entertainment feared that Spielberg s film could damage the commercial prospects of their film as a replacement the creative team had the players play through the events of The Shining to which Spielberg was able to secure the rights as an homage to his friend Stanley Kubrick Penn and Cline also thought that the film could be the opportunity to replace such a lengthy sequence with a more action heavy one Once they decided to use The Shining they were doubtful at first that Spielberg would accept the change but Spielberg did go for it While Cline s original work heavily used the character of Ultraman the rights over the character were still under legal dispute requiring them to replace Ultraman with the titular robot from The Iron Giant and RX Gundam Spielberg recognized that his past films were a significant part of the s popular culture cited in the book and to avoid being accused of vanity he opted to remove many of the references to his own work Cline stated that he believed Spielberg wanted to avoid self references to films he directed due to the criticism he received for his film which lampooned his own previous works Jaws and Duel Cline said he had to convince Spielberg to include some iconic elements such as the DeLorean time machine from Back to the Future which Spielberg conceded as the film was one he produced rather than directed Spielberg also allowed the Tyrannosaurus rex from his own Jurassic Park to be included Cline also asked ILM to include a reference to Last Action Hero one of Penn s first screenplays without Penn s knowledge a movie marquee in the Manhattan race segment bears the name Jack Slater the character Arnold Schwarzenegger played in that film br br Ready Player One was originally scheduled to be released on December However on February the film was delayed to March to avoid competition with Star Wars The Last Jedi In

RogerEbert com Brian Tallerico wrote that the film s overwhelming nature and non stop action will likely thrill fans of pop culture while he observed narrative weaknesses such as a lack of depth among the supporting characters he felt that they ultimately do not hinder the film from working on the level of technical blockbuster mastery that Spielberg helped define Writing for Variety Owen Gleiberman called the film a coruscating explosion of pop culture eye candy and found the sequence based on The Shining to be irresistible However he criticized Spielberg s separation of fantasy and reality and he said the film has more activity than it does layers IndieWire s Eric Kohn characterized the film as an astonishing sci fi spectacle and a relentless nostalgia trip at once and praised both the sequence based on The Shining and Penn s screenplay particularly with respect to Mendelsohn s character Nevertheless he remarked that the film drags a bunch in its final third Alissa Wilkinson writing for Vox praised both the quality and quantity of the worldbuilding She also commented on just how dystopian the future portrayed is where the main characters fight to save the OASIS and the escape from reality it represents with arguably less concern for the problems of the real world Film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz praised Ready Player One and noted the undercurrent of sadness present in the film stating that I don t think Spielberg gets enough credit for making sad films that most people interpret as happy and complex films that are immediately dismissed as simple or confused Seitz concluded that the film is a mess but it is a fascinating and complex one In March a year after the film s release Seitz determined that with Ready Player One s images commenting on capitalism and popular culture the film was the second most interesting and substantive big budgeted fantasy in after Black Panther admitting that I still think about Ready Player One a lot especially concerning the world around me br Monica Castillo was more critical of the film in her review for The Guardian and drew attention to the absence of character arcs the lack of resolution

good chance that if this one does well Warner Bros will want to make a sequel I don t know if Steven Spielberg would want to dive back in because he would know what he is getting into He s said that it s the third hardest film he s made out of dozens and dozens of movies Cline wrote a book sequel titled Ready Player Two which was released on November stating in the acknowledgments that he had consulted Spielberg on the final draft of the book and where to take a potential film adaptation br On December Cline announced that a sequel was in the early stages of development Spielberg confirmed
