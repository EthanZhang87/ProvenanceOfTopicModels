Diego the studio behind the original game had a rough outline of the game by mid and by late rough scripts of the game had been completed When Rockstar Games realized a group of distinct studios would not necessarily work it co opted all of its studios into one large team presented simply as Rockstar Games to facilitate development between people a total of around people worked on the game Analyst estimations place the game s combined development and marketing budget between US million and US million which would make it one of the most expensive video games to develop br While the main theme of the original game was to protect family at all costs Red Dead Redemption tells the story of the breakdown of a family in the form of the Van der Linde gang The team was interested in exploring the story of why the gang fell apart as frequently mentioned in the first game Rockstar s Vice President of Creativity Dan Houser was inspired by film and literature when writing the game though he avoided contemporary works to avoid being accused of stealing ideas The team was not specifically inspired by film or art but rather real locations The team was focused on creating an accurate reflection of the time with people and locations The citizens in the game feature a contrast between rich and poor while the locales contrast between the civilization and the wilderness br Red Dead Redemption s recording sessions began in Rockstar wanted a diverse cast of characters within the Van der Linde gang The writers put particular focus on the individual stories behind each character exploring their life before the gang and their reasons for remaining with the group Several characters were cut from the game during development as their personalities failed to add to the narrative The actors sometimes improvised some additional lines but mostly remained faithful to the script The team decided the player would control one character in Red Dead Redemption as opposed to the three protagonists in Rockstar s previous title Grand Theft Auto V to follow the character more personally and understand how the events impact him They felt a single character is more appropriate for the narrative structure of a Western br Red Dead Redemption is the first game from Rockstar built specifically for the PlayStation and Xbox One Rockstar had tested these consoles technical capabilities when porting Grand Theft Auto V initially released on the PlayStation and Xbox to them Once the team had defined what limitations were sustainable they found the areas requiring the most focus One of Rockstar s goals with Red Dead Redemption s gameplay was to make the player feel as though they are living in a world instead of playing missions and watching cutscenes A method used to achieve this was through the gang s moving camp where the player can interact with other characters The team ensured the characters maintained the same personality and mood from cutscene to gameplay to make the world feel more alive and realistic br Woody Jackson who worked with Rockstar on the original game and Grand Theft Auto V returned to compose Red Dead Redemption s original score Red Dead Redemption has three different types of score narrative which is heard during the missions in the game s story interactive when the player is roaming the open world or in multiplayer and environmental which includes campfire singing songs or a character playing music in the world The game s music regularly reacts according to the player s decisions in the world Jackson purchased several instruments from the Wrecking Crew featured on classic cowboy films In total over musicians worked on the music for the game Daniel Lanois produced the original vocal tracks for the game collaborating with artists such as D Angelo Willie Nelson Rhiannon Giddens and Josh Homme Director of music and audio Ivan Pavlovich engaged saxophone player Colin Stetson experimental band Senyawa and musician Arca to work on the score br Rockstar Games first teased Red Dead Redemption on October before the official announcement on October Originally due for release in the second half of the game was delayed twice first to Q Q and later to October According to Rockstar the game required extra development time for polish To spur pre order sales Rockstar collaborated with several retail outlets to provide special edition versions of the game A companion app released alongside the game for Android and iOS devices acts as a second screen wherein the player can view in game items such as catalogs journals and a real time mini map The game was released for Windows on November and was a launch title for Stadia when the service launched on November The Windows version has visual and technical improvements br br Red Dead

while advancing the form to the current state of film and television with similar works like The Godfather and The Sopranos br Regarding its narrative Meikleham of GamesRadar called Red Dead Redemption perhaps the boldest triple A game ever made praising the unpredictability of the narrative and comparing its epilogue to The Last of Us The Guardian s MacDonald praised the story s twists

suffered in its clich d Native American portrayal and side missions Some reviewers commented on the game s slow opening hours and its lengthy epilogue br EGM s Plessas found the journey of redemption for Arthur far more redeeming than John s in Red Dead Redemption noting his sins heightened his sympathy for the character Conversely Eurogamer s Martin Robinson considered Arthur less compelling than Marston resulting in a confusing narrative GameSpot s Plagge felt the new characters contributed to the story s quality and Mike Williams of USgamer wrote they feel like actual people due to their varied personalities IGN s Reilly praised the cultural variety and avoidance of caricatures and Giant Bomb s Navarro noted the characters possess humanity often lacking in other Rockstar games particularly in the thoughtful portrayal of Arthur s internal conflicts MacDonald of The Guardian found the performances led to more believable characters Polygon s Chris Plante found the political commentary shone when focusing on the Braithwaite and Gray families but considered the portrayal of Native American characters insensitive and confusing Eirik Gumeny writing for Polygon praised the realistic and unfiltered depiction of tuberculosis including the misguided and hostile reactions from others br br Several critics considered Red Dead Redemption s open world among the greatest in video games EGM s Plessas said it pushes industry boundaries in both size and detail and The Guardian s MacDonald praised the imitation of real American landscapes IGN s Reilly considered the world

it one of the best looking on PlayStation and Xbox One IGN s Reilly praised the lighting engine facial animation and level of granular detail Game Informer s Bertz lauded the attention to detail and found the world felt more alive due to an unrivaled dynamic weather system ambient sound effects and the most ambitious ecology of flora and fauna ever seen in games br Several reviewers lauded the level of detail in all aspects of gameplay EGM s Plessas felt the attention to detail led to deeper immersion though some found the sheer amount of realism restricted opportunities and unnecessarily prolonged some animations IGN s Reilly felt Arthur s movement did not feel cumbersome despite being heavier than Grand Theft Auto V s protagonists and found the intimate battles more exciting Polygon s Plante considered the conversation options limited but still an improvement over the violence of other action games Eurogamer s Robinson voiced frustration at the lack of freedom in some story missions Some reviewers criticized the controls and found its button layout and user interface inconsistent and confusing br br Red Dead Redemption s Windows release received universal acclaim according to Metacritic it is one of the highest rated PC games PCGamesN s Sam White thought the graphics improvements made the open world look the best it ever has Destructoid s Carter praised the addition of the Photo Mode Sam Machkovech of Ars Technica felt the cutscenes animations did not scale well to higher frame rates but considered the gameplay far superior to console Rock Paper Shotgun s Matthew Castle lauded the adapted controls particularly when painting targets in Dead Eye though felt they took longer to familiarize oneself with PC Gamer s James Davenport found the first person perspective superior on the Windows version due to the responsiveness of the mouse but noted the game crashed several times Jeuxvideo com s Jean Kl ber Lauret echoed similar criticisms observing the graphical and technical enhancements required advanced hardware Polygon s Samit Sarkar criticized the port s technical issues and declared it unplayable at the time One week after release PCMag s Tony

Company gave a conservative estimate of million sales In July industry analyst Mat Piscatella predicted Red Dead Redemption would be the best selling game of outselling other blockbuster titles such as Battlefield V Call of Duty Black Ops and Fallout some industry commentators noted frequent franchises like Assassin s Creed and Call of Duty were launching their entries Odyssey and Black Ops respectively earlier than usual predicting an avoidance of competition with Red Dead Redemption Shortly before release in October Schacter estimated the game would sell million copies in its first

partake individually or with a posse group As players complete activities throughout the game world they receive experience points to raise their characters in rank and receive bonuses thereby progressing in the game Though Red Dead Online and Red Dead Redemption share assets and gameplay Rockstar viewed them as separate products with independent trajectories reflected in its decision to launch the multiplayer title separately Player progression in the public beta carried over when the beta ended on May A standalone client for Red Dead Online was released on December for PlayStation Windows and Xbox One Post release content was added to the game through free title updates In July Rockstar announced Red Dead Online would not receive more major updates instead focusing on smaller missions and the expansion of existing modes as development resources were withdrawn to focus on Grand Theft Auto VI br br In February online technology publication Trusted Reviews published an article leaking several features due to be included in Red Dead Redemption including a first person perspective and a battle royale mode in Red Dead Online The information was obtained from a leaked document in August but the site had hesitated to publish the article as the claims were unsubstantiated until promotional material validated its legitimacy the document was sent to other sites at the time In November Trusted Reviews replaced the article with an apology noting the information was confidential and should not have been published In a settlement with Take Two Interactive Trusted Reviews agreed to donate million US million to charities chosen by Take Two Rockstar directed the funds be donated to the American Indian College Fund the American Prairie Reserve and the First Nations Development Institute Neither Trusted Reviews nor Take Two indicated any specific laws had been violated Several journalists recognized the uniqueness of successful legal action against media outlets Seth Barton of MCV Develop called the outcome an incredible development for games industry journalism and felt it would result in hesitancy to leak information regarding Rockstar in future Kotaku s Keza MacDonald similarly described the events as extraordinary as it likely meant Take Two argued the information was a trade secret and Trusted Reviews was unable to use a public interest defense she added it might prove to be influential and prevent publications from leaking information in the future even if obtained legally br Prior to the game s release Dan Houser stated the team had been working hour weeks several times in Many sources interpreted this statement as crunch time for the entire development staff of the game comparable to similar accusations made by wives of Rockstar San Diego employees in regards to the development of the game s predecessor The following day Rockstar clarified in a statement the work duration mentioned by Houser only affected the senior writing staff for Red Dead Redemption and the duration had only been the case for three weeks during the entire development Houser added the company would never expect or force any employee to work as long as was stated and those staying late at the development studios were powered by their passion for the project However other Rockstar employees argued Houser s statements did not give an accurate picture of the crunch time culture at the company many of its employees worked under which included mandatory overtime and years long periods of crunch Due to the salary based nature of employment contracts many employees were not compensated for their overtime work and instead depended on year end bonus payments that hinged on the sales performance of the game Nonetheless a sentiment echoed across many employee statements was the observation that working conditions had somewhat improved since development on the original Red Dead Redemption By April several employees reported the company had made significant changes as a result of the publicity surrounding the work culture and many were cautiously optimistic about Rockstar s future br In November YouTuber Shirrako posted several videos of his player character murdering a female suffragette NPC including feeding her to an alligator and dropping her down a mineshaft Critics noted the majority of comments on the videos were sexist and misogynistic Shirrako claimed the actions were apolitical and he did not support the sexist comments but did not wish to censor them Matt Leonard of GameRevolution called Shirrako s response plain bullshit noting he continued to post similar videos encouraging the same behavior In response YouTube suspended the channel for violation of their community guidelines citing its graphic nature for shock purposes and for promoting violence Shirrako protested the decision claiming it was hypocritical as in game violence against men did not receive the same response YouTube restored the channel and designated an age restriction to the suffragette videos commenting the reviewer will be educated on this outcome and on how to avoid repeating this mistake Some critics questioned if Rockstar was partly to blame for the behavior as the game does not limit attacks on the suffragette as it does other characters such as children scholars Kristine J rgensen and Torill Elvira Mortensen writing in Games and Culture acknowledged this concern but recognized the responsibility ultimately lay with the player and limiting attacks could be interpreted as both a political statement from Rockstar and a restriction on the player s freedom of expression Writing for Public History Weekly Moritz Hoffman noted the incident reflects a newer issue of open world games granting freedom without penalties promotes disinhibition In The Journal of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era scholars Hilary Jane Locke and Thomas Mackay wrote it points to a sharp contrast between the game s portrayal of Progressive Era politics and how some players have responded to its depictions thereof br Securitas AB the parent company of the modern day Pinkerton agency issued a cease and desist notice to Take Two Interactive on December asserting Red Dead Redemption s use of the Pinkerton name and badge imagery was against their trademark and demanded royalties for each copy of the game sold or they would take legal action Take Two filed a complaint against Securitas on January maintaining the Pinkerton name was strongly associated with the Wild West and its use of the term did not infringe on the Pinkerton trademark Take Two sought a summary judgment to declare the use of Pinkerton in the game as allowed fair use Game Informer s Javy Gwaltney agreed with Take Two s claims questioning why Securitas had not targeted other works depicting the Pinkerton agency in the past he felt the company likely just wants a cut of the game s profits In response to Take Two s complaint Pinkerton president Jack Zahran described the game s portrayal of Pinkertons as baseless and inaccurate noting Pinkerton employees would have to explain to their young game players why Red Dead Redemption encourages people to murder Pinkertons but hoped the companies could come to an amicable solution By April Securitas withdrew its claims and Take Two moved to withdraw its complaint br br Critics agreed Red Dead Redemption was among the best games of the eighth generation of video game consoles GQ s White described it as a generation defining release and VG s McKeand named it a benchmark for other open world games to aspire to IGN ranked the game as the third best Xbox One game and eleventh best PC and PlayStation game In November TechRadar listed it among the greatest games

three more animals on average than other gamers In late University of Tennessee professor Tore Olsson started teaching Red Dead America a class about United States history in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries including the frontier myth Jim Crow laws settler colonialism and women s suffrage inspired by the lack of academic discourse surrounding the game s history Olsson found the
