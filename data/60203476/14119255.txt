lantern br Meanwhile scientist Hector Hammond is summoned by his father Senator Robert Hammond to a secret government facility to perform an autopsy on Abin Sur s body under the watchful eye of Amanda Waller A piece of Parallax inside the corpse enters Hammond giving him psychic powers at the cost of his health and sanity After discovering that he was chosen for the secret work only due to his father s influence and not for his own abilities Hammond attempts to kill his father by telekinetically sabotaging his helicopter at a massive party with the use of Parallax s power Hal saves the

Hal telepathically connects with Hector and learns of Parallax coming to Earth before Hammond escapes br On Oa the Guardians tell Sinestro that Parallax was one of their fellow guardians who attempted to control the yellow essence of fear only to become corrupted himself Arguing that the way to fight fear is with fear itself Sinestro requests that the Guardians forge a ring of the same yellow power

the Ferris Aircraft Company whose will to act qualifies him to become the first earthman ever inducted into an intergalactic peacekeeping force fueled by green energy of will Reynolds said I ve known about Green Lantern my whole life but I ve never really followed it before I fell in love with the character when I met with Martin Campbell Reynolds called the film an origin story to a certain degree but it s not a labored origin story where the movie begins in the third act The movie starts when it starts We find out Hal is the guy fairly early on and the adventure begins Alternatively Chris Pine Sam Worthington Jon Hamm Nathan Fillion who voiced the character in animated DC Comics projects Bradley Cooper Justin Timberlake and Jared Leto were considered for the role while Brian Austin Green a Green Lantern fan campaigned for the part but ultimately did not audition br Gattlin Griffith portrays a young Jordan br Blake Lively as Carol Ferris The vice president of Ferris Aircraft and a long time love interest of Hal Jordan One pseudonymous writer citing unnamed sources said Lively was among five leading contenders that included Eva Green Keri Russell Diane Kruger and Jennifer Garner About her stunt work in which she rehearsed with stunt coordinator Gary Powell Casino Royale The Bourne Ultimatum Quantum of Solace gymnastic acrobats from Cirque du Soleil and used aerial stunt rigs created for The Matrix Lively explained Our director likes it real the fights close and dirty I m feet in the air spiraling around That s the best workout you can ever do because it s all core You do that for ten minutes and you should see your body the next day It s so exhilarating so thrilling and nauseating br Jenna Craig portrays a young Ferris br Peter Sarsgaard as Hector Hammond A scientist who is exposed to the yellow energy of fear from Parallax which causes his brain to grow to an enormous size and grants him psionic powers Regarding his preparation for the role Sarsgaard stated I actually did hang with this biologist from Tulane that was I think just the most eccentric guy they could find He was entertaining and he and I actually worked on my lecture that I give in Green Lantern About his character Sarsgaard remarked that he s got shades of gray It s eccentricity on top of eccentricity br Kennon Kepper portrays a young Hammond br Mark Strong as Thaal Sinestro A Green Lantern and Hal Jordan s mentor Strong affirmed that the film follows the origin story and that the film closely follows the early comics Sinestro starts out as Hal Jordan s mentor slightly suspicious and not sure of him because obviously Hal is the first human being who s made into a Green Lantern He s certainly very strict and unsure of the wisdom of Hal becoming a Green Lantern Strong said that the character is a military guy but isn t immediately bad It s the kind of person that lends himself to becoming bad over the course of the comics being written but initially he s quite a heroic figure He also revealed that the outfit and other aspects of the character very closely follow the character s early days That widow s peak and thin mustache was for some reason originally based on David Niven So I would like to do justice to the Sinestro that was conceived for the comic books br Angela Bassett as Amanda Waller A former congressional aide and government agent About the differences between the comic book and film character Bassett said Well I m not pounds but added that her character does have that intellectual that bright that no nonsense that means business personality She is getting it done and in the trenches nothing fazes her br Tim Robbins as Robert Hammond A United States senator and the father of the film s human villain Hector Hammond br Temuera Morrison as Abin Sur A Green Lantern who crash lands on Earth and recruits Hal Jordan as his replacement Morrison said it took four to five hours to put on the prosthetic makeup for the character About filming with Ryan Reynolds Morrison commented We did the whole scene together where I give him the ring our suits are CGI so we had these grey suits with things on them so it was cool and working with Martin Campbell again was great too br Geoffrey Rush as Tomar Re A bird beaked member of the Green Lantern Corps who teaches Hal Jordan how to use his cosmic powers Rush said that he was not initially familiar with Green Lantern but was drawn to the part after seeing the concept art When I got the offer for it I said Haven t they made that film They said No it s a completely computer generated character I saw the artwork and I said I would love to be that guy Because I had voiced an owl in Legend of the Guardians The Owls of Ga Hoole and I d voiced a pelican in Finding Nemo and I thought I could really improve on that now by being half bird half fish part lizard You don t get to do that in a live action film Rush compared the role to previous roles where he played a mentoring figure You could say that I ve mentored Queen Elizabeth I as Sir Francis Walsingham and Leon Trotsky has mentored Frida Kahlo and now Tomar Re is going to mentor Hal Jordan and I was sort of mentoring King George VI in The King s Speech But I can t imagine Tomar Re setting up an office on Harley Street in London They re all very different people to me but there is a kind of theme I suppose br Michael Clarke Duncan as Kilowog A drill sergeant trainer of new recruits for the Green Lantern Corps About the character Duncan a fan of the comic book said that he is a real type of tough guy who knows everything and actually in one of the comic books he and Superman fought to a tie br Taika Waititi as Thomas Kalmaku An Inuit engineer at Ferris Aircraft Waititi said he was cast after a Warner Bros casting agent saw his performance in Boy which he also wrote and directed Waititi who has a Jewish mother and M ori father said the production had an opening for a role in the film for someone who wasn t I don t know not white or not black br Clancy Brown as Parallax An entity made up of the yellow energy of fear Parallax was imprisoned by Abin Sur after breaking into the physical plane by possessing the body of a former Guardian of the Universe br Additionally Jon Tenney plays Martin Jordan Hal Jordan s father Jay O Sanders portrays Carl Ferris an aircraft designer and father

Smigel had completed a script which was set to star Jack Black in the lead role but the studio dropped the comedy idea following poor fan reaction from the Internet David S Goyer was offered the chance to write and direct either a Green Lantern or Flash film after Warner Bros was impressed with his screenplay for Batman Begins but he opted to direct the latter br Actor writer Corey Reynolds a comic book fan of the John Stewart character pitched to Warner an idea for a trilogy with him starring as John Stewart and performing screenwriting duties Reynolds intended to introduce Hal Jordan the Green Lantern Corps and Justice League in possible sequels He finished the script for Green Lantern Birth of a Hero in June receiving positive feedback from Warner Bros with a potential release date However the studio abandoned Reynolds concept and in October the same year Greg Berlanti signed to direct the film and cowrite it with comic book writers Michael Green and Marc Guggenheim A draft of the trio s script leaked on the Internet revealed a story that included the hero s origin and included the characters Carol Ferris Kilowog Sinestro and Guy Gardner in a cameo appearance and appeared to set up Hector Hammond as Hal Jordan s first major nemesis br Shortly afterward Guggenheim said that the script would contain characterizations inspired by the Denny O Neil Neal Adams run on the comic in the s and Dave Gibbons work in the early s He added that he and his co writers also looked to the s Geoff Johns stories It s been interesting because we finished a draft just before Johns Secret Origin story arc started up So I ve been reading Secret Origin with a real interest in seeing OK how did Geoff solve this problem There are certain elements just for anyone trying to retell Hal s origin for a modern day audience to address and grapple with For example why the hell was Abin Sur flying in a spaceship when he s a Green Lantern You don t ask that question back in the Silver Age but when you re writing in the Modern Age you have to answer these things br br br Pre production br By December the writers had written three drafts of the screenplay and Warner was preparing for pre production By February Berlanti was no longer attached to the project and Martin Campbell entered negotiations to direct The release date was set as December before being moved to June Speaking about
