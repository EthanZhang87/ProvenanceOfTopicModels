Weymouth was settled in as Wessagusset Colony founded by Thomas Weston who had been the main financial backer of Plymouth Colony It is thought to have been named after English explorer George Weymouth The settlement was a failure as the men from London were ill prepared for the hardships required for survival They also may have lacked the motivation of the Pilgrims as this colony was purely economic in motivation and the men had not brought their families br br By winter poor planning and bad management led to supplies running out and the Plymouth colonists had little to share The situation grew desperate and Weymouth men began to sell their clothes hire themselves out as laborers and even steal from the local Massachusett Indians The Indians were soon taunting the Weymouth men and robbing them of what little food they gathered clamming and foraging in the woods By now many in the colony were starving or ill and law and order had broken down The lowest point came when a settler was accused of stealing supplies from the Massachusetts and the Massachusett leaders demanded the thief s execution the Weymouth men complied but legend has it that they may have executed a dying sick settler instead br By April word came of conflict between American Indians and the Virginia colonists and tension increased between the Wessagusset colonists and the Indians Massachusetts and other tribes began plotting to attack and destroy what was left of the floundering colony and the more successful Plymouth Colony Wampanoag Chief Massasoit heard about the plot but soon fell ill and nearly died A party from the Plymouth Colony came to his village and nursed him back to health and he warned them of the plot Governor William Bradford decided to preempt the planned attack and sent Myles Standish to Weymouth with the Plymouth militia and their Indian guide Hobbamock to end the threat Using the promise of a meal of pork Standish lured five of the more bellicose Massachusett Indians inside the stockade including Wituwamat a large man who had belittled Standish because he was short and had bragged about murdering a number of French shipwreck survivors Once inside there was a brief struggle and the Indian leaders were killed br Ten of the original colonists starved to death and two others were killed in conflicts with the Indians Forty five colonists joined Plymouth or went north to Maine and from there most returned to England Three men who had left the colony to live among the Indians as laborers could not be warned in time and were subsequently killed by them after Standish had released the women and children br Robert Gorges attempted to form a colony at the site later that year as the center of a more royalist and Anglican system of government for New England He brought William Morrell as religious leader and expected Governor Bradford to acknowledge his supremacy and act as his agent Within weeks the New England winter caused Gorges to leave with most of the settlers Those who remained formed the nucleus of the permanent settlement and the oldest in what would become Massachusetts Bay Colony In it was officially incorporated into the Massachusetts Bay Colony the name was changed to Weymouth in with the addition of families under the leadership of Joseph Hull These groups experienced some difficulty integrating together especially due to conflicting pressures from the Puritans of Boston and the Pilgrims of Plymouth but Weymouth was a stable and prominent town with its current boundaries by It was included as part of Suffolk
