film that represents Peter Sellers most smashing work since the mid s Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it a gentle exquisitely funny film adding that Sellers hasn t been so terrific or had such terrific material in years br Vincent Misiano reviewed Being There in Ares Magazine and commented that the film s humor never flags and yet its delicately bitter irony is never far away It satirizes politics and politicians business and businessmen and finally all the rest of us and what we imagine we see when we look at one another br In Roger Ebert mentioned the reaction of his students to the final scene which is unique to the film not appearing in the book stating that they once suggested that Chance may be walking on a submerged pier But Ebert writes The movie presents us with an image and while you may discuss the meaning of the image it is not permitted to devise explanations for it Since Ashby does not show a pier there is no pier a movie is exactly what it shows us and nothing more br The credits at the film s end roll over an outtake known as the Rafael outtake Sellers was displeased that the outtake ran because he believed that it took away from Chauncey s
