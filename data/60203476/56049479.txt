The acquisition of st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company was announced on December and was completed on March Among other key assets the acquisition included the th Century Fox film and television studios U S cable channels such as FX Fox Networks Group a stake in National Geographic Partners Indian television broadcaster Star India and a stake in Hulu The assets like the Fox Broadcasting Company Fox Television Stations Fox News Channel Fox Business Fox Sports and Fox Deportes and the Big Ten Network were not part of the deal and they were spun off into a new company called Fox Corporation on March a day before the acquisition was completed Other st Century Fox assets such as the Fox Sports Networks and Sky were divested and sold off to Sinclair and Comcast respectively br br br Negotiations br br br Early developments November April br On November CNBC reported The Walt Disney Company was negotiating a deal with Rupert Murdoch to acquire st Century Fox s filmed entertainment cable entertainment and direct broadcast satellite divisions including th Century Fox FX Networks and National Geographic Partners The deal would reportedly exclude the Fox Broadcasting Company th Century Fox s studio lot Fox Television Stations Fox News Group and Fox Sports which would be spun off into a new independent company run by the Murdoch family br According to Disney CEO Bob Iger the idea of purchasing st Century Fox s assets came after Disney acquired majority control of the streaming company BAMTech with anticipation to develop its own streaming service which would eventually launch in November as Disney It was less interested in st Century Fox s production capacities and more keen to acquire st Century Fox s own film and television libraries to help expand the streaming service s library Additionally as th Century Fox was the last major studio from the studio era to be acquired when Rupert Murdoch took full control in its film library was largely intact relative to its peers from that era such as Metro Goldwyn Mayer MGM br The two companies had done business in when Disney acquired Fox Family Worldwide from the original incarnation of News Corporation which included the Fox Family Channel afterwards rebranded to ABC Family and later Freeform Saban Entertainment and the international Fox Kids cable networks controlled by Fox Family Worldwide among other assets br The deal would also include th Century Fox s film rights to certain third party franchises such as X Men Deadpool and Fantastic Four the distribution rights to Star Wars Episode IV A New Hope which were not owned by Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm respectively when Disney acquired those companies as well as consolidate ownership of other franchises both share such as Home Alone and give Disney access to adult animation with ownership of The Simpsons which Disney would fully embrace under the Disney moniker and Family Guy which in the following years after the acquisition would break the fourth wall by making inside jokes on what they were allowed to do now that they were owned by Disney br Talks had stalled for the day without a deal being finalized but it was reported on November that the prospected deal had yet to be fully abandoned On November it was reported that Comcast parent company of NBCUniversal Xfinity and Comcast Spectacor Verizon Communications and Sony parent company of Sony Pictures Sony Music and Sony Interactive Entertainment had also joined Disney in a bidding war for st Century Fox During a recent shareholders meeting st Century Fox Co chairman Lachlan Murdoch said st Century Fox was not in the category of sub scale companies that were finding it difficult to leverage their positions in new and emerging video platforms but was instead a company that had the required scale to continue to both execute on our aggressive growth strategy and deliver significant increased returns to shareholders br Because Disney owns the American Broadcasting Company ABC Comcast owns the National Broadcasting Company NBC and st Century Fox owned the Fox Broadcasting Company a full acquisition of st Century Fox by Disney or Comcast would have been illegal under the Federal Communications Commission FCC s rules prohibiting a merger between any of two of the four major broadcast networks br On November while mentioning a rumor that the rumored negotiations between Disney and st Century Fox were progressing at a rapid pace Mike Fleming Jr of Deadline Hollywood commented given how Disney made the Marvel and Lucasfilm deals under the cone of silence if this happens we ll probably only know it when it s announced It is certainly being talked about today br Rumors of a nearing deal continued on December with additional reports suggesting the FSN regional sports networks would be included in the sale assets that would likely be aligned with Disney s ESPN division br On December Comcast announced it was dropping its bid on the Fox assets On December Disney and Fox confirmed a billion deal to merge the two companies pending approval from the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division br In February CNBC reported that despite the Disney Fox deal Comcast might take action to outbid Disney s billion offer if the AT T Time Warner merger went through Despite this Fox President Peter Rice stated he was content with Disney s offer and that the Fox assets were a great fit for Disney br Early in March the non profit group Protect Democracy Project Inc filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Justice DOJ on the hopes to seek any records of communications between the two groups over Disney s pending acquisition of Fox The lawsuit also sought any related antitrust enforcement efforts by the DOJ to find out whether the president or his administration is improperly interfering with the independence of the DOJ out of favoritism for a political ally Donald Trump congratulated Murdoch for the Disney Fox deal while attacking AT T s acquisition of Time Warner particularly over the ownership of CNN which he frequently criticized due to alleged bias br On April Rice revealed the acquisition was expected to close by summer Beginning in March a strategic reorganization of the Disney conglomerate saw the creation of two business segments Disney Parks Experiences and Products and Walt Disney Direct to Consumer International Parks Consumer Products was primarily a merger of Parks Resorts and Consumer Products Interactive Media while Direct to Consumer International took over for Disney International and global sales distribution and streaming units from Disney ABC Television Group Studio Entertainment and Disney Digital Network Given that Iger described it as strategically positioning our businesses for the future The New York Times considered the reorganization done in expectation of the st Century Fox purchase br br br Bidding war between Disney and Comcast May July br On May it was reported that Comcast spoke to investment banks about topping Disney s offer to acquire Fox Shortly afterwards Iger stated he was willing to drop Sky plc from the deal to ensure the Fox acquisition br Several Fox investors said they would be open to terminate the company s agreement with Disney if Comcast followed through on its plan to launch a rival all cash bid for billion Murdoch s family trust controlled of Fox due to shares it held with special voting rights However under the company s by law those special rights did not apply to a vote on the Disney Fox deal when the Murdoch trust only controlled of the vote making it easier for other shareholders to defeat him which was expected as early as next month Later that month it was confirmed that Lachlan Murdoch rather than James Murdoch would take charge of the new company tentatively known as New Fox br The following week Comcast publicly announced it was looking into making an all cash counter offer for the Fox assets that Disney proposed to acquire Shortly after it was reported that Disney was looking into making its own all cash counter offer for Fox assets if Comcast went through with their offer br The next day Disney and Fox announced they had set their shareholder vote meetings for July although both said Fox s meeting could be postponed if Comcast came through with their offer br On June AT T was given approval by District Judge Richard J Leon to acquire Time Warner easing concerns Comcast had regarding whether government regulators would block their bid for Fox Consequently the next day Comcast mounted a bid of billion for the st Century Fox assets that were set to be acquired by Disney br On June it was reported that Disney would upgrade its already existing billion claim to contest Comcast s proposed counter offer for the Fox assets br On June Disney and Fox announced they had amended their previous merger agreement upping Disney s offer to billion a premium over Comcast s billion offer while also offering shareholders the option of receiving cash instead of stock On June Murdoch said in response to Disney s higher offer We are extremely proud of the businesses we have built at st Century Fox and firmly believe that this combination with Disney will unlock even more value for shareholders as the new Disney continues to set the pace at a dynamic time for our industry That still would not have prevented other companies from making a bid as the deal still needed to be voted on by shareholders br Iger explained the reasoning behind the bid Direct to consumer distribution has actually become an even more compelling proposition in the six months since we announced the deal There has just been not only a tremendous amount of development in that space but clearly the consumer is voting loudly br On June the United States Department of Justice gave antitrust approval to Disney under the condition the company sold Fox s regional sports channels within days of closing to which the company agreed The next day Disney and Fox boards scheduled July as the day shareholders voted on the sale of Fox s properties to Disney br On July a Fox shareholder filed a lawsuit to stop the acquisition from Disney citing the absence of financial projections for Hulu On the same day CNBC reported Comcast was looking for companies that could take over Fox s Regional Sports Networks The shareholder claimed that would ve made Comcast s antitrust problems regarding the takeover of Fox assets easier as Comcast was preparing to make a new all cash counter offer before July br On July the Department of Justice filed a notice of appeal with the D C Circuit to reverse the District Court s approval for AT T s acquisition of Time Warner which became WarnerMedia shortly afterward Analysts said the chances of a victory by the DOJ were small but would be the final nail in the coffin for Comcast s Fox chase This is a clear gift to Disney On the next day AT T CEO Randall L Stephenson gave an interview with CNBC about Comcast s bid for Fox It probably can t help it You re in a situation where two entities are bidding for an asset and this kind of action can obviously influence the outcome of those actions br On July Disney received the support of the Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis the two most prominent proxy adviser firms in the world Fox shareholders were recommended by the advisers as means to provide for Disney s future br On July CNBC reported Comcast was unlikely to continue its bidding war with Disney to acquire Fox Instead Comcast would likely continue pursuing the stake of Sky br On July Comcast officially announced it was dropping its bid on the Fox assets in order to focus on its bid for Sky CEO Brian L Roberts said I d like to congratulate Bob Iger and the team at Disney and commend the Murdoch family and Fox for creating such a desirable and respected company br br br Road to

for New Fox was revealed to be Fox Corporation br On November regulators in China approved the Disney Fox deal without any conditions After obtaining approval from Chinese regulators Disney said it still needed to obtain regulatory approval from several other regulators though the approvals from the United States European Union and China were considered the most important hurdles to clear br On December Brazil s Administrative Council for Economic Defense CADE said the deal would concentrate the market of cable sports channels and CADE recommended remedial measures br By December the merger was subjected to regulation in Mexico where Disney Fox would account for of content distribution across all genres Disney would own of all sports channels in Mexico On January Mexico s Federal

on February to discuss the deal However a decision on it still could not be reached However on February Bloomberg said CADE would make its ruling on the deal on February On February Bloomberg reported Disney would divest Fox Sports in Brazil and Mexico to get approval in these countries which were among the last major hurdles for the Disney Fox deal On February CADE approved the merger with conditions requiring the aforementioned divestiture of the Brazilian Fox Sports among other measures The regulator said it coordinated with regulators in Mexico and Chile in evaluating the transaction Brazil s approval cleared one of the final hurdles allowing the deal to be completed in March br In March Disney tweaked Iger s compensation package he would receive upon closing the Disney Fox deal

IFT approved the deal on March under the condition that Disney agreed to sell the country s Fox Sports within six months It also had to keep the National Geographic brand separate from its A E

Multimedia Lauman Fox Sports Mexico would be acquired by Fox Corporation and would become part of its eponymous division Fox Sports Media Group br br br Criticism br br Despite Disney passing antitrust approval from regulators in every country there are significant antitrust concerns about Disney s purchase The deal is a horizontal merger i e in which a company buys up a corporation that produces the same goods and products as opposed to a vertical merger i e two companies that operate at separate stages of the production process for a specific finished product much akin to the integrations of AT T Time Warner and Comcast NBC Universal Horizontal mergers are more likely to be disapproved than vertical mergers as they affect a more tangible reduction in competition br The Federal Trade Commission FTC states on its website that The greatest antitrust concern arises with proposed mergers between direct competitors horizontal mergers br As both Disney and Fox create films and television series the number of major film studios in Hollywood lowered from six to five Some argued the operation would still leave many competitors around since Disney may compete with Netflix in the online streaming market with Disney and Hulu in equal conditions with its newly acquired properties Opponents countered that these arguments do not hold much weight due to Disney s powerful box office and stock market shares its practices and its purchase of Fox s many assets br br br News media br A film reporter said They ll have more control over more things so if they decide they don t like what you wrote and want to ban you from their screenings eventually that will mean all of entertainment For journalists and reporters trying to do their job it is frightening to see the scope of one company expand in that way and know that your fate is kind of tied up with them We ve seen a pattern in Disney s behavior The more power they have the more they wield it one entertainment reporter said A freelance critic and member of the New York Film Critics Circle said that they were troubled by the idea of the Disney Fox deal br On November Disney banned the Los Angeles Times from attending press screenings of its films in retaliation for the paper s coverage of their political influence in Anaheim California in September of that year On November however Disney reversed its decision after receiving massive protests and condemnation from a number of major publications and writers including The New York Times The Boston Globe critic Ty Burr The Washington Post blogger Alyssa Rosenberg A Wrinkle in Time director Ava DuVernay the websites The A V Club and Flavorwire and film critic organizations which threatened to disqualify Disney films from their year end awards in retaliation specifically the National Society of Film Critics Los Angeles Film Critics Association New York Film Critics Circle and Boston Society of Film Critics br Jason Bailey the editor of Flavorwire thought the way Disney treated the Los Angeles Times was absolutely chilling fearing it would only grow more common after the merger br br The idea of a major multinational conglomerate being that petty and vindictive and really engaging in an act of retribution against an outlet and against reporters who had nothing to do with the thing that they were angry about gave some insight into the length they were willing to go against anyone who didn t toe the Disney company line It s very worrisome and is more worrisome if they re in control of this much more of the entertainment industry br One film writer stated that I personally worry that a studio this big will need the press less and less I don t think anything drastic will change immediately but I think it is more important than ever for entertainment reporters to uphold journalistic values We are not their PR arms no matter how much they d like us to be Another film reporter said As a critic I ve had Disney tell me they don t want to invite me to its film because I didn t like the last one It really scares me to watch them get even more power br br br Theaters br Disney has a reputation for imposing strict conditions for theater owners to screen its films such as Avengers Age of Ultron and Star Wars The Last Jedi For the latter Disney demanded a cut of domestic ticket sales rather than the minimum to cut along with a four week hold in each venue and a penalty to any theater owner who breaks any part of the contract including taking the film off screen If the Disney Fox deal had happened in late Disney s domestic box office in would have equaled billion or market share a figure no major studio has ever hit For some the deal would give Disney unprecedented market power in the industry br One distribution studio executive denounced the deal saying that If I was an independent mom and pop theater I would just close down there s no way to survive With a market share how do you negotiate against that John Roper the general manager of the Phoenix Theatre in Fort Nelson British Columbia said that Disney Fox had him worried about even stricter rules in the future stating It s not good for any type of industry when a company grows that large Disney holds all the cards and we have to play by their rules Smaller cinemas are just left in the dust Roper decided not to screen Star Wars The Last Jedi because of Disney s strict conditions of requiring the theater to run the film four weeks straight and play it four times a day as opposed to other studios who only require a minimum of two weeks for a film run and play it one time a day Elkader Cinema in Elkader Iowa opted out the movie for the same reason with owner Lee Akin stating that I can t get the entire town in my auditorium in one week s time let alone four br In Brazil Disney demanded a cut of Coco s domestic ticket sales rather than the historical cut and some theaters with exceptions including foreign chains such as Cinemark Theatres and Cin polis boycotted the film Coco was shown in theaters compared to theaters that showed Sony Pictures Jumanji Welcome to the Jungle which premiered in Brazil at the same time br On November the U S Department of Justice formally filed its motion for a federal court order to nullify the Paramount Decrees which was set in place after the case United States v Paramount Pictures Inc that required movie studios to divest themselves of their theatrical arms and prohibited certain anti competitive practices in the distribution business The department had cited the shifting realities of an industry that has come to rely on online revenue such as streaming services as a justification David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that such move would be very disruptive to the theater industry br br I f a company like Disney were to buy a major theater company something the impending DOJ change would permit it could have drastic consequences for Hollywood Disney already controls an alarmingly large portion of ticket revenues and just bought its competitor th Century Fox since doing that the company has quietly restricted repertory showings of old Fox movies a practice it has long enforced for Disney movies A hypothetical Disney owned theater chain that prioritized Disney films for its screens would squeeze an industry that s already struggling to offer a breadth of options to consumers thanks to the overwhelming success of family friendly brand name blockbusters br Without strict antitrust rules independently owned theaters could have trouble affording big studio movies A crucial part of the old centralized system was that theater chains rented screens to their studio owners at a massive discount were that model to return it would be hard for indie theaters to compete We live in a world where more than percent of all ticket revenues are earned by Disney it s arguable that the movie system needs more market restriction not less br The
