title: Facial motion capture
id: 3105104
Facial motion capture is the process of electronically converting the movements of a person s face into a digital database using cameras or laser scanners This database may then be used to produce computer graphics CG computer animation for movies games or real time avatars Because the motion of CG characters is derived from the movements of real people it results in a more realistic and nuanced computer character animation than if the animation were created manually br A facial motion capture database describes the coordinates or relative positions of reference points on the actor s face The capture may be in two dimensions in which case the capture process is sometimes called expression tracking or in three dimensions Two dimensional capture can be achieved using a single camera and capture software This produces less sophisticated tracking and is unable to fully capture three dimensional motions such as head rotation Three dimensional capture is accomplished using multi camera rigs or laser marker system Such systems are typically far more expensive complicated and time consuming to use Two predominate technologies exist marker and marker less tracking systems br Facial motion capture is related to body motion capture but is more challenging due to the higher resolution requirements to detect and track subtle expressions possible from small movements of the eyes and lips These movements are often less than a few millimeters requiring even greater resolution and fidelity and different filtering techniques than usually used in full body capture The additional constraints of the face also allow more opportunities for using models and rules br Facial expression capture is similar to facial motion capture It is a process of using visual or mechanical means to manipulate computer generated characters with input from human faces or to recognize emotions from a user br br br History br br One of the first papers discussing performance driven animation was published by Lance Williams in There he describes a means of acquiring the expressions of realfaces and applying them to computer generated faces br br br Technologies br br br Marker based br Traditional marker based systems apply up to markers to the actors face and track the marker movement with high resolution cameras This has been used on movies such as The Polar Express and Beowulf to allow an actor such as Tom Hanks to drive the facial expressions of several different characters Unfortunately this is relatively cumbersome and makes the actors expressions overly driven once the smoothing and filtering have taken place Next generation systems such as CaptiveMotion utilize offshoots of the traditional marker based system with higher levels of details br Active LED Marker technology is currently being used to drive facial animation in real time to provide user feedback br br br Markerless br Markerless technologies use the features of the face such as nostrils the corners of the lips and eyes and wrinkles and then track them This technology is discussed and demonstrated at CMU IBM University of Manchester where much of this started with Tim Cootes Gareth Edwards and Chris Taylor and other locations using active appearance models principal component analysis eigen tracking deformable surface models and other techniques to track the desired facial features from frame to frame This technology is much less cumbersome and allows greater expression for the actor br These vision based approaches also have the ability to track pupil movement eyelids teeth occlusion by the lips and tongue which are obvious problems in most computer animated features Typical limitations of vision based approaches are resolution and frame rate both of which are decreasing as issues as high speed high resolution CMOS cameras become available from multiple sources br The technology for markerless face tracking is related to that in a Facial recognition system br since a facial recognition system can potentially be applied sequentially to each frame br of video resulting in face tracking br For example the Neven Vision system formerly Eyematics now acquired by Google allowed real time br D face tracking with no person specific training their system was also amongst the best performing facial recognition systems in the U S Government s Facial Recognition Vendor Test FRVT br On the other hand some recognition systems do not explicitly track expressions or br even fail on non neutral expressions and so are not suitable for tracking br Conversely systems such as deformable surface models pool temporal information to disambiguate and obtain more robust results and thus could not be applied from a single photograph br Markerless face tracking has progressed to commercial systems such as Image Metrics which has been applied in movies such as The Matrix sequels br and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button br The latter used the Mova system to capture a deformable br facial model which was then animated with a combination of manual and br vision tracking Avatar was another prominent performance capture movie however it used painted markers br rather than being markerless Dynamixyz is another commercial system currently in use br Markerless systems can be classified according to several distinguishing criteria br br D versus D tracking br whether person specific training or other human assistance is required br real time performance which is only possible if no training or supervision is required br whether they need an additional source of information such as projected patterns or invisible paint such as used in the Mova system br To date no system is ideal with respect to all these criteria For example the Neven Vision br system was fully automatic and required no hidden patterns or per person training but was D br The Face Off system br is D automatic and real time but requires projected patterns br br br Facial expression capture br br br Technology br Digital video based methods are becoming increasingly preferred as mechanical systems tend to be cumbersome and difficult to use br Using digital cameras the input user s expressions are processed to provide the head pose which allows the software to then find the eyes nose and mouth The face is initially calibrated using a neutral expression Then depending on the architecture the eyebrows eyelids cheeks and mouth can be processed as differences from the neutral expression This is done by looking for the edges of the lips for instance and recognizing it as a unique object Often contrast enhancing makeup or markers are worn or some other method to make the processing faster Like voice recognition the best techniques are only good percent of the time requiring a great deal of tweaking by hand or tolerance for errors br Since computer generated characters don t actually have muscles different techniques are used to achieve the same results Some animators create bones or objects that are controlled by the capture software and move them accordingly which when the character is rigged correctly gives a good approximation Since faces are very elastic this technique is often mixed with others adjusting the weights differently for the skin elasticity and other factors depending on the desired expressions br br br Usage br Several commercial companies are developing products that have been used but are rather expensive br It is expected that this will become a major input device for computer games once the software is available in an affordable format but the hardware and software do not yet exist despite the research for the last years producing results that are almost usable br br br See also br Eye tracking br
