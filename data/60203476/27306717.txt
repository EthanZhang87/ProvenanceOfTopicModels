programs WHIH Newsfront and The Daily Bugle br The franchise has been commercially successful becoming one of the highest grossing media franchises of all time and it has received generally positive reviews from critics The studio attributed several Multiverse Saga projects performing below expectations to the increase in the amount of content being produced post Endgame and began decreasing its content output from The MCU has inspired other film and television studios to attempt similar shared universes and has also inspired several themed attractions an art exhibit television specials literary material multiple tie in video games and commercials br br br Development br br br Marvel Studios films and series br br br The Infinity Saga films br br By Marvel Entertainment was planning to produce its own films independently and distribute them through Paramount Pictures Previously Marvel had co produced several superhero films based on Marvel Comics with Columbia Pictures New Line Cinema th Century Fox and others Marvel made relatively little profit from these licensing deals and wanted to get more money out of its films while maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution Avi Arad head of Marvel Entertainment s film division was pleased with Sam Raimi s Spider Man films at Sony Pictures but was less pleased with some of the other films Arad decided to form Marvel Studios Hollywood s first major independent film studio since DreamWorks Pictures was founded in Kevin Feige Arad s second in command realized that unlike Spider Man Blade and the X Men which were respectively licensed to Sony New Line and Fox Marvel owned the rights to the Avengers team Feige a self described fanboy envisioned combining these characters in a shared universe similar to the one created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby for Marvel Comics in the s br To raise capital the studio secured funding from a seven year million revolving credit facility with Merrill Lynch Marvel s plan was to release individual films for their main characters and then merge them in a crossover film Arad who resigned in doubted this strategy would work He insisted that it was his reputation that helped secure the initial financing In Feige was named studio chief To preserve its artistic integrity Marvel Studios formed a creative committee of six people familiar with its comic book lore Feige Marvel Studios co president Louis D Esposito Marvel Comics president of publishing Dan Buckley Marvel Entertainment s chief creative officer Joe Quesada comic book writer Brian Michael Bendis and Marvel Entertainment president Alan Fine who oversaw the committee Feige initially referred to the shared narrative continuity of the films as the Marvel Cinema Universe but later used the term Marvel Cinematic Universe Since the franchise expanded to other media some have used this phrase to just refer to the feature films br The MCU films are released in groups called Phases beginning with Phase One and Phase Two In December the Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel Entertainment for billion Disney said future Marvel Studios films would be distributed by its own studio once the existing deal with Paramount expired The films of Phase Three were announced at a special press event in October By September Marvel Studios was integrated into Walt Disney Studios Feige was reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F Horn instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter and the creative committee began having only nominal input on the films They continued to consult on Marvel Television productions which remained under Perlmutter s control All key film decisions going forward were to be made by Feige D Esposito and executive vice president Victoria Alonso The studio went on to establish the Marvel Studios Parliament a brain trust of long time executives at the company who help to elevate each other s projects where possible In November Feige said Avengers Endgame would provide a definitive conclusion to the films so far and begin a new period for the franchise He later said Phase Three would conclude The Infinity Saga br br br The Multiverse Saga films and series br Disney was reported to be developing a Marvel television series for their new streaming service Disney by November In July Feige said discussions had begun with Disney regarding any potential involvement Marvel Studios could have with the streaming service since Feige felt the service was important for the wider company In September Marvel Studios was reported to be developing several limited series centered on second tier characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to star in their own films Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes and would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television with Feige taking a hands on role in each series development Feige said these series would tell stories that we wouldn t be able to tell in a theatrical experience a longer form narrative He added that being asked by Disney to create these series energized everyone creatively within Marvel Studios since they could play in a new medium and throw the rules out the window in terms of structure and format Television specials from the studio are marketed as Marvel Studios Special Presentations The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special a Special Presentation was the first project Marvel Studios began planning for Disney br In December Disney agreed to acquire assets from st Century Fox The transaction officially closed on March This saw the return of the film rights for Deadpool the X Men and the Fantastic Four to Marvel Studios though Feige explained that despite the acquisition finalizing in access and integration of these characters and concepts were unavailable for a very long time because of corporate acquisition laws Some of the first elements to be integrated into the MCU following the acquisition were the organization S W O R D in the Disney series WandaVision and the fictional country Madripoor in the series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier Additionally Patrick Stewart appeared as Professor Charles Xavier in the film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness portraying a different version of the character that he previously played in Fox s X Men film series while Kamala Khan was revealed to have a genetic mutation in Ms Marvel with star Iman Vellani confirming that she is the first mutant a term related to the X Men in the MCU Namor is also revealed to be a mutant in the film Black Panther Wakanda Forever as he is in the comics Feige called Deadpool Wolverine the true start to Marvel Studios exploration and use of the Fox characters and called every project after it part of the MCU s Mutant era br br In July Feige announced the Phase Four slate at San Diego Comic Con consisting of films and for the first time television event series on Disney The Phase Four slate includes What If the first animated series from Marvel Studios and by July the studio was creating an animation branch and mini studio known as Marvel Studios Animation to focus on more animated content beyond What If Alonso said Marvel had around projects in various stages of development by September In April Feige said he and Marvel Studios were on a creative retreat to plan and discuss the MCU films for the following years That July Feige announced some of the films and series for Phase Five and Phase Six at San Diego Comic Con revealing that the second three Phases were collectively known as The Multiverse Saga After the creative experience of ending Phase Three and The Infinity Saga with Avengers Infinity War and Avengers Endgame and the expansion in the number of projects being produced by the studio in a short amount of time Marvel Studios decided to move away from having an Avengers crossover movie at the end of each Phase and instead decided to have a crossover culmination at the end of The Multiverse Saga with Avengers The Kang Dynasty and Avengers Secret Wars The studio was excited to explore Kang the Conqueror as an overarching villain of the Multiverse Saga after Thanos in the Infinity Saga because Kang was a different villain in part because he has multiple variants from different timelines within the multiverse The studio did not initially plan to build the next saga around Kang and made that decision after seeing actor Jonathan Majors s performance in the first season of the Disney series Loki as well as dailies from the filming of Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania After Majors was found guilty amidst legal issues in December he was fired by Disney and Marvel Studios and Marvel began referring to The Kang Dynasty internally as Avengers br Alonso was fired from her role at Marvel Studios in March for serving as a producer on the Amazon Studios film Argentina in breach of a agreement between Alonso and Disney to not work for a competing studio The decision was made by a group that included Disney Entertainment co chairman Alan Bergman and Disney s human resources and legal departments Alonso reportedly did not seek permission to work on the film and was asked by Disney to stop working on it or promoting it The situation was deemed serious enough that Disney requested a new agreement be signed and the company consistently reminded her of this while she continued to promote the film following its September premiere ultimately leading to her firing Alonso s lawyers refuted these claims saying Disney was aware of and agreed to Alonso s work on Argentina and Alonso had been silenced and was terminated when she refused to do something she believed was reprehensible this was reported to be a disagreement with a Disney executive over the censoring of gay pride elements in Quantumania so the film could be released in Kuwait in compliance with the country s restrictive anti LGBTQ laws A Disney spokesperson reiterated that Alonso was fired due to an indisputable breach of contract and a direct violation of company policy among other factors Disney and Alonso reached a multi million dollar compensation settlement in April br Disney CEO Bob Iger said in July that the company would be reducing the amount of Marvel content created moving forward admitting that Marvel Studios expansion into Disney series and more films had diluted focus and attention after a number of underachieving films at the box office He clarified their plans in May saying Disney would now release two or at most three Marvel films and two Marvel series a year This was down from up to four films and around four series being released in some recent years The company was reducing output and focusing on quality across all its divisions but Iger felt the change was especially needed for Marvel Feige and D Esposito said had been a particularly difficult year and a rough time for the studio but they had learned their lesson on trying to make too much content at once They added that no longer being on top of the box office allowed them to be underdogs again as they had been when starting work on Phase One and they would be coming back strong with the hope of surprising audiences and exceeding expectations br In Marvel Studios introduced their Marvel Animation and Marvel Television banners for their animated and live action series respectively This was done along with the previously established Marvel Spotlight banner to help indicate to audiences that they did not have to watch all of the studio s projects to understand the overall story and could choose which storylines and characters under these banners to follow br br br Marvel Television series br br Marvel Television was launched in June with Jeph Loeb as head and had entered into discussions with ABC to create a show set in the MCU by July the network went on to release Agents of S H I E L D Agent Carter and Inhumans The latter was a co production with IMAX Corporation In November Disney was set to provide Netflix with the live action series Daredevil Jessica Jones Luke Cage and Iron Fist building up to the crossover miniseries The Defenders In April Netflix ordered The Punisher a spin off of Daredevil By February Netflix had canceled all of its Marvel series In April the Disney owned cable network Freeform announced Cloak Dagger In May Marvel announced that Runaways had received a series order from Hulu In May Marvel announced that Helstrom had been greenlit for Hulu br In October further corporate restructuring saw Feige named Chief Creative Officer of Marvel Entertainment with Marvel Television becoming part of Marvel Studios and executives of Marvel Television reporting to Feige In December Marvel Television was folded into Marvel Studios with Marvel Studios taking over production of the remaining series and no further series expected to be developed by Marvel Television In January Feige said never say never to potentially reviving the Netflix series but noted that Marvel Studios was focused on their new Disney series In May Marvel Studios was revealed to be developing a new Daredevil series for Disney which was announced in July as Daredevil Born Again br br br Expansion to other media br In the first comic book to tie into the MCU was released Quesada explained that these comics would be set within the continuity of the films but were not intended to be direct adaptions Rather they would explore something that happened off screen or flesh out something briefly mentioned Feige was involved with the creation of the comics with the film s screenwriters sometimes as well Marvel Comics worked with Brad Winderbaum Jeremy Latcham and Will Corona Pilgrim at Marvel Studios to decide which concepts should be carried over from the Marvel Comics Universe to the Marvel Cinematic Universe what to show in the tie in comics and what to leave for the films Marvel later clarified which of the tie in comics are considered canonical MCU stories with the rest being merely inspired by the MCU where we get to show off all the characters from the film in costume and in comic form br In August Marvel announced a series of direct to video short films called Marvel One Shots The name was derived from the label used by Marvel Comics for their one shot comics Winderbaum said the shorts were a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas and to expand the MCU Each short was designed to be a self contained story that provided more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films br In March Marvel s Vice President of Animation Development and Production Cort Lane said animated tie ins to the MCU were in the works That July Marvel Studios partnered with Google to produce the faux news program WHIH Newsfront with Christine Everhart a series of in universe YouTube videos serving as the center of a viral marketing campaign to promote the films and universe In December a six part web series Agents of S H I E L D Slingshot debuted on ABC com It follows Elena Yo Yo Rodriguez on a secret mission shortly before the start of Agents of S H I E L D s fourth season with Natalia Cordova Buckley reprising her role from the series In September Sony created a real version of the fictional The Daily Bugle website as part of a viral marketing campaign to promote the home media release of Spider Man Far From Home Inspired by real world conspiracy pushing websites such as that of Alex Jones the website features J K Simmons reprising his role as J Jonah Jameson in a video where he speaks out against Spider Man before asking viewers to like and subscribe In December Marvel Studios announced I Am Groot a series of photorealistic animated shorts starring Baby Groot for Disney br br br Business practices br br In November Feige explained that the studio would often put together a lookbook of influences from the comics and art by Marvel s visual development department to create a visual template for a project These are put together at company retreats which the studio holds every months or so to plan out future projects and develop the phases of the MCU These lookbooks are not always shown to directors though with Marvel sometimes preferring to let the director offer their own ideas first When choosing a director for a project Marvel Studios looks for filmmakers to hire who are able to guide a film Some of their choices for directors have been considered out of left field based on those director s previous work On this Feige remarked that you don t have to have directed a big giant visual effects movie to do a big giant visual effects movie for us You just have to have done something singularly sort of awesome br The studio ensures directors are open to the idea of the shared universe and are willing to include connective material such as Kenneth Branagh and Joe Johnston needing to include scenes that set up The Avengers in their respective Phase One films Thor and Captain America The First Avenger both Marvel Studios usually has a big idea they would like to explore or build to in a project such as Hydra infiltrating S H I E L D in Captain America The Winter Soldier but they leave it up to the filmmakers to interpret and improv a little bit to get that point After these ideas have been developed the creative team then begins to explore ideas happening in other future projects to see how to make any larger universe connections br In August Marvel signed The Avengers and Avengers Age of Ultron director Joss Whedon to an exclusive contract through June for film and television With the deal Whedon contributed creatively to all of the Phase Two films and also developed the first television series set in the MCU In April Guardians of the Galaxy and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol writer and director James Gunn revealed that he would be working with Marvel to help plan future stories for the Guardians of the Galaxy characters and the wider Marvel Cosmic Universe though Gunn became co head of DC Studios in November and signed a four year deal to work exclusively on DC Comics based projects For Phase Three there was large amount of collaboration between the filmmakers of the individual character films and the filmmakers of the crossover films Avengers Infinity War and Avengers Endgame which were directed by the Russo brothers and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely This was to ensure their storytelling aligned for the Infinity Saga s culmination br Marvel Studios began contracting their actors for multiple films including signing actor Samuel L Jackson to a then unprecedented nine film contract Feige said the studio had all actors sign contracts for multiple films with the norm being for three or more and the nine or twelve film deals being more rare The actors contracts also feature clauses that allows Marvel to use up to three minutes of an actor s performance from one film in another which Marvel describes as bridging material By the start of Phase Four Marvel Studios was no longer contracting actors for a large number of projects with deal lengths varying for each actor and project Feige said the studio was looking for actors who were excited to join the franchise and appear in multiple projects without being locked into contractual obligations He also noted that they were starting to include theme park attractions in actors deals By December because of the impact COVID had on theaters and film studios shifting away from theatrical releases Marvel Studios began exploring updated contracts for actors writers directors and producers to receive adjusted compensation in the event a film had to debut on Disney instead of in theaters TheWrap reported that it was believed the new contracts would only apply to films about to enter production and was unclear if any adjustments would be made to contracts for films already completed but not yet released br For Marvel Television Loeb said he and his executives were involved in all aspects of production whether it s being in the writers room editing on set casting every step of the production goes through the Marvel team to tell the best story that we can He said the studio was able to work on so many series across different networks and platforms because all they needed was one person working on each series to help guide the process Actors appearing in Marvel Television series such as Charlie Cox Matt Murdock Daredevil in Daredevil and Adrianne Palicki Bobbi Morse Mockingbird in Agents of S H I E L D were contractually obliged to appear in a Marvel film if asked When developing the crossover miniseries The Defenders showrunner Marco Ramirez consulted with the creators of all the individual Marvel Netflix series having them read each of the scripts for The Defenders and provide insight into individual characters worlds In December Feige confirmed that Cox would reprise the role of Daredevil in Marvel Studios MCU productions with Cox first reprising the role in the film Spider Man No Way Home Additionally Vincent D Onofrio first reprised his role as Wilson Fisk Kingpin from Daredevil in the Disney series Hawkeye br br br Feature films br br Marvel Studios releases its films in groups called Phases br br br The Infinity Saga br br The first three phases are collectively

featured characters traveling into the past and introduced a five year time jump with many subsequent releases in Phase Four and Phase Five set after Endgame s events in the timeline The television series Loki and What If were the first properties to occur outside of the main timeline and explore alternative timelines and universes br There have been numerous attempts by Marvel Studios and others to codify the events of the MCU which have been subject to perceived continuity errors resulting in Marvel Studios releasing an official timeline book in for their first four phases that were designated as part of their Sacred Timeline This book did not feature projects produced by other companies such as Marvel Television s series which all had been loosely connected to the films though it was noted all of these outside projects were part of the larger Marvel canon In early Marvel Studios formally integrated Marvel Television s group of Netflix series into their Disney timeline br As of the Phase Five television series Secret Invasion and the film The Marvels the present day in the MCU is The following covers and discusses MCU media released by Marvel Studios and the Netflix series by Marvel Television Loki and What If are excluded from the diagram because they occur outside of the main timeline Werewolf by Night is also excluded given the special explicitly does not indicate where it takes place in the MCU Disney s timeline order places the first seasons of Loki and What If between Avengers Endgame and WandaVision their second seasons after The Marvels and Werewolf by Night after Thor Love and Thunder Werewolf by Night is also placed here in The Marvel Cinematic Universe An Official Timeline br br br Multiverse br br The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z Vol published in originally designated the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Earth within the continuity of Marvel s comic multiverse a collection of fictional alternate universes although this designation was rarely used officially outside of the source material The television series Loki and What If were the first to explore the concept of the multiverse within the MCU as well as the film Spider Man No Way Home which connected the MCU to other Spider Man film franchises by featuring characters from Sam Raimi s Spider Man trilogy Marc Webb s The Amazing Spider Man films and Sony s Spider Man Universe SSU The SSU film Venom Let There Be Carnage briefly featured the main universe of the MCU as well In Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness the main universe of MCU events was designated as Earth a designation first referenced in Spider Man Far From Home sharing the name of the main Marvel Comics universe while another universe was designated as Earth Sony s animated Spider Man Across the Spider Verse references the events of No Way Home citing the MCU s primary reality as Earth Phases Four Five and Six will comprise The Multiverse Saga With the release of The Marvel Cinematic Universe An Official Timeline in October Feige wrote in its foreword that Marvel Studios only considered at that time projects developed by them in their first four phases as part of their Sacred Timeline but acknowledged the history of other Marvel films and television series that would exist in the larger multiverse given they were canonical to Marvel In January Winderbaum acknowledged that Marvel Studios had previously been a little bit cagey about what was part of their Sacred Timeline noting how there had been the corporate divide between what Marvel Studios created and what Marvel Television created He continued that as time has passed Marvel Studios has begun to see how well integrated the Marvel Television stories are and personally felt confident in saying Daredevil was part of the Sacred Timeline br br br Recurring cast and characters br br Additionally Paul Bettany was the first actor to portray two main characters within the universe voicing Tony Stark s artificial intelligence J A R V I S in the Iron Man and Avengers films and portraying Vision in Avengers films Captain America Civil War and the miniseries WandaVision J K Simmons became the first actor to reprise a non MCU role in the MCU when he appeared as J Jonah Jameson a role he played in Sam Raimi s Spider Man trilogy from to in Spider Man Far From Home br Prior to his death in Stan Lee creator or co creator of many of the characters seen in the MCU made cameo appearances in all of the feature films and television series except Inhumans In Iron Fist it is revealed his on set photograph cameo in the Marvel Netflix series is as NYPD Captain Irving Forbush His cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol sees Lee appearing as an informant to the Watchers discussing previous adventures that include Lee s cameos in other MCU films he specifically mentions his time as a FedEx delivery man referring to Lee s cameo in Captain America Civil War This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos with writer and director James Gunn noting that people thought Stan Lee is Uatu the Watcher and that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher So Stan Lee as a guy who is working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU Feige added that Lee clearly exists you know above and apart from the reality of all the films So the notion that he could be sitting there on a cosmic pit stop during the jump gate sequence in Guardians really says so wait a minute he s this same character who s popped up in all these films Following Lee s death Marvel Studios chose not to create any new Lee cameos in future projects NY news anchor Pat Kiernan has also appeared in multiple MCU films and television series as himself br br br Reception br br Early on the shared universe element of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was criticized by some journalists Around the release of The Avengers in Jim Vorel of Herald Review called the Marvel Cinematic Universe complicated and impressive but said As more and more heroes get their own film adaptations the overall universe becomes increasingly confusing Kofi Outlaw of Screen Rant stated that while The Avengers was a success Marvel Studios still has room to improve their approach to building a shared movie universe Some reviewers criticized the fact that the desire to create a shared universe led to films that did not hold as well on their own In his review of Thor The Dark World Forbes critic Scott Mendelson likened the MCU to a glorified television series with The Dark World being a stand alone episode that contains little long range mythology Collider s Matt Goldberg considered that while Iron Man Thor and Captain America The First Avenger were quality productions they have never really been their own movies feeling that the plot detours to S H I E L D or lead ups to The Avengers dragged down the films narratives br The metaphor of the MCU as the world s biggest TV show was discussed again after the release of Captain America Civil War by Emily VanDerWerff of Vox who felt that film in particular highlighted Marvel s success with the model saying Viewed in complete isolation the plot of Captain America Civil War makes little to no sense but when you think about where Captain America has been in earlier Marvel films his leeriness about being subject to oversight makes a lot more sense VanDerWerff continued that when thinking about the MCU as a television series many common criticisms people tend to level at it take on a new context such as complaints that the films are formulaic lack visual spark or shoehorn in story elements that are necessary to set up future films all characteristics that are fairly typical on television where a director s influence is much lower than that of the showrunner in this case Feige Comparing the films to the series Game of Thrones specifically VanDerWerff noted that each solo film checks in on various characters and their individual side stories before bringing everyone together in the finale or rather an Avengers film with Guardians of the Galaxy being equivalent to the character Daenerys Targaryen both separated by long distances from everybody else She noted that this format was an extension of early TV like film franchises such as Star Wars as well as the format of the comics upon which the films are based I say all of this not to suggest that film franchises resembling TV series is necessarily a good trend VanDerWerff concluded For as much as I generally enjoy the Marvel movies I m disheartened by the possibility that their particular form might take over the film industry But I also don t think it s the end of the world if Marvel continues on there s a reason TV has stolen so much of the cultural conversation over the past few decades There s something legitimately exciting about the way the medium tells stories when it s good and if nothing else Marvel s success shows the film world could learn from that br Following the conclusion of season one of Agents of S H I E L D Mary McNamara at the Los Angeles Times praised the connections between that series and the films stating that never before has television been literally married to film charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise Agents of S H I E L D is now not only a very good show in its own right it s part of Marvel s multiplatform city state It faces a future of perpetual re invention and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television s roller coaster ride toward possible world domination Terri Schwartz of Zap it agreed with this sentiment stating that the fact that Captain America The Winter Soldier so influenced the show is game changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven though the fault there seems to be that Agents of S H I E L D had to bide time until The Winter Soldier s release which led to much criticism br In January Michael Doran of Newsarama and Graeme McMillian of The Hollywood Reporter had a point counterpoint debate in response to the first Ant Man trailer Doran stated Marvel has raised the bar sooo high that as opposed to just allowing another film to finish under the MCU bar we re all overly and perhaps even eager to overreact to the first thing that doesn t clear it McMillian responded at this point Marvel s brand is such that I m not sure it can offer up something like the trailer without it seeming like a crushing disappointment part of Marvel s brand is that it doesn t offer the kind of run of the mill superhero movie that you re talking about that it s at least different enough to tweak and play with the genre somehow The fact that there s such upset about this trailer being well okay suggests to me that the audience is expecting something to knock their socks off Doran concluded That does seem to be the point here the expectations fans now have for everything Marvel Studios and Marvel is going to eventually falter br After seeing the portrayal of Yellowjacket in Ant Man the antagonist of the film McMillian noted br br It s hardly a secret that Marvel Studios has a bit of a problem when it comes to offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against their villains generally fall into one of two camps There s the Unstoppable Monster or there s the Professional White Guy in a Suit with an Ego No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into they share one common purpose evil The motivations for evil likely differ although invariably they fall under the umbrella of misguided belief in a greater good that doesn t exist but that really doesn t matter because without fail there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations meaning that to all intents and purposes the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else The strange thing about this is that Marvel s comic books offer a number of wonderful colorful bad guys who could step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to and arguably bored with In future movies we can only hope they are treated in such a way that their freak flags are allowed to fly free br Following the release of Jessica Jones David Priest at CNET wrote about how the series rescues Marvel from itself Jessica Jones takes big steps forward in terms of theme craft and diversity It s a good story first and a superhero show second And for the first time the MCU seems like it matters Our culture needs stories like this Here s hoping Marvel keeps them coming For Paul Tassi and Erik Kain of Forbes watching the series made them question the MCU with Kain feeling that the morally complex violent dark world of Jessica Jones has no place in the MCU right now the MCU is holding back shows like Jessica Jones and Daredevil while those shows are contributing absolutely nothing to the MCU Tassi went so far as to wonder what the point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is lamenting the lack of major crossovers in the franchise since the Winter Soldier reveal on Agents of S H I E L D and saying that Jessica Jones is so far removed from the world of The Avengers it might as well not be in the same universe at all I really don t understand the point of the MCU if they re going to keep everything within it separated off in these little boxes Conversely Eric Francisco of Inverse called Jessica Jones s lack of overt connections to the MCU the show s chief advantage Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU s scope really is Jessica Jones also proves the MCU s thematic durability br In April Marvel Studios revealed that Alfre Woodard would appear in Captain America Civil War having already been cast as Mariah Dillard in Luke Cage the previous year This raised hopes that Marvel could be uniting its film and Netflix universes with one of the first and strongest connections between the two Civil War writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely revealed that Woodard would instead be portraying Miriam Sharpe in the film explaining that she had been cast on the suggestion of Robert Downey Jr and they had not learned of her casting in Luke Cage until afterwards This was not the first instance of actors being cast in multiple roles in the MCU but this casting was called more significant and seen by many as a disappointing indication of the growing divide and lack of more satisfying cooperation between Marvel Studios and Marvel Television following the September corporate reshuffling of Marvel Entertainment br br Speaking to the s setting of Captain Marvel the MCU s first full period piece since Phase One s Captain America The First Avenger in Richard Newby of The Hollywood Reporter felt the return of younger versions of some characters introduced and killed in earlier films open ed up the MCU in a whole new way and broaden ed the franchise s mantra of it s all connected Speaking specifically to Clark Gregg s appearance as Agent Phil Coulson in the film Newby noted the appearance doesn t exactly mend fences between Marvel s film and TV divisions but it does strengthen the connective tissue and the sense that these characters still matter in the grand scheme of Marvel s film plans He also hoped that continuity from Agents of S H I E L D would be maintained in Captain Marvel especially since Coulson has dealt with the Kree in the series Newby also added that shifting to different time periods would help Marvel Studios sustain this cinematic universe for the next years by allowing them to repeat some of the genres previously used as they could then feel fresh and have different rules and different restraints as well as allow them to build upon material established in the television series such as Agent Carter He concluded Marvel Studios has an entire sandbox to play in but for necessary reasons has largely chosen to remain in a small corner in order to ground audiences in these concepts Now that the basis has been laid the opportunity for exploration in both film and television lies ahead with Captain Marvel leading the way Wherever Marvel Studios plans to take the MCU in the future it s refreshing to know that its past is expansive and filled with infinite possibilities br Likewise in his review of Avengers Endgame Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal acknowledged the unique achievement that the Marvel Cinematic Universe had accomplished br br These are difficult times for big screen entertainment As the medium declines and TV grows ascendant authentic spectacles as opposed to lavish embellishments of smallish ideas threaten to become a thing of the fabled past All the more reason then to cherish what Marvel has achieved even though befuddling stumbles have occurred along the way The studio has kept the faith by smartening up most of its films not dumbing them down by banking on and raking in profits from the audience s appetite for surprise its capacity for complexity When the final battle comes at the end of Avengers Endgame it s inevitably unwieldy every Marvel character you can think of from the past decade shows up for one more assault on cosmic evil but thrilling all the same and followed by a delicate coda So many stories So many adventures So much to sort out before the next cycle starts br Many famous filmmakers expressed different views both on the success and quality of MCU In October filmmaker Martin Scorsese openly criticized Marvel films in an interview and during a David Lean lecture in London later expanded in an op ed in The New York Times asserting that these films are not cinema but are instead the equivalent of theme park rides that lack mystery revelation or genuine emotional danger He also stated that such films are corporation products that have been market researched audience tested vetted modified revetted and remodified until they re ready for consumption and that the invasion of such theme park films in theaters crowded out films by other directors Scorsese s remarks were dismissed by directors of MCU films such as Joss Whedon and James Gunn while they were defended by Francis Ford Coppola who described the potential effect of Marvel films in the film industry as despicable In September director Denis Villeneuve noted that Marvel films are nothing more than a cut and paste of others that have turned us into zombies a bit In February director Roland Emmerich felt large blockbuster films such as the MCU and Star Wars films were ruining our industry a little since nobody does anything original anymore Conversely George Miller stated To me it s all cinema I don t think you can ghettoize it and say oh this is cinema or that is cinema It applies to all the arts to literature the performing arts painting and music in all its form It s such a broad spectrum a wide range and to say that anyone is more significant or more important than the other is missing the point It s one big mosaic and each bit of work fits into it br Marvel s American audience was studied by Morning Consult in which found that of Marvel s fan base is Generation Z of fans are White adults and of fans live in suburban areas In critics began describing the volume of interconnected storylines as a homework assignment br br br Cultural impact br br br Other studios br After the release of The Avengers in May Tom Russo of Boston com noted that aside from the occasional novelty such as Alien vs Predator the idea of a shared universe was virtually unheard of in Hollywood Since that time the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios has begun to be replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters In April Tuna Amobi a media analyst for Standard Poor s Equity Research Services stated that in the previous three to five years Hollywood studios began planning megafranchises for years to come opposed to working one blockbuster at a time Amobi added A lot of these superhero characters were just being left there to gather dust Disney has proved that this approach and genre can be a gold mine With more studios now playing the megafranchise game Doug Creutz media analyst for Cowen and Company feels the allure will eventually die for audiences If Marvel s going to make two or three films a year and Warner Brothers is going to do at least a film every year and Sony s going to do a film every year and Fox is going to do a film every year can everyone do well in that scenario I m not sure they can br In March Patrick Shanley of The Hollywood Reporter opined that the key differences between a regular franchise such as The Fast and the Furious or Pitch Perfect films and a shared universe is the amount of planning and interweaving that goes into each individual film Its all too easy to make a film that exists solely for the purpose of setting up future installments and expanding a world rather than a film that stands on its own merits while deftly hinting or winking at its place in the larger mythos In that the MCU has flourished He felt that Iron Man itself was aimed at being an enjoyable stand alone experience not as an overall advertisement for subsequent movies That mentality has persisted through most of the MCU films over the past decade which is all the more impressive as its roster of heroes now exceeds the two dozen mark br br br DC Entertainment and Warner Bros Pictures br br In October following its legal victory over Joe Shuster s estate for the rights to Superman Warner Bros Pictures announced that it planned to move ahead with its long awaited Justice League film uniting such DC Comics superheroes as Batman Superman and Wonder Woman The company was expected to take the opposite approach to Marvel releasing individual films for the characters after they have appeared in a team up film The release of Man of Steel in was intended to be the start of a new shared universe for DC laying the groundwork for the future slate of films based on DC Comics In Warner Bros announced that slate of films similarly to Disney and Marvel claiming dates for films years in advance That year DC chief creative officer Geoff Johns stated that the television series Arrow and The Flash were set in a separate universe from the new film one later clarifying that We look at it as the multiverse We have our TV universe and our film universe but they all co exist For us creatively it s about allowing everyone to make the best possible product to tell the best story to do the best world Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through It s just a different approach from Marvel s br Discussing the apparent failure of the cinematic universe s first team up film Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice to establish a successful equivalent to the MCU Emily VanDerWerff noted that where the MCU has a television like showrunner in Feige the visionary behind Marvel s entire slate the DCEU has director Zack Snyder whose DC films seemingly start from the assumption that people have come not to see an individual story but a long series of teases for other ones It s like he knows what he needs to do but can t focus on the task at hand TV certainly isn t immune to that problem but shows that get caught up in high concept premises and big picture thinking before doing the necessary legwork to establish characters and their relationships tend to be canceled Subsequently in May Warner Bros gave oversight of the DCEU to Johns and executive Jon Berg in an attempt to unify the disparate elements of the DC movies and emulate Marvel s success The two were made producers on the Justice League films on top of Johns involvement in several solo films such as the post production process of Suicide Squad or the writing process of a standalone Batman film After the successful release of Wonder Woman in June DC decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films with DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson stating Our intention certainly moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn t make sense but there s no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe Moving forward you ll see the DC movie universe being a universe but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who s creating them Additionally DC began focusing on films completely separate from everything else set entirely outside the DCEU as part of a new label with the first film centered on the Joker In August Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav announced a year plan for the DC Extended Universe similar to the one that Horn and Iger employed with Feige for the MCU with James Gunn and Peter Safran appointed in October to serve as the co chairmen and co CEOs of the newly formed DC Studios to develop a new DC shared universe the first content for which was announced in January br br br th Century Fox br br In November th Century Fox announced plans to create their own shared universe consisting of Marvel properties that it held the rights to including the Fantastic Four and X Men with the hiring of Mark Millar as supervising producer Millar said Fox are thinking We re sitting on some really awesome things here There is another side of the Marvel Universe Let s try and get some cohesiveness going So they brought me in to oversee that really To meet with the writers and directors to suggest new ways we could take this stuff and new properties that could spin out of it X Men Days of Future Past released in was Fox s first step towards expanding their stable of Marvel properties and creating this universe ahead of the release of a Fantastic Four reboot film the next year In May Days of Future Past and Fantastic Four screenwriter Simon Kinberg stated that the latter film would not take place in the same universe as the X Men films explaining that none of the X Men movies have acknowledged the notion of a sort of superhero team the Fantastic Four And the Fantastic Four acquire powers so for them to live in a world where mutants are prevalent is kind of complicated because you re like Oh you re just a mutant Like What s so fantastic about you they live in discrete universes In July X Men director Bryan Singer said that there was still potential for a crossover between the X Men and Fantastic Four franchises if reactions to Fantastic Four and X Men Apocalypse warranted it br Feeling that Singer s efforts in Apocalypse to establish a larger world similar to the MCU did not meet the standards established by Marvel VanDerWerff noted that unlike Feige s ability to serve as pseudo showrunner Singer is instead steeped in film and the way movie stories have always been told so when it comes time to have Apocalypse dovetail with story threads from the earlier X Men First Class which was directed by Matthew Vaughn both Singer s direction and Simon Kinberg s script rely on hackneyed devices and clumsy storytelling indicating a lack of the kind of big picture thinking this sort of mega franchise requires In his review of Dark Phoenix Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal characterized the entire X Men film series as being a notoriously erratic franchise In March the film rights of Deadpool the X Men characters and the Fantastic Four characters returned to Marvel Studios following the Walt Disney Company s acquisition of st Century Fox br br br Sony Pictures br br In November Sony Pictures Entertainment co chairman Amy Pascal announced that the studio intended to expand their universe created within Marc Webb s The Amazing Spider Man series with spin off adventures for supporting characters in an attempt to replicate Marvel and Disney s model The next month Sony announced Venom and Sinister Six films both set in the Amazing Spider Man universe With this announcement IGN stated that the spin offs are the latest example of what we can refer to as the Avengers effect in Hollywood as studios work to build interlocking movie universes Sony chose not to replicate the Marvel Studios model of introducing individual characters first before bringing them together in a team up film instead making the Spider Man adversaries the stars of future films In February Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that the Spider Man franchise would be retooled with a new film co produced by Feige and Pascal being released in July and the character being integrated into the MCU Sony Pictures would continue to finance distribute own and have final creative control of the Spider Man films With this announcement sequels to The Amazing Spider Man were canceled and by November the Venom and Sinister Six films as well as spin offs based on female characters in the Spider Man universe were no longer moving forward By March the Venom film had itself been retooled to start its own franchise unrelated to the MCU Spider Man A year later Sony officially announced the Venom film to be in development for an October release along with a film centered on the characters Silver Sable and Black Cat known as Silver Black Both projects were not intended to be a part of the MCU nor spin offs to Spider Man Homecoming but rather part of an intended separate shared universe known as the Sony s Spider Man Universe SSU The mid credits scene of Venom Let There Be Carnage hinted at Eddie Brock Venom joining the MCU which was confirmed with the release of Spider Man No Way Home through an uncredited cameo appearance in its mid credits scene Spider Man No Way Home also featured the Spider Man iterations from Sam Raimi and Webb s Spider Man films respectively reprised by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield br After Sony canceled their shared universe plans and started sharing the Spider Man character with Marvel Studios multiple critics discussed their failure at replicating the MCU Scott Meslow of The Week noted the perceived flaws of the first Amazing Spider Man film outside of its lead performances and how the sequel doubles down on all the missteps of the original while adding a few of its own We now have a textbook example of how not to reboot a superhero franchise and if Sony and Marvel are wise they ll take virtually all those lessons to heart as they chart Spider Man s next course Scott Mendelson noted that The Amazing Spider Man was sold as less a sequel to The Amazing Spider Man than a backdoor pilot for Spider Man vs the Sinister Six Had Sony stuck with the original plan of a scaled down superhero franchise one that really was rooted in romantic drama they would have at least stuck out in a crowded field of superhero franchises When every superhero film is now going bigger Amazing Spider Man could have distinguished itself by going small and intimate This would have saved Sony a boatload of money and potentially reversed the film s relative financial failure br br br Academia br In September the University of Baltimore announced a course beginning in the spring semester revolving around the Marvel Cinematic Universe to be taught by Arnold T Blumberg Media Genres Media Marvels examines how Marvel s series of

unaired episodes of Agents of S H I E L D and Ant Man Brian Lowry of Variety felt the special contains a pretty interesting business and creative story While it might all make sense in hindsight there was appreciable audacity in Marvel s plan to release five loosely connected movies from the same hero filled world beginning with the cinematically unproven Iron Man and culminating with superhero team The Avengers As such this fast moving hour qualifies as more than just a cut and paste job from electronic press kits although there s an element of that certainly The special was released on

The special features behind the scenes footage from Avengers Age of Ultron and Ant Man as well as footage from the Agent Carter television series previously screened at New York Comic Con Brian Lowry of Variety felt an hour for the special did not do the topic justice adding For anyone who has seen more than one Marvel movie but would shrug perplexedly at the mention of Jack Kirby or Steve Ditko Marvel Years From Pulp To Pop should probably be required viewing Fun fast paced and encompassing many of the company s highlights along with a few lowlights it s a solid primer on Marvel s history while weaving in inevitable self promotion and synergistic plugs Eric Goldman of IGN also wished the special had been longer adding Understandably the more you already know about Marvel the less you

analyzed their impact as a sincere assessment of the importance of the stories beyond gender representation Philip Watson at CGMagazine said that while the series seemed focused on add ing depth to the backstories of the females behind Marvel a secondary focus was to honor the title and empower women quoting Kasumba You could watch it and think people that look like me we can be Super Heroes too Kai Young of Screen Rant felt that the series exclusion of an episode focused on Scarlett Johansson s MCU character Natasha Romanoff Black Widow was another insult against the character as she was pivotal to the MCU and had wanted such an episode to focus on developing Romanoff as an individual beyond her relationships with male characters and alongside her family br br br Literary material br

Hollywood and global pop culture from Marvel Studios inception through events in early conducted through numerous interviews with those closely associated with the MCU Norton approached the writers to work on a book centered on the MCU in Robinson explained that the book was originally meant to be an oral history until Disney was no longer enthused about the book s publication despite initially being open to it and told current employees and former stars not to talk to the writers The writers were able to supplement the interviews they were able to get with those from cultural critics and comics experts in addition to years of research Robinson added that because of the long work put into the book it was able to cover the studio s expansion to television on Disney as well as this current state of what I like to call a wobble in Marvel s long reign and provide a lot of answers about how we got here Additionally the book was not deterred by the then recent firings of Alonso and Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter needing only a few cosmetic tweaks to weave the whole story together with Robinson explaining those firings actually reinforced our sense that we really had captured the story of Marvel in both its triumphs and its stumbling blocks Robinson was able to interview many of the subjects while Gonazles did the majority of the book s research with Edwards
