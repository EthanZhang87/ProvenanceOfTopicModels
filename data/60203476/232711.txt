Paramount Pictures agreed to distribute Part of the deal called for Niccol to make his directing debut though Paramount executives felt the estimated million budget would be too high for him In addition Paramount wanted to go with an A list director paying Niccol extra money to step aside Brian De Palma was under negotiations to direct before he left United Talent Agency in March Directors who were considered after De Palma s departure included Tim Burton Sam Raimi Terry Gilliam David Cronenberg Barry Sonnenfeld and Steven Spielberg before Peter Weir signed on in early following a recommendation of Niccol Bryan Singer wanted to direct but Paramount decided to go with the more experienced Weir br Weir wanted the film to be funnier feeling that Niccol s script was too dark and declaring where Niccol had it depressing I could make it light It could convince audiences they could watch a show in this scope Niccol wrote sixteen drafts of the script before Weir considered the script ready for filming Later in Jim Carrey signed to star but because of commitments with The Cable Guy and Liar Liar he would not be ready to start filming for at least another year Weir felt Carrey was perfect for the role and opted to wait for another year rather than recast the role Niccol rewrote the script twelve times while Weir created a fictionalized book about the show s history He envisioned backstories for the characters and encouraged actors to do the same br Weir scouted locations in Eastern Florida but was dissatisfied with the landscapes Sound stages at Universal

offices were immediately opened in Seaside where the majority of filming took place The scenes of Truman s house were filmed at a residence owned by the Gaetz family which included Florida State Senator Don Gaetz and U S representative Matt Gaetz The scene at the Seahaven Nuclear Power Station was filmed outside the front entrance of the Lansing Smith Generating Plant at Lynn Haven operated then by Gulf Power Other scenes were shot at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles California Norman Rockwell paintings and s postcards were used as inspiration for the film s design Weir Peter Biziou and Dennis Gassner researched surveillance techniques for certain shots br br br Filming br Filming took place from December to April Its overall look was influenced by television images particularly commercials Many shots have characters leaning into the lens with their eyes wide open and the interior scenes are heavily lit because Weir wanted to remind viewers that in this world everything was for sale Those involved in visual effects work found the film somewhat difficult to make because was the year many visual effects companies were trying to convert to computer generated imagery CGI CGI was used to create the upper halves of some of the larger buildings in the film s downtown set Craig Barron one of the effects supervisors said that these digital models did not have to look as detailed and weathered as they normally would in a film because of the artificial look of the entire town although they did imitate slight blemishes found in the physical buildings br br br Soundtrack br The Truman Show Music from the Motion Picture is a soundtrack to the film of the same name and was composed by Burkhard Dallwitz Dallwitz was hired after Peter Weir received a tape of his work while in Australia for the post production Some parts of the soundtrack were composed by Philip Glass Philip Glass also appears in the film as an uncredited cameo playing his composition Truman Sleeps br Also featured are Fr d ric Chopin s second movement Romanze Larghetto from his first piano concerto performed by the New Symphony Orchestra of London under the direction of Stanis aw Skrowaczewski with pianist Arthur Rubinstein Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart s Rondo alla turca from his Piano Sonata No in A Major performed by Wilhelm Kempff Wojciech Kilar s Father Kolbe s Preaching performed by the Warsaw National Philharmonic Orchestra as well as the song th Century Boy performed by rockabilly band The Big Six br Although not part of the soundtrack Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart s Horn Concerto No and Love Is Just Around the Corner by Jackie Davis were also featured in the film br br br Themes br br br Media br br In Popular Mechanics named The Truman Show as one of the most prophetic science fiction films Journalist Erik Sofge argued that the story reflects the falseness of reality television Truman simply lives and the show s popularity is its straightforward voyeurism And like Big Brother Survivor and every other reality show on the air none of his environment is actually real He deemed it an eerie coincidence that Big Brother made its debut a year after the film s release and he also compared the film to the program The Joe Schmo Show Unlike Truman Matt Gould could see the cameras but all of the other contestants were paid actors playing the part of various reality show stereotypes While Matt eventually got all of the prizes in the rigged contest the show s central running joke was in the same existential ballpark as The Truman Show Weir declared There has always been this question Is the audience getting dumber Or are we filmmakers patronizing them Is this what they want Or is this what we re giving them But the public went to my film in large numbers And that has to be encouraging br Ronald Bishop s paper in the Journal of Communication Enquiry suggested The Truman Show showcased the power of the media Truman s life inspires audiences around the world meaning their lives are controlled by his Bishop commented In the end the power of the media is affirmed rather than challenged In the spirit of Antonio Gramsci s concept of hegemony these films and television programs co opt our enchantment and disenchantment with the media and sell it back to us br In her essay Reading The Truman Show inside out Simone Knox argues that the film itself tries to blur the objective perspective and the show within the film Knox also draws a floor plan of the camera angles of the first scene br br br Psychoanalytic interpretation br An essay published in the International Journal of Psychoanalysis analyzed Truman as br br a prototypical adolescent at the beginning of the movie He feels trapped into a familial and social world to which he tries to conform while being unable to entirely identify with it believing that he has no other choice other than through the fantasy of fleeing to a far way island Eventually Truman gains sufficient awareness of his condition to leave home developing a more mature and authentic identity as an adult leaving his child self behind and becoming a True man br For the Cannes Film Festival its official poster pays homage to the film and its final scene with their website stating that Peter Weir and Andrew Niccol s The Truman Show is a modern reflection of Plato s cave and the decisive scene urges viewers to not only experience the border between reality and its representation but to ponder the power of fiction between manipulation and catharsis br br br Similarity to Utopia br Parallels can be drawn from Thomas More s book Utopia in which More describes an island with only one entrance and only one exit Only those who belonged to this island knew how to navigate their way through the treacherous openings safely and unharmed This situation is similar to The Truman Show because there are limited entryways into the world that Truman knows Truman does not belong to this utopia into which he has been implanted and childhood trauma rendered him frightened of the prospect of ever leaving this small community Utopian models of the past tended to be full of like minded individuals who shared much in common comparable to More s Utopia and real life groups such as the Shakers and the Oneida Community It is clear that the people in Truman s world are like minded in their common effort to keep him oblivious to reality The suburban picket fence appearance of the show s set is reminiscent of the American Dream of the s The American Dream concept in Truman s world serves as an attempt to keep him happy and ignorant br br br Release br Originally set for August the film s theatrical release was pushed back initially to November and then to the summer of NBC purchased broadcast rights in December roughly eight months before the film s release In March Turner Broadcasting System purchased the rights and now airs the film on TBS br br br Home media br Paramount Home Entertainment released the film on VHS on January followed by DVD on January that same year and a Special Edition re release on August It was later released on Blu ray on December A Ultra HD Blu ray was released on July in celebration of the film s th anniversary br br br Reception br br br Critical response br On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes The Truman Show holds a approval rating based on reviews with an average rating of The website s critics consensus reads A funny tender and thought provoking film The Truman Show is all the more noteworthy for its remarkably prescient vision of runaway celebrity culture and a nation with an insatiable thirst for the private details of ordinary lives Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned the film a score of out of based on critics indicating universal acclaim Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale br Giving the film a perfect four star score Roger Ebert compared it to Forrest Gump claiming that the film had the right balance of comedy and drama He was also impressed with Jim Carrey s dramatic performance Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote The Truman Show is emotionally involving without losing the ability to raise sharp satiric questions as well as get numerous laughs The rare film that is disturbing despite working beautifully within standard industry norms He would name it the best movie of In June Entertainment Weekly named Truman one of the Greatest Characters of the Last Years br James Berardinelli liked the film s approach of not being the casual summer blockbuster with special effects and he likened Carrey s charismatic understated and effective performance to those of Tom Hanks and James Stewart Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote Undeniably provocative and reasonably entertaining The Truman Show is one of those high concept movies whose concept is both clever and dumb Tom Meek of Film Threat said the film was not funny enough but still found something rewarding in its quirky demeanor br br br Accolades br br br Possible sequel show br Screenwriter Andrew Niccol had pitched a sequel show to the Truman Show This was his pitch br br There has been talk of doing a musical believe it or not or a series When it s a different art form I don t think it takes anything away from the original In my version of a series I thought it would be fun if after Truman walked through the sky the audience clamored for more which you sense at the end of the film I imagine there would be a network with multiple channels all starring a subject born on the show If I set it in New York City there would be girl living on the Upper East Side a boy from Harlem a kid from Chinatown etc Since they are all on their own channel and move in their own circles they are never meant to meet But at the end of the first season the boy from Harlem and the rich girl find themselves drawn to each other They both sense that the other is acting differently from anyone they ve ever met because for the first time they ve met someone who is not acting In the second season the Network would desperately try to kill off their romance br br br The Truman Show delusion br br Joel Gold a psychiatrist at the Bellevue Hospital Center revealed that by he had met five patients with schizophrenia and had heard of another twelve who believed their lives were reality television shows Gold named the syndrome The Truman Show delusion after the film and attributed the delusion to a world that had become hungry for publicity Gold stated that some patients were rendered happy by their disease while others were tormented One traveled to New York to check whether the World Trade Center had actually fallen believing the attacks to be an elaborate plot twist in his personal storyline Another came to climb the Statue of Liberty believing that he would be reunited with his high school girlfriend at the top and finally be released from the show br In August the British Journal of Psychiatry reported similar cases in the United Kingdom The delusion has informally been referred to as Truman syndrome according to an Associated Press
