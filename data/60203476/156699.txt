New Musical Express NME is a British music film gaming and culture website and brand Founded as a newspaper in with the publication being referred to as a rock inkie the NME would become a magazine that ended up as a free publication before becoming an online brand which includes its website and radio stations br As a rock inkie NME was the first British newspaper to include a singles chart adding that feature in the edition of November In the s it became the best selling British music newspaper From to it was particularly associated with gonzo journalism then became closely associated with punk rock through the writings of Julie Burchill Paul Morley and Tony Parsons It started as a music newspaper and gradually moved toward a magazine format during the s and s changing from newsprint in br The magazine s website NME com was launched in and became the world s biggest standalone music site with over sixteen million users per month With newsstand sales falling across the UK magazine sector in the early st century the magazine s paid circulation in the first half of was In September the NME magazine was relaunched to be distributed nationally as a free publication The first average circulation published in February of copies per week was the highest in the brand s history beating the previous best of recorded in at the height of the Beatles fame By December according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations average distribution of NME had fallen to copies a week although its then publisher Time Inc UK claimed to have more than million global unique users per month including million in the UK In March the publisher announced that the print edition of NME would cease publication after years and become an online only publication However this decision was reversed in with NME announcing that it would revive its print magazine as a bimonthly release br NME was acquired in by Singaporean music company BandLab Technologies which put all of its music publications under the NME Networks brand in December when the company was restructured br br br History br The paper was established in The Accordion Times and Musical Express was bought by London music promoter Maurice Kinn for just minutes before it was due to be officially closed It was relaunched as the New Musical Express and was initially published in a non glossy tabloid format on standard newsprint On November taking its cue from the US magazine Billboard it created the first UK Singles Chart a list of the Top Twelve best selling singles The first of these was in contrast to more recent charts a top twelve sourced by the magazine itself from sales in regional stores around the UK The first number one was Here in My Heart by Al Martino br br br s br During the s the paper championed the new British groups emerging at the time The NME circulation peaked under Andy Gray editor with a figure of for the period from January to June The Beatles and the Rolling Stones were frequently featured on the front cover These and other artists also appeared at the NME Poll Winners Concert an awards event that featured artists voted as most popular by the paper s readers The concert also featured a ceremony where the poll winners would collect their awards The NME Poll Winners Concerts took place between and From onwards they were filmed edited and transmitted on British television a few weeks after they had taken place br In the mid s the NME was primarily dedicated to pop while its older rival Melody Maker was known for its more serious coverage of music Other competing titles included Record Mirror which led the way in championing American rhythm and blues and Disc which focused on chart news The latter part of the decade the paper charted the rise of psychedelia and the continued dominance of British groups of the time During this period some sections of pop music began to be designated as rock The paper became engaged in a sometimes tense rivalry with Melody Maker however NME sales were healthy with the paper selling as many as issues per week making it one of the UK s biggest sellers at the time br br br s br br By the early s NME had lost ground to Melody Maker as its coverage of music had failed to keep pace with the development of rock music particularly during the early years of psychedelia and progressive rock In early the paper was on the verge of closure by its owner IPC which had bought the paper from Kinn in According to Nick Kent soon to play a prominent part in the paper s revival br br After sales had plummeted to and a review of guitar instrumentalist Duane Eddy had been printed which began with the words On this his th album we find Duane in as good voice as ever the NME had been told to rethink its policies or die on the vine br Alan Smith was made editor in and was told by IPC to turn things around quickly or face closure To achieve this Smith and his assistant editor Nick Logan raided the underground press for writers such as Charles Shaar Murray and Nick Kent and recruited other writers such as Tony Tyler Ian MacDonald and Californian Danny Holloway According to The Economist the New Musical Express started to champion underground up and coming music NME became the gateway to a more rebellious world First came glamrock and bands such as T Rex and then came punk by it had become the place to keep in touch with a cultural revolution that was enthralling the nation s listless youth Bands such as Sex Pistols X Ray Spex and Generation X were regular cover stars eulogised by writers such as Julie Burchill and Tony Parsons whose nihilistic tone narrated the punk years perfectly By the time Smith handed the editor s chair to Logan in mid the paper was selling nearly copies per week and was outstripping Melody Maker Disc Record Mirror and Sounds br According to MacDonald br br I think all the other papers knew by that NME had become the best music paper in Britain We had most of the best writers and photographers the best layouts that sense of style of humour and a feeling of real adventure We also set out to beat Melody Maker on its strong suit being the serious responsible journal of record We did Looking Back and Consumer Guide features that beat the competition out of sight and we did this not just to surpass our rivals but because we reckoned that rock had finished its first wind around and deserved to be treated as history as a canon of work We wanted to see where we d got to sort out this huge amount of stuff that had poured out since the mid s Everyone on the paper was into this br Led Zeppelin topped the NME Pop Poll for three consecutive years under the category of the best Vocal Group br In NME lambasted German pioneer electronic band Kraftwerk with this title This is what your fathers fought to save you from The article said that the electronic melodies flowed as slowly as a piece of garbage floating down the polluted Rhine The same year also saw punk rock arrive on what some people perceived to be a stagnant music scene The NME gave the Sex Pistols their first music press coverage in a live review of their performance at the Marquee in February that year but overall it was slow to cover this new phenomenon in comparison to Sounds and Melody Maker where Jonh Ingham and Caroline Coon respectively were early champions of punk Although articles by the likes of Mick Farren whose article The Titanic Sails at Dawn called for a new street led rock movement in response to stadium rock were published by the NME that summer it was felt that younger writing was needed to credibly cover the emerging punk movement and the paper advertised for a pair of hip young gunslingers to join their editorial staff This resulted in the recruitment of Tony Parsons and Julie Burchill The pair rapidly became champions of the punk scene and created a new tone for the paper Parsons time at NME is reflected in his novel Stories We Could Tell about the misadventures of three young music paper journalists on the night of August the night Elvis Presley died br br In Logan moved on and his deputy Neil Spencer was made editor One of his earliest tasks was to oversee a redesign of the paper by Barney Bubbles which included the logo still used on the paper s masthead today albeit in a modified form this made its first appearance towards the end of Spencer s time as editor also coincided with the emergence of post punk acts such as Joy Division and Gang of Four This development was reflected in the writing of Ian Penman and Paul Morley Danny Baker who began as an NME writer around this time had a more straightforward and populist style br The paper also became more openly political during the time of punk Its cover would sometimes feature youth orientated issues rather than a musical act It took an editorial stance against political parties like the National Front With the election of Margaret Thatcher in the paper took a broadly socialist stance for much of the following decade br br br s br br In the s the NME became the most important music paper in the country It released the influential C in in conjunction with Rough Trade Records available to readers by mail order at a low price The tape featured a number of then up and coming bands including Duran Duran Aztec Camera Orange Juice Linx and Scritti Politti as well as a number of more established artists such as Robert Wyatt Pere Ubu the Buzzcocks and Ian Dury A second tape titled C was released in From to the magazine released cassette compilations br The NME responded to the Thatcher era by espousing socialism through movements such as Red Wedge In the week of the election the paper featured an interview with the leader of the Labour Party Neil Kinnock who appeared on the paper s cover He had appeared on the cover once two years before in April br Writers at this time included Mat Snow Chris Bohn known in his later years at the paper as Biba Kopf Antonella Gambotto Burke known by her pseudonyms Antonella Black and because of her then dyed orange hair Ginger Meggs Barney Hoskyns Paolo Hewitt Don Watson Danny Kelly Steven Wells and David Quantick br However sales were dropping and by the mid s NME had hit a rough patch and was in danger of closing During this period now under the editorship of Ian Pye who replaced Neil Spencer in they were split between those who wanted to write about hip hop a genre that was relatively new to the UK and those who wanted to stick to rock music Sales were apparently lower when photos of hip hop artists appeared on the front and this led to the paper suffering as the lack of direction became even more apparent to readers A number of features entirely unrelated to music appeared on the cover in this era including a piece by William Leith on computer crime and articles by Stuart Cosgrove on such subjects as the politics of sport and the presence of American troops in Britain with Elvis Presley appearing on the cover not for musical reasons but as a political symbol br The NME was generally thought to be rudderless at this time with staff pulling simultaneously in a number of directions in what came to be known as the hip hop wars It was haemorrhaging readers who were deserting NME in favour of Nick Logan s two creations The Face and Smash Hits This was brought to a head when the paper was about to publish a poster of an insert contained in the Dead Kennedys album Frankenchrist consisting of a painting by H R Giger called Penis Landscape then a subject of an obscenity lawsuit in the US In the summer and autumn of three senior editorial staff were sacked including Pye media editor Stuart Cosgrove and art editor Joe Ewart Former Sounds editor Alan Lewis was brought in to rescue the paper mirroring Alan Smith s revival a decade and a half before br Some commented at this time that the NME had become less intellectual in its writing style and less inventive musically Initially NME writers themselves were ill at ease with the new regime with most signing a letter of no confidence in Lewis shortly after he took over However this new direction for the NME proved to be a commercial success and the paper brought in new writers such as Andrew Collins Andrew Harrison Stuart Maconie Mary Anne Hobbs and Steve Lamacq to give it a stronger identity and sense of direction Lewis prioritised readership over editorial independence and Mark Sinker left in after Lewis refused to print his unfavourable review of U s Rattle and Hum the worst album by a major band in years replacing it with a glowing Stuart Baillie review intended to be more acceptable to readers Initially many of the bands on the C tape were championed as well as the rise of gothic rock bands but new bands such as the Happy Mondays and the Stone Roses were coming out of Manchester One scene over these years was Acid House which spawned Madchester which helped give the paper a new lease of life By the end of the decade Danny Kelly had replaced Lewis as editor br br br s br br By the end of the Madchester scene was dying off and NME had started to report on new bands coming from the US mainly from Seattle These bands would form a new movement called grunge and by far the most popular bands were Nirvana and Pearl Jam The NME took to grunge very slowly Sounds was the first British music paper to write about grunge with John Robb being the first to interview Nirvana Melody Maker was more enthusiastic early on largely through the efforts of Everett True who had previously written for NME under the name The Legend For the most part NME only became interested in grunge after Nevermind became popular Although it still supported new British bands the paper was dominated by American bands as was the music scene in general br Although the period from to was dominated by American bands like Nirvana British bands were not ignored The NME still covered the indie scene and was involved with a war of words with a new band called Manic Street Preachers who were criticising the NME for what they saw as an elitist view of bands they would champion This came to a head in when during an interview with Steve Lamacq Richey Edwards would confirm the band s position by carving real into his arm with a razor blade br By the Madchester scene had died and along with the Manics some new British bands were beginning to appear Suede were quickly hailed by the paper as an alternative to the heavy grunge sound and hailed as the start of a new British music scene Grunge however was still the dominant force but the rise of new British bands would become something the paper would focus on more and more br In the NME also had a very public dispute with Morrissey due to allegations by NME s Dele Fadele that Morrissey had used racist lyrics and imagery This erupted after a concert at Finsbury Park where Morrissey was seen to drape himself in a Union Jack The series of articles starting with Fadele s one which followed in the next edition of NME featuring the story on the front cover soured Morrissey s relationship with the paper and this led to Morrissey not speaking to the paper again for the next years i e until br Later in Steve Sutherland previously an assistant editor of Melody Maker was brought in as the NME s editor to replace Danny Kelly Andrew Collins Stuart Maconie Steve Lamacq and Mary Anne Hobbs all left the NME in protest and moved to Select Collins Maconie and Lamacq would all also write for Q while Lamacq would join Melody Maker in Kelly Collins Maconie Lamacq and Hobbs would all subsequently become prominent broadcasters with BBC Radio as it reinvented itself under Matthew Bannister br In April Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found dead a story which affected not only his fans and readers of the NME but would see a massive change in British music Grunge was about to be replaced by Britpop a new genre influenced by s British music and culture The term was coined by NME after the band Blur released their album Parklife in the month of Cobain s death Britpop began to fill the musical and cultural void left after Cobain s demise and with Blur s success and the rise of a new group from Manchester called Oasis Britpop would continue its rise for the rest of By the end of the year Blur and Oasis were the two biggest bands in the UK and sales of the NME were increasing thanks to the Britpop effect In NME covered these new bands many of whom played the NME Stage at that year s Glastonbury Festival where the paper had been sponsoring the second stage at the festival since This would be its last year sponsoring the stage subsequently the stage would be known as the Other Stage br In August Blur and Oasis planned to release singles on the same day in a mass of media publicity Steve Sutherland put the story on the front page of the paper and was criticised for playing up the duel between the bands Blur won the race for the top of the charts and the resulting fallout from the publicity led to the paper enjoying increased sales during the s as Britpop became the dominant genre After this peak the paper experienced a slow decline as Britpop burned itself out fairly rapidly over the next few years This left the paper directionless again and attempts to embrace the rise of DJ culture in the late s only led to the paper being criticised for not supporting rock or indie music The paper did attempt to return to its highly politicised s incarnation by running a cover story in March condemning Tony Blair who had previously associated himself with Britpop bands such as Oasis and this received a certain level of attention in the wider media br Sutherland did attempt to cover newer bands but a cover feature on the Canadian post rock band Godspeed You Black Emperor saw the paper dip to a sales low and Sutherland later stated in his weekly editorial that he regretted putting them on the cover For many this was seen as an affront to the principles of the paper and sales reached a low point at the turn of the millennium From the issue of March the paper was no longer printed on newsprint and more recently it has shifted to tabloid size with glossy colour covers br br br s br In Steve Sutherland left to become brand director of the NME and was replaced as editor by year old Melody Maker writer Ben Knowles In the same year Melody Maker officially merged with the NME and many speculated the NME would be next to close as the weekly music magazine market was shrinking the monthly magazine Select which had thrived especially during the Britpop era was closed down within a week of Melody Maker In the early s the NME also attempted somewhat to broaden its coverage again running cover stories on hip hop acts such as Jay Z and Missy Elliott electronic musician Aphex Twin Popstars winners Hear say and R B groups such as Destiny s Child However as in the s these proved unpopular with much of the paper s readership and were soon dropped In the NME reasserted its position as an influence in new music and helped to introduce bands including the Strokes the Vines and the White Stripes br In Conor McNicholas was appointed editor with a new wave of photographers including Dean Chalkley Andrew Kendall James Looker and Pieter Van Hattem and a high turnover of young writers It focused on new British bands such as the Libertines Franz Ferdinand Bloc Party and the Kaiser Chiefs which had emerged as indie music continued to grow in commercial success Later Arctic Monkeys became the standard bearers of the post Libertines crop of indie bands being both successfully championed by the NME and receiving widespread commercial and critical success br In December accusations were made that the NME end of year poll had been edited for commercial and political reasons These criticisms were rebutted by McNicholas who claimed that webzine Londonist com had got hold of an early draft of the poll br In October NME launched an Irish version of the magazine called NME Ireland This coincided with the launch of Club NME in Dublin Dublin based band Humanzi was first to appear on the cover of NME Ireland The Irish edition of the magazine could not compete with local competitors such as Hot Press therefore it was discontinued after its fourth issue in February br After the NME Award nominations Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian criticised the magazine s lack of diversity saying br br NME bands fall within very narrow parameters In the s the paper prided itself on its coverage of hip hop R B and the emerging dance scene which it took seriously and featured prominently alongside the usual Peel endorsed indie fare Now though its range of approved bands has dramatically shrunk to a strand embodied by the Arctic Monkeys Babyshambles and Muse bands who you don t need specialist knowledge to write about and who are just indie enough to make readers feel they re part of a club Like everything else in publishing this particular direction must be in response to reader demand but it doesn t half make for a self limiting magazine br In May the magazine received a redesign aimed at an older readership with a more authoritative tone The first issue of the redesign featured a free seven inch Coldplay vinyl single br br br s br Krissi Murison was appointed editor in June launching a new redesigned NME in April The issue had different covers highlighting the broader range of music the magazine would cover and featured Jack White Florence and the Machine LCD Soundsystem Rihanna Kasabian Laura Marling Foals M I A Biffy Clyro and Magnetic Man br Murison was replaced as editor in July by Mike Williams who had previously been the magazine s deputy Williams is now Editor in Chief with full responsibility for NME s cross platform output Under Williams NME has launched the NME Daily app a new career focussed event called Lifehacks and successfully relaunched both the NME magazine and NME s website NME com br In NME s The Greatest Albums of All Time was criticized by the media The Guardian pointed out that Features Editor Laura Snapes included in her top greatest albums of all time four albums from the same band which was The National Consequence of Sound similarly observed that if Laura Snapes had her wish the top four would all be The National albums br br br Free title br In February it was reported that the NME was in discussions about removing the cover price and becoming a free publication This was confirmed in July br The free NME launched on September with Rihanna on the cover Distributed nationwide via universities retail stores and the transport network the first circulation numbers published in February of copies per week were the highest in the brand s history Since relaunch the magazine has featured a number of high profile international pop stars on the cover such as Coldplay Taylor Swift Lana Del Rey Kanye West and Green Day alongside emerging talent like Zara Larsson Years Years Lady Leshurr and Christine and the Queens br The free pop oriented NME magazine was praised for reconnecting NME with its target audience and was awarded a silver at the Professional Publishers Association Awards for its historic first ever cover as a free title featuring Rihanna Editor in Chief Mike Williams
