WCVB TV channel is a television station in Boston Massachusetts United States affiliated with ABC and owned by Hearst Television The station s studios are located on TV Place off Gould Street near the I MA Highland Avenue interchange in Needham Massachusetts and its transmitter is located on Cedar Street also in Needham on a tower shared with several other television and radio stations br Nearby Manchester New Hampshire is considered part of the Boston media market making WCVB TV part of a nominal duopoly with WMUR TV channel that city s ABC affiliate however the two stations maintain separate operations br WCVB is also one of six Boston television stations that are carried by satellite provider Bell Satellite TV and fiber optic television provider Bell Fibe TV in Canada Since midday and weekend late newscasts along with World News Now are overlaid with Canadian paid programming on those providers however the latter has carried the normal WCVB TV feed in recent years br br br History br br br Prior history of channel in Boston br br The channel allocation in Boston was first occupied by the original WHDH TV which signed on the air on November The station was owned by the Boston Herald Traveler Corporation along with WHDH radio AM now WEEI and FM now WJMN It was originally an ABC affiliate but switched to CBS in br However almost as soon as it signed on the Federal Communications Commission FCC began investigating allegations of impropriety in the granting of the television station s construction permit This touched off a struggle that lasted years As a result WHDH TV never had a license renewal period lasting more than six months at a time most television licenses at the time lasted for three years In a local group Boston Broadcasters won a construction permit to build a new station on channel under the callsign of WCVB TV after promising to air more local programming than any other station in the United States at the time The new channel needed to have a different call sign due to FCC rules at the time that stated that TV and radio stations in the same market but with different ownership were required to have different call signs It was also critical of the combination of the Herald Traveler and WHDH AM FM TV Herald Traveler Corporation fought the decision in court but lost in and Boston Broadcasters was awarded a full license The local group was led by acoustic expert Leo Beranek br br br WCVB history present br br br Beginnings br The original WHDH TV signed off for the last time on March and was replaced by the new WCVB TV early the next morning The Herald Traveler refused to hand over its facilities to the new channel forcing the station to rent tower space for its transmitter from WBZ TV channel during the final months of its operation WHDH TV was court ordered to sign off daily at a m so that WCVB TV could test its equipment WCVB purchased a former International Harvester sales and service facility in Needham to serve as its studio facility along Route which the station continues to operate from to this day Although WCVB operates under a different license and celebrates station anniversaries using its sign on date it inherited all of WHDH TV s personnel including anchorman Jack Hynes and sportscaster Don Gillis all transferred to WCVB TV with the termination of the WHDH TV license br However WCVB did not inherit its predecessor s CBS affiliation Boston Broadcasters plans for a large amount of local programming would have resulted in heavy preemptions of network programming CBS was not pleased with the prospect of being subjected to numerous preemptions of its programs in the nation s fifth largest market at the time as of it is the seventh largest especially since WCVB would have inherited WHDH s status as CBS s second largest affiliate and largest on the East Coast It refused to have anything to do with WCVB and moved its programming back to WNAC TV which had been Boston s original CBS affiliate from to NBC was entrenched with WBZ TV and in any event was even less tolerant of preemptions than CBS More or less by default WCVB affiliated with ABC br br br Local programming br Making good on its promise WCVB aired more local programming than any other television station in the nation throughout the s and s One of its local programs Good Day which first premiered in as Good Morning broke ground by taking its entire production on the road and broadcasting from locations outside of the Boston area and around the world Good Day along with The Morning Exchange on Cleveland s WEWS TV served as a prototype for the format of ABC s Good Morning America Good Day lasted until br During the s WCVB TV was the first television station in southern New England to run a hour program schedule The station ran a programming block from to am branded as All Night which featured a library of older black and white movies and a few recent syndicated programs During station breaks announcer George Fennel who never made an on camera appearance during the block would make live announcements and read fan mail from the viewing audience as various All Night logo backdrops were displayed on screen His actual first on air portrait was displayed as part of a donation pledge drive for the Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon The portrait had been covered from view and as the tally had reached a certain amount a piece of the portrait would be revealed to the viewers until it was completely uncovered revealing what Fennel looked like br Another staple of All Night was Simon s Sanctorum a program similar to Elvira s Movie Macabre that showcased old black and white horror movies it was hosted by a character named Simon portrayed by Gary Newton who often referred to his viewing audience as to being moths lured to a flame and Dearly Devoted Simon s costume consisted of an old top hat and fluorescent green facial makeup with black circles painted around each eye and gloves that had the fingers cut out of them To add to an extra eerie effect a fluorescent black light was used to enhance the makeup effect on Simon s face and eyes His eyes actually glowed by the use of fluorescent paint on a pair of special contact lenses br br br Ownership changes br Boston Broadcasters sold WCVB to Metromedia in for million the costliest sale ever made for a local station at the time In Metromedia sold its television stations to the News Corporation then owners of the th Century Fox film studio which later used Metromedia s group of independent stations to launch the Fox network on October Channel was included in the original deal but was concurrently spun off to the Hearst Corporation which had purchased fellow ABC affiliate KMBC TV in Kansas City Missouri from Metromedia in That station was sold to allow Metromedia to acquire WCVB to comply with FCC rules in effect at the time that limited the number of VHF stations owned by a single company to only five and it is believed that Metromedia gave Hearst a right of first refusal offer if WCVB ever went up for sale again Fox would get its own station in Boston in when it bought WXNE TV channel from the Christian Broadcasting Network and renamed it WFXT Fox subsequently sold WFXT to the Boston Celtics in repurchased the station in and then traded WFXT to Cox Media Group in br br br Logo br In graphic design

hour long p m newscast In both time periods Oprah always held first place among the program s competitors and consistently kept WCVB s neighboring newscasts at number one Winfrey s decision to end her

WQTV channel now WBPX TV or Worcester based WHLL channel now WUTF TV Since the mid s WCVB has carried ABC s entire programming schedule although it occasionally preempts network programming in favor of locally produced specials and movies Notable examples are the annual MDA Labor Day Telethon before the program s move to ABC as a short form broadcast although it did stay on WCVB the program would be discontinued after the edition and the preemption of Saving Private Ryan one of several ABC stations that preempted the film out of concern over the graphic war battle scenes and profanity that

to the winning bid WCVB management had asked Janet Langhart to host the nightly lottery drawings if the station won the contract Langhart was reportedly angered by the proposition accusing WCVB of trying to minimize her from the role of respected journalist and talk show host and also inferring a racial motivation behind the offer Langhart is African American Ultimately WCVB lost its bid for the lottery rights to WNEV TV channel which began broadcasting the drawings and all other related broadcast property in August br In when WHDH TV the former WNEV TV was purchased by Sunbeam Television the lottery did not renew the station s contract for another cycle It was announced soon after that WCVB would acquire the rights From March to May WCVB was the official station for Lottery Live the
