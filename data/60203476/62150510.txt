film for The New York Times Manohla Dargis wrote that DaCosta plays with perspective shifting between Anthony s and the intersecting sometimes colliding worlds of more successful artists urban legend propagators and touchingly profoundly scarred children She points to the interspersed bits of shadow puppetry as a reflexive writing device that emphasizes Candyman is fundamentally about storytelling writing We tell some fictions to understand ourselves to exist others we tell to turn other human beings into monsters to destroy Odie Henderson reviewing the film for RogerEbert com praised DaCosta s visual style writing that she stages the kill scenes with a mix of pitch black humor misdirection and clever framing fully acknowledging that what you don t see or think you saw can be a lot worse than what you did see br In her review of Candyman for The A V Club Anya Stanley wrote that the film s various interests are more than a minute movie can adequately explore but conceded there are worse crimes for a movie to commit than having too many ideas She explained Where Bernard Rose spoke on White anxieties and the image of the scary Black man in DaCosta expands the conversation relocating the horror from one man to the many structures that foment brutality upon the Black populace br In her review for Vulture Angelica Jade Basti n called Candyman the most disappointing film of the year so far writing that it limns not only the artistic failures of the individuals who ushered it to life but the artistic failures of an entire industry that seeks to commodify Blackness to embolden its bottom line Robert Daniels expressed similar disappointment with the film in his review for Polygon describing it as cluttered preachy and not nearly scary enough He took particular issue with the way the film fails to convey the geographical importance of Cabrini Green writing that the lack of a visual metaphor makes the film s exploration of gentrification more of an assemblage of nonspecific dialogue It talks about what gentrification is and not what it looks like br David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote Director Nia DaCosta working from a script she wrote with Jordan Peele and Win Rosenfeld uses Bernard Rose s film as a jumping off point for bone chilling horror that expands provocatively on the urban legend of the first film within the context of Black folklore and history as well as the distorting White narrative that turns Black victims into monsters Reviewing the film for TheWrap Elizabeth Weitzman said DaCosta Peele and Rosenfeld are playing with us the victim is rendered less sympathetically than Candyman as much as they are with notions of history culture art and appropriation They bring in actors from the first film including Tony Todd and Vanessa Estelle Williams but not always in ways we expect They build on canon while simultaneously dismantling it Aedan Juvet of Screen Rant also named the movie The Most Rewatchable Horror Film of br br
