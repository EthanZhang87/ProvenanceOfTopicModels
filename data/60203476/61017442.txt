followed being Nature Day Earth Day May Day Halloween Turkey Day Thanksgiving and Toy Day Christmas Other popular seasonal events such as summer also came with new items Each respective update also featured popular characters from past Animal Crossing games With each update the island changed in look and the player s island is often decorated for the occasion Alongside seasonal changes Nintendo

Horizons was paid downloadable content entitled Happy Home Paradise Similar to the spinoff Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer the expansion allows players to visit a distant island and design vacation homes for villagers and adds new customization options that can also be used on players personal islands once learned The Happy Home Paradise add on was released on November br br Development of a new main series Animal Crossing game for the Nintendo Switch was confirmed in a Nintendo Direct on September with an unspecified release date Although the game was announced in game director Aya Kyogoku confirmed that the game had begun development in shortly after the original release of Animal Crossing New Leaf for the Nintendo DS in Japan she stated how concepts for the game were forming long before ideas for the Nintendo Switch had even existed Hisashi Nogami and Katsuya Eguchi reprised their roles as the game s producers br Nintendo released the game s title and first trailer at its E Nintendo Direct on June The game was delayed until March with Yoshiaki Koizumi stating that in order to ensure that the game was the best it could be Nintendo had to ask that players wait a little longer than Nintendo itself thought Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser cited a desire to avoid crunch and maintain a healthy work life balance for Nintendo employees as the primary reason for the delay Nintendo s stock market value posted a loss in reaction to the delay amounting to a total loss in value of more than US billion br Kyogoku stated that the success of the Animal Crossing series was due to the fact that the developers make each game different enough from the last to bring appeal to newcomers yet keep the core concept for returning players Kyogoku and Nogami stated that they selected a deserted island as the game s setting to differentiate it from previous Animal Crossing games which are set in established villages and to allow greater freedom to customize the game s world Additionally a deserted island took away established parameters in the series to allow for different ideas and player interactions Other concepts such as the internet and multiplayer were able to be implemented unlike previous games due to advancing hardware Kyogoku made sure to keep balance of introducing new and fresh ideas while retaining core elements to satisfy long term fans of the series br The developers were very disappointed when the game s release cycle overlapped with the COVID pandemic Due to quarantine during the pandemic Kyogoku hoped that the game would be an escape for fans at the time They emphasized a global release to allow for international connections between the players br br The developers sought to make the game both welcoming to new players and to retain core concepts from the previous games to keep older fans of the series happy A crafting system was implemented to allow the player to keep the player from running out of things to do after the in game stores close Kyogoku mentioned how the D I Y crafting system would keep players in theme with the game by interacting and using the natural environment to their advantage She took note of players who began playing Animal Crossing games via mobile apps such as Animal Crossing Pocket Camp by implementing the Nook Miles feature which would show the player what kinds of activities and concepts they can achieve by rewarding them to do so The Nook Miles system also rewards the player for doing common tasks and collecting materials that would sell for cheap to keep the player from only tediously searching out expensive materials Furniture and clothing accessibility and customization were emphasized for multiplayer so players could show pride in their islands br Additionally the developers noticed that players would repeatedly restart their save file in previous titles in hopes of getting their desired island shape Because of this landscaping was implemented to allow for easy shaping of the island Another issue they noticed was time traveling due to the game running in real time players would change the clock on the console to put themselves further into the future so they don t have to wait in real time To help avoid this they made sure landscaping and crafting did not have any wait time restrictions They also tied seasonal events to updates instead of implementing the content into the game from the beginning so players could not skip ahead and retrieve exclusive items The interest rate in the game s bank system was also decreased to lower the incentive of time traveling Although the developers intended no time traveling to be the ideal way of playing they did not shun the concept entirely br br The game s art director Koji Takahashi followed the philosophy of trigger of play to make sure there was something within the player s field of vision or grasp that they would want to explore With this the island was designed from a degree angle similar to that of a cylinder or a curved perspective where the player could view other content occurring in the background that would trigger them to investigate further or interact By making an everyday concept simple and easy to grasp it would cause the player to explore it further and be able to easily pick up the new material Takahashi believed that if the game s art was complicated and realistic the player would possibly receive too much information and make progression difficult The simple design allowed for a multiple of one object to be stacked close to each other such as flowers or allow for simplistic objects to compliment others br By leaving empty space and with a simplistic design with simple graphics and little nature complexity Takahashi explains how it would have the player attempt to fill in that gap with their own perspectives and ideas called the imagination gap and further motivation to create their own designs and space with the features available In the game the grass is designed to look like that of a checkerboard Although this concept was only used in prior titles due to a lack of hardware complexity it was retained because it could be used as a form of expression for the player and allow them to conceptualize ideas with the imagination gap br Art designer Hiromi Sugimoto made sure furniture would lead to motivation and hard work and thus make the player want to connect with others to show off their achievements She made sure the furniture could be customized by the player to ensure the difference between islands that would motivate visiting others and seeing unique ideas Each furniture model was designed to have a likeness to it which would show exactly what to expect and what the player envisions the pieces of furniture and items implemented various portions on how players view an object to look like and combine the commons ideas into one model From there using the imagination gap the player could fill in the smaller nitpicky info they would expect and further imagine how they could use the item br br The March release date for New Horizons coincided with that of id Software s Doom Eternal Due to the demand expected for both games and in light of the COVID pandemic GameStop decided to begin selling Doom Eternal one day earlier on the th to minimize crowding The stark contrast in tone between both games combined with them being released on the same day prompted fans of both series to celebrate the coincidence by creating light hearted crossover art featuring Doom s Doomguy and Isabelle as best friends When New Horizons released on March video game retailer EB Games attracted criticism for allowing fans who pre ordered the game along with Doom Eternal to line up at its flagship Canadian location on Yonge Street Toronto amid a COVID pandemic in the country when all levels of government urged the public to close non essential businesses and maintain social distancing br Touching on New Horizons in a December interview with Polygon Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser stated the game sold well beyond expectations and applauded the developers for their efforts He noted the game would continue to see updates all throughout br br Animal Crossing New Horizons received universal acclaim according to review aggregator Metacritic becoming the highest rated game in the series on the website The game was awarded perfect scores by Nintendo Life and Pocket Gamer However the game has been subject to review bombing due to its handling of Switch profiles and multiplayer br Most enjoyed the Nook Miles system stating that it gave the player something to do and a goal to reach Dann Sullivan writing for Pocket Gamer liked how it gave the player optional direction USGamer also joked how nobody can complain how there is nothing to do The D I Y system was also praised with Nintendo Life taking note of how no resource is useless Polygon s Russ Frushtick lauded the ability for unrestricted creativity that allowed for the player to design the island with furniture and building layout leading to a true representation of the player who created it Eurogamer Deputy Editor Martin Robinson stated that the game has some very impressive improvements which allowed for a much clearer and more defined structure overall that gave the game play a better feel and cohesion than ever before br Critics from GameSpot and Game Informer praised the creative freedom and control offered by the game such as being allowed to choose where buildings and bridges are placed In particular the Island Designer App was lauded with its ability to create natural structures although there were minor complaints about how the player could not expand the island and could only reshape it GamesRadar appreciated the retaining of old characters and concepts with the addition of new gameplay mechanics TechRadar lauded the game s sound and visuals writing everything is sharp smooth colorful and a big improvement on previous releases br Slant Magazine s Steven Scaife was more critical of the game arguing that By consolidating so much power in the hands of an individual player New Horizons threatens to upend the Animal Crossing vision of community living br Many had complaints about time restrictions in the early phases of the game Since the game runs in real time most of the resources available replenish the next day and reviewers were left with little to do in the beginning IGN s Samuel Claiborn refused to time travel in prior titles but ultimately was tempted into putting the system s clock ahead days in when more tools were unlocked and to begin what he believed was when the game had faster pacing Players enjoyed the lack of time related pressure and the option to time travel if preferred br Outside of gameplay itself New Horizons received acclaim for the timing of the release coming out just as stay at home orders were being fortified Reviewer Louryne Strampe of WIRED found that the game was exactly what she needed for her mental health and added that she and her colleagues find solace when visiting each other s respective islands Due to online multiplayer options it also gave critics the opportunity to play with friends during quarantine The release of New Horizons has also sparked in popularity of the term cozy game which meant that the term was also adopted to various farm sims such as Stardew Valley br The downloadable content expansion Happy Home Paradise was well received Lisa Segarra of Kotaku found the prompts for designing villager homes to be exhilarating and that it sparked inspiration She found that the update brought so much new life into the game Kate Gray of Nintendo Life described the new content in the expansion and the free update as being comparable to a big lick of paint over the whole game The depth and quantity of new content were praised and minor improvements were deemed to really make it worth sticking around though the finality of the update was criticized br br Due to the seasonal and real time connection in New Horizons the game saw multiple second opinions by critics and fans as new content was released usually of positive to mixed reception According to Vice Media and VentureBeat about weeks after the release date players who played the game for large amounts of time shortly after its release tended to suffer from burnout and play significantly less by the time the game had been released for six weeks Vice Media noted how the game wasn t designed for people to be playing all the time and was rather intended for distraction but the pandemic isn t giving people much of a choice they reflected on the nature of the Animal Crossing series and how the game is better enjoyed at a slower pace of action Venturebeat s Jeff Grubb was able to recognize smaller hindrances and slow paced gameplay that became increasingly frustrating the more he had to use them Despite this both reviewers continued to play and looked on the game positively by April br A year later past reviews were revisited by Andrew Webster and Brendan Lowry writing for The Verge and iMore respectively and both expressed similar thoughts of what the game had become they both agreed the lack of island progression not continuing beyond a few months made returning difficult to enjoy with iMore expressing concerns for the lack of upgrades to components such as buildings and shops and The Verge considering the Nook Miles system to be an afterthought rather than goals to look forward to Both still continued to enjoy daily tasks of tending to the island however with both citing how it gives the player something to do and offers a small distraction from the real world By the release of the November update fans were torn on restarting their island entirely to recapture the experience as highlighted by Nicole Carpenter writing for Polygon br br Animal Crossing New Horizons sold over million physical copies at launch in
