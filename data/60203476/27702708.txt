radio controlled hands as well According to Jackman executive producer Spielberg actually said to Shawn You should really have real elements where you can Basically if they re not walking or fighting that s a real robot Levy added that Spielberg gave the example of Jurassic Park where Winston s animatronic dinosaurs got a better performance from the actors as they were seeing something real and gave the visual effects team an idea of what it would look like As Real Steel was not based on a toy Meyer said that there was no guideline for the robots and each was designed from scratch with an attempt to put different personality and aesthetics according to Levy In Atom s case it tried to have a more humanizing design to be an everyman who could attract the audience s sympathy and serve as a proxy to the viewer with a fencing mask that Meyer explained served to show his identity was a bit hidden so you have to work harder to get to see him Executive producer Robert Zemeckis added that the mask became a screen so we can project what we want on Atom s face Damage was added to the robots decoration to show how they were machines worn out by intense battles br For scenes when computer generated robots brawl simulcam motion capture technology developed for the film Avatar was used As Levy described the process Y ou re not only capturing the fighting of live human fighters but you re able to take that and see it converted to CGI robots on a screen instantaneously Simulcam puts the robots in the ring in real time so you are operating your shots to the fight whereas even three four
