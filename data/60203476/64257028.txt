id: 64257028
Wade Winston Wilson also known as Deadpool is a character portrayed by Ryan Reynolds in th Century Fox s X Men film series and later the Marvel Cinematic Universe MCU media franchise produced by Marvel Studios Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name by Fabian Nicieza and Rob Liefeld he was loosely adapted for his first appearance in X Men Origins Wolverine in which he is depicted as a member of Major William Stryker s Team X who is transformed into a genetically altered mutant killer known as Weapon XI before being defeated by his former teammate Wolverine br The revised timeline of the original X Men film series in X Men Days of Future Past narratively allowed for a more faithful rebooted iteration of the character to be depicted in Deadpool Wilson is a dishonorably discharged Special Forces operative and terminal cancer patient volunteering for an experimental treatment to awaken his latent mutant genes It gives him a regenerative healing factor that counteracts his illness but disfigures him resulting in him adopting the moniker Deadpool killing the scientist responsible and reuniting with his fianc e Vanessa Carlysle In Deadpool Wilson forms the X Force to protect a young mutant and avert his turn towards tyranny in the distant future Following the acquisition of st Century Fox by Disney in it was announced that Deadpool would be integrated within the MCU beginning with Deadpool Wolverine br The character s portrayal in X Men Origins Wolverine was negatively received by both critics and fans for deviating from the source material However his characterization in the two Deadpool films received critical acclaim with praise directed at Reynolds s performance and its faithfulness to the comics br br br Concept creation and characterization br br br Development br br Artisan Entertainment had announced a deal with Marvel Entertainment in May to co produce finance and distribute several films based on Marvel Comics s characters including Deadpool a newer character introduced in the early s By February screenwriter and director David S Goyer and Ryan Reynolds were working on a Deadpool film at New Line Cinema They had worked together on the Marvel film Blade Trinity Reynolds was interested in the part of Deadpool after learning that in the comics the character refers to his appearance as Ryan Reynolds crossed with a Shar Pei New Line executive Jeff Katz who thought Reynolds was the only actor suitable for the role championed the idea However there were rights issues with th Century Fox and their X Men films and the project did not move forward br By March Reynolds learned that Fox had expressed interest in a film featuring Deadpool The character was set to make a cameo appearance in the film X Men Origins Wolverine with Reynolds cast in the part His role was expanded during the film s production Katz was an executive at Fox at that point and said that Deadpool was nicely set up to be explored in his own way in a future film The film s portrayal deviates from the original comic character imbuing him with several superpowers and sewing his mouth shut Deadpool apparently dies in the film though a post credits scene showing him still alive was added to the film shortly before its release After the successful opening weekend of Wolverine Fox officially began development on Deadpool with Reynolds attached to star and X Men producer Lauren Shuler Donner involved The spinoff was set to ignore the Wolverine version of Deadpool and return to the character s roots with a slapstick tone and a propensity to break the fourth wall br At Fox the film went through several directors before Tim Miller settled on the position with Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick hired to write the script Meanwhile Reynolds took the lead role in Green Lantern a film that was critically and financially unsuccessful Due to this poor reception and the fact that a film based on Deadpool would most likely be rated R instead of PG Fox became doubtful about the project even after Reynolds produced test footage of himself in character However the footage was eventually leaked in to enthusiastic reviews prompting Fox to green light the project Reynolds attributed Fox s green lighting of the film entirely to the leak He Miller and the writers had previously discussed leaking the footage themselves and Reynolds initially thought that Miller had done so He later believed the leak came from someone at Fox In exchange for being able to make the film the way they wanted Fox gave the crew a much smaller budget than is typical for superhero films br br br Characterization br br In both timelines Wade possesses a highly sarcastic sense of humor that irritates and annoys most of his enemies He regularly insults and belittles his enemies He feels no shame and can make a joke out of any situation even after months of endless torture and being shaken by his subsequent transformation Only a few select people can withstand his seemingly endless talking and his mouth is sewn shut in the final act of X Men Origins Wolverine Ajax also threatens to sew Wade s mouth shut in Deadpool when he is undergoing his cancer treatment because of his nonstop talking br In the original timeline Wade is shown to have his sense of humor from the comics In addition however Wade bears similar personality traits to that of Agent Zero in X Men Origins Wolverine being a ruthless killer as shown during Team X s mission in Africa where he sided with Stryker Zero and Creed when ordered to kill the inhabitants of the village He likes to travel to new places to meet new people so that he can kill them br His personality is significantly more fleshed out in the new timeline He loves cartoons potty humor Skee Ball classical music television shows rap music and American pop culture His favorite band is Wham and George Michael specifically the song Careless Whisper He remains very movie cultured referencing The Matrix RoboCop Alien Yentl Hours Cocoon Star Wars Green Lantern which also stars Ryan Reynolds and even X Men Days of Future Past br Like his comics counterpart Wade himself is aware that he is a fictional character and makes fun of this by breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly to the audience In Deadpool when his autograph is requested by a fan he signs it Ryan Reynolds br Despite his initial immaturity Wade is a genuine soft good hearted man and in time becomes a very moral and heroic person to the point of sacrificing himself to save the mutant Russell Collins Although he is a mercenary he agreed to scare off a young girl s stalker without being paid for his troubles revealing he can be affectionate On matters of love he can be surprisingly sensitive feeling forced to abandon his girlfriend Vanessa due to his terminal cancer He advises his taxi driver Dopinder to fight for the object of his affections Gita After Vanessa s death Wade develops a suicidal nature yet his inability to die increases the decay of his already fractured psyche He is content to die of cancer in the Icebox until he finds a new purpose in protecting Russell from Cable After his near death experience he still has not accepted Vanessa s demise so he uses Cable s time travel device to save her br Reynolds worked with longtime trainer Don Saladino to get in shape for the role gaining pounds of lean muscle Saladino commented that while they aimed to achieve an aesthetically pleasing appearance they also wanted to get Reynolds actual strength over superficial so they spent extensive time working on Reynolds s mobility prior to working on actual strength br br br Marvel Cinematic Universe br br After the acquisition of st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company was announced in December and completed in March Disney CEO Bob Iger said that Deadpool would be integrated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe under Disney and that the company would be willing to make future R rated Deadpool films as long as we let the audiences know what s coming The Once Upon a Deadpool version of the film was being watched carefully by Disney and Marvel Studios to see whether it might inform how they could approach the character and integrate him into the PG MCU br In October Reese and Wernick said that they had a script in development but were waiting for approval from Marvel Studios to begin production on the third film Reese said Deadpool will live in the R rated universe that we ve created and hopefully we ll be allowed to play a little bit in the MCU sandbox as well and incorporate him into that In December Reynolds confirmed that a third Deadpool film was in development at Marvel Studios which was confirmed by Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige in January with Reynolds reprising his role The film will retain the R rating of the prior films and will be set in the MCU Feige described Wilson as a very different type of character in the MCU In March Shawn Levy was revealed as the film s director after previously collaborating with Reynolds on Free Guy and The Adam Project while Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick were announced to be rewriting the Molyneux sisters screenplay reprising their duties from the first two Deadpool films Filming began in May Reynolds is also slated to produce the film alongside Kevin Feige through his production company Maximum Effort br In May screenwriter Michael Waldron confirmed in an interview that there had been discussions within Marvel regarding Reynolds making a cameo appearance as Deadpool in the multiverse focused film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness as he himself felt it would ve been crazy to not raise that after the inclusions of other X Men related elements in the film such as the Savage Land and the character Professor Charles Xavier played by returning X Men actor Patrick Stewart However Waldron would ultimately feel as if the film was an unfitting place to feature the character The Marvel Studios Assembled episode on the making of Multiverse of Madness also featured concept art depicting a Deadpool dimension an alternate world cityscape with multiple billboards adorned with Deadpool themed posters and comic book art A pair of sneakers inspired by Deadpool s costume appears in the main on end credits sequence of the metafictional Disney television series She Hulk Attorney at Law

The climax for reasons that I won t reveal will absolutely infuriate devotees of Deadpool for comparison imagine if at the end of Spider Man Eddie Brock turned into The Vulture In her retrospective of the film Rachel Edidin of WIRED described the film s take on the character as Deadpool with his mouth sewn shut which kind of fundamentally misses the point of the Merc with a Mouth while Collider s
