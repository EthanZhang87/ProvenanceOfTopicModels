When Mega Man was released in the characteristic that made it revolutionary was the choice given to the player of which robot master to attempt first After defeating a Robot Master the boss of a level

Duo and Bass br The Classic series has not reached a definite conclusion Originally developed for the NES the original Mega Man series experienced graphical improvements in fourth and fifth generation installments The series had no games developed for sixth generation consoles but returned in the seventh generation purposely sporting graphics sound and gameplay similar to the original NES games to

his actions thoughts and feelings This character also a creation of Dr Light was put into suspended animation and uncovered years in the future by a researcher named Dr Cain The Mega Man X series features more detailed bit graphics and greater freedom of movement In the Mega Man X series the characters grow in abilities and power as the game progresses While the gameplay loop and combat is largely similar to the Classic Mega Man series Mega Man X series differs from its increased emphasis on mobility with X being able to dash and reach higher places through the use of his various armors gained throughout the games as well as its more mature story than its predecessor br As the series progressed various other player characters have appeared such as fellow Maverick Hunter Zero who was created by Dr Wily of the Classic series and Axl a Reploid with an adolescent personality who has the ability to shape shift into other Reploids Zero would later star in his own spin off series Mega Man Zero br The series was originally intended to conclude with Mega Man X which will lead to the Mega Man Zero series however as Inafune began work on the Zero series its storyline was continued

as he protects the oppressed remaining reploids uncovers the history behind The Elf Wars and the cause of his slumber br In the Mega Man Zero series the gameplay is largely similar to Zero s play style in the later Mega Man X games featuring a more close quarter hack n slash combat compared to Mega Man X s ranged combat and features an in depth ranking system that rewards the player with new abilities and enhancements such as copied abilities from boss characters in exchange for better play performance In the fourth game Zero can also physically steal weapons from enemies such as axes and guns br With its fourth installment Mega Man Zero became the first series in the franchise to reach a definitive conclusion br br The Mega Man ZX series debuted in for Nintendo DS once again developed

installment a first in the franchise New to the series is the interconnected Metroidvania esque world that encourages exploration and replay value and the ability to collect Biometals which are central to the story Biometals contains data on the legendary heroes of the past including X Zero and the Four Guardians from the Zero series Using these Biometals the protagonists are able to transform or Mega Merge in the English releases and use the powers of these heroes In the second game s Mega Man ZX Advent the player character is also able to transform into boss characters upon

obtained via achievements in Lost Planet br br Mega Man Battle Network a series primarily on the Game Boy Advance began in as a way for the Mega Man games to branch out into the role playing video game market and to celebrate Mega Man s th anniversary This series features a Net Navi called MegaMan EXE NetNavis acts as virtual assistants to Operators such as the protagonist Lan Hikari an elementary school student and a future hero who uses his Net Navi to help battle computer viruses and other Internet based threats The game combines real time strategy role playing and collectible card games to create a unique fast paced battle system Players and enemies are placed in a x grid with each side usually occupying x of the space Players must select Battle Chips from a select few from a folder deck and once selected the game switches to real time as the player must move to dodge enemy attacks while attacking at the same time using said Battle Chips Once the Custom Gauge is

Transmission was released in It is the only entry in the series released on a home console rather than a handheld and takes place chronologically between the first two Battle Network games It is also

completing the story arc that started in the first game Star Force became the third series in the Mega Man franchise to have a proper conclusion br The Star Force games are similar to the Battle Network games in which players must use a select number of Battle Cards on a folder deck to attack enemies However unlike Battle Network combat takes place in D space with most of the grid occupied by enemies and the player having only a x grid to move making combat much faster paced and focusing more on player reflexes and quick reaction time from an opening To compensate the collectible card system has been simplified and players were given the Mega Attack ability which allows the player to lock on and move straight to the enemy to attack and a regenerating shield that can deflect most attacks br Like Battle Network multiple merchandise and toys have been created for this series such as add on accessories for the Nintendo DS as well as physical Battle Cards that can be used in game

Semrad Danyon Carpenter and Al Manuel of the EGM review panel all noted that the game may have too low a difficulty level Semrad disliked the introductory stage and felt that the game was too short as well Super Play editor Zy Nicholson lowered his review score of the game because he found the levels were neither large nor challenging A few elementary tricks like repeating easy sections to recoup energy and weapon power will see you through the harder bits Nicholson explained Within the level you ll also find restart points extra lives and no harsh time limit to put pressure on your performance Couple this with a password system that records your level completion status and weapon accumulation and you ll see we re not looking at a lasting challenge for the experienced player

came out reviewers were quick to hail a return to what they considered the Mega Man roots however some fans criticized that the lack of knowing which boss the player will face next was a change for the worse and that it takes away what made the series unique in the past br Overall the character of Mega Man has been well received by critics IGN called him an icon of Capcom Nintendo Power listed

with his rivals his enemies and their abilities IGN agreed with his dependency on support characters saying Zero is cooler than Mega Man Den of Geek listed Mega Man s incarnation from Street Fighter X Tekken as the th best cameo in fighting game history due to how it represented Capcom s lack of interest in featuring other games as of as well as the apparent self mockery of it due to Mega Man s
