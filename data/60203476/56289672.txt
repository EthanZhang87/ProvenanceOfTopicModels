the United States entering World War II The initial introduction of the character included the concepts of a soldier named Steve Rogers being given a serum bestowing enhanced strength and agility wearing a patriotic red white and blue uniform carrying a shield and having as a sidekick a teenaged Bucky Barnes In the s Marvel decided to test bringing the character back as part of the Avengers with the premise that the character had been frozen for the two decades since the war and was haunted by past memories and trying to adapt to s society Live action performances of the character in television and film serials began within a few years after its creation with a feature film resulting in critical and financial failure br In the mid s Kevin Feige realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers which included Captain America Feige a self professed fanboy envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early s In Marvel received a million investment from Merrill Lynch allowing them to independently produce ten films including Captain America Paramount Pictures agreed to distribute the film br br Originally the film would stand alone Feige said about half the movie would be set during World War II before moving into the modern day Producer Avi Arad said The biggest opportunity with Captain America is as a man out of time coming back today looking at our world through the eyes of someone who thought the perfect world was small town United States Sixty years go by and who are we today Are we better He cited the Back to the Future trilogy as an influence and claimed he had someone in mind to be the star and definitely someone in mind to be the director In

is doing a lot of good things right now and it s a fun character I think the story of Steve Rogers is great He s a great guy Even if it were just a script about anybody I would probably want to do it So it wasn t necessarily about the comic itself In April it was reported that Joss Whedon would rewrite the script as part of his negotiation to write and direct The Avengers Whedon said in August I just got to make some character connections The structure of the thing was really tight and I loved it but there were a couple of opportunities to find his voice a little bit and some of the other characters and make the connections so that you understood exactly why he wanted to be who he wanted to be And progressing through the script to flesh it out a little bit br br br Film appearances br

Soldier and Captain America Civil War as becoming increasingly comfortable in his clothes A New York magazine article however criticized his clothing across the series as being bereft of patterns graphics imagery or anything you couldn t color in with one singular crayon br br In The First Avenger Rogers uses a weaponized WLA motorcycle in World War II in his fights against Hydra In Captain America The Winter Soldier and The Falcon and the Winter Soldier this model is shown to be displayed in the Captain America exhibit in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum In The Avengers Rogers is shown to have switched to a Softail Slim model for commuting around New York City before using the Street model when fleeing from pursuing Hydra agents in The Winter Soldier Rogers later uses other models such as the Breakout V Rod and the Softail Slim S br br br Personality br In Captain America The First Avenger Steve Rogers begins as a frail sickly young man who is enhanced to the peak of human ability by an experimental serum in order to aid the United States in World War II Regarding the extent of the character s abilities Evans remarked He would crush the Olympics Any Olympic sport he s gonna dominate He can jump higher run faster lift stronger weight but he can be injured He could roll an ankle and be out for the season He s not perfect he s not untouchable So a lot of the effects if I m going to punch someone they re not going to put them on a cable and fly them back feet but he s going to go down probably not getting back up which I think humanizes it It makes it something that again I think everyone can relate to a little bit more which I really like br Evans said that Rogers is much darker in The Avengers It s just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world You ve got to imagine it s enough of a shock to accept the fact that you re in a completely different time but everybody you know is dead Everybody you cared about He was a soldier obviously everybody he went to battle with all of his brothers in arms they re all dead He s just lonely I think in the beginning it s a fish out of water scene and it s tough It s a tough pill for him to swallow Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world Regarding the dynamic between Rogers and Tony Stark Evans said I think there s certainly a dichotomy this kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark they re polar opposites One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along They explore that and it s pretty fun A key moment in The Avengers occurs when Stark who had been dismissive of Rogers at earlier points in the film defers to Rogers as leader of the newly formed team to defend New York against a large scale attack Describing his character s continuing adjustment to the modern world in Captain America The Winter Soldier Evans said It s not so much about his shock with technology It s more about the societal differences He s gone from the s to today he comes from a world where people were a little more trusting the threats not as deep Now it s harder to tell who s right and wrong Actions you take to protect people from threats could compromise liberties and privacy That s tough for Steve to swallow br In his next appearance in Avengers Age of Ultron Rogers is the leader of the Avengers Evans stated that since the fall of S H I E L D Rogers has been left to depend on his Avenger teammates without the structure of military life and is now looking to understand where he belongs not just as a soldier as Captain America but as Steve Rogers as a person In Captain America Civil War Rogers becomes the leader of a faction of the Avengers against regulation Director Anthony Russo described Captain America s character arc in the film as taking him from the most ra ra company man and a somewhat willing propagandist to an insurgent at the end of the film Unlike the comics Civil War the film was never going to kill Rogers as the directors thought that was an easy ending The more difficult and more interesting place to leave a family fight is can these important relationships ever be repaired Is this family broken permanently br Director Joe Russo said that after the events of Civil War Rogers struggles with the conflict between his responsibility to himself and his responsibility to others In Avengers Infinity War the character embodies the spirit of his comic alternate identity Nomad in the film An early draft of the film experimented with Rogers first appearing in the film saving Vision from Corvus Glaive during the third act Markus and McFeely said they were called insane for waiting that long to introduce Rogers into the film and ultimately conceded it was not a satisfying approach br In Avengers Endgame Christopher Markus described Rogers as someone who is moving toward some sort of enlightened self interest McFeely knew Rogers was going to get his dance he promised Peggy Carter in The First Avenger He initially planned to complete Rogers s story arc by killing him off given the character s elongated life for his occupation before deciding to have Rogers abandoned his shield br br br Differences from the comic books br The origin story of Captain America follows that of the comic books particularly Ultimate Marvel for certain elements like growing up in Brooklyn and Bucky being a childhood best friend rather than being met later but diverges from there Rogers is also a founding Avenger unlike in the comics where he is a later addition to the roster and the formed Avengers are the ones who thaw him out of the ice In the comic books Steve Rogers is murdered at the event of the Civil War storyline leading to Bucky Barnes becoming the next Captain America In the MCU Rogers survives Civil War eventually passing the mantle of Captain America to Sam Wilson in Avengers Endgame In the comics Wilson became Captain America in after Rogers aging accelerated to be the real age of br br br Reception br br Evans portrayal of the character has been positively received by fans and critics Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel positively reviewed Evans performance as Steve Rogers writing that Evans brings a proper earnestness to the character Roger Ebert described the character as a hero we care about and who has some dimension Likewise in his review of Avengers Endgame Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal lauded both actor and character calling Chris Evans s effortlessly likable Steve Rogers Captain America the team s natural leader br Peter DeBruge writing for Variety had a more critical take finding that as Marvel heroes go Captain America must be the most vanilla of the lot and that because of his quick healing and fighting abilities there s never the slightest concern that the Nazis might get the better of him In Empire named Captain America the th greatest film character of all time In a December interview with Vanity Fair Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige called Evans a great actor and a reluctant star He compared his portrayal of Captain America with Christopher Reeve s Superman for the strong association between the actors and their respective characters br Rogers elderly appearance at the end of Avengers Endgame has been noted to resemble U S President Joe Biden which Evans acknowledged His quote No I don t think I will has also become the subject of several Internet memes br br br Accolades br br br See also br Captain America in other
