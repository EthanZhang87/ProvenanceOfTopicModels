the book br Etienne Marie Laure s great uncle died in the series In the book however he was put in prison and eventually got out and reunited with Marie Laure br Werner s extended backstory in the book from his childhood and training with the Nazi was condensed at the start of the series And near the end his role in saving Marie Laure was also significantly altered In the book he killed Reinhold von Rumpel to protect Marie Laure while in the series Werner helped Marie Laure by fighting Reinhold von Rumpel and distracting him from finding her but it s Marie at the end who managed to fatally shoot von Rumpel br Another key difference is the extended encounter and a moment of romance between the two main characters which did not happen in the book In the book Marie Laure and Werner met only for a short time after he saved her at her hideout and before he was captured by the Allied Soldiers In the series they instead had more than a few hours together at her place where they had a slow dance and a kiss Author Anthony Doerr has shared that over the years he had received feedbacks from lots of readers reflecting their disappointment at the brief encounter of the two main characters near the end of the story which had been built up throughout their separate storylines in the book He saw the miniseries as a remedy for this to the fans of the original story who wanted more br In addition the series ended after the teenaged Marie Laure threw the Sea of Flames stone into the ocean while in the book the storyline moved on to decades later when the old Marie Laure now over and once again living in Paris received the miniature house and the key that once belong to her back from Werner s sister With this major removal of the storyline in the later years Jutta Werner s sister therefore does not re appear and she and Marie Laure never cross path in the series br br br Reception br The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a approval rating with an average rating of based on critic reviews The website s critics consensus reads While All the Light We Cannot See has a bright cast its potential is often snuffed out by a tonally awkward blend of serious and silly Metacritic which uses a weighted average assigned a score of out of based on critics indicating generally unfavorable reviews br The decision to cast a legally blind actress to play the role of the main character Marie Laure was praised for its breakthrough representation of blind and low vision performers Critics also praised the casting choice of Aria Mia Loberti as Marie Laure and the visuals but felt it fell short of capturing the depth and nuance of the source material Particularly criticized were the characterization and dialogue with some feeling that the adaptation missed the mark in exploring the complexities of its Nazi affiliated protagonist br br br br br br External links br All the Light We Cannot See at IMDb br All the Light We Cannot See on Netflix
