and creation br The Hulk first appeared as a comic book character in The Incredible Hulk cover dated May written by Stan Lee penciled and co plotted by Jack Kirby and inked by Paul Reinman Lee cited influence from Frankenstein and Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in the Hulk s creation while Kirby recalled as inspiration the tale of a mother who rescues her child who is trapped beneath a car Lee gave the Hulk s alter ego the alliterative name Bruce Banner because he found he had less difficulty remembering alliterative names The Hulk was initially grey but coloring problems led to the creature being made green Banner and his alter ego appeared in a live action TV series and in a film that received mixed reviews with Marvel Studios regaining the film production rights for the character in February br In the mid s Kevin Feige realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the Avengers which now included Hulk Feige a self professed fanboy envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators Stan Lee and Jack Kirby had done with their comic books in the early s Louis Leterrier who had expressed interest in directing Iron Man was brought on board to direct with a screenplay by Zak Penn intended to serve as a loose sequel to the film but keeping the story closer to the comics and the television series David Duchovny was a front runner for the film and Leterrier s original choice for the role was Mark Ruffalo In April Edward Norton was hired to portray Banner and to rewrite Penn s screenplay in order to distance itself from the film and establish its own identity as a reboot although he would go uncredited for his writing Producer Gale Anne Hurd recalled Norton s portrayals of duality in Primal Fear and Fight Club while Norton reminded Kevin Feige of Bill Bixby who had played Banner in the TV series Lou Ferrigno who played the Hulk with Bixby remarked Norton has a similar physique and a similar personality Norton was a Hulk fan citing the first comic appearances the Bixby TV show and Bruce Jones run on the comic as his favorite depictions of the character He had expressed interest in the role for the first film He initially turned down the part recalling there was the wince factor or the defensive part of you that recoils at what the bad version of what that would be as he felt the previous film strayed far afield from a story that was familiar to people which is a fugitive story When he met Leterrier and Marvel he liked their vision and believed they were looking to him to guide the project During the New York Comic Con Leterrier publicly offered Ferrigno the chance to voice the Hulk for the film Originally the Hulk s only line was Betty at the film s ending which would have been his first word Leterrier was aware that fans wanted him to speak normally and added leave me alone and Hulk smash The latter line received cheers during a screening he attended br br Mark Ruffalo began his role as Banner Hulk in The Avengers after Feige said he chose not to bring back Norton Norton has since asserted that it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he wanted more diversity with his career and did not want to be associated with only one character Screen Rant has noted that in part due to the change in actors many forget that Incredible Hulk is even canon within the MCU In April despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel Feige confirmed to Collider that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film In a Q A session Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions were underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo s performance in The Avengers However Universal retained the distribution rights for The Incredible Hulk as well as the right of first refusal to distribute future Hulk films In September Feige while exploring all possible story options for a sequel film including a film based on the Planet Hulk and World War Hulk storylines stated everything in terms of stories from the comics is on the table Do I think Hulk can carry a movie and be as entertaining as he was in Avengers I do believe that I do believe he absolutely could We certainly are not even going to attempt that until Avengers So there s a lot of time to think about it br In June Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film saying I think they are for the first time entertaining the idea of it When we did The Avengers it was basically No and now there is some consideration for it But there s still nothing definitive not even a skeletal version of what it would be In July Feige stated that the studio was not considering a Planet Hulk film at that time due to wanting to feature Ruffalo s Banner in the film However he did not rule out a story that saw the Hulk and Banner end up in space and explained why a solo Hulk film did not occur in Phase Two of the MCU by saying After the first Avengers Iron Man had his own movie Thor had his own movie Captain America had his own movie and Widow and Fury were in The Winter Soldier So it was really about frankly saving somebody so that the only place you could get Hulk between Avengers movies is the next Avengers movie so director Joss Whedon could continue to play with that in Avengers Age of Ultron Where we go after that we ll see br In April Ruffalo noted that Universal holding the distribution rights to Hulk films may be an obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film and reiterated this in October and July According to The Hollywood Reporter a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with Paramount Pictures for the Iron Man Thor and Captain America films is that Universal holds the theme park rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel s parent company Disney wants for its own theme parks In December Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film The following month he indicated that the lack of a standalone Hulk film allowed the character to play a more prominent role in Thor Ragnarok Avengers Infinity War and Avengers Endgame stating We ve worked a really interesting arc into Thor Ragnarok Avengers Infinity War and Avengers Endgame for Banner that I think will when it s all added up will feel like a Hulk movie a standalone movie br Charles Pulliam Moore writing for Gizmodo said of the earlier MCU films that w hile there are a number of storylines from Marvel s comics that delve deeper into the duality of Banner Hulk s identity Marvel s movies have forgone those plot lines in favor of trotting Bruce out to babble about science and break things when necessary One specific difference from the comic books is Banner s involvement in the creation of Ultron and the Vision a character who in the comics was created solely by Ultron The Vision in the films is created as a counter to Ultron who had previously been created by Stark and Bruce Banner In the comics however Ultron is created by a different member of the Avengers Hank Pym br Due to the lack of freestanding films about the Hulk the character has been depicted in very few of the storylines shown in the comic books In particular the Planet Hulk storyline from the comic books is highly condensed and worked into Thor Ragnarok the comic book storyline has the heroes of Earth intentionally sending the Hulk into space due to his excessively dangerous nature while the MCU Hulk leaves Earth of his own accord The merged Banner Hulk storyline depicted in Avengers Endgame also differs from the comics where a comparable merger was accomplished by hypnosis performed by superhero psychiatrist Doc Samson In the MCU Banner accomplishes the merger by himself through experimentation with gamma radiation br br br Appearances br br br Film br Edward Norton portrays Bruce Banner in The Incredible Hulk with Lou Ferrigno providing the voice of the Hulk Mark Ruffalo took on the role of Banner in The Avengers where the voice of the Hulk was a mix of Ruffalo Ferrigno and few others though the Hulk s single line of dialogue Puny god was provided solely by Ruffalo Mike Seymour of FX Guide called Ruffalo s Hulk the most successful Hulk in comparison to the less than fully successful earlier attempts at digital Hulks Seymour explained Ang Lee s Hulk and Louis Leterrier s The Incredible Hulk both failed in producing a Hulk that could walk the digital tightrope of impressive near undefeatable strength huge body mass fast agile movement raw anger and likable performance He stated that on contrary Ruffalo s Hulk had both dynamic action sequences and crowd pleasing moments of humor and dialogue In order to achieve this Industrial Light Magic created a new motion capture and facial animation system Hulk s face was generated from a life cast scan of Ruffalo s face which was then manipulated in the program ZBrush to become the Hulk while making sure to retain Ruffalo s essence Ruffalo reprised the role in Iron Man Avengers Age of Ultron Thor Ragnarok Avengers Infinity War Captain Marvel Avengers Endgame and Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings br A sequel to The Incredible Hulk has been discussed with Marvel Studios having suggested a possible release after Avengers Age of Ultron due to the positive audience reception towards Ruffalo s portrayal of Banner in The Avengers Ruffalo is set to reprise his role in any future adaptation of the character In June Ruffalo said he believed the studio might be considering doing a new standalone Hulk film saying I think they are for the first time entertaining the idea of it When we did The Avengers it was basically No and now there is some consideration for it But there s still nothing definitive not even a skeletal version of what it would be In December Joss Whedon said despite the positive reception to Ruffalo a new solo Hulk film had not been announced because Marvel wished to have a character that only appears in Avengers films In April Ruffalo told Collider that Universal holding the distribution rights to Hulk films may be an obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures regained the film distribution rights to The Incredible Hulk and future solo Hulk films in June coinciding with the film s release on Disney br br br Television br Archival footage of the character appears in Glorious Purpose the first episode of the Disney television series Loki Ruffalo voices alternate versions of Banner in the Disney animated series What If Ruffalo reprised his role in She Hulk Attorney at Law br br br Other media br Ruffalo reprised his role as Bruce Banner in the non canon short film Team Thor br br br Characterization br For The Incredible Hulk Louis Leterrier stated that Edward Norton s rewrite of the script has given Bruce s story real gravitas explaining that just because we re making a superhero movie it doesn t have to just appeal to year old boys Ed and I both see superheroes as the new Greek gods In taking up the character for The Avengers Mark Ruffalo said He s a guy struggling with two sides of himself the dark and the light and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk I like that the part has those qualities Regarding the Hulk s place on the team Ruffalo said He s like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team He s a loose cannon It s like Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let s hope it turns out well br By Age of Ultron Ruffalo stated that his character had grown since the previous film and was a bit more complex with a confrontation brewing between Banner and the Hulk There s a very cool thing happening Hulk is as afraid of Banner as Banner is afraid of Hulk and they have got to come to peace somehow with each other While filming in London Ruffalo said that Whedon still had not given him any of the Hulk s lines Whedon later explained that he writes the Hulk s dialogue spontaneously saying What makes the Hulk so hard to write is that you re pretending he s a werewolf when he s a superhero You want it vice versa So the question is how has he progressed How can we bring changes on what the Hulk does And that s not just in the screenplay that s moment to moment When the character next appears in Thor Ragnarok two years have passed since Age of Ultron and Hulk has become a successful and popular gladiator on Sakaar having suppressed the Banner side in those years He is forming the vocabulary of a toddler with the level of Hulk s speech being a big conversation between director Taika Waititi and Marvel since it was taking into account future appearances for the character Ragnarok begins an arc for the character that continues in Avengers Infinity War and Avengers Endgame Ruffalo felt Hulk had a swagger in the film and was much more of a character than the green rage machine seen in the first two Avengers films br The Hulk only appears briefly at the beginning of Infinity War with Bruce Banner spending the film trying to reintegrate with the Avengers and to impress upon everybody how dangerous Thanos is Joe Russo felt the Hulk refusing to appear for much of the film was only partially because he was scared but also because he realizes that Banner only wants Hulk for fighting I think he s had enough of saving Banner s ass Russo added that this was really reflective of the journey from Ragnarok where these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control The difference between Hulk and Banner is intended to be shown as starting to blur a little bit Ruffalo described Hulk in Infinity War as having the mental capacity of a five year old Despite the lack of further standalone films Bruce and the Hulk have managed to eke out a character arc in the six years since The Avengers with Thor Ragnarok and Infinity War highlighting an ongoing battle for control of which persona will manifest expected to be resolved in Avengers Endgame In Avengers Endgame the Bruce Banner and the Hulk personalities are shown to have reconciled and merged into Professor Hulk who has the strength of the Hulk but the intelligence of Bruce Banner br br br Appearance and special effects br In filming The Incredible Hulk Leterrier cited Andy Serkis motion capture portrayals of Gollum and King Kong in The Lord of the Rings and King Kong respectively as the standard for which he was aiming Norton and Roth filmed takes of different movements the monsters would make such as the Hulk s thunder claps Phosphorescent face paint applied to the actors faces and strobe lighting would help record the most subtle mannerisms into the computer Others including Cyril Raffaelli provided motion capture for stunts and fights after the main actors had done video referencing Leterrier hired Rhythm and Hues to provide the CGI rather than Industrial Light Magic ILM who created the visual effects for Ang Lee s Hulk Visual effect company Image Engine spent over a year working on a shot where Banner s gamma irradiated blood falls through three factory floors into a bottle Overall effects shots were created Motion capture aided in placing and timing of movements but overall key frame animation by Rhythm and Hues provided the necessary finesse and superhero quality br Dale Keown s comic book artwork of the Hulk was an inspiration for his design Leterrier felt the first Hulk had too much fat and the proportions were a little off He explained The Hulk is beyond perfect so there is zero grams of fat all chiseled and his muscle and strength defines this creature so he s like a tank Visual effects supervisor Kurt Williams envisioned the Hulk s physique as a linebacker rather than a bodybuilder A height of nine feet was chosen for the character as they did not want him to be too inhuman To make him more expressive computer programs controlling the inflation of his muscles and saturation of skin color were created Williams cited flushing as an example of humans skin color being influenced by their emotions The animators felt green blood would make his skin become darker rather than lighter and his skin tones depending on lighting either resemble an olive or even gray slate His animation model was completed without the effects company s full knowledge of what he would be required to do he was rigged to do whatever they imagined in case the model was to be used for The Avengers film The Hulk s medium length hair was modeled on Mike Deodato s art He originally had a crew cut but Leterrier decided flopping hair imbued him with more character Leterrier cited An American Werewolf in London as the inspiration for Banner s transformation wanting to show how painful it was for him to change As a nod to the live action TV series Banner s eyes change color first when he transforms br The Avengers was the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk Ruffalo told New York magazine I m really excited No one s ever played the Hulk exactly they ve always done CGI They re going to do the Avatar stop action stop motion capture So I ll actually play the Hulk That ll be fun The D model used to create the Hulk s body was modeled after Long Island bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm while the Hulk s face was modeled after Ruffalo To create the on screen Hulk Ruffalo performed in a motion capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion capture HD cameras two full body two focused on his face captured his face and body movements ILM returned to create the digital Hulk Jeff White ILM s visual effects supervisor said We really wanted to utilize everything we ve developed the last years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him So much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance not only in motion capture and on set but down to his eyes his teeth and his tongue br For Thor Ragnarok ILM had to add much more detail to the character s facial features due to the Hulk s increased dialogue ILM visual effects supervisor Chad Wiebe explained that Ruffalo s expressions were captured fresh for the film using Medusa a performance capture technology With different expressions captured ILM built an entirely new library that would allow Hulk to cover a full range of normal human visual characteristics To help create the Hulk a person on set was covered in green body paint and would replicate the intended motions of the character to aid the visual effect artists Additionally stunt actor Paul Lowe who is under feet m tall stood in for Hemsworth during some of his interactions with the Hulk so that the Hulk s stunt men would be proportionally correct In some instances when Thor and the Hulk interacted a digital double was used for Thor also created by ILM to have greater flexibility for the shots ILM worked on all of the Hulk moments in the film outside the final fight sequence which was completed by Framestore using ILM s assets as Framestore was primarily responsible for rigging that sequence Framestore completed nearly shots which featured digital doubles of Thor and Hela Fenris Korg Miek the giant Surtur at the end of the film and over buildings for Asgard based on assets D Negative had from The Dark World resulting in over character vehicle prop and crowd rigs Taika Waititi also provided additional motion capture for the Hulk after Ruffalo had completed his scenes br With respect to Bruce Banner s regular appearance his fashion sense has been critiqued with the observation that in just about every appearance he s wearing a nondescript suit with a purple button down shirt By contrast Banner s Professor Hulk appearance in Avengers Endgame including his penchant for knit sweaters has been described as hot and sexy br br br Reception br Norton s performance as Banner received a generally positive reception Reviewing The Incredible Hulk Mark Rahner of The Seattle Times wrote that The relaunch of Marvel s green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee s ponderous Hulk in nearly every way except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game and he still barely talks Conversely Christy Lemire of the Associated Press found that the inevitable comparisons to Iron Man Marvel Studios first blockbuster this summer serve as a glaring reminder of what this Hulk lacks wit and heart Despite the presence of Edward Norton an actor capable of going just as deep as Robert Downey Jr we don t feel a strong sense of Bruce Banner s inner conflict br Mark Ruffalo s portrayal of Dr Bruce Banner the Hulk in The Avengers was well received by commentators Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast Ruffalo is the revelation turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano Similarly The New Yorker s Anthony Lane proclaimed Ruffalo s acting to be one of the film s highlights alongside Downey The Village Voice s Karina Longworth concluded Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd genius who in contrast to the preening hunks on the team knows better than to draw attention to himself Travers asserted that the actor resonated a scruffy warmth and humor vibe while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he s at war every moment with himself The film finally solves the Hulk problem He s a lot more fun in small doses br br br Accolades br br br See also br Characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe br Hulk in other
