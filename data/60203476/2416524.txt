CTV News is the news division of the CTV Television Network in Canada The name CTV News is also applied as the title of local and regional newscasts on the network s owned and operated stations O Os which are closely tied to the national news division Local newscasts on CTV are also branded as CTV News although in most cases they are managed separately from the newscasts on the main CTV network br br br National programs br br CTV s national news division produces the following programs which air on the main CTV network br br CTV National News the nightly newscasts anchored by Sandie Rinaldo early evening weekdays Omar Sachedina late evening weekdays and Heather Butts late evening weekends br Question Period a weekly news and interview series br The national news operation also produces a

operates the national hour news channel CTV News Channel and the hour national business news channel BNN Bloomberg both of which are available across Canada on cable and satellite br The news division produced the weekday morning news and entertainment program Canada AM from to October when responsibility for the program was transferred to Bell Media In House Productions the division responsible for CTV s other daytime lifestyle programming until the program s cancellation in June Canada AM s replacement Your Morning is produced by Bell Media Studios with news content provided by CTV News br

properties br br br Local programs br br In most markets local CTV News programs air at p m and p m CTV or p m CTV on weekdays In selected markets p m newscasts and weekend newscasts at p m and p m p m are also produced and several CTV stations in western Canada and some CTV Two stations in eastern Canada produce local morning newscasts under the title CTV Morning Live br In shortly following the merger of the CTV network with Baton Broadcasting local news branding on the CTV O Os was unified with network news presentation with newscast titles standardized under the format call sign News e g CFTO News for the Toronto station Prior to this the local O Os used various titles though one used in the late s by a number of stations was World Beat News for late afternoon broadcasts and Night Beat News for late night broadcasts By late the O Os local newscasts had been renamed CTV News Beginning in February local programs were rebranded using region specific on air titles such as CTV News Toronto br On November CTV replaced p m newscasts with an evening edition of CTV National News br On February Bell made major cuts to CTV s local newscasts All noon newscasts outside of Toronto were cut as well as weekend newscasts outside of Montreal Toronto and Ottawa Bell will also expand multimedia journalist models to Atlantic Canada Alberta Manitoba and Quebec br National aggregate ratings published by BBM Canada refer to the local broadcasts collectively as CTV Evening News CTV Late News CTV Noon News etc although these titles are not used on air Since most CTV affiliates are owned by the network CTV offers the opportunity to buy national ads on local programming across its O Os making these aggregate ratings useful for advertisers br Local CTV News programs are produced in the following markets br br Barrie CKVR br Calgary CFCN br Edmonton CFRN br Greater Sudbury CICI CTV Northern Ontario br Halifax CJCH CTV Atlantic br Kitchener CKCO br London CFPL br Montreal CFCF br Ottawa CJOH CHRO br Regina CKCK br Saskatoon CFQC br Toronto CFTO br Vancouver CIVT br Victoria CIVI br Winnipeg CKY br Windsor CHWI br CTV O Os in smaller markets air a newscast produced in one of the larger markets noted above although some may also produce a shorter local news insert aired during a break in the main market s program and some of these smaller stations produce their own noon newscasts br Through the purchase of CHUM Limited Bell Media acquired A News which produced local newscasts mainly in smaller markets or alternate areas of larger markets When the A system was rebranded as CTV Two on August and later CTV its newscasts switched to the CTV News branding likely because CTV Two News might be seen as connoting a second class newscast The CTV News broadcasts on the CTV stations previously used the main CTV logo as their logo bug during these newscasts as did the main CTV network but they currently use the regionally branded titles such as CTV News Barrie as is now the case for the CTV O Os Most of these stations are nevertheless required to separate their news operations from CTV stations in local and adjacent markets This restriction does not apply to the cable only channels CTV Two Atlantic which has been co owned with the local CTV stations since its launch their news operations have been fully integrated since and CTV Two Alberta which produces a current affairs program Alberta Primetime using resources from local CTV stations br Independent affiliates also air their own local newscasts such as NTV which despite dropping CTV s entertainment programming in still provides coverage of Newfoundland for CTV News and airs its national newscasts and CITL TV which airs Prime Time Local News a production shared with its sister station Global affiliate now Citytv affiliate CKSA TV br Bell Media also operates CP a regional news channel focusing on the Greater Toronto Area and most of Southern Ontario which was acquired through the purchase
