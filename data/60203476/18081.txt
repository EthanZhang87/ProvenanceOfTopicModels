port at nearby Chester began to silt up The Port of Liverpool became heavily involved in the Atlantic slave trade with the first slave ship departing from the town in The port also imported much of the cotton required by the neighbouring Lancashire textile mills and became a major departure point for English and Irish emigrants to North America In the th century Liverpool rose to global economic

earliest Chinese community in Europe and the first mosque in England br br br Toponymy br The name comes from the Old English lifer meaning thick or muddy water and p l meaning a pool or creek and is first recorded around as Liuerpul According to the Cambridge Dictionary of English Place Names The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained The place appearing as Leyrpole in a legal record of may also refer to Liverpool Other origins of the name have been suggested including elverpool a reference to the large number of eels in the Mersey The adjective Liverpudlian was first recorded in br Although the Old English origin of the name Liverpool is beyond dispute claims are sometimes made that the name Liverpool is of Welsh origin but these are without foundation The Welsh name for Liverpool is Lerpwl from a former English local form Leerpool This is a reduction of the form Leverpool with the loss of the intervocalic v seen in other English names and words e g Daventry Northamptonshire Danetry never do well ne er do well br In the th century some Welsh publications used the name Lle r Pwll the place of the pool a reinterpretation of Lerpwl probably in the belief that Lle r Pwll was the original form br Another name which is widely known even today is Llynlleifiad again a th century coining Llyn is pool but lleifiad has no obvious meaning G Melville Richards a pioneer of scientific toponymy in Wales in Place Names of North Wales does not attempt to explain it beyond noting that lleifiad is used as a Welsh equivalent of Liver br A derivative form of a learned borrowing into Welsh llaf of Latin l ma slough bog fen to give lleifiad is possible but unproven br br br History br br br Early history br In the Middle Ages Liverpool existed firstly as farmland within the West Derby Hundred before growing in to a small town of farmers fishermen and tradesmen and tactical army base for King John of England The town was planned with its own castle although due to outbreaks of disease and its subordinance to the nearby Roman port of Chester the town s growth and prosperity stagnated until the late th and early th centuries Substantial growth took place in the mid late th century when the town became the most heavily involved European port in the Atlantic slave trade br King John s letters patent of announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool then spelt as Liuerpul There is no evidence that the place had previously been a centre of any trade The creation of the borough was probably due to King John deciding it would be a convenient place to embark men and supplies for his Irish campaigns in particular John s Irish campaign of The original street plan of Liverpool is said to have been designed by King John near the same time it was granted a royal charter making it a borough The original seven streets were laid out in the shape of a double cross Bank Street now Water Street Castle Street Chapel Street Dale Street Juggler Street now High Street Moor Street now Tithebarn Street and Whiteacre Street now Old Hall Street Liverpool Castle was built before it survived until it was demolished in the s By the middle of the th century the population was still around although this was likely to have fallen from an earlier peak of people due to slow trade and the effects of the plague br In the th century there was slow progress in trade and population growth Battles for control of the town were waged during the English Civil War including a brief siege in In the same year as its first recorded slave ship Liverpool Merchant set sail for Africa Liverpool was made a parish by Act of Parliament But arguably the legislation of that reformed the Liverpool council was of more significance to its subsequent development Since Roman times the nearby city of Chester on the River Dee had been the region s principal port on the Irish Sea However as the Dee began to silt up maritime trade from Chester became increasingly difficult and shifted towards Liverpool on the neighbouring River Mersey The first of the Liverpool docks was constructed in and the system of docks gradually grew into a large interconnected system br As trade from the West Indies including sugar surpassed that of Ireland and Europe and as the River Dee continued to silt up Liverpool began to grow with increasing rapidity The first commercial wet dock was built in Liverpool in Substantial profits from the slave trade and tobacco helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow although several prominent local men including William Rathbone William Roscoe and Edward Rushton were at the forefront of the local abolitionist movement br br br th century br br The th century saw Liverpool rise to global economic importance Pioneering world first technology and civic facilities launched in the city to serve the accelerating population which was fuelled by an influx of ethnic and religious communities from all around the world br br By the start of the th century a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth In Liverpool and Manchester became the first cities to have an intercity rail link through the Liverpool and Manchester Railway The population continued to rise rapidly especially during the s when Irish migrants began arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the Great Famine While many Irish settled during this time in the city a large percentage also emigrated to the United States or moved to the industrial centres of Lancashire Yorkshire and the Midlands br In her poetical illustration Liverpool which celebrates the city s worldwide commerce Letitia Elizabeth Landon refers specifically to the Macgregor Laird expedition to the Niger River at that time in progress This is to a painting by Samuel Austin Liverpool from the Mersey br Britain was a major market for cotton imported from the Deep South of the United States which fed the textile industry in the country Given the crucial place cotton held in the city s economy during the American Civil War Liverpool was in the words of historian Sven Beckert the most pro Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself Liverpool merchants helped to bring out cotton from ports blockaded by the Union Navy built ships of war for the Confederacy and supplied br the South with military equipment and credit br During the war the Confederate Navy ship the CSS Alabama was built at Birkenhead on the Mersey and the CSS Shenandoah surrendered there being the final surrender at the end of the war The city was also the center of Confederate purchasing war materiel including arms and ammunition uniforms and naval supplies to be smuggled by British blockade runners to the South br For periods during the th century the wealth of Liverpool exceeded that of London and Liverpool s Custom House was the single largest contributor to the British Exchequer Liverpool was the only British city ever to have its own Whitehall office During this century at least of the world s entire trade passed through Liverpool br In the early th century Liverpool played a major role in the Antarctic sealing industry in recognition of which Liverpool Beach in the South Shetland Islands is named after the city br As early as the city was described as the New York of Europe During the late th and early th century Liverpool was attracting immigrants from across Europe This resulted in the construction of a diverse array of religious buildings in the city for the new ethnic and religious groups many of which are still in use today The Deutsche Kirche Liverpool Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas Gustav Adolf Church and Princes Road Synagogue were all established in the s to serve Liverpool s growing German Greek Nordic and Jewish communities respectively One of Liverpool s oldest surviving churches St Peter s Roman Catholic Church served the Polish community in its final years as a place of worship br br br th century br br The th century saw Liverpool s established rank as a global economic powerhouse challenged Its strategic location as an international seaport made it particularly vulnerable in two World wars Economic depressions both in the United Kingdom and across the world changing housing patterns and containerisation in the maritime industry contributed to a downtrend in the city s productivity and prosperity Despite this the city s influence on global popular culture excelled and by the end of the century the continuing process of urban renewal paved the way for the redefined modern city of the st century br The period after the Great War was marked by social unrest as society grappled with the massive war losses of young men as well as trying to re integrate veterans into civilian life and the economy Unemployment and poor living standards greeted many ex servicemen Union organising and strikes took place in numerous locations including a police strike in Liverpool among the City Police Numerous colonial soldiers and sailors from Africa and India who had served with the British Armed Forces settled in Liverpool and other port cities In June they were subject to attack by whites in racial riots residents in the port included Swedish immigrants and both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and housing In this period race riots also took place in other port cities br br The Housing Act resulted in mass council housing being built across Liverpool during the s and s In the s and s as much as of the city s population around people was relocated from the inner city to new purpose built lower density suburban housing estates based on the belief that this would improve their standard of living though the overall benefits have been contested Numerous private homes were also built during this era During the Great Depression of the early s unemployment peaked at around in the city Liverpool was the site of Britain s first provincial airport operating from br During the Second World War the critical strategic importance of Liverpool was recognised by both Hitler and Churchill The city was heavily bombed by the Germans suffering a blitz second only to London s The pivotal Battle of the Atlantic was planned fought and won from Liverpool br The Luftwaffe made air raids on Merseyside killing people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area Significant rebuilding followed the war including massive housing estates and the Seaforth Dock the largest dock project in Britain Since Liverpool has been twinned with Cologne Germany a city which also suffered severe aerial bombing during the war In the s and s much of the immediate reconstruction that took place in the city centre proved to be deeply unpopular The historic portions of the city that had survived German bombing suffered extensive destruction during urban renewal It has been argued that the so called Shankland Plan of the s named after the town planner Graeme Shankland led to compromised town planning and vast road building schemes that devastated and divided inner city neighbourhoods Concrete brutalist architecture compromised visions botched projects and grand designs that were never realised became the subject of condemnation Historian Raphael Samuel labelled Graeme Shankland the butcher of Liverpool br A significant West Indian black community has existed in the city since the first two decades of the th century Like most British cities and industrialised towns Liverpool became home to a significant number of Commonwealth immigrants beginning after World War I with colonial soldiers and sailors who had served in the area More immigrants arrived after World War II mostly settling in older inner city areas such as Toxteth where housing was less expensive The black population of Liverpool was recorded at in In the Census described themselves as black African Caribbean mixed white and black African mixed white and Caribbean or other black br br In the s Liverpool was the centre of the Merseybeat sound which became synonymous with the Beatles and fellow Liverpudlian rock bands Influenced by American rhythm and blues and rock music they also in turn strongly affected American music The Beatles became internationally known in the early s and performed around the world together they were and continue to be the most commercially successful and musically influential band in popular history Their co founder singer and composer John Lennon was killed in New York City in Liverpool Airport was renamed after him in the first British airport to be named in honour of an individual br Previously part of Lancashire and a county borough from Liverpool became a metropolitan borough within the newly created metropolitan county of Merseyside in From the mid s onwards Liverpool s docks and traditional manufacturing industries declined due to restructuring of shipping and heavy industry causing massive losses of jobs The advent of containerisation meant that the city s docks became largely obsolete and dock workers were made unemployed By the early s unemployment rates in Liverpool were among the highest in the UK standing at by January although this was about half the level of unemployment that had affected the city during the Great Depression some years previously During this period Liverpool became a hub of fierce left wing opposition to the central government in London Liverpool in the s has been labelled as Britain s shock city Once the second city of the British Empire which rivalled the capital city in global significance Liverpool had collapsed in to its nadir at the depths of post colonial post industrial Britain br In the late th century Liverpool s economy began to recover The late s saw the opening of a regenerated Albert Dock which proved to be a catalyst for further regeneration In the mid s the city enjoyed growth rates higher than the national average At the end of the th century Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration a process that continues today br br br st century br br Ongoing regeneration combined with the hosting of internationally significant events has helped to re purpose Liverpool as one of the most visited tourist

Nevertheless there are a few exceptions to local governance apart from these two structures Liverpool was administered by Merseyside County Council between and and some residual aspects of organisation which date back to this time have survived When the County Council was disbanded in most civic functions were transferred to Liverpool City Council However several authorities such as the

city s history The number of electoral wards in the city was doubled from to while the overall number of City Councillors up for election was reduced from to In future the council would also change to all out elections every four years whereby every single City Councillor would be eligible for re election at the same time The role of elected city mayor was also abolished and the Council reverted to

Scouser br Since the mid th century Scouser has become the predominant demonym for the inhabitants of Liverpool and is strongly associated with the Scouse accent and dialect of the city The Scouse

popularity and longevity br br Liverpoldon th century br Leeirpooltonian th Century br Liverpolitan th century br Liverpudlian th century to present br Professor Tony Crowley argues that up until the s inhabitants of Liverpool were generally referred to by a number of demonyms He argues that there was a debate in the mid th century between the two rival terms of Liverpolitan and Liverpudlian The debate surrounded the lexicology of these terms and their connotations of social class br Professor John Belchem suggests that a series of other nicknames such as Dick Liver Dicky Sam and whacker were used but gradually fell out of use Belchem and Philip Boland suggest that comedic radio presenters and entertainers brought the Liverpool identity to a national audience which in turn encouraged locals to be gradually more known as scousers By the time that Frank Shaw s My Liverpool a Celebration of Scousetown was published in Belchem argues that Scouser had firmly become the dominant demonym

Liverpool in the st century reverses a trend which took place between the s and when the population of the city proper effectively halved br At the United Kingdom census Liverpool s population reached an all time high of Following this peak in response to central government policy the Council authority of Liverpool then built and owned large several new town council estates in the suburbs within Liverpool s metropolitan area Tens of thousands of people were systematically relocated to new housing in areas such as Halton Knowsley St Helens Sefton Wirral Cheshire West and Chester West Lancashire Warrington and as far as North Wales br Such a mass relocation and population loss during this time was common practice for many British cities including London and Manchester In contrast satellite towns such as Kirkby Skelmersdale and Runcorn saw a corresponding rise in their populations Kirkby being the fastest growing town in Britain during the s br br br Urban and metropolitan area br Liverpool is typically grouped with the wider Merseyside plus Halton area for the purpose of defining its metropolitan footprint and there are several methodologies Sometimes this metropolitan area
