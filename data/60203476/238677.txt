prevents the Forellis from stealing his money and kills Lance for his betrayal before finally killing Sonny When Ken arrives to a scene of carnage Tommy quickly reassures him that everything is now fine as he has finally established himself as the undisputed crime kingpin of Vice City br br br Development br br Rockstar North s core person team led the eighteen month development of Grand Theft Auto Vice City Full production began in late as Grand Theft Auto III was nearing completion while early development only involved creating D models executive producer Sam Houser said it really kicked off at the beginning of and lasted about nine months After the release of the Windows version of Grand Theft Auto III the development team discussed creating a mission pack for the game that would add new weapons vehicles and missions Upon further discussion the team decided to make this concept a stand alone game which became Vice City The game was announced on May during the Electronic Entertainment Expo It was Rockstar North s most expensive game at the time with a budget of US million On September the company announced that the release date of October had been postponed until October to meet product demand By October development of Vice City stopped as the game was submitted for manufacturing It was released for the PlayStation on October in North America and on November in Europe Capcom published the game in Japan on May for PlayStation and Windows The game was added to the Rockstar Games Launcher in September br br br Setting br The game is set in in fictional Vice City which is based heavily on the city of Miami Vice City previously appeared in the original Grand Theft Auto the development team decided to reuse the location and incorporate ideas from within the studio and the fanbase They wanted to satirise a location that was not contemporary unlike Grand Theft Auto III s Liberty City The team wanted to choose a location that had various similarities and differences to New York City the inspiration of Liberty City eventually leading them to Miami which producer Leslie Benzies describes as a party town all sun and sea and sex but with that same dark edge underneath Sam Houser called it the grooviest era of crime because it didn t even feel like it was crime it was a totally topsy turvy back to front period of time The team intended to make Vice City a living breathing city for the player to feel like life still goes on while the character is inside a building br The game s look particularly the clothing and vehicles reflect its s setting Many themes are borrowed from the major films Scarface and Carlito s Way the latter for its characterisation and portrayal of nuanced criminals The television series Miami Vice was also a major influence and was regularly watched by the team throughout development Art director Aaron Garbut used the series as a reference point in creating neon lighting In recreating a s setting the team found it relatively painless due to the distinct culture of the time period and the team s familiarity of the era The art team was provided with large volumes of research as well as reference photographs from other members of the development team The team organised field research trips to Miami shortly after the development of Grand Theft Auto III splitting into small teams and observing the streets br br br Story and characters br br The team spent time solving the riddle of a speaking protagonist a notable departure from Grand Theft Auto III s silent protagonist Claude Ray Liotta portrayed protagonist Tommy Vercetti Liotta described the role as challenging You re creating a character that s not there before It s so intensive When recording the role the team used blue screen in order to allow Liotta to visualise how it s gonna move The team ensured that the player felt real affinity for Tommy making the narrative a key development interest Dan Houser described Tommy as strong and dangerous and prepared to wait for the right opportunity to arrive Director Navid Khonsari found Liotta occasionally difficult to work with In some sessions he was into it but then sometimes he was very dark and couldn t work said Sam Houser br The majority of the game s animations were original with only a few borrowed from Grand Theft Auto III For the characters the team used motion capture and stop motion animation techniques cutscenes use the former while gameplay movements use a combination of both techniques The team encountered difficulty in animating motorcycle animations due in part to the variety of models Pedestrian character models use skins in Vice City allowing the artists to produce more realistic characters There are unique pedestrian models throughout the game world alongside roughly story characters each character is rendered using twice the amount of polygons and textures found in Grand Theft Auto III This also impacted the character physics improving gameplay aspects such as weapon hit accuracy Some character models and scenarios were inspired by films such as The Godfather and the game s presentation was inspired by action television shows of the s The interplay between Tommy Vercetti and Lance Vance was crafted to be similar to the relationship of Miami Vice s Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs br br br Sound design and music production br The game features lines of recorded dialogue four times the amount in Grand Theft Auto III It contains over minutes of cutscenes and nine hours of music with more than songs and commercials The team was interested in the challenge of creating the game s soundtrack particularly in contrast to Grand Theft Auto III s music which Sam Houser described as clearly satirical and its own thing In developing the radio stations the team wanted to reinforce the game s setting by collating a variety of songs from the s and therefore performed extensive research The radio stations were published by Epic Records in seven albums known collectively as Grand Theft Auto Vice City Official Soundtrack Box Set alongside the game in October Vice City contains about three times as much talk radio as Grand Theft Auto III Producer and talk show host Lazlow Jones stated that the small percentage of station listeners that actually call in are insane in Vice City the team bumped it up a notch emphasising the extremity Dan Houser felt that the talk stations give depth to the game world br br br Reception br br br Critical response br br Grand Theft Auto Vice City was released to critical acclaim

making it one of the best selling PlayStation games br br br Controversies br Similar to its predecessors Vice City generated several controversies It has been labelled as violent and explicit and is considered highly controversial by many special interest groups Peter Hartlaub of SFGate noted the game s mindless violence but simply attributed it to the developers attempt to achieve accuracy Jeremy Pope who worked on various Rockstar games including Vice City vowed never to work on violent games again due to their portrayal in mainstream media In Australia the game was pre edited to receive an MA classification an uncensored version was released in the region in retaining its classification br br In November the Haitian Centers Council and Haitian Americans for Human Rights staged a protest in New York publicly criticising the game contending that it invited the player to harm Haitian immigrants and claiming that it depicted Haitians as thugs thieves and drug dealers In response Rockstar issued a press release apologising and acknowledging the concern but insisted that the violence should be taken within the context of the game which also contains violence towards other ethnic groups When New York mayor Michael Bloomberg threatened distributor Take Two Interactive with legal action the company apologised and removed offensive statements from future copies of the game In January North Miami s majority Haitian American council filed an ordinance to ban the selling or renting of violent games to anyone under without parental permission The proposal apparently sparked by Vice City was supported by North Miami mayor Josaphat Celestin who stated We don t believe the First Amendment was written to protect those who want to incite violence The case was later downgraded from federal court to state court br On June year old Devin Moore shot and killed two Alabamian police officers and a dispatcher before fleeing in a patrol car he was later apprehended In statements to police Moore reportedly said Life is like a video game Everybody s got to die sometime A million lawsuit was filed against Rockstar Games Take Two Interactive Sony Computer Entertainment GameStop and Wal Mart claiming that Moore frequently played Vice City and that his experience with the game led him to commit the crimes The plaintiffs attorney Jack Thompson

conduct In March the Supreme Court rejected an appeal by the defendants to dismiss the case br In September Thompson brought another million lawsuit against Cody Posey Rockstar Games Take Two Interactive and Sony Computer Entertainment The lawsuit claimed that year old Posey played the game obsessively before murdering his father stepmother and stepsister on a ranch in Hondo New Mexico

played Vice City The case was dismissed in December as New Mexico held no jurisdiction over Sony or Take Two br In July the Psychic Readers Network PRN sued Rockstar over the character named Auntie Poulet alleging similarities between the character and Youree Harris who voiced the character Brandon J Huffman a lawyer for Odin Law and Media noted that PRN s lawsuit faced challenges due to the timing of the lawsuit as the Eleventh Circuit s statute of limitations for copyright infringement is three years the lawsuit was filed almost years after the game s release Huffman added that Take Two
