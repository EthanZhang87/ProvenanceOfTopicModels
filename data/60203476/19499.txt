been compared to Whitney Houston whom she has also cited as an influence Carey and her peers according to Garry Mulholland are the princesses of wails virtuoso vocalists who blend chart oriented pop with mature MOR torch song Author and writer Lucy O Brien attributed the comeback of Barbra Streisand s old fashioned showgirl to Carey and Celine Dion and described them and Houston as groomed airbrushed and overblown to perfection Carey s musical transition and use of more revealing clothing during the late s were in part initiated to distance herself from this image and she subsequently said that most of her early work was schmaltzy MOR Some have noted that unlike Houston and Dion Carey writes and produces her own music br br br Musical style br br Love is the subject of the majority of Carey s lyrics although she has written about themes such as loss sex race abuse and spirituality She has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical but Time magazine s Christopher John Farley wrote If only Mariah Carey s music had the drama of her life Her songs are often sugary and artificial NutraSweet soul But her life has passion and conflict applying it to the first stages of her career He commented that as her albums progressed so too her songwriting and music blossomed into more mature and meaningful material Jim Faber of the New York Daily News made similar comments For Carey vocalizing is all about the performance not the emotions that inspired it Singing to her represents a physical challenge not an emotional unburdening While reviewing Music Box Stephen Holden from Rolling Stone commented that Carey sang with sustained passion while Arion Berger of Entertainment Weekly wrote that during some vocal moments Carey becomes too overwhelmed to put her passion into words In The Village Voice wrote that Carey s Strawberry Shortcake soul still provides the template with which teen pop cuties draw curlicues around those centerless Diane Warren ballads br Following Carey s divorce with Tommy Mottola Carey broke free of adult contemporary arrangements in favor of what Alex Macpherson of The Guardian described as a lovingly crafted hip hop inflected quiet storm Carey often records her layered background vocals which has been described as a swooning bank of a hundred Mariahs The singer claims that it s because I started out as a backup singer and doing sessions as a background vocalist learning from some of the greatest background vocalists and also people like Luther Vandross Growing up I admired his texture in and of itself but also his use of background vocals David Foster stated that Carey thinks like a record producer and lays her vocals down like a virtuoso guitarist Carey s songwriting is noted for its eccentric verbosity Jeffrey Ingold of Vice argues that her lyrics are among the most verbose in pop music br Carey s output makes use of electronic instruments such as drum machines keyboards and synthesizers Many of her songs contain piano driven melodies as she was given piano lessons at age six Carey said that she cannot read sheet music and prefers to collaborate with a pianist when composing her material but feels that it is easier to experiment with faster and less conventional melodies and chord progressions using this technique While Carey learned to play the piano at a young age and incorporates several ranges of production and instrumentation into her music she has maintained that her voice has always been her most important asset My voice is my instrument it always has been br Carey began commissioning remixes of her material early in her career and helped to spearhead the practice of recording entirely new vocals for remixes Disc jockey David Morales has collaborated with Carey on several occasions

hip hop and house producers to re structure her album compositions Entertainment Weekly included two remixes of Fantasy on a list of Carey s greatest recordings compiled in a National Dance Music Award winning remix produced by Morales and a Sean Combs production featuring rapper Ol Dirty Bastard The latter has been credited with popularizing the R B hip hop collaboration trend that has

to come up with something with you br In an article in The New York Times writer David Browne discusses how the once ubiquitous melisma pop style was heavily popularized by singers such as Carey Browne commented beginning in melisma overtook pop in a way it hadn t before Mariah Carey s debut hit from Vision of Love set the bar insanely high for notes stretched louder longer and knottier than most pop fans had ever heard Browne further added A subsequent generation of singers including Ms Aguilera Jennifer Hudson and Beyonc built their careers around melisma Men like Brian McKnight and Tyrese also indulged in it but women tended to dominate the form br br br Voice and timbre br Carey possesses a five octave vocal range Referred to as the Songbird Supreme by the Guinness World Records due to her ability to sing in the whistle register she was ranked as the greatest singer of the past twenty years in a MTV online poll Carey said of the result What it really means is voice of the MTV generation Of course it s an enormous compliment but I don t feel that way about myself In Rolling Stone named her the fifth greatest singer of all time and the architect of modern pop br Regarding her type of voice several critics have described her as a lyric coloratura soprano or just a soprano Jon Pareles of The New York Times described Carey s lower register as a rich husky alto that extends to dog whistle high notes She once described herself as an alto singer Sasha Frere Jones of The New Yorker adds her timbre on Vision of Love possesses various colors stating Carey s sound changes with nearly every line mutating from a steely tone to a vibrating growl and then to a humid breathy coo In an analysis of Carey s voice for ClassicFM singer Catherine Bott claims that Carey s chest voice could go up higher in pitch than any classical singer that I ve ever met br Her sense of pitch is admired and Jon Pareles adds she can linger over sensual turns growl with playful confidence syncopate like a scat singer with startlingly exact pitch Carey claims that she has had nodules on her vocal cords since childhood enabling her to sing in a higher register than others However tiredness and sleep deprivation can affect them due to the nodules and Carey explained that she went through a lot of practice as a child to maintain a balance during singing Carey is noted for her vocal improvisation skills br Towards the late s she began incorporating breathy vocals into her material Tim Levell from BBC News described her vocals as sultry close to the mic breathiness while USA Today s Elysa Gardner wrote it s impossible to deny the impact her vocal style a florid blend of breathy riffing and resonant belting has had on today s young pop and R B stars In an interview Ron Givens of Entertainment Weekly described it this way first a rippling soulful ooh comes rolling effortlessly from her throat alto Then after a quick breath she goes for the stratosphere with a sound that nearly changes the barometric pressure in the room In one brief swoop she seems to squeal and roar at the same time br Alex Macpherson of The Guardian noted that Carey s voice on Butterfly is an instrument of texture rather than volume with pillows of lavishly layered vocals and nuanced phrasing magnifying the emotional intensity of the songs Randy Jackson said that It s in the tone that buttery tone that she has with her voice that is unbelievably amazing and unbelievably identifiable br br br Stage performances and videos br br Despite being called a show stopper and

issues she returned to the stage a year later and according to Time effectively redeemed herself br Carey is known for being very static during her live performances Some reviewers credited her stage fright and lack of confidence as the reasoning while others pointed out that her performances focus on her vocals and the quality of her songs Her onstage hand gesticulations have usually been mimicked as the singer has a tendency for using her hands to point flutter and sweep through the air as she deftly crests each run When reviewing Carey s concert Michael Lallo wrote that If you re Mariah you stroke your hair a lot When a high note is on the horizon you brace yourself by touching your ear and adopting a pained expression provoking the crowd into losing its collective mind br Carey had been open about the fact that she had not been happy with some of her early music videos and has subsequently been noted for self directing and co producing her subsequent videography The
