state by land area With over seven million residents as of it is the most populous state in New England the th most populous in the country and the third most densely populated after New Jersey and Rhode Island br Massachusetts was a site of early English colonization The Plymouth Colony was founded in by the Pilgrims of the Mayflower In the Massachusetts Bay Colony taking its name from the Indigenous Massachusett people also established settlements in Boston and Salem In the town of Salem and surrounding areas experienced one of America s most infamous cases of mass hysteria the Salem witch trials In the late th century Boston became known as the Cradle of Liberty for the agitation there that later led to the American Revolution In Shays Rebellion a populist revolt led by disaffected American Revolutionary War veterans influenced the United States Constitutional Convention Originally dependent on agriculture fishing and trade Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution Before the American Civil War the state was a center for the abolitionist temperance and transcendentalist movements During the th century the state s economy shifted from manufacturing to services and in the st century Massachusetts has become the global leader in biotechnology and also excels in artificial intelligence engineering higher education finance and maritime trade br The state s capital and most populous city as well as its cultural and financial center is Boston Other major cities are Worcester Springfield and Cambridge Massachusetts is also home to the urban core of Greater Boston the largest metropolitan area in New England and a region profoundly influential upon American history academia and the research economy

developed and wealthiest U S states ranking first in the percentage of population and over with either a bachelor s degree or advanced degree first on both the American Human Development Index and the standard Human Development Index first in per capita income and as of first in median income Consequently Massachusetts typically ranks as the top U S state as well as the most expensive state for residents to live in br br br Etymology br The Massachusetts Bay Colony was named after the Indigenous population the Massachusett or Muhsachuweesut whose name likely derived from a W pan ak word muswachasut segmented as mus y big wach mountain s diminutive ut locative This word has been translated as near the great hill by the blue hills at the little big hill or at the range of hills in reference to the Blue Hills namely the Great Blue Hill located on the boundary of Milton and Canton Massachusett has also been represented as Moswetuset This comes from the name of the Moswetuset Hummock meaning hill shaped like an arrowhead in Quincy where Plymouth Colony commander Myles Standish a hired English military officer and Squanto a member of the Patuxet band of the Wamponoag people who have since died off due to contagious diseases brought by colonizers met Chief Chickatawbut in br Although the designation Commonwealth forms part of the state s official name it has no practical implications in modern times and Massachusetts has the same position and powers within the United States as other states John Adams may have chosen the word in for the second draft of what became the Massachusetts Constitution unlike the word state the word commonwealth had the connotation of a republic at the time This was in contrast to the monarchy the former colonies were fighting against during the American Revolutionary War The name State of Massachusetts Bay appeared in the first draft which was ultimately rejected It was also chosen to include the Cape Islands in reference to Martha s Vineyard and Nantucket from to they were seen as additional and separate entities confined within the Commonwealth br br br History br br br Pre colonization br Massachusetts was originally inhabited by tribes of the Algonquian language family including Wampanoag Narragansett Nipmuc Pocomtuc Mahican and Massachusett While cultivation of crops like squash and corn were an important part of their diet the people of these tribes hunted fished and searched the forest for most of their food Villagers lived in lodges called wigwams as well as longhouses Tribes were led by male or female elders known as sachems br br br Colonial period br br In the early s European colonizers caused virgin soil epidemics such as smallpox measles influenza and perhaps leptospirosis in what is now known as the northeastern region of the United States Between and a disease that was most likely smallpox killed approximately of the Massachusetts Bay Native Americans br The first English colonizers in Massachusetts Bay Colony landed with Richard Vines and spent the winter in Biddeford Pool near Cape Porpoise after the State of Maine in The Puritans arrived at Plymouth in This was the second permanent English colony in the part of North America that later became the United States after the Jamestown Colony The First Thanksgiving was celebrated by the Puritans after their first harvest in the New World and lasted for three days They were soon followed by other Puritans who colonized the Massachusetts Bay Colony now known as Boston in br The Puritans believed the Church of England needed to be further reformed along Protestant Calvinist lines and experienced harassment due to the religious policies of King Charles I and high ranking churchmen such as William Laud who would become Charles s Archbishop of Canterbury whom they feared were re introducing Romish elements to the national church They decided to colonize to Massachusetts intending to establish what they considered an ideal religious society The Massachusetts Bay Colony was colonized under a royal charter unlike the Plymouth colony in Both religious dissent and expansionism resulted in several new colonies being founded shortly after Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay elsewhere in New England The Massachusetts Bay banished dissenters such as Anne Hutchinson and Roger Williams due to religious and political conflict In Williams colonized what is now known as Rhode Island and Hutchinson joined him there several years later Religious intolerance continued and among those who objected to this later that century were the English Quaker preachers Alice and Thomas Curwen who were publicly flogged and imprisoned in Boston in br By Massachusetts had expanded inland significantly The Commonwealth acquired the Connecticut River Valley settlement of Springfield which had recently disputed with and defected from its original administrators the Connecticut Colony This established Massachusetts s southern border in the west However this became disputed territory until due to surveying problems leading to the modern Southwick Jog br br In the Massachusetts General Court authorized Boston silversmith John Hull to produce local coinage in shilling sixpence and threepence denominations to address a coin shortage in the colony Before that point the colony s economy had been entirely dependent on barter and foreign currency including English Spanish Dutch Portuguese and counterfeit coins In shortly after the restoration of the British monarchy the British government considered the Boston mint to be treasonous However the colony ignored the English demands to cease operations until at least when Hull s contract as mintmaster expired and the colony did not move to renew his contract or appoint a new mintmaster The coinage was a contributing factor to the revocation of the Massachusetts Bay Colony charter in br In the colonies of Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth were united along with present day Maine which had previously been divided between Massachusetts and New York into the Province of Massachusetts Bay Shortly after the new province s first governor William Phips arrived The Salem witch trials also took place where a number of men and women were hanged for alleged witchcraft br The most destructive earthquake known to date in New England occurred on November causing considerable damage across Massachusetts br br br The Revolutionary War br br Massachusetts was a center of the movement for independence from Great Britain Colonists in Massachusetts had long had uneasy relations with the British monarchy including open rebellion under the Dominion of New England in the s Protests against British attempts to tax the colonies after the French and Indian War ended in led to the Boston Massacre in and the Boston Tea Party escalated tensions In the Intolerable Acts targeted Massachusetts with punishments for the Boston Tea Party and further decreased local autonomy increasing local dissent Anti Parliamentary activity by men such as Samuel Adams and John Hancock followed by reprisals by the British government were a primary reason for the unity of the Thirteen Colonies and the outbreak of the American Revolution in br br The Battles of Lexington and Concord fought in Massachusetts in initiated the American Revolutionary War George Washington later the first president of the future country took over what would become the Continental Army after the battle His first victory was the siege of Boston in the winter of after which the British were forced to evacuate the city The event is still celebrated in Suffolk County only every March as Evacuation Day br On the coast Salem became a center for privateering Although the documentation is incomplete about letters of marque issued on a per voyage basis were granted during the American Revolution Nearly vessels were commissioned as privateers which were credited with capturing or destroying about British ships br br br Federal period br br Bostonian John Adams known as the Atlas of Independence was highly involved in both separation from Britain and the Constitution of Massachusetts which effectively the Elizabeth Freeman and Quock Walker cases as interpreted by William Cushing made Massachusetts the first state to abolish slavery David McCullough points out that an equally important feature was its placing for the first time the courts as a co equal branch separate from the executive The Constitution of Vermont adopted in represented the first partial ban on slavery among the states Vermont became a state in but did not fully ban slavery until with the Vermont Personal Liberty Law The Pennsylvania Gradual Abolition Act of made Pennsylvania the first state to abolish slavery by statute the second English colony to do so the first having been the Colony of Georgia in Later Adams was active in early American foreign affairs and succeeded Washington as the second president of the United States His son John Quincy Adams also from Massachusetts would go on to become the nation s sixth president br From to an armed uprising led by Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays now known as Shays Rebellion wrought havoc throughout Massachusetts and ultimately attempted to seize the federal Springfield Armory The rebellion was one of the major factors in the decision to draft a stronger national constitution to replace the Articles of Confederation On February Massachusetts became the sixth state to ratify the United States Constitution br br br th century br br In Maine separated from Massachusetts and entered the Union as the rd state due to the ratification of the Missouri Compromise br br During the th century Massachusetts became a national leader in the American Industrial Revolution with factories around cities such as Lowell and Boston producing textiles and shoes and factories around Springfield producing tools paper and textiles The state s economy transformed from one based primarily on agriculture to an industrial one initially making use of water power and later the steam engine to power factories Canals and railroads were being used in the state for transporting raw materials and finished goods At first the new industries drew labor from Yankees on nearby subsistence farms though they later relied upon immigrant labor from Europe and Canada br Although Massachusetts was the first slave holding colony with slavery dating back to the early s the state became a center of progressivist and abolitionist anti slavery activity in the years leading up to the American Civil War Horace Mann made the state s school system a national model Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson both philosophers and writers from the state also made major contributions to American philosophy Furthermore members of the transcendentalist movement within the state emphasized the importance of the natural world and emotion to humanity br Although significant opposition to abolitionism existed early on in Massachusetts resulting in anti abolitionist riots between and abolitionist views there gradually increased throughout the next few decades Abolitionists John Brown and Sojourner Truth lived in Springfield and Northampton respectively while Frederick Douglass lived in Boston and Susan B Anthony in Adams The works of such abolitionists contributed to Massachusetts s actions during the Civil War Massachusetts was the first state to recruit train and arm a Black regiment with White officers the th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment In Massachusetts became the first state to pass compulsory education laws br br br th century br Although the U S stock market had sustained steep losses the last week in October Tuesday October is remembered as the beginning of the Great Depression The Boston Stock Exchange drawn into the whirlpool of panic selling that beset the New York Stock Exchange lost over percent of its value in two days of frenzied trading The BSE nearly years old at the time had helped raise the capital that had funded many of the Commonwealth s factories railroads and businesses Governor of Massachusetts Frank G Allen appointed John C Hull the first Securities Director of Massachusetts Hull would assume office in January and his term would end in br With the departure of several manufacturing companies the state s industrial economy began to decline during the early th century By the s competition from the American South and Midwest followed by the Great Depression led to the collapse of the three main industries in Massachusetts textiles shoemaking and precision mechanics This decline would continue into the latter half of the th century Between and the number of Massachusetts residents involved in textile manufacturing declined from to The closure of the Springfield Armory in particular spurred an exodus of high paying jobs from Western Massachusetts which suffered greatly as it de industrialized during the century s last years br Massachusetts manufactured percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II ranking tenth among the states After the world war the economy of eastern Massachusetts transformed from one based on heavy industry into a service based economy Government contracts private investment and research facilities led to a new and improved industrial climate with reduced unemployment and increased per capita income Suburbanization flourished and by the s the Route Interstate corridor was dotted with high tech companies who recruited graduates of the area s many elite institutions of higher education br In the state received federal funding for the Central Artery Tunnel Project Commonly known as the Big Dig it was at the time the biggest federal highway project ever approved The project included making the Central Artery part of Interstate into a tunnel under downtown Boston in addition to the re routing of several other major highways The project was often controversial with numerous claims of graft and mismanagement and with its initial price tag of billion increasing to a final tally of over billion Nonetheless the Big Dig nonetheless changed the face of Downtown Boston and connected areas that were once divided by elevated highway Much of the raised old Central Artery was replaced with the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway The project also improved traffic conditions along several routes br br br Notable th century politicians br br The Kennedy family was prominent in th century Massachusetts politics The children of businessman and ambassador Joseph P Kennedy Sr included John F Kennedy who was a senator and U S

smallest state in the United States It is located in the New England region of the Northeastern United States It has an area of square miles km of which is water Several large bays distinctly shape its coast Boston is the largest city at the inmost point of Massachusetts Bay and the mouth of the Charles River br Despite its small size Massachusetts features numerous topographically distinctive regions The large coastal plain of the Atlantic Ocean in the eastern section of the state contains Greater Boston along with most of the state s population as well as the distinctive Cape Cod peninsula To the west lies the hilly rural region of Central Massachusetts and beyond that the Connecticut River Valley Along the western border of Western Massachusetts lies the highest elevated part of the state the Berkshires forming a portion of the northern terminus of the Appalachian Mountains br The U S National Park Service administers a number of natural and historical sites in Massachusetts Along with twelve national historic sites areas and corridors the National Park Service also manages the Cape Cod National Seashore and the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area In addition the Department of Conservation and Recreation maintains a number of parks trails and beaches throughout Massachusetts br br br Ecology br The primary biome of inland Massachusetts is temperate deciduous forest br Although much of Massachusetts had been cleared for agriculture leaving only traces of old growth forest in isolated pockets secondary growth has regenerated in many rural areas as farms have been abandoned Forests cover around of Massachusetts The areas most affected by human development include the Greater Boston area in the east and the Springfield metropolitan area in the west although the latter includes agricultural areas throughout the Connecticut River Valley There are endangered species in Massachusetts br A number of species are doing well in the increasingly urbanized Massachusetts Peregrine falcons utilize office towers in larger cities as nesting areas and the population of coyotes whose diet may include garbage and roadkill has been increasing in recent decades White tailed deer raccoons wild turkeys and eastern gray squirrels are also found throughout Massachusetts In more rural areas in the western part of Massachusetts larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture br Massachusetts is located along the Atlantic Flyway a major route for migratory waterfowl along the eastern coast Lakes in central Massachusetts provide habitat for many species of fish and waterfowl but some species such as the common loon are becoming rare A significant population of long tailed ducks winter off Nantucket Small offshore islands and beaches are home to roseate terns and are important breeding areas for the locally threatened piping plover Protected areas such as the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge provide critical breeding habitat for shorebirds and a variety of marine wildlife including a large population of grey seals Since there has been a significant increase in the number of Great white sharks spotted and tagged in the coastal waters off of Cape Cod br Freshwater fish species in Massachusetts include bass carp catfish and trout while saltwater species such as Atlantic cod haddock and American lobster populate offshore waters Other marine species include Harbor seals the endangered North Atlantic right whales as well as humpback whales fin whales minke whales and Atlantic white sided dolphins br The European corn borer a significant agricultural pest was first found in North America near Boston Massachusetts in br br br Climate br Most of Massachusetts has a humid continental climate with cold winters and warm summers Far southeast coastal areas are the broad transition zone to Humid Subtropical climates The warm to hot summers render the oceanic climate rare in this transition only applying to exposed coastal areas such as on the peninsula of Barnstable County The climate of Boston is quite representative for the commonwealth characterized by summer highs of around F C and winter highs of F C and is quite wet Frosts are frequent all winter even in coastal areas due to prevailing inland winds Boston has a relatively sunny climate for a coastal city at its latitude averaging over hours of sunshine a year br br br Environmental issues br br br Climate change br br Climate change in Massachusetts will affect both urban and rural environments including forestry fisheries agriculture and coastal development The Northeast is projected to warm faster than global average temperatures by according to the U S Global Change Research Program the Northeast is projected to be more than F C warmer on average than during the preindustrial era As of August the EPA reports that Massachusetts has warmed by over two degrees Fahrenheit or degrees Celsius br Shifting temperatures also result in the shifting of rainfall patterns and the intensification of precipitation events To that end average precipitation in the Northeast United States has risen by ten percent from to and the number of heavy precipitation events has increased by seventy percent during that time These increased precipitation patterns are focused in the winter and spring Increasing temperatures coupled with increasing precipitation will result in earlier snow melts and subsequent drier soil in the summer months br The shifting climate in Massachusetts will result in a significant change to the state s built environment and ecosystems In Boston alone costs of climate change related storms will result in to billion in damage br Warmer temperatures will also disrupt bird migration and flora blooming With these changes deer populations are expected to increase resulting in a decrease in underbrush which smaller fauna use as camouflage Additionally rising temperatures will increase the number of reported Lyme disease cases in the state Ticks can transmit the disease once temperatures reach degrees so shorter winters will increase the window of transmission These warmer temperatures will also increase the prevalence of Asian tiger mosquitoes which often carry the West Nile virus br To fight this change the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs has outlined a path to decarbonize the state s economy On April Kathleen A Theoharides the state s Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs released a Determination of Statewide Emissions limits for In her letter Theoharides stresses that as of the Commonwealth has experienced property damage attributable to climate change of more than billion To ensure that the Commonwealth experiences warming no more than C of pre industrialization levels the state will work towards two goals by to achieve net zero emissions and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by percent overall br br br Power Initiatives br br The State of Massachusetts has developed a plethora of incentives to encourage the implementation of renewable energy and efficient appliances and home facilities The Mass Save program formed in conjunction with the State by several companies that provide power and gas in Massachusetts provides homeowners and renters with monetary incentives to retrofit their homes with efficient HVAC equipment and other household appliances Appliances such as water heaters air conditioners washers and driers and heat pumps are eligible for rebates in order to incentivize change br The concept of Mass Save was created in by the passing of the Green Communities Act of during Deval Patrick s tenure as governor The main goal of the Green Communities Act was to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels in the State and to encourage new more efficient technologies Among others one result of this act was a requirement for Program Administrators of utilities to invest in saving energy as opposed to purchasing and generating additional energy where economically feasible In Massachusetts eleven Program Administrators including Eversource National Grid Western Massachusetts Electric Cape Light Compact Until and Berkshire Gas jointly own the rights to this program in conjunction with the MA Department of Energy Resources DOER and the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council EEAC br The State Revenue Service provides incentives for the installation of solar panels In addition to the Federal Residential Renewable energy credit Massachusetts residents may be eligible for a tax credit of up to percent of the project Once installed arrays are eligible for net metering Certain municipalities will offer up to per watt up to percent of the system s cost on PV arrays kW or less The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources also offered low interest fixed rate financing with loan support for low income residents until December br As a part of the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources effort to incentivize the usage of renewable energy the Massachusetts Offers Rebates for Electric Vehicles MOR EV initiative was created With this incentive residents may qualify for a state provided incentive of up to for the purchase or lease of an electric vehicle or for the purchase or lease of a plug in hybrid vehicle This rebate is available in addition to the tax credits offered by the United States Department of Energy for the purchase of electric and plug in hybrid vehicles br For income eligible residents Mass Save has partnered with Massachusetts Community Action Program Agencies and Low Income Energy Affordability Network LEAN to offer residents assistance with upgrades to their homes that will result in more efficient energy usage Residents may qualify for a replacement of their heating system insulation installation appliances and thermostats if they meet the income qualifications provided on Mass Save s website For residents of family residential buildings there are additional income restricted benefits available through LEAN If at least percent of the residents of the building qualify as low income energy efficiency improvements like those available through Mass Save are available Residential structures operated by non profit organizations for profit operations or housing authorities may take advantage of these programs br In late the administration of Massachusetts governor Charlie Baker released a decarbonization roadmap to aim for net zero greenhouse gas emissions by The plan calls for major investments in offshore wind and solar energy It would also require all new cars sold in the state to be zero emissions electric or hydrogen powered by br br br Demographics br br At the U S census Massachusetts had a population of over million a increase since the United States Census As of Massachusetts was estimated to be the third most

Natick br Like the rest of the Northeastern United States the population of Massachusetts has continued to grow in the late th and early st centuries Massachusetts is the fastest growing state in New England and the th fastest growing state in the United States Population growth has been driven primarily by the relatively high quality of life and a large higher education system br Foreign immigration is also a factor in the state s population growth causing the state s population to continue to grow as of the census particularly in Massachusetts gateway cities where costs of living are lower Forty percent of foreign immigrants were from Central or South America according to a Census Bureau study with many of the remainder from Asia Many residents who have settled in Greater Springfield claim Puerto Rican descent Many areas of Massachusetts showed relatively stable population trends between and Exurban Boston and coastal areas grew the most rapidly while Berkshire County

congregations of the Unitarian Universalist Association The headquarters of the Unitarian Universalist Association long located on Beacon Hill is now located in South Boston Many Puritan descendants also dispersed to other Protestant denominations Some disaffiliated along with Roman Catholics and other Christian groups in the wake of modern secularization br As of the Pew study Christians made up of the state s population with Protestants making up of them Roman Catholics made up and now predominate because of massive immigration from primarily Catholic countries and regions chiefly Ireland Italy Poland Portugal Quebec and Latin America Both Protestant and Roman Catholic communities have been in decline since the late th century due to the rise of irreligion in New England It is the most irreligious region of the country along with the Western United States for comparison and contrast however in the Public Religion Research Institute determined of the population were Christian
