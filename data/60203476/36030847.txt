New York City holding a folder when he is hit by a flying piece of paper The paper is chased by a young woman named Meg who lost it to a gust of wind from a passing train The same thing happens to George when a subsequent gust of wind from another incoming train dislodges one of the papers from his folder and blows it into Meg s face leaving a lipstick smudged kiss imprinted on the paper much to his amusement when George retrieves it He is entranced by the lipstick mark and Meg s beauty and therefore misses her boarding the departing train The two exchange looks as she departs br George arrives at work despondent gazing at the lipstick marked paper on his desk He looks out the window and is surprised to find Meg in the building across the street working in an office with an open window After failing to get her attention by waving his arms much to the annoyance of his boss George begins folding airplanes from a stack of papers on his desk throwing them out the window one by one in an attempt to get her to notice him His efforts are met with varying levels of failure as well as disparaging looks from his boss In desperation having used all of the paper on his desk to no success he uses the lipstick marked paper although this fails as well when a gust of wind tugs it from his hands Meg then leaves the office and George rebuffing his boss dashes from his desk Rushing across a street of busy traffic he fails to see which way she went and only finds the final lipstick marked paper airplane Angered he throws it hard and it soars into the sky br It turns out many of the paper airplanes have collected in a nearby alley and when the lipstick marked paper airplane lands among them they begin to stir and fly from the ground seeming to come alive and set off in pursuit of George A cloud of paper airplanes forces him toward a nearby train station and onto a train much to his confusion Meanwhile the lipstick marked paper airplane sets off in pursuit of Meg finding her at a flower stand Recognizing the lipstick marked paper she chases the airplane to another train station and aboard a different train They re finally brought together when both of their trains stop at the same station George still covered in paper airplanes and Meg holding his lipstick marked paper airplane As the credits roll they are seen chatting happily with each other at a restaurant table with the lipstick marked paper between them The picture disappears but the paper still is in the credits before it flies off br br br Cast br John Kahrs as George br Kari Wahlgren as Meg br br br Production br br br Conception and writing br br In an interview with Animation World Network director John Kahrs revealed that Paperman first materialized when he was working as an animator at Blue Sky Studios during the s Kahrs conceived Paperman while he was traveling on his routine commute through Grand Central Station where he was inspired by the random connections you sometimes make with people on these excursions As a result he created a story about a guy who makes a connection with this girl on his long commute elaborating that the story really is about what happens when he tries to get her back and make that connection again Describing Paperman as an urban fairytale Kahrs pitched the idea as an animated short to Disney Chief Creative Officer John Lasseter and Walt Disney Animation Studios several times The studio refused to develop the project because they were pre occupied with Tangled on which Kahrs also worked It wasn t until after Tangled was completed that Disney who was searching for a project that would fill the space between Tangled and Wreck It Ralph that Paperman was finally green lit br Kahrs developed the story on storyboards and wrote the original draft of Paperman However he admitted that the writing was really a collaborative process because he constantly received creative input from a peer group of directors Lasseter who served as an executive producer on the film also made frequent contributions The main character George was inspired by George Bailey from the film It s A Wonderful Life According to Kahrs Bailey like George experiences the full gamut of life from the highest highs to the lowest lows He s a real guy he gets frustrated He s got dreams br br br Animation br While searching for a way to merge D and D animation Kahrs discovered Meander a hybrid vector raster based drawing and animation system that gives artists an interactive way to craft the film When describing the inspiration for the film s unique style of animation which was created with this new in house technology Kahrs stated We brought together as best we could the expressiveness of D drawing immersed with the stability and dimensionality of CG It really goes back to working with Glen Keane on Tangled watching him draw over all the images br The technique called final line advection gives the artists and animators significantly more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department In his commentary In Paperman we didn t have a cloth department and we didn t have a hair department Here folds in the fabric hair silhouettes and the like come from the committed design decision making that comes with the D drawn process Our animators can change things actually erase away the CG underlayer if they want and change the profile of the arm And they can design all the fabric in that Milt Kahl kind of way if they want to br br br Characters and voices br The character design of Paperman has been likened to that of Disney s traditionally animated film One Hundred and One Dalmatians Several comparisons have been drawn between the characters George from Paperman and Roger from Dalmatians specifically the fact that they both share similar body types George s appearance underwent several alterations but Kahrs always intended for the character to have a rather large nose saying that it can still be really fun and attractive Longtime Disney animator Glen Keane worked on George s love interest Meg According to Kahrs both Paperman characters George and Meg were intentionally drawn to complement and match each other s designs br In an interview with her school s alumni association Kari Wahlgren who voiced Meg said that she was asked to do the role because of her previous involvements in Bolt and Tangled Recording for her role in the film took about minutes Since the film is mostly silent they just wanted some vocal ambiance that they could experiment with We played with lots of different vocal reactions in the session snorts gasps breaths I think one chuckle made it into the final mix I m actually glad they kept it mostly silent I think it makes the short even more powerful that way br br br Release br The short film premiered at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in June Five months later the short accompanied the theatrical release of Wreck It Ralph which was released on November Christophe Beck s score was released digitally by Walt Disney Records in the following month on December After being nominated for the Academy Award

Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on the Blu ray and DVDreleases of Wreck It Ralph on March Paperman was also released on the Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection Blu ray on August br br br Reception br Film critic Jeff Shannon writing for RogerEbert com called the short brilliant from start to finish writing that the film proved yet again that traditional D animation is every bit as expressive as computer generated D Leonard Maltin called the short an amusing and ingenious love story noting that it was perfection itself br There is some discussion regarding some similarities in the storyline and concept of Paperman and Patrick Hughes short film Signs Hughes himself dismissed the idea of copying while acknowledging the similarities between them but he admired the short and called it beautiful br Paperman was nominated and won both an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film at the th Academy Awards and the Annie Award for Best Animated Short Subject at
