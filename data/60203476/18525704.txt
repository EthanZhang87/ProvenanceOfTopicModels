CinemaScore is a market research firm based in Las Vegas It surveys film audiences to rate their viewing experiences with letter grades reports the results and forecasts box office receipts from the data br br br Background br Ed Mintz who majored in math at the University of Wisconsin Madison and founded dental billing software company Dentametics with wife Rona attended The Cheap Detective in June He had read a positive review by a movie critic but disliked the film despite being a fan of Neil Simon and heard another disappointed attendee wanting to hear the opinions of ordinary people not critics Mintz had not worked with polls or the entertainment industry but decided to use his math and computer skills for a business surveying the opinions of hundreds of film viewers br A Yom Kippur donation card with tabs inspired the survey cards given to audience members The company conducts exit polls of audiences who have seen a film in theaters asking them to rate the film and specifying what drew them to the film Its results are published in Entertainment Weekly CinemaScore also conducts surveys to determine audience interest in renting films on video breaking the demographic down by age and sex and passing along information to video companies such as Fox Video Corporation br After employees of Mintz s dental company tested the survey cards at theaters polling began in CinemaScore at first reported its findings to consumers including a newspaper column and a radio show After th Century Fox approached the company in it began selling the data to studios instead By the mid s AMC Theatres used CinemaScore data when choosing films for its locations A website was launched by CinemaScore in after three years delay in which the president sought sponsorship from magazines and video companies Brad Peppard was president of CinemaScore Online from to The website included a database of nearly feature films and the audiences reactions to them Prior to the launch CinemaScore results had been published in Las Vegas Review Journal and Reno Gazette Journal CinemaScore s expansion to the Internet included a weekly email subscription for cinephiles to keep up with reports of audience reactions br In CinemaScore was rating approximately films a year including of major studio releases For each film employees polled moviegoers in three of CinemaScore s sites which included the cities Las Vegas Los Angeles San Diego Denver Milwaukee St Louis Dallas Atlanta Tampa Phoenix and Coral Springs br In the summer of CinemaScore reported that the season had the biggest collective grade since In the summer of out of films received either an A or B grade Twenty six of the summer of s films got similar grades while of the summer of s films got similar grades the latter being the highest ratio in a decade br Since July CinemaScore reports its results also on Twitter br Usually to maintain comparable sample sizes only films that open in more than screens are polled and reported on CinemaScore s website and social media The distributor of a film that opens in fewer screens can also contract with CinemaScore for a private survey whose result would be disclosed only to the client Some of these privately contracted surveys results have nevertheless been publicly touted such as the A ratings for films including Courageous and A Question of Faith both released by faith based distributor Pure Flix Entertainment br br br Rating br br CinemaScore describes itself as the industry leader in measuring movie appeal There are to teams of CinemaScore representatives present in large cities across North America Each Friday representatives in five randomly chosen cities give opening day audiences a small survey card The card asks for age gender a grade for the film A B C D or F whether they would rent or buy the film on DVD or Blu ray why they chose the film and whether or not they felt the film lined up with its marketing CinemaScore typically receives about cards per film the company estimates a response rate and margin of error br An overall grade of A and F is calculated as the average of the grades given by responders In this case grades other than F are qualified with a plus high end minus low end or neither middle The ratings are divided by gender and age groups under and up Film studios and other subscribers receive the data at about pm Pacific Time CinemaScore publishes letter grades to the public on social media and although the detailed data is proprietary the grades become widely shared in the media and the industry Subsequent advertisements for highly ranked films often cite their CinemaScore grades Studios use the demographic data when marketing films A studio might hope that a high grade helps the box office of a film with a disappointing opening weekend or adjust a future film s marketing based on survey results for one with a similar demographic br CinemaScore pollster Dede Gilmore reported the trend in Most movies get easily a B plus I think people come wanting the entertainment They have high expectations They re more lenient with their grades But as moviegoers do it more and more they get to be stronger critics In films that were graded with an A included Scent of a Woman A Few Good Men and Falling Down Films graded with a B included Sommersby and Untamed Heart A C grade film for the year was Body of Evidence As opening night audiences are presumably more enthusiastic about a film than ordinary patrons a C grade from them is according to the Los Angeles Times bad news the equivalent of a failing grade According to Ed Mintz A s generally are good B s generally are shaky and C s are terrible D s and F s they shouldn t have made the movie or they promoted it funny and the absolute wrong crowd got into it Horror films consistently score lower The Conjuring s A was the first time a horror film scored better than B CinemaScore s Harold Mintz said that An F in a horror film is equivalent to a B in a comedy br An A typically predicts a successful box office From to August only films about two a year received the top grade including seven Academy Award for Best Picture winners From to January there were movies with A As of July about films have received A br From to those rated A and A had multiples of and respectively while C rated films total revenue was times their opening weekend Ed Mintz cited Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Cruise as the two stars it doesn t matter how bad the film is they can pull the projections up DiCaprio s Shutter Island had a revenue multiple despite a C grade and Cruise s Vanilla Sky had a multiple with a D grade br As of films have received an F grade Vulture wrote that besides horror br br Another type of movie features prominently on the list let s call it Misleading Auteurism These are movies made by prominent often Oscar nominated directors that investigate risky and controversial subject matters and receive both praise and pans But because of how the movie industry works the name of a director alone not being enough to get most people to go see something they tend to be marketed as more straight ahead genre films resulting in a whole bunch of misled and pissed off audience members br Vulture cited as examples of such F graded films Steven Soderbergh s Solaris with George Clooney Andrew Dominik s Killing Them Softly with Brad Pitt and Darren Aronofsky s mother with Jennifer Lawrence br In an essay for The Hollywood Reporter Martin Scorsese strongly criticized this type of approach by writing The brutal judgmentalism that has made opening weekend grosses into a bloodthirsty spectator sport seems to have encouraged an even more brutal approach to film reviewing I m talking about market research firms like CinemaScore They have everything to do with the movie business and absolutely nothing to do with either the creation or the intelligent viewing of film The filmmaker is reduced to a content manufacturer and the viewer to an unadventurous consumer Ed Mintz rejected being connected to Rotten Tomatoes and defended CinemaScore methodology of polling select audiences on the opening night to see if the film meets the expectations of the people who most want to see it He further defended the accuracy of their data and the correlation to box office results br CinemaScore s forecasts for box office receipts based on the surveys are according to the Los Angeles Times surprisingly accurate as most of the company s picks are in the ballpark in correctly predicting the success of The Hangover and the failure of Land of the Lost Hollywood executives are divided on CinemaScore s accuracy Rob Moore formerly of Paramount Pictures said Ed Mintz had an absolute connection with the pulse of moviegoers Jeff Goldstein of Warner Bros described CinemaScore as essential for the entertainment industry and Dan Fellman of Warner said that the studio discontinued its own exit polling because of CinemaScore Another Hollywood executive said It s not always right but it s a pretty good indicator I rely on it Another said that competitor PostTrak was much better more thorough and in depth br
