available content was generally well received but many commented on the likelihood of confusion with HBO s other since deprecated streaming platforms HBO Go and HBO Now and the service s higher subscription price compared to other newly launched streaming platforms like Disney Television critics also expressed frustration that the library of original series not including its former late night adult content for sister network Cinemax was not originally available on HBO Max though much of its output had arrived on the service by the end of br AT T announced in July that HBO Max had nominally achieved million subscribers after its first month of operation including million wholesale customers primarily legacy HBO pay TV subscribers that were covered by new agreements that added access to HBO Max at no extra charge However only million customers had activated their HBO Max accounts by the same date The latter figure was seen by many observers as a disappointment particularly in light of Disney having reached million subscribers within a day of launch The New York Times s media critic Ben Smith wrote that WarnerMedia had badly botched the launch br However AT T executives contended that it had been a flawless launch citing increased customer engagement compared to HBO Now and overall growth in total subscriptions to either HBO or HBO Max million vs million HBO or HBO Now subscribers at the end of while acknowledging that there was more to do to persuade existing HBO subscribers to start using the HBO Max apps Executives had previously noted that HBO Max was starting from a different place than other streaming services as it was building on the existing HBO subscriber base and had to work within the constraints of many of HBO s pre existing deals such as those with Amazon and Roku br In October AT T revealed that the number of activated HBO Max subscribers had reached million by the end of September while the number of nominal eligible subscribers reached million The total number of HBO HBO Max subscriptions in the U S also increased to million With an agreement being reached the following month with Amazon which is reported to have had million

alleging that WarnerMedia had overstated the number of HBO Max subscribers by including unactivated subscriptions bundled with AT T services br br br As Max br Upon its launch it was noted that Max had grouped directors and writers for its films and television series under a singular creators credit The Directors Guild of America and Writers Guild of America West condemned the move amidst the Hollywood labor disputes Max announced that they would fix the credits agreeing with the outcry from the guilds regarding proper credit for its creators noting the altered credits were a result of an oversight in the technical transition from HBO Max to Max Deadline Hollywood reported the consolidation was a result of WBD s IT departments creating the catch all for the credits to be in place for launch and that executives who could have intervened had been unaware of the single credit until the discourse arose online after its launch Additionally it was reported that it would take weeks to fix given the service would need to make the adjustment on each platform The credits would later be fixed beginning in late June br br br See also br List of streaming media services br br br
