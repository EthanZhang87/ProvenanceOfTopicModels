nearby hills The ancient Native trail later known as the Old Connecticut Path also ran through this area During the initial period of colonization of the region by Puritan settlers the Nipmuc suffered a rapid decline in population due to the introduction of foreign infectious diseases to which they had no immunity and violence related to settler colonialism Many of the Nipmuc people were forced
