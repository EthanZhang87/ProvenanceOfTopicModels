developing two sequels The third film was set to include the superhero team X Force Deadpool director Tim Miller chose not to return for the sequels due to creative differences with star Ryan Reynolds and David Leitch was hired to direct Deadpool in November Fox was looking for another filmmaker to develop the third film In March Deadpool and Deadpool co writer Rhett Reese said X Force would be introduced in Deadpool before starring in a planned spin off film that would launch something bigger separate from the third Deadpool film which would be more personal When the acquisition of st Century Fox by Disney was announced in December the Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said Reynolds s Deadpool would be integrated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe MCU This was despite those films being rated PG and the Deadpool films being R rated Iger said Disney was willing to make R rated Deadpool films as long as we let the audiences know what s coming and said a Marvel R brand could be created for characters like Deadpool In May Reynolds said a third Deadpool film may not be made due to the shift of focus to X Force Reese and his writing partner Paul Wernick said a third film would happen after Reynolds took a break from the character and the X Force film was released similar to the MCU crossover film The Avengers being released between Iron Man and Iron Man br At the end of May Leitch expressed interest in returning for another Deadpool film depending on the schedule A third Deadpool film was believed to be in active development by that August with production planned to take place in Atlanta Georgia rather than in Vancouver Canada where the previous films were made Once Upon a Deadpool a PG version of Deadpool was released at the end of the year It was watched carefully by Disney and Marvel Studios to see how it might inform their approach to the character in the MCU While promoting Once Upon a Deadpool Reynolds confirmed that a third Deadpool film was in development and said it would go in a completely different direction Reynolds later revealed that they were considering a road trip film styled after Rashomon featuring Hugh Jackman s X Men film series character James Logan Howlett Wolverine Karan Soni who portrayed Dopinder in the first two Deadpool films reiterated these plans and explained that the film would have focused on Deadpool trying to save Christmas by going on a road trip to the North Pole Jackman had himself envisioned a team up film with Reynolds inspired by Hrs while attending a screening of Deadpool in but chose to retire from the role of Wolverine after Logan In March Disney officially acquired Fox and gained the film rights to several Marvel Comics characters for Marvel Studios including Deadpool and the X Men The Marvel based films that Fox had been developing were placed on hold br Josh Brolin who portrayed Cable in Deadpool and Thanos in the MCU said in June that he had discussed his future as Cable with Marvel Studios In October Zazie Beetz said she would be surprised if she did not reprise her Deadpool role of Domino in a future film That month Reese and Wernick said they and Reynolds were taking a much needed rest from Deadpool while they waited to hear from Marvel Studios about the franchise s future They confirmed that another Deadpool film would be made that it would be R rated like the previous films and that it would integrate the character with the MCU Wernick said there was never a set pitch for a third Deadpool film between their exhaustion following Deadpool and the announcement of Fox s acquisition by Disney Reese said they now had to land on the right idea and once we do I think we ll be off to the races The writers felt there would be more characters available in the MCU to act as foils for Deadpool compared to their restricted options among the characters that Fox had control over for the previous films br br br Development br Reynolds revealed in mid October that he was meeting with Marvel Studios At that time Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige was unsure how to integrate Deadpool into the MCU and was still thinking about how the X Men and mutants in general would be added to the franchise Feige described Reynolds as an idea machine who pitched many different approaches for the film including a low budget road trip film with Deadpool and Dopinder that was compared to independent films from the Sundance Film Festival and one that included a dance number with Wolverine set to I Guess That s Why They Call It the Blues by Elton John Reynolds also pitched his previous idea for a Rashomon style team up film with Wolverine which would tell one story from three different perspectives He was told that it would not be possible to include Wolverine in the film In December Reynolds confirmed that the whole team was actively developing a Deadpool film at Marvel Studios br Reynolds and Marvel Studios met with potential writers throughout October including Wendy Molyneux and Lizzie Molyneux Logelin whose pitch was in line with their intentions for the film The Molyneux sisters were hired to write the screenplay the next month Reynolds and Marvel Studios were open to Leitch returning for the film but he was not expected to due to other commitments throughout and was not involved in hiring the writers Leitch later confirmed that he met with Marvel for the film but both parties understood that scheduling and other commitments would prevent him from returning In January Feige reaffirmed that the film would receive an R rating and would be set in the MCU Reynolds was supervising the scripting process at that time and Feige said filming would not begin until after due to Reynolds s busy schedule br br While filming The Adam Project with director Shawn Levy Reynolds approached Levy about working together on the next Deadpool film after they had become frequent collaborators Reynolds assumed Levy would not be interested due to it being a sequel and not an original work but Levy was enthused about the idea as long as they had the right story to tell In July Reynolds and Taika Waititi promoted their film Free Guy also directed by Levy by appearing as Deadpool and Waititi s MCU character Korg respectively in a commercial for that film titled Deadpool and Korg React Deadpool who often breaks the fourth wall discusses joining the MCU with Korg in the commercial The next month Reynolds said he expected filming to begin in which Feige soon confirmed Feige added that Marvel Studios had a release timeframe in mind for the film In

were plugging away at the film br Levy was revealed to be directing the film in March and said filming would not begin until after due to his busy schedule through the remainder of the year Reese and Wernick were hired to rewrite the screenplay and said they were excited to use MCU elements in the film They added that Disney and Marvel were supportive of jokes about the MCU that they were writing for Deadpool given the success of the previous films They would not confirm whether they were starting from scratch or reworking the previous draft by the Molyneux sisters In June Raymond Chan was revealed to be the production designer after working on the Disney MCU miniseries The Falcon and the Winter Soldier Feige said in July that the film would be elevated from the first two in a similar way to other third installments of MCU film series such as Captain America Civil War Thor Ragnarok and Avengers Infinity War br Levy and Reynolds worked on the script with Reese Wernick and Zeb Wells who previously worked on the MCU miniseries She Hulk Attorney at Law and Marvel Zombies and the film The Marvels They all began to feel that they did not have an original story that was not derivative of the other Deadpool films Levy explained that they felt the film had to be deserving of being the first Deadpool film set within the MCU while still feeling grounded because this is an earthbound gritty realistic superhero franchise Levy and Reynolds were prepared to suggest to Feige that the film not move forward at that time because of the trouble they had landing on a story idea with executive producer Wendy Jacobson also stating that Marvel was struggling to settle on a core idea for the film In August Jackman reached out to Reynolds about wanting to be part of the film Reynolds was preparing for a meeting with Feige to discuss how to proceed given their lack of story ideas and realized that including Wolverine would solve many of the issues they were coming up against Jackman had a change of heart after being content with his decision to retire as Wolverine for several years and decided that a team up film with Reynolds could be so much fun I ll probably have more fun on that movie than anything I ve ever done Feige advised Jackman not to return as he felt Wolverine s death in Logan was the greatest ending in history and did not want to undo that He was won over by the idea that Jackman would portray a new version of Wolverine and Jackman confirmed that he wanted to return after taking a long drive to think about it br Reynolds announced in September that Jackman would return as Wolverine for Deadpool which was set for release on September The pair said the film would avoid affecting the events of Logan by using a narrative device from Marvel Studios that allowed different versions of characters to move around timelines Levy said preserving Logan s legacy was top priority for the creative team Jackman reached out to Logan director James Mangold to inform him of the film s story and said Mangold was both enthusiastic about the idea and relieved that Logan would not be impacted Alongside Feige Reynolds and Levy produced the film through their respective production companies Maximum Effort and Laps Entertainment as did X Men film producer Lauren Shuler Donner Simon Kinberg served as an executive producer after producing the previous Deadpool films and some X Men films He said the film had been authored by Levy Reynolds and Feige and they all cared deeply about Logan Deadpool and Wolverine Levy added that the legacies of Deadpool and Wolverine informed the film s story and themes Jackman said the film may not be titled Deadpool with Reynolds later referring to it as The Deadpool Wolverine film and Jackman referring to it as Wolverine and Deadpool Levy said the creative team were discussing multiple options for the title and he had at times referred to it as Deadpool Versus Wolverine Deadpool and Wolverine and Deadpool with Wolverine The film was originally titled Deadpool Friend but this was changed the night before the official title was announced as Deadpool Wolverine in February because the former title had been leaked Levy acknowledged that it was the third Deadpool film but he did not want to call it Deadpool because it is a two hander character adventure that focuses on both characters Despite this Reynolds said the film was tonally still a Deadpool film with violence swearing and meta mayhem He called it the most Deadpool movie in the history of Deadpool br br br Pre production br Pre production work began by October less than two months after Jackman decided to join the film Jacobson said this was one of the fastest turnarounds she had seen for a big production Filming was expected to begin in January in Vancouver In mid October the film s release date was pushed back to November Reynolds said the next month that filming would begin in mid and Levy confirmed in December that filming was set to begin that May He said developing the film was one of the most fun creative experiences of his career citing the film s self awareness violence and foul language Levy said he did not want to alter the franchise s DNA from the prior films and called the new film raw audacious and very much R rated comparing it to the buddy comedy films Midnight Run Hrs and Planes Trains and Automobiles br Patrick Stewart who portrayed Charles Xavier Professor X in the X Men film series and reprised the role in the MCU film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness had been approached about potentially making an appearance in the film by February Later that month filming was set to take place in London and Emma Corrin joined the cast in a lead villain role Marvel had been considering Corrin since late but had to work through scheduling issues with their other commitments before they signed on Corrin was cast after Levy saw their performance in a stage production of

be featured in the film Later that month Matthew Macfadyen joined the cast in an undisclosed role which was described as a third wheel to Deadpool and Wolverine Karan Soni and Leslie Uggams were set

respective roles as Peter Wisdom Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Yukio br br Graham Churchyard and Mayes C Rubeo were the film s costume designers Jackman wears a yellow and blue costume similar to Wolverine s costumes from X Men The Animated Series and the comic books specifically Astonishing X Men volume drawn by John Cassaday it also features elements of the character s s design by John Romita Sr and Dave Cockrum and the s design by Jim Lee Jackman did not wear a comics accurate costume in the X Men film series though it was referenced in X Men and a deleted scene from The Wolverine The film was therefore an opportunity to see Jackman in a comics accurate costume for the first time and Levy felt this could be the last chance for Jackman to wear such a costume They went through several iterations and fittings to get the suit right Jackman said putting the suit on looked so right and felt so right and he questioned why he had not worn such a costume for the previous X Men films An early reveal of the costume was met with positive reactions online and led some commentators to determine that Jackman was portraying a different iteration of the character in the film from the one he portrayed in the X Men films Reynolds also has an updated costume from the previous Deadpool films featuring a brighter shade of red and larger black circles on his mask This is reminiscent of the character s comic book design from the s Levy was pleased with the overwhelmingly positive response to the suit designs which were revealed early due to production occurring on location br br br Filming br Principal photography began on May in London and at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire England under the working title Tidal Wave George Richmond served as the cinematographer after working with Levy and Reynolds on Free Guy Reynolds lobbied Marvel Studios to film in Vancouver where he is from and the previous Deadpool films were made but conceded that they have their established infrastructure and you just have to sort of fall in line However a United States Copyright Office filing for the film indicated that some filming did occur in Vancouver Levy worked with Marvel Studios and the producers of the Netflix series Stranger Things present on which he was an executive producer to allow him to direct for that series final season since the schedules for the two projects were expected to overlap br Filming was not expected to be impacted by the Writers Guild of America strike that began in early May outside of Reynolds being unable to contribute to the script during filming as he had done for the previous films Marvel Studios was reportedly planning to shoot what they could during principal photography and make any necessary writing adjustments during the film s already scheduled reshoots The film was shot on location where possible to create a more grounded feeling than can be achieved with soundstages In June the film s release date was moved forward to May Filming for a car crash scene took place on location in London in early July Shortly after Jennifer Garner was revealed to be appearing in the film as Elektra after portraying a version of that character in the Fox produced film Daredevil and its spin off Elektra Garner denied her involvement Filming with Reynolds and Jackman took place in Norfolk br Production was suspended on July because

the film s sets intact during the strike Levy and Reynolds were able to edit what had been shot and begin work on the visual effects though they had not prioritized filming major visual effects sequences before the strike Prior to the strike Baccarin completed filming all of her scenes and Levy shot a sequence that he likened to the lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi He asked the film s stunt team to look to that scene s blocking tempo and framing for their scene Levy acknowledged some of the casting rumors surrounding the film including Garner appearing as Elektra Liev Schreiber returning as Sabretooth from X Men Origins Wolverine and Taylor Swift making a cameo appearance as Dazzler and said some of them were true but would not confirm which ones Swift was later stated to not be appearing in the film Levy said the characters that were included such as Aaron Stanford reprising his role as Pyro from X and X Men The Last Stand were added as the story developed rather than being based on a wishlist of characters and cameos that the producers wanted to include They did not want cameos or global MCU stakes to be the focus of the film and were able to include deep cut references to Marvel s history because Deadpool can serve as a Marvel fan through his fourth wall breaking Soni said several cameos were intended to be a surprise for the audience br The film along with others that were mid way through production at the start of the strikes was said to be a top priority for the studios to resume production following the conclusion of the SAG AFTRA strike In October Levy questioned if the film would be able to retain its May release date given the SAG AFTRA strike was still ongoing at that time shortly before it was reported that the film was likely to be delayed to a date later in even if filming was able to resume by the start of that year After the conclusion of the SAG AFTRA strike on November filming was expected to resume in London within the following two weeks before Thanksgiving Reynolds announced that the character Dogpool would appear in the film played by dog actor Peggy and the film s release date was pushed back to July Filming resumed by November Levy said his time editing and reviewing footage during the strikes allowed him to gain a better understanding of the film and he was able to return to work without feeling rushed and with a focus on what was needed to complete it br In early December set photos revealed that the characters Sabretooth and Toad were appearing in the film

in June while Toad was confirmed in the film s final trailer the next month Set photos also revealed a giant th Century Fox logo set piece Reynolds commented shortly after about the set photo leaks saying they created a difficult situation for the production and expressing his hope that websites would stop publishing unfinished out of context leaked images to preserve as much of that magic as possible for the finished film and the big screen He noted that the franchise is associated with leaks since the first Deadpool film was able to be made following a leak of its original test footage Reynolds proceeded to post faux leaked images featuring Mickey Mouse Predator and Steve Urkel along with various hashtags to try to alter the social media algorithm around the actual leaked photos since platforms prioritize posts from high profile accounts br Rob McElhenney Reynolds co chairman of Wrexham A F C visited the set to film a cameo appearance while also discussing matters for their

was released the following month and revealed that the creature Alioth from Loki was appearing in the film along with the characters Lady Deathstrike and Azazel The latter two resembled Kelly Hu and Jason Flemyng who portrayed those characters in X and X Men First Class respectively br At the end of April Levy said he was busy finishing work on the film Early screenings of the film had taken place which he described as extremely extremely promising with the main changes coming from them being pacing adjustments He added that despite the film s multiverse connections and use of elements from other projects such as the TVA from Loki he did not expect audiences to do homework before watching the film and intended for it to be an entertaining experience on its own Post production was completed on June The next month Jon Favreau and Wunmi Mosaku were revealed to be reprising their MCU roles as Happy Hogan and Hunter B in the film Throughout the promotional tour for the Star Wars
