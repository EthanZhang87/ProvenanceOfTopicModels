id: 31697773
Portal is a series of first person puzzle platform video games developed by Valve Set in the Half Life universe the two main games in the series Portal and Portal center on a woman Chell forced to undergo a series of tests within the Aperture Science Enrichment Center by a malicious artificial intelligence GLaDOS that controls the facility Most of the tests involve using the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device nicknamed the portal gun that creates a human sized wormhole like connection between two flat surfaces The player character or objects in the game world may move through portals while conserving their momentum This allows complex flinging maneuvers to be used to cross wide gaps or perform other feats to reach the exit for each test chamber A number of other mechanics such as lasers light bridges high energy pellets buttons cubes tractor funnels and turrets exist to aid or hinder the player s goal to reach the exit br The Portal games are noted for bringing students and their projects from the DigiPen Institute of Technology into Valve and extending their ideas into the full games The portal concept was introduced by the game Narbacular Drop and led to the basis for the first game Another game Tag The Power of Paint formed the basis of surface altering gels introduced in Portal br Both games have received near universal praise and have sold millions of copies The first game was released as part of a five game compilation The Orange Box and though intended as a short bonus feature of the compilation was instead considered the highlight of the five Its success led to the creation of the much longer Portal which included both single player and cooperative player modes it too received near universal critical acclaim In addition to the challenging puzzle elements both games are praised for their dark humor written by Erik Wolpaw Chet Faliszek and Jay Pinkerton voice work by actors Ellen McLain Stephen Merchant and J K Simmons A number of spin off media have been developed alongside the games and several of the game elements have become parts of internet memes br br Both Portal games take place in the fictional Aperture Science Enrichment Center Aperture Science was founded by Cave Johnson voiced by J K Simmons and originally sought to make shower curtains for the military Its research happened upon the discovery of portal technology and soon became a direct competitor with Black Mesa Research Facility from the Half Life series for government funding Johnson acquired the rights to a disused salt mine in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan where they started building a labyrinthine set of offices laboratories facilities and test chambers During this time Johnson became poisoned from exposure to moon dust a key component of the paint needed to support portal technology and became increasingly deranged br In Portal the player explores these long abandoned areas of Aperture learning that the company had moved from testing on the country s finest to paid volunteers and ultimately to forcing its own employees to participate in testing Near the point of his death Johnson ordered his lifelong assistant Caroline voiced by Ellen McLain to be the first test subject for a mind to computer transfer her personality would ultimately form the core of GLaDOS also McLain Sometime after Johnson s death the old sections of the facility were vitrified and a more modern facility was built atop the ruins GLaDOS was built to control the facility and monitor the tests but researchers found that the computer had villainous tendencies threatening to kill the entire staff before it was shut down in time The Aperture researchers constructed a number of personality cores that would fit onto GLaDOS to prevent her from turning against them Despite this on the day she was officially activated coincidentally on Take Your Daughter to Work Day she turned against the researchers and killed nearly everyone in the facility with lethal doses of neurotoxin gas In the games and the comic Lab Rat one employee Doug Rattmann survived due to his schizophrenia and distrust of GLaDOS In trying to find a way to defeat GLaDOS he finds that Chell one of the human subjects kept in cryogenic storage within Aperture has a high level of tenacity and arranges for the events of Portal to occur by moving her to the top of GLaDOS testing list GLaDOS remains driven to test human subjects despite the lack of humans br br The player is introduced to Aperture in Portal which is said by Valve to be set sometime between the events of Half Life and Half Life The player character Chell is awakened by GLaDOS for testing Chell resists GLaDOS lies and verbal ploys and succeeds to defeat GLaDOS core the destruction creating a portal implosion that sends Chell to the surface unconscious Rattmann who has helped Chell by writing warning messages and directions to maintenance areas on the facility walls and had observed the final battle escapes Aperture but on witnessing a robot dragging Chell s body back inside sacrifices his escape to assure that Chell is put into indefinite cryogenic storage He himself is critically wounded but appears to make it to another cryogenic chamber though his ultimate fate is not revealed br Portal takes place an unknown number of years after the events of the first game the Aperture facility has fallen into disrepair without GLaDOS A personality core named Wheatley Stephen Merchant wakes Chell from her sleep to help her stop a reactor failure but inadvertently awakens GLaDOS who had backed up her personality Though they defeat GLaDOS by putting Wheatley in control of the facility Wheatley is overwhelmed with power sending Chell and GLaDOS GLaDOS being temporarily reduced to a small computer powered by a potato to the old core of Aperture where GLaDOS rediscovers her relation to Caroline They return to the surface where they are forced to defeat Wheatley before his ineptitude with the Aperture systems causes the facility reactors to become critical and explode GLaDOS is returned to her original place and returns the facility to normal GLaDOS then lets Chell go realizing that the prospect of trying to kill her is too much trouble Instead she turns to two robots of her own creation Atlas and P Body to locate a mythical store of additional human subjects kept in cryogenic sleep for her to continue testing on br In addition to these characters the game includes numerous laser seeking turrets that seek to kill the player characters though are apologetic for it most are voiced by McLain though some defective ones in the sequel are voiced by Nolan North GLaDOS introduces Chell to the Weighted Companion Cube appearing similar to other Weighed Cubes crates in the game but decorated with hearts on its sides GLaDOS attempts to make Chell believe the Companion Cube is a sentient object and a key to her survival before having Chell dispose of it in an incinerator prior in order to leave a test chamber Both games feature other personality cores that were constructed to keep GLaDOS in check the first game includes three cores the Morality Curiosity and Intelligence Cores voiced by McLain as well as a snarling Anger Core voiced by Mike Patton In Portal three more such cores beyond Wheatley are introduced including the irrelevant Fact Core the bold Adventure Core and the space obsessed Space Core each voiced by North br br The player controls the main character Chell in the single player campaigns or one of Atlas and P Body in the cooperative mode from a first person view running jumping and interacting with switches or other devices The player characters are able to withstand large drops but can be killed by falling in the toxic water of the facility crushed to death passing through laser grids or fired on repeatedly by turrets br Both games are generally divided into a series of test chambers other sections of the game are more exploratory areas that connect these chambers Each chamber has an exit door that must be reached often requiring that certain conditions have been met such as having weighed down a large button with a Weighted Cube effectively a crate These puzzles require the use of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device the portal gun The gun can shoot two portals colored differently for identification on any flat surface that is painted with a specific paint containing moon dust Once both portal ends are placed the player can walk the character between them or carry objects with the portal gun through them Portal ends can be re positioned as often as necessary but certain actions such as walking through emancipation grills or moving a surface with a portal will cause the portals to dissipate br A critical feature of portals is that they retain the speed of the object traveling through it as stated by GLaDOS to the player in the first game Speedy thing goes in speedy thing comes out When portals are placed on non parallel planes this can create the effect of flinging Commonly one uses gravity to build up their momentum when they fall into a portal which flings them out of the other side to gain speed and distance that normal jumping and running could not generate A leapfrogging effect can be used by placing portals in series during this flinging gaining further momentum with each use br Portals will also allow light and other objects to transfer through them and numerous puzzles involve using portals to manipulate bouncing energy balls lasers hard light bridges and tractor beams to access new locations or direct objects to specific receptacles that must be activated to open the level s exit Portal introduces mobility gels that can paint surfaces including turrets and cubes that can also move through portals though not directly by the player The gels can create a surface that repels the player Repulsion Gel increases the player s speed Propulsion Gel or allows the surface to accept portals Conversion Gel br The games credit sequences feature the songs Still Alive and Want You Gone composed by Jonathan Coulton and in its original form sung by Ellen McLain in the GLaDOS voice Portal also features the song Exile Vilify by The National br br The concept of Portal came from Narbacular Drop a student project from the DigiPen Institute of Technology The game included the aspects of placing portals on any flat surfaces and using them to maneuver around levels Valve s employees attending a DigiPen career fair saw their game and shortly later offered the entire team jobs at Valve to help expand on their idea br Valve originally saw Portal as an experimental game to be included with its upcoming compilation The Orange Box alongside its release of Half Life Episode Two and Team Fortress To give the game character a minimal story tied loosely with the Half Life world was written by Valve s Erik Wolpaw and Marc Laidlaw They needed a character to guide the player through the game coming onto a polite but humorous artificial intelligence which would ultimately become the character of GLaDOS br Portal s release with The Orange Box received near universal praise with the standalone game earning an aggregate Metacritic rating of out of With success of the game work on an expanded sequel began nearly immediately expanding the development team from to about programmers Initial ideas for Portal retained the idea of solving puzzles through scientific concepts but eliminating the use of portals altogether these versions did not fare well with test audiences nor with Gabe Newell Valve s president these ideas were dropped though saved for potential reuse in a different game by Valve Portal development was restarted specifically to keep the portal concept but adding new elements to freshen the gameplay br During this period Valve had witnessed another student project out of Digipen Tag The Power of Paint which allows the player to spray paint onto surfaces to alter their behavior and brought them into Valve though not initially as part of the Portal The Tag team had found a way to incorporate their paints with real time fluid dynamics code previously made by Valve and soon their concept for paints had become the conversion gels as part of Portal br Valve included a co operative play mode based on their own observations and stories from players about working out the solutions to Portal s puzzles in a group environment With this feature they sought the ability to enable cross platform play of Portal between computers and consoles through Steamworks This led to a surprise reveal by Newell that not only would Portal be on the PlayStation platform after previously stating the difficulties in supporting this console but that it would include support for cross platform play between personal computers and PlayStation players through a limited Steamworks interface Valve brought in writer Jay Pinkerton formerly with National Lampoon and Left Dead writer Chet Faliszek to assist Wolpaw with the larger story They built on the character of the Aperture Science facility providing a deeper story for GLaDOS and Aperture s CEO Cave Johnson as well as developing several concepts for personality cores ultimately to the creation of the Wheatley core character br Portal was similarly released with high praise with a out of score on Metacritic Valve has continued to support the game through the release of two separate downloadable content packages one introducing a new co operative campaign and a second that incorporated an easy to learn level editor that allowed players to make their own test chambers and share these through the Steam Workshop to others Further on this Valve has created a special version of the Portal level editor to be used alongside its Steam in Schools program as a means of using the game and editor to teach students about physics math and other lessons Valve released this version of Portal free for educational use Exploring options for a full scale VR game in Valve experimented with Portal but found the portal systems disorienting in VR instead they returned to the Half Life series and released Half Life Alyx in br In April Erik Wolpaw urged Valve to make Portal saying I am also not getting any younger We are reaching the point where it s crazy to think we re literally going to be too old to work on Portal So we should just do it In September Ellen McLain also called for Portal saying she was willing to star in it and asked fans to Write in Email Valve You ve got my blessing br br Portal was initially released in October as part of a compilation game called The Orange Box alongside Half Life and its two episodes and Team Fortress Valve considered including Portal as a bonus feature of the compilation the game was purposely kept short such that if it did not meet expectations players would have the rest of the content of The Orange Box as a safety net Portal has since been repackaged on Windows as a standalone game in April A Mac OS X client was introduced simultaneously with the release of the Steam client for that platform in May as part of its promotion the game was released free of charge for both platforms during which at least million players downloaded it br br Portal Still Alive was a standalone version of Portal with additional content for the Xbox Live Arcade released in October The game included new achievements additional challenges from the existing test chambers and additional non story levels based on those found in the Flash based Portal The Flash Version created by We Create Stuff br br In September Nvidia announced it would release an updated version of Portal with real time ray tracing as a free DLC for owners of the original game on PC It was released on December br br Portal was released as a standalone game in April on both computers and consoles It is considered as one of the greatest video games of all time by numerous publications and critics It received acclaim for its gameplay pacing dark humor writing the voice work of McLain Merchant and Simmons and its challenging but surmountable learning curve br br Portal Companion Collection is a compilation of both games and Still Alive content released for Nintendo Switch on June The port was developed in collaboration with Nvidia Lightspeed Studios br br The Potato Sack was an A R G alternate reality game conceived by Valve and indie video game developers as a prelude to the release of Portal Portal had been announced by a similar game where a patch applied to the Steam version of Portal in March provided clues heralding the official announcement The Potato Sack game launched on April led to the reveal of GLaDOS home a spoof of distributed computer challenges to get players to cooperate on playing the independent games as to unlock Portal on Steam about hours before its planned release br br The Final Hours of Portal is a digital book written and created by Geoff Keighley released on May This digital book gives insight on the creation of Portal Keighley had previously worked as an editor at GameSpot writing several word Final Hours pieces on various games where he visited the studios during the late development phases to document the creation of the game One piece The Final Hours of Half Life allowed Keighley to interact with Valve during and and talk with the staff as they completed work on Half Life Keighley wanted to recreate a similar work for Portal with focus on making it an interactive work for the iPad Keighley was granted fly on the wall access to Valve when Portal was being produced The initial iPad release was written by Keighley with work by Joe Zeff Design a studio that had also produced digital applications for Time magazine The interactive work provides movie clips and short applications to demonstrate the various mechanics of the game and stages of the game s development The work was later ported into a non interactive eBook and into an application with the same iPad interactivity on the Steam platform With the iPad and Steam version Keighley is able to offer live updates to the work upon release of the Peer Review downloadable content pack the work was updated with an additional chapter discussing the creation of the new content and what new features players could expect in the future from Portal br br To help the players develop the fictional history of Aperture Science Valve created a digital comic to tell the story of the Rat Man a schizophrenic who is unseen in the games themselves but creates murals and scrawlings that guide Chell in both games The comic Portal Lab Rat takes place both during and after Portal explaining the events that led to Portal The Rat Man s artwork appears early in Portal where it retells the plot of Portal Michael Avon Oeming who had worked on comics for Valve games Team Fortress and Left Dead and Valve in house artist Andrea Wicklund drew the comic Ted Kosmatka wrote most of the story with input from the Portal writers The page comic was made available online in two parts about two weeks before the game s release and was also bundled with the game itself Dark Horse Comics has published Portal Lab Rat in a printed anthology of Valve comics Valve Presents The Sacrifice and Other Steam Powered Stories in November br In the comic Doug Rattmann also known as The Rat Man is a scientist working in the Aperture facility He escapes GLaDOS s initial neurotoxin attack but suffers symptoms as his schizophrenia medication runs out causing hallucinations of his Weighted Companion Cube talking Noticing that Chell is uniquely tenacious among the test subjects held by Aperture Rattmann moves her to the top of the queue of testing subjects thus starting the events of the first Portal After Chell defeats GLaDOS Rattmann escapes Aperture but returns against the Companion Cube s objections when he sees the Party Escort Bot dragging an unconscious Chell back inside and into a disabled cryo chamber He ensures that Chell is kept in indefinite suspended animation but he is shot by a turret in the process He then enters a stasis pod himself leaving his fate afterward unknown br br A board game version of Portal developed by Cryptozoic Entertainment with oversight from Valve was released in Titled Portal Uncooperative Cake Acquisition Game the game is based on players manipulating their tokens which are representative of unwitting test subjects through various test chambers in the Aperture Laboratories The goal being to test the most lucrative chambers while attempting to stall the progress of other players Valve had approached Cryptozoic with the core concepts of the board game which the publisher found only needed small modifications in gameplay for the purpose of balance br br The Lab is a VR game developed by Valve that as part of its partnership with HTC and the VR headset the HTC Vive It was described as a room scale VR experience consisting of about a dozen small experimental experiences that highlight the use of VR such include experiencing a fully panoramic view that has been stitched together from a number of photographs a physics game where the player attempts to launch personality cores into piles of boxes using a catapult and a bow and arrow based game The Lab was announced at the Game Developers Conference and was released free on April following the public release of the HTC Vive br br Valve licensed the use of Portal to Headup Games and Clockstone Software the developers of Bridge Constructor to develop Bridge Constructor Portal The game follows the same type of gameplay as Bridge Constructor where players are tasked to create a bridge from a limited set of parts to cross a river or chasm using physics simulations to test if the bridge will hold up against traffic crossing it Bridge Constructor Portal adds in elements from the Portal series such as portals as part of the construction challenge The game is set within Aperture Laboratories with the puzzles monitored by GLaDOS The game released on December for personal computers and mobile devices and later in for PlayStation Xbox One and Nintendo Switch consoles br br Aperture Hand Lab is a roomscale VR video game co developed by Canadian studio Cloudhead Games and

assurance checker for toilets manufactured by Aperture Science in its early years They are guided by the personality core Grady through the steps but as the game progresses mishaps in the automated factory lead Grady to suggest that the player develop a weaponized toilet as an invention to pitch to Cave Johnson br br In February Valve president Gabe Newell and film director J J Abrams announced that they were to collaborate on a film adaptation of the Portal series In Abrams stated that he still has plans to direct these films in the future with both films in the writing stage Abrams confirmed in May that the film adaptation was still in the works as they were still working on a script for the film from Warner Bros Pictures br br During Portal the player explores areas outside of the test chambers where scrawled messages left by Rattmann and others warn of GLaDOS deception In particular while GLaDOS promises that Chell will receive cake for completing the training courses the messages alert that this reward does not exist and that The cake is a lie The phrase became an Internet meme leading to numerous cake related jokes as well as its adaption as a term relating to a false promise When writing Portal Wolpaw stated that they were so sick of cake jokes that they purposely avoided any reference to them save for one subtle nod br Valve has sold several Portal based prints T shirts and other memorabilia through its own store often riding on the popularity of certain memes that the series has created When first released both were sold out in under hours Valve also

as part of required coursework at Wabash the game is used as an example of Erving Goffman s dissemination on dramaturgy The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life br At a mid presentation at the Games for Change Festival at New York University Gabe Newell stated Valve s intention to direct Portal and Portal towards education Newell stated that Valve doesn t see divide between making a game that can do well and be educational and was already working with schools to develop lesson plans around the game In one example Valve brought in students from nearby Evergreen School to watch them interact with the game in an educational setting As part of this effect the company promoted Portal for free use by any user during September br In speaking at the Games for Change Festival Newell said that the response to these efforts was praised by educators Their efforts culminated in a Teach with Portals program that Newell announced at the Festival The effort is built on a standalone Puzzle Maker that incorporates the level editor for Portal that was released as free content for the game in early Valve had built the Puzzle Maker with the aid of educators as to make it suitable for lesson plans as well as making it as easy for teachers to use to construct such plans The Puzzle Maker is not limited to physics but designed to be modular so that other fields such as fundamental electronics or chemistry could be included The Teach with Portals initiative is built atop of a stripped down version of the Steam client Steam for Schools that is designed to be used in schools allowing instructors to control the installation of the games and lesson plans on the students computers These tools as well as copies of Portal and the Puzzle Maker are being offered for free for all educators br br
