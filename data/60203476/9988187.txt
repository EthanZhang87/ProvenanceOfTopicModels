the service was twttr an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass inspired by Flickr and the five character length of American SMS short codes The decision was also partly due to the fact that the domain twitter com was already in use and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to Twitter The developers initially considered as the service s short code for SMS text messaging but later changed it to for ease of use and memorability Work on the project started in February Dorsey published the first Twitter

technologies br br br API and developer platform br Twitter was recognized for having one of the most open and powerful developer APIs of any major technology company The service s API allows other web services and applications to integrate with Twitter Developer interest in Twitter began immediately following its launch prompting the company to release the first version of its public API in September The API quickly became iconic as a reference implementation for public REST APIs and is widely cited in programming tutorials br From until Twitter s developer platform experienced strong growth and a highly favorable reputation Developers built upon the public API to create the first Twitter mobile phone clients as well as the first URL shortener Between and however Twitter made a number of decisions that were received unfavorably by the developer community In Twitter mandated that all developers adopt OAuth authentication with just weeks of notice Later that year Twitter launched its own URL shortener in direct competition with some of its most well known third party developers And in Twitter introduced stricter usage limits for its API completely crippling some developers While these moves successfully increased the stability and security of the service they were broadly perceived as hostile to developers causing them to lose trust in the platform br In July Twitter released version of the public API and began showcasing Twitter apps made by third party developers on its Twitter Toolbox section in April br In January Twitter ended third party access to its APIs forcing all third party Twitter clients to shut down This was controversial among the developer community as many third party apps predated the company s official apps and the change was not announced beforehand Twitterrific s Sean Heber confirmed in a blog post that the year old app has been discontinued We are sorry to say that the app s sudden and undignified demise is due to an unannounced and undocumented policy change by an increasingly capricious Twitter a Twitter that we no longer recognize as trustworthy nor want to work with any longer br In February Twitter announced it would be ending free access to Twitter API and began offering paid tier plans with a more limited access br br br Innovators patent agreement br On April Twitter announced it would implement an Innovators Patent Agreement which would obligate Twitter to only use its patents for defensive purposes br br br Open source br Twitter has a history of both using and releasing open source software while overcoming technical challenges of their service A page in their developer documentation thanks dozens of open source projects which they have used from revision control software like Git to programming languages such as Ruby and Scala Software released as open source by the company includes the Gizzard Scala framework for creating distributed datastores the distributed graph database FlockDB the Finagle library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients the TwUI user interface framework for iOS and the Bower client side package manager The popular Bootstrap frontend framework was also started at Twitter and is th most popular repository on GitHub br On March Twitter released the source code for Twitter s recommendation algorithm which determines what tweets show up on the user s personal timeline to GitHub According to Twitter s blog post We believe that we have a responsibility as the town square of the internet to make our platform transparent So today we are taking the first step in a new era of transparency and opening much of our source code to the global community Elon Musk the CEO at the time had been promising the move for a while on March before he owned the site he polled his followers about whether Twitter s algorithm should be open source and around percent of the responses said yes In February he promised it would happen within a week before pushing back the deadline to March earlier this month br Also in March Twitter suffered a security attack which resulted in proprietary code being released Twitter then had the source code removed br br br Interface br Twitter introduced the first major redesign of its user interface in September adopting a dual pane layout with a navigation bar along the top of the screen and an increased focus on the inline embedding of multimedia content Critics considered the redesign an attempt to emulate features and experiences found in mobile apps and third party Twitter clients br The new layout was revised in with a focus on continuity with the web and mobile versions introducing Connect interactions with other users such as replies and Discover further information regarding trending topics and news headlines tabs an updated profile design and moving all content to the right pane leaving the left pane dedicated to functions and the trending topics list In March Twitter became available in Arabic Farsi Hebrew and Urdu the first right to left language versions of the site In the Twitter Web site listed languages supported by Twitter com br In September a new layout for profiles was introduced with larger covers that could be customized with a custom header image and a display of the user s recent photos posted The Discover tab was discontinued in April and was succeeded on the mobile app by an Explore tab which features trending topics and moments br In September Twitter began to migrate selected web users to its progressive web app based on its Twitter Lite experience for mobile web reducing the interface to two columns Migrations to this iteration of Twitter increased in April with some users receiving it with a modified layout br In July Twitter officially released this redesign with no further option to opt out while logged in It is designed to further unify Twitter s user experience between the web and mobile application versions adopting a three column layout with a sidebar containing links to common areas including Explore that has been merged with the search page which previously appeared in a horizontal top bar profile elements such as picture and header images and biography texts merged into the same column as the timeline and features from the mobile version such as multi account support and an opt out for the top tweets mode on the timeline br br br Security br In response to early Twitter security breaches the United States Federal Trade Commission FTC brought charges against the service the charges were settled on June This was the first time the FTC had taken action against a social network for security lapses The settlement requires Twitter to take a number of steps to secure users private information including maintenance of a comprehensive information security program to be independently audited biannually br After a number of high profile hacks of official accounts including those of the Associated Press and The Guardian in April Twitter announced a two factor login verification as an added measure against hacking br On July a major hack of Twitter affected high profile accounts both verified and unverified ones such as Barack Obama Bill Gates and Elon Musk the hack allowed bitcoin scammers to send tweets via the compromised accounts that asked the followers to send bitcoin to a given public address with the promise to double their money Within a few hours Twitter disabled tweeting and reset passwords from all verified accounts Analysis of the event revealed that the scammers had used social engineering to obtain credentials from Twitter employees to access an administration tool used by Twitter to view and change these accounts personal details as to gain access as part of a smash and grab attempt to make money quickly with an estimated US in bitcoin deposited in various accounts before Twitter intervened Several law enforcement entities including the FBI launched investigations into the attack br On August Twitter disclosed that a bug introduced in a June update to the service allowed threat actors to link email addresses and phone numbers to twitter user s accounts The bug was reported through Twitter s bug bounty program in January and subsequently fixed While Twitter originally believed no one had taken advantage of the vulnerability it was later revealed that a user on the online hacking forum Breach Forums had used the vulnerability to compile a list of over million user profiles which they offered to sell for The information compiled by the hacker includes user s screen names location and email addresses which could be utilized in phishing attacks or used to deanonymize accounts running under pseudonyms br br br Outages br br During an outage Twitter users were at one time shown the fail whale error message image created by Yiying Lu illustrating eight orange birds using a net to hoist a whale from the ocean captioned Too many tweets Please wait a moment and try again Web designer and Twitter user Jen Simmons was the first to coin the term fail whale in a September tweet In a November Wired interview Chris Fry VP of Engineering at that time noted that the company had taken the fail whale out of production as the platform was now more stable Twitter had approximately ninety eight percent uptime in or about six full days of downtime The downtime was particularly noticeable during events popular with the technology industry such as the Macworld Conference Expo keynote address br br br User accounts br br br Verified accounts br br In June after being criticized by Kanye West and sued by Tony La Russa over unauthorized accounts run by impersonators the company launched their Verified Accounts program Twitter stated that an account with a blue tick verification badge indicates we ve been in contact with the person or entity the account is representing and verified that it is approved In July Twitter announced a public application process to grant verified status to an account if it is determined to be of public interest and that verification does not imply an endorsement Verified status allows access to some features unavailable to other users such as only seeing mentions from other verified accounts br In November Twitter announced a relaunch of its verification system in According to the new policy Twitter verifies six different types of accounts for three of them companies brands and influential individuals like activists the existence of a Wikipedia page will be one criterion for showing that the account has Off Twitter Notability Twitter states that it will re open public verification applications at some point in early br In October after the takeover of Twitter by Elon Musk it was reported that verification would instead be included in the paid Twitter Blue service and that existing verified accounts would lose their status if they do not subscribe On November Musk confirmed that verification would be included in Blue in the future dismissing the existing verification system as a lords peasants system Following concerns over the possibility of impersonation Twitter subsequently reimplemented a second Official marker consisting of a grey tick and Official text displayed under the username for high profile accounts of government and commercial entities br In December the Official text was replaced by a gold checkmark for organizations as well as a grey checkmark for government and multilateral accounts br In March the gold checkmark was made available for organizations to purchase through the Verified Organizations program formerly called Twitter Blue for Business br br br Privacy br Tweets are public but users can also send private direct messages Information about who has chosen to follow an account and who a user has chosen to follow is also public though accounts can be changed to protected which limits this information and all tweets to approved followers Twitter collects personally identifiable information about its users and shares it with third parties as specified in its privacy policy The service also reserves the right to sell this information as an asset if the company changes hands Advertisers can target users based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads directed specifically to the user br Twitter launched the beta version of their Verified Accounts service on June allowing people with public profiles to announce their account name The profile pages of these accounts display a badge indicating their status br On December the United States Department of Justice issued a subpoena directing Twitter to provide information for accounts registered to or associated with WikiLeaks Twitter decided to notify its users and said in a statement it s our policy to notify users about law enforcement and governmental requests for their information unless we are prevented by law from doing so br In May a claimant known as CTB in the case of CTB v Twitter Inc took action against Twitter at the High Court of Justice of England and Wales requesting that the company release details of account holders This followed gossip posted on Twitter about professional footballer Ryan Giggs s private life This led to the British privacy injunctions controversy and the super injunction Tony Wang the head of Twitter in Europe said that people who do bad things on the site would need to defend themselves under the laws of their own jurisdiction in the event of controversy and that the site would hand over information about users to the authorities when it was legally required to do so He also suggested that Twitter would accede to a UK court order to divulge names of users responsible for illegal activity on the site br Twitter acquired Dasient a startup that offers malware protection for businesses in January Twitter announced plans to use Dasient to help remove hateful advertisers on the website Twitter also offered a feature which would allow tweets to be removed selectively by country before deleted tweets used to be removed in all countries The first use of the policy was to block the account of German neo Nazi group Besseres Hannover on October The policy was used again the following day to remove anti Semitic French tweets with the hashtag unbonjuif a good Jew br Followed the sharing of images showing the killing of American journalist James Foley in Twitter said that in certain cases it would delete pictures of people who had died after requests from family members and authorized individuals br In following updated terms of service and privacy policy Twitter users outside the United States were legally served by the Ireland based Twitter International Company instead of Twitter Inc The change made these users subject to Irish and European Union data protection laws br On April Twitter announced that users outside of the European Economic Area or United Kingdom thus subject to GDPR will no longer be allowed to opt out of sharing mobile app advertising measurements to Twitter third party partners br On October Twitter took additional steps to counter misleading campaigns ahead of the US Election Twitter s new temporary update encouraged users to add their own commentary before retweeting a tweet by making quoting tweet a mandatory feature instead of optional The social network giant aimed at generating context and encouraging the circulation of more thoughtful content After limited results the company ended this experiment in December br On May Twitter was fined million for collecting users phone numbers and email addresses used for security and using them for targeted advertising required to notify its users and banned from profiting from deceptively collected data The Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice stated that Twitter violated a agreement not to use personal security data for targeted advertising br br br Harassment br In August Twitter announced plans to introduce a report abuse button for all versions of the site following uproar including a petition with signatures over Tweets that included rape and death threats to historian Mary Beard feminist campaigner Caroline Criado Perez and the member of parliament Stella Creasy Twitter announced new reporting and blocking policies in December including a blocking mechanism devised by Randi Harper a target of GamerGate In February CEO Dick Costolo said he was frankly ashamed at how poorly Twitter handled trolling and abuse and admitted Twitter had lost users as a result br As per a research study conducted by IT for Change on abuse and misogynistic trolling on Twitter directed at Indian women in public political life women perceived to be ideologically left leaning dissenters Muslim women political dissenters and political commentators and women from opposition parties received a disproportionate amount of abusive and hateful messages on Twitter br In Twitter announced the creation of the Twitter Trust Safety Council to help ensure that people feel safe expressing themselves on Twitter The council s inaugural members included organizations and individuals The announcement of Twitter s Trust Safety Council was met with objection from parts of its userbase Critics accused the member organizations of being heavily skewed towards the restriction of hate speech and a Reason article expressed concern that there s not a single uncompromising anti censorship figure or group on the list br Twitter banned accounts and limited more that had ties to QAnon on July The bans and limits came after QAnon related accounts began harassing other users through practices of swarming or brigading coordinated attacks on these individuals through multiple accounts in the weeks prior Those accounts limited by Twitter will not appear in searches nor be promoted in other Twitter functions Twitter said they will continue to ban or limit accounts as necessary with their support account stating We will permanently suspend accounts Tweeting about these topics that we know are engaged in violations of our multi account policy coordinating abuse around individual victims or are attempting to evade a previous suspension br In September Twitter began beta testing a feature called Safety Mode The functionality aims to limit unwelcome interactions through automated detection of negative engagements If a user has Safety Mode enabled authors of tweets that are identified by Twitter s technology as being harmful or exercising uninvited behavior will be temporarily unable to follow the account send direct messages or see tweets from the user with the enabled functionality during the temporary block period Jarrod Doherty senior product manager at Twitter stated that the technology in place within Safety Mode assesses existing relationships to prevent blocking accounts that the user frequently interacts with br br br Suspect and contested accounts br br In January Twitter was sued by the widow of a U S man killed in the Amman shooting attack claiming that allowing the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ISIL to continually use the platform including direct messages in particular constituted the provision of material support to a terrorist organization which is illegal under U S federal law Twitter disputed the claim stating that violent threats and the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on Twitter and like other social networks our rules make that clear The lawsuit was dismissed by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California upholding the Section safe harbor which dictates that the operators of an interactive computer service are not liable for the content published by its users The lawsuit was revised in August providing comparisons to other telecommunications devices The second amended complaint was dismissed by the district court a decision affirmed on appeal to the U S Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on January br Twitter suspended multiple parody accounts that satirized Russian politics in May sparking protests and raising questions about where the company stands on freedom of speech Following public outcry Twitter restored the accounts the next day without explaining why the accounts had been suspended The same day Twitter along with Facebook Google and Microsoft jointly agreed to a European Union code of conduct obligating them to review the majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech posted on their services within hours In August Twitter stated that it had banned accounts over the past six months bringing the overall number of suspended accounts to accounts in the past year for violating policies banning use of the platform to promote extremism br On May Twitter announced that they suspended accounts for promoting terrorism in the July December period stating there was a steady decrease in terrorist groups trying to use the platform owing to its zero tolerance policy enforcement According to Vijaya Gadde Legal Policy and Trust and Safety Lead at Twitter there was a reduction of terror related tweets from the previous reporting period January June br As of July Twitter will block URLs in tweets that point to external websites that contain malicious content such as malware and phishing content as well as hate speech speech encouraging violence terrorism child sexual exploitation breaches of privacy and other similar content that is already banned as part of the content of tweets on the site Users that frequently point to such sites may have their accounts suspended Twitter said this was to bring their policy in line to prevent users from bypassing their tweet content restrictions by simply linking to the banned content br Following the onset of protests by Donald Trump s supporters across the US in January Twitter suspended more than accounts stating that they shared harmful QAnon associated content at a large scale and were dedicated to the propagation of this conspiracy theory across the service br br br Malicious and fake accounts br Between January and late July Twitter had identified and shut down over fake accounts created by Iranian influence operations br In May in response to scrutiny over the misuse of Twitter by those seeking to maliciously influence elections Twitter announced that it would partner with the nonprofit organization Ballotpedia to add special labels verifying the authenticity of political candidates running for election in the U S br In December Twitter removed accounts for violating their manipulation policies The company investigated and attributed these accounts to a single state run information operation which originated in Saudi Arabia The accounts were reported to be a part of a larger group of accounts engaged in spammy behavior However Twitter did not disclose all of them as some could possibly be legitimate accounts taken over through hacking br In March Twitter suspended around fake accounts that were running a campaign to influence the American audience after the US intelligence officials concluded that the assassination of The Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi was approved by the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman These Saudi accounts were working in two languages English and Arabic to influence public opinion around the issue Many accounts commented directly on the tweets of US based media houses including The Post CNN CBS News and The Los Angeles Times Twitter was unable to identify the source of the influence campaign br As of the top four countries spreading state linked Twitter misinformation are Russia China Iran and Saudi Arabia br br br Bot accounts br br A bot is a computer program that can automatically post repost and follow other accounts X s open application programming interface and the availability of cloud servers make it possible for X bots to exist within the social networking site Benign X bots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation spam or slander Bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections influence the stock market appeal to the public and attack governments As of Twitter said there were million fake accounts on Twitter representing less than of active users A estimate put the figure at of all accounts or around million accounts br br br Society br br br Usage br br br Protesters br Twitter had been used for a variety of purposes in many industries and scenarios For example it has been used to organize protests including the protests over the Moldovan election the student protests in Austria the Gaza Israel conflict the Iranian green revolution the Toronto G protests the Bolivarian Revolution the Stuttgart protests in Germany the Egyptian Revolution England riots the United States Occupy movement the anti austerity movement in Spain the Aganaktismenoi movements in Greece the demonstration in Rome the Wisconsin labor protests the Gaza Israel conflict the protests in Brazil and the Gezi Park protests in Turkey br The service was also used as a form of civil disobedience In users expressed outrage over the Twitter joke trial by copying a controversial joke about bombing an airport and attaching the hashtag IAmSpartacus a reference to the film Spartacus and a sign of solidarity and support to a man controversially prosecuted after posting a tweet joking about bombing an airport if they canceled his flight IAmSpartacus became the number one trending topic on Twitter worldwide Another case of civil disobedience happened in the British privacy injunction debate where several celebrities who had taken out anonymized injunctions were identified by thousands of users in protest to traditional journalism being censored br During the Arab Spring in early the number of hashtags mentioning the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt increased A study by the Dubai School of Government found that only of the Egyptian population of the Tunisian population and of the Syrian population are active on Twitter br br br Governments br According to documents leaked by Edward Snowden and published in July the United Kingdom s GCHQ has a tool named BIRDSONG for automated posting of Twitter updates and a tool named BIRDSTRIKE for Twitter monitoring and profile collection br During the Hong Kong protests Twitter suspended a core group of fake accounts and an associated network of accounts for operating a disinformation campaign that was linked to the Chinese government In their announcement Twitter released two data sets detailing the core group s account activity Geng Shuang the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not comment on the suspensions but suggested that the activity could be attributed to overseas Chinese citizens br On June Twitter suspended over accounts from Turkey because those accounts were fake profiles designed to support the Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo an and were managed by a central authority Turkey s communication director said that the decision was illogical biased and politically motivated Turkey blocked access to Twitter twice once after voice recordings appeared on Twitter in which Erdo an ordered his son to stash away millions of dollars and another time for hours in the aftermath of the earthquake of February when Erdo an blamed the people for a disinformation campaign as they criticized the Government for their lack of help br In May Twitter labeled one of the tweets by Sambit Patra a spokesman of the local ruling party BJP in India as manipulated media leading to Twitter s offices in Delhi and Gurgaon being raided by the local police Twitter issued a statement calling the police visit a form of intimidation Later the Indian government released a statement in July claiming Twitter has lost its liability protection concerning user generated content This was brought on by Twitter s failure to comply with the new IT rules introduced in with a filing stating that the company failed to appoint executives to govern user content on the platform Twitter stated to India s government in August that they have appointed permanent executives and staff to provide for compliance to these new IT rules br According to a report by Reuters the United States ran a propaganda campaign to spread disinformation about the Sinovac Chinese COVID vaccine including using fake social media accounts on Twitter to spread the disinformation that the Sinovac vaccine contained pork derived ingredients and was therefore haram under Islamic law The campaign primarily targeted people in the Philippines and used a social media hashtag for China is the virus in Tagalog The campaign ran from to mid When asked about the accounts by Reuters Twitter concluded based on activity patterns and internal data that they were a coordinated bot campaign and removed them br Twitter allows pornographic content as long as it is marked sensitive by uploaders which puts it behind an interstice and hides it from minors The super follow feature is said to enable competition with the subscription site OnlyFans used mainly by sex workers Content filtering services for families and schools have noted that the company makes it really easy to find porn and advises blocking the entire domain Many performers use Twitter s service to market and grow their porn businesses attracting users to paywalled services like OnlyFans by distributing photos and short video clips as advertisements br In April Twitter convened a Red Team for the project of ACM Adult Content Monetization as it is known internally Eventually the project was abandoned because of the difficulty of implementing Real ID br br br Child sexual exploitation br A February report from the company s Health team begins While the amount of CSE child sexual exploitation online has grown exponentially Twitter s investment in technologies to detect and manage the growth has not br Until February the only way for users to flag illegal content was to flag it as sensitive media a broad category that left much of the worst material unprioritized for moderation In a February report employees wrote that Twitter along with other Tech Companies have accelerated the pace of CSE content creation and distribution to a breaking point where manual detection review and investigations no longer scale by allowing pornography and failing to invest in systems that could effectively monitor it The working group made several recommendations but they were not taken up and the group was disbanded br As part of its efforts to monetize porn Twitter held an internal investigation that reported in April Twitter cannot accurately detect child sexual exploitation and non consensual nudity at scale br John Doe et al v Twitter a civil lawsuit filed in the th Circuit Court alleges that Twitter benefited from sex trafficking and refused to remove the illegal tweets when first informed of them In an amicus brief filed in the case the NCMEC said The children informed the company that they were minors that they had been baited harassed and threatened into making the videos that they were victims of sex abuse under investigation by law enforcement but Twitter failed to remove the videos allowing them to be viewed by hundreds of thousands of the platform s users br Some major brands including Dyson Mazda Forbes and PBS Kids suspended their marketing campaigns and pulled their ads from the platform after an investigation into child porn on twitter showed that Twitter failed to suspend of the accounts that shared or solicited the prohibited content A brand president at Cole Haan said We re horrified either Twitter is going to fix this or we ll fix it by any means we can which includes not buying Twitter ads br br br Impact br br br On communication br In May The Wall Street Journal wrote that social networking services such as Twitter elicit mixed feelings in the technology savvy people who have been their early adopters Fans say they are a good way to keep in touch with busy friends But some users are starting to feel too connected as they grapple with check in messages at odd hours higher cellphone bills and the need to tell acquaintances to stop announcing what they re having for dinner The following year John C Dvorak described Twitter as the new CB radio br In April the Metropolitan Transportation Authority MTA in New York City announced that it would no longer post real time service updates on Twitter The transportation system claimed that the platform cannot be trusted to provide consistent updates that riders need According to an MTA spokesperson this decision was made after it experienced two Application Programming Interface API interruptions over the previous two weeks However only the updates were discontinued and the MTA planned to continue to respond to riders queries br In Twitter introduced a paywall system that required businesses to pay for access to its platform The payment scheme s upper limit amounts to an annual fee of up to million for top tier access With the paywall implementation public agencies issued numerous alerts about potential interruptions to transit and weather Shanifah Rieara MTA Acting Chief Customer Officer revealed that Twitter attempted to demand over annually from MTA for platform access which the latter declined br On May Twitter backtracked its paywall system allowing the free posting of automated tweets by verified government profiles In light of Twitter s decision MTA announced its resumption of posting automated alerts on the platform br br br Emergency use br A practical use for Twitter s real time functionality is as an effective de facto emergency communication system for breaking news It was neither intended nor designed for high performance communication but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication was not lost on the creators who knew that the service could have wide reaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes br Another practical use that is being studied is Twitter s ability to track epidemics and how they spread Additionally Twitter serves as a real time sensor for natural disasters such as bush fires and earthquakes br br br Education br Twitter has been adopted as a communication and learning tool in educational and research settings mostly in colleges and universities It has been used as a backchannel to promote student interactions especially in large lecture courses Research has found that using Twitter in college courses helps students communicate with each other and faculty promotes informal learning allows shy students a forum for increased participation increases student engagement and improves overall course grades br Twitter has been an increasingly growing in the field of education as an effective tool that can be used to encourage learning and idea or knowledge sharing in and outside the classroom By using or creating hashtags students and educators are able to communicate under specific categories of their choice to enhance and promote education A broad example of a hashtag used in education is edchat to communicate with other teachers and people using that hashtag Once teachers find someone they want to talk to they can either direct message the person or narrow down the hashtag to make the topic of the conversation more specific using hashtags for scichat science engchat English sschat social studies br In a study researchers found that young peoples use of Twitter helped to improve relationships with teachers encourage interactive learning and ultimately lead to high grades In the same study it was found that out of a group of educators agreed that the reason they use Twitter is because of how user friendly it is another agreed that they started and continue using Twitter because of how easy it is to learn and finally said they use Twitter because it is free People found sifting through large amounts of data to be challenging however with the simple nature of Twitter large amount of information became easily accessible Much of this simplicity comes from the use of the hashtag and the intuitive nature of how Twitter as a microblogging site operates These features help to promote education outside the classroom in a global setting where students and educators are easily able to create connect and share knowledge This ultimately promotes growth and learning among students and educators not just in the classroom but virtually and around the world br br br Public figures br Jonathan Zittrain professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School said that the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half baked are what makes it so powerful In that same vein and with Sigmund Freud in mind political communications expert Matthew Auer observed that well crafted tweets by public figures often deliberately mix trivial and serious information so as to appeal to all three parts of the reader s personality the id ego and superego The poets Mira Gonzalez and Tao Lin published a book titled Selected Tweets featuring selections of their tweets over some eight years The novelist Rick Moody wrote a short story for Electric Literature called Some Contemporary Characters composed entirely of tweets br Many commentators have suggested that Twitter radically changed the format of reporting due to instant short and frequent communication According to The Atlantic writers Benjamin M Reilly and Robinson Meyer Twitter has an outsized impact on the public discourse and media Something happens on Twitter celebrities politicians and journalists talk about it and it s circulated to a wider audience by Twitter s algorithms journalists write about the dustup This can lead to an argument on a Twitter feed looking like a debate roiling the country regular people are left with a confused agitated view of our current political discourse In a article in the Columbia Journalism Review Matthew Ingram argued much the same about Twitter s oversized role and that it promotes immediacy over newsworthiness In some cases inauthentic and provocative tweets were taken up as common opinion in mainstream articles Writers in several outlets unintentionally cited the opinions of Russian Internet Research Agency affiliated accounts br br br World leaders br br World leaders and their diplomats have taken note of Twitter s rapid expansion and have been increasingly utilizing Twitter diplomacy the use of Twitter to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens US Ambassador to Russia Michael A McFaul has been attributed as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in posting in English and Russian On October Queen Elizabeth II sent her first tweet to mark the opening of the London Science Museum s Information Age exhibition A study by website Twiplomacy found that of the countries represented at the United Nations had established government Twitter accounts The same study also found that those accounts amounted to Twitter handles used by world leaders and their foreign ministers with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over million followers br According to an analysis of accounts the heads of state of countries and other leading politicians have Twitter accounts that have between them sent more than tweets and have almost million followers However only of these do their own tweeting more than do not subscribe to other politicians and many do not follow any accounts br br br Religion br As of October more than twenty Roman Catholic cardinals managed active Twitter accounts nine of whom were

transparency report published on September Twitter said that Turkey was the first among countries where about percent of removal requests came from followed by Russia France and Germany Twitter stated that between July and December We received legal demands relating to accounts from different countries including Bulgaria Kyrgyzstan Macedonia and Slovenia for the first time As part of evidence to a U S Senate Enquiry the company admitted that their systems detected and hid several hundred thousand tweets relating to the Democratic National Committee email leak During the curfew in Jammu and Kashmir after revocation of its autonomous status on August the Indian government approached Twitter to block accounts accused of spreading anti India content by October nearly one million tweets had been removed as a result br In March shortly after Russia s censorship of Twitter a Tor onion service link was created by the platform to allow people to access the website even in countries with heavy Internet censorship br br br Moderation of tweets br Twitter removed more than propaganda accounts linked to Saudi Arabia Twitter removed tweets from accounts associated with the Russian Internet Research Agency that had tried to influence public opinion during and after the US election In June Twitter also removed propaganda accounts that were spreading biased political narratives for the Chinese Communist Party the United Russia Party or Turkey s President Erdogan identified based on centralized behavior Twitter also removed accounts linked to the governments of Armenia Egypt Cuba Serbia Honduras Indonesia and Iran Twitter suspended Pakistani accounts tied to government officials for posting tweets about the Kashmir conflict between India and Pakistan In February Twitter removed accounts in India that criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi s government for its conduct during Indian farmers protests in br At the start of the COVID pandemic numerous tweets reported false medical information related to the pandemic Twitter announced a new policy in which they would label tweets containing misinformation going forward In April Twitter removed accounts which defended President Rodrigo Duterte s response to the spread of COVID in the Philippines br In November then Chief Technology Officer and future CEO of Twitter Parag Agrawal when asked by MIT Technology Review about balancing the protection of free speech as a core value and the endeavour to combat misinformation said Our role is not to be bound by the First Amendment but our role is to serve a healthy public conversation focus less on thinking about free speech but thinking about how the times have changed br Musk had been critical of Twitter s moderation of misinformation prior to his acquisition of the company After the transition Musk eliminated the misinformation moderation team and stopped enforcing its policy on labeling tweets with misleading information about coronavirus While Twitter had joined a voluntary program under the European Union s to fight disinformation in June Musk pulled the company out of the program in May br br br Birdwatch br br In August development of Birdwatch was announced initially described as a moderation tool Twitter first launched the Birdwatch program in January intended as a way to debunk misinformation and propaganda with a pilot program of contributors weeks after the January United States Capitol attack The aim was to build Birdwatch in the open and have it shaped by the Twitter community In November Twitter updated the Birdwatch moderation tool to limit the visibility of contributors identities by creating aliases for their accounts in an attempt to limit bias towards the author of notes br Twitter then expanded access to notes made by the Birdwatch contributors in March giving a randomized set of US users the ability to view notes attached to tweets and rate them with a pilot of contributors On average contributors were noting times a day in prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine This then increased to on the day of the invasion estimated to be a very small portion of the misleading posts on the platform By March only of contributors had proposed notes in while a Twitter spokeswoman described plans to scale up the program with the focus on ensuring that Birdwatch is something people find helpful and can help inform understanding br By September the program had expanded to users In October the most commonly published notes were related to COVID misinformation based on historical usage In November at the request of new owner Elon Musk Birdwatch was rebranded to Community Notes taking an open source approach to deal with misinformation and expanded to Europe and countries outside of the US br br br Court cases and lawsuits br Twitter Inc v Taamneh alongside Gonzalez v Google were heard by the United States Supreme Court during its term Both cases dealt with Internet content providers and whether they are liable for terrorism related information posted by their users In the case of Twitter v Taamneh the case asked if Twitter and other social media services are liable for
