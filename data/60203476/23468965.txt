physically fit highly intelligent self educated in history and various languages and a supposed descendant of Sir Francis Drake Naughty Dog gave Drake a very strong personality as they did not want him to act blandly thus he often thinks out loud and comments on and complains about the absurdity of his situations Although naturally handsome Drake s appearance is generic and not excessively muscular usually appearing in a plain shirt and jeans to portray the everyman persona North also strongly mixed in his own personality with Drake s ad libbing portions of the character s dialogue and improvising numerous scenes br Emily Rose as Elena Fisher br Elena is an investigative journalist who often finds herself on the same excursions as Drake They begin a relationship and eventually marry and have a child Naughty Dog initially designed Elena solely as a sidekick and a romantic interest to Drake and her personality to complement his However she grows to be as capable as Drake at gun battles and resourcefulness Rose commented that in the first game she s a lot younger she s a lot more naive and she looks at things as being very possible and in the second game has seen murders and adventure the way that any person grows you see that in her She s a little bit more hesitant a little more cynical The games tell the story of her romantic relationship with Drake br Richard McGonagle as Victor Sullivan br A former U S Navy officer Sullivan is a skilled traveler able to navigate planes and submarines He is also able to engage in similar gun battles as Drake and is adept at star based navigation Sullivan is Drake s mentor and father figure having picked him up as a wandering orphan in Colombia Naughty Dog also designed him to fit the everyman persona as he clads himself in odd guayabera style shirts khaki pants and smokes cigars He is also constantly in debt and often relies on other people to fund the pair s adventures br Claudia Black as Chloe Frazer br The only other single player playable character Chloe was designed to be a darker version of the main character and a stark contrast to Elena She is an impulsive and reckless adventurer and is witty devious and fun seeking Chloe is also a very sexually forward character using it to help further her interests At first she appears selfish caring little for anything but her goal but is later seen as a very loyal and determined character She is as skilled as Drake and Sullivan in gun battles and fights while Black also ad libbed segments of dialog to influence Chloe s personality br br br Other media br br br
