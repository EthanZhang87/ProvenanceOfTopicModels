Incident at Loch Ness is a mockumentary starring produced by and written by Werner Herzog and Zak Penn while also serving as the latter s directorial debut The small cast film follows Herzog and his crew Gabriel Beristain Russell Williams II while working on the production of a movie project on the Loch Ness Monster titled Enigma of Loch Ness Incident at Loch Ness won the New American Cinema Award at the Seattle International Film Festival br br br Plot br After a mysterious shot of a body floating in Loch Ness reprised near the end Incident at Loch Ness flashes back to the beginning of a documentary called Herzog in Wonderland being directed by John Bailey with an overview of Herzog s work as he himself begins work for a separate documentary to be called Enigma of Loch Ness in which he is exploring the Loch Ness Monster myth Throughout the film Herzog asserts the Loch Ness Monster is merely a creation of a collective psychological need in society br As the film continues Herzog hosts a dinner party to kick off film production In attendance are his wife Lena Herzog several Hollywood celebrities actors Jeff Goldblum Ricky Jay and Crispin Glover and editor Pietro Scalia and the film s crew Difficulties begin to arise as the untested producer Zak Penn attempts to transform Herzog s film into a high grossing blockbuster In this attempt Penn commits several Hollywood clich s such as hiring a beautiful woman Kitana Baker for a dubious role as a sonar operator and a delusional cryptozoologist Michael Karnow for comic relief br As the shooting progresses the tension between Herzog and Penn escalates with each revelation that Penn is acting in an underhanded manner First it becomes quite apparent the producer has commissioned a fake Nessie to be used Then both Kitana and Karnow are revealed to be actors hired by Penn br In a twist of events when Herzog and his crew are working on their film the crew begins to see what appears truly to be the Loch Ness Monster Herzog and crew become more and more concerned as first the boat s motor fails and then the monster appears to be attacking the vessel in a deepening fog The crew huddles below decks until the monster returns again to ram the boat hard enough to cause it to begin to sink Karnow is thrown overboard during another attack Nessie now clearly visible to the crew Karnow is lost in the fog and presumably eaten by the monster After Penn and the assistant director Robert O Meara sneak away in the liferaft Herzog decides to put on the ship s sole wetsuit and swim to shore for help Before he can do so however Nessie returns to finally sink the ship While holding a camera in a water resistant housing Herzog captures underwater images of a large creature passing him in the murky dark water br The next day Penn is found by vacationers and leads them back to recover all but O Meara and Karnow who are presumed dead At this point it appears that both the documentary film we have been watching and the documentary film we were watching Herzog make could be fictitious However this never becomes completely obvious and the film ends without making it clear exactly who is duping whom br br br Cast

a mockumentary film within a film within a film invented by Penn The ruse is revealed in Easter eggs hidden on the DVD Penn wrote what he calls a scriptment part script part treatment that outlined the specific structure of the film and including key dialogue that was needed in order to advance the plot but left most of the dialogue and interaction up to the participants to work out as improvisation br As shown on the DVD the hoax was on even before photography started as several media outlets announced the upcoming production as an actual film Adding to the verisimilitude is the fact that everyone who appears on screen is a real person and most are in fact who they say they are For example DP Gabriel Beristain and soundman Russell Williams II are well known distinguished professionals who did work on the productions they respectively name on screen br br br Critical reaction br Incident at Loch Ness scored a rating of on Rotten Tomatoes based on reviews It also received a score of on Metacritic based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews br Critic Roger Ebert enjoyed the film giving it stars out of saying Watching the movie is an entertaining exercise in forensic viewing and the insidious thing is even if it is a con who is the conner and who is the connee Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times called it an amusing mock documentary that spends considerable energy artfully trying to make you believe it s real as real can be br br br br br br External links br Incident at Loch Ness at IMDb br Incident at Loch Ness at Rotten Tomatoes br
