average reviews Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale down from the B earned by its predecessor while PostTrak reported of audience members gave it a positive score with saying they would definitely recommend it br John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote Where the first film offered genuine scares this one is suspenseful at best snicker worthy at worst and will beg viewers to recall the time Fonzie got on water skis and tried not to get eaten by a shark Benjamin Lee of The Guardian gave the film a score of stars praising Lang as an effectively imposing physical presence but described the film as an unforgivably dull piece of product that should never have breathed in the first place and said that the antagonists were made as cartoonishly awful as possible adding their ultimate plan for the girl is so laughably repulsive that suddenly problematically Nordstrom is made to seem like the better option William Bibbiani of TheWrap praised Lang and Grace s performances but described the film as a clunky home invasion thriller adding it seems more like the filmmakers wanted to purge their creation of its wickedness than tell a story about that wickedness which makes sense br Jesse Hassenger of The A V Club was more positive in his review of the film giving it a grade of B He wrote Don t Breathe is more effective maybe even a little mischievously insidious in its attempted villain rehab when it sticks to smaller gestures like Norman s already established affinity for cuddly canine sidekicks Christy Lemire writing for RogerEbert com gave the film a score of stars praising Lang s performance and writing the most daring feat of all in Don t Breathe is its attempt to completely rehabilitate Norman It s admirable and even unusual that a studio movie would offer such moral ambiguity in its horror hero and that s definitely what he is here comparatively but the cause for his torment lingers until the end br br br Future br In August lvarez and Sayagues expressed interest in developing a sequel acknowledging that Rocky from the first movie may appear in a future film The filmmakers elaborated that there are plans to explore additional characters from the first movie stating that by the end of Don t Breathe the stories of Norman Nordstrom The Blind Man and Jane Levy s Roxanne Rocky were intentionally left open ended while both characters got away with different illegal activities The pair stated that they intend to explore the consequences that both characters face for their criminal actions with each of their pasts catching up to them in different movies Sayagues stated that they intend to continue Roxanne s story in the future That same month in a number of interviews Lang expressed interest in reprising his role in additional movies br By August of it was reported that a third film was officially in development In October Lang confirmed that he is currently preparing
