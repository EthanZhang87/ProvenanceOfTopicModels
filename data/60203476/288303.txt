Dan Harris the film s writers cameo in scenes of Wolverine s Weapon X flashbacks as surgeons br br br Development br br br Writing br The financial and critical success of X Men persuaded th Century Fox to immediately commission a sequel Starting in November Bryan Singer researched various storylines one of them being the Legacy Virus of the X Men comic book series Singer wanted to study the human perspective the kind of blind rage that feeds into warmongering and terrorism citing a need for a human villain Bryan and producer Tom DeSanto envisioned X as the film series equivalent to The Empire Strikes Back in that the characters are all split apart and then dissected and revelations occur that are significant the romance comes to fruition and a lot of things happen Producer Avi Arad announced a planned November theatrical release date while David Hayter and Zak Penn were hired to write separate scripts Hayter and Penn combined what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay Singer and Hayter worked on another script finishing in October Penn was partially hired when he convinced Singer to not adapt The Dark Phoenix Saga storyline for the film feeling that the franchise s universe should be established much more before going cosmic Instead in what he feels was his major contribution to the project Penn based the film s outline on Chris Claremont s graphic novel X Men God Loves Man Kills before leaving to work on another movie br br Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris were hired to rewrite Hayter and Penn s script in February turning down the opportunity to write Urban Legends Bloody Mary they turned in hundreds of drafts to Singer Angel and Beast appeared in early drafts but were deleted because there were too many characters Dr Hank McCoy can be seen on a television interview in one scene Beast s appearance was to resemble Jim Lee s artwork of the character in the series X Men Legacy Angel was to have been a mutant experiment by William Stryker transforming into Archangel A reference to Dougherty s and Harris s efforts to include Angel remains in the form of an X ray on display in one of Stryker s labs Tyler Mane was to reprise as Sabretooth before the character was deleted In Hayter s script the role eventually filled by Lady Deathstrike was Anne Reynolds a character who appears in God Loves Man Kills as Stryker s personal assistant assassin Singer changed her to Deathstrike citing a need for another kick ass mutant There was to be more development on Cyclops and Professor X being brainwashed by Stryker The scenes were shot but Fox cut them out because of time length and story complications Hayter was disappointed feeling that James Marsden deserved more screentime br Rewrites were commissioned once more specifically to give Halle Berry more screen time This was because of her recent popularity in Monster s Ball earning her the Academy Award for Best Actress A budget cut meant that the Sentinels and the Danger Room were dropped Guy Hendrix Dyas and a production crew had already constructed the Danger Room set In the words of Dyas The control room of the Danger Room was a large propeller that actually rotated around the room so that you can sit up in that control room and travel around the subject who is in the middle of the control room The idea for the traveling is that if it s a mutant has some kind of mind control powers they can t connect br br br Production br Producer Lauren Shuler Donner had hoped to start filming in March but production did not begin until June in Vancouver and ended by November Over sixty four sets were used in thirty eight different locations The film crew encountered problems when there was insufficient snow in Kananaskis Alberta for them to use for some scenes A large amount of fake snow was then applied The idea to have Jean Grey sacrifice herself at the end and to be resurrected in a third installment was highly secretive Singer did not tell Famke Janssen until midway through filming while filming the scene where Xavier and Lehnsherr playing chess Stewart and McKellen had no clue how to play chess so a Canadian grandmaster was called on set for a day Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and two stunt drivers nearly died when filming the scene in which Pyro has a dispute with police officers James Bamford worked as Hugh Jackman s stunt double for rehearsals until he suffered an injury due to Bamford s looks Singer asked him to play the role of Gambit for a cameo appearance but Gambit s scene was deleted from the film s final cut According to Alan Cumming Singer began berating the cast which lead to Halle Berry saying to Singer you can kiss my black ass Cumming would also later say that working on the film was a bad experience br John Ottman composed the score Ottman established a new title theme as well as themes specifically for Magneto Jean Grey Nightcrawler Mystique and Pyro br br br Design and effects br br Singer and Sigel credited Road to Perdition as a visual influence Though Sigel shot the first X Men in anamorphic format he opted to shoot X in Super Sigel felt the recent improvements in film stocks and optics increased the advantages of using spherical lenses even if the blowup to anamorphic must be accomplished optically instead of digitally Sigel noted If you think about it every anamorphic lens is simply a spherical lens with an anamorphizer on it They ll never be as good as the spherical lenses that they emulate Cameras that were used during filming included two Panaflex Millenniums and a Millennium XL as well as an Aaton mm Singer also used zoom lenses more often than he did in his previous films while Sigel used a Frazier lens specifically for dramatic moments br The Blackbird was redesigned and increased in virtual size from feet to feet John Myhre served as the production designer on the first film but Singer hired Guy Hendrix Dyas for X which was his first film as a production designer For scenes involving Stryker s Alkali Base Vancouver Film Studios the largest sound stage in North America was reserved br Visual effects supervisor
