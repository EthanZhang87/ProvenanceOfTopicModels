on John Guillermin s lush screen version there s a nagging feeling throughout that Branagh while hitting the marks of storytelling and design has drained some of the fun out of it Owen Gleiberman of Variety called the film a moderately diverting dessert that carries you right along It never transcends the feeling that you re seeing a relic injected with life serum but that in a way is part of its minor league charm Edward Porter of The Times gave the film three out of five stars saying that its gaudy style combined with the melodrama of the script s modified take on Christie s plot remains diverting even if some of the supposedly Egyptian backdrops look phoney Sandra Hall of The Sydney Morning Herald gave the film four out of five stars writing While the gamble Branagh takes in disinterring Poirot s long neglected sensitive side may be regarded as sacrilege by some I think it works Poirot has a yearning heart br Wendy Ide of The Observer gave the film two out of five stars writing The camera whirls giddily dizzy from the sparkle and spectacle but not quite able to conceal the fact that this is an empty bauble of a movie David Fear of Rolling Stone wrote that the film
