Super Mario is a platform game developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo It was released in Japan and North America in and PAL regions in It is the first Super Mario game to feature D

castle and hides the castle s sources of protection the Power Stars in many different worlds inside magical paintings As Mario the player collects Power Stars to unlock enough of Princess Peach s castle to get to Bowser and rescue Princess Peach br Director Shigeru Miyamoto conceived a D Super Mario game during the production of Star Fox Development lasted nearly three years about one year on design and twenty months on production starting with designing the virtual camera system The team continued with illustrating the D character models at the time a relatively unattempted task and refining sprite movements The sound effects were recorded by Yoji Inagaki and the score was composed by Koji Kondo br Super Mario was highly anticipated by video game journalists and audiences boosted by advertising campaigns and showings at the E trade show It received critical acclaim with reviewers praising its ambition visuals level design and gameplay though some criticized its virtual camera system It is the best selling Nintendo game with nearly twelve million copies sold by br Retrospectively Super Mario has been considered one of the greatest video games of all time Numerous developers have cited it as an influence on D platform games with its dynamic camera system and degree analog control establishing a new archetype for the genre much as Super Mario Bros did for side scrolling platform games It was remade as Super Mario DS for the Nintendo DS in and has been ported to other Nintendo consoles since The game has attracted a cult following spawning many fangames and mods a large speedrunning presence and enduring rumors surrounding game features br br br Gameplay br br br Controls br br Super Mario is a D platformer in which the player controls Mario through various courses Mario s abilities are far more diverse than in previous games He can walk run jump crouch crawl climb swim kick grab objects and punch using the game controller s analog stick and buttons He can execute special jumps by combining a regular jump with other actions including the double and triple jumps long jump backflip and wall jump The player can adjust the camera operated by a Lakitu broadcasting Mario and toggle between first person and third person view br br br Health lives and power ups br Unlike many of its predecessors Super Mario uses a health point system represented by a pie shape consisting of eight segments If Mario has taken damage he can replenish his health either by collecting three types of coins yellow which replenishes one segment red equal to two yellow coins and blue equal to five yellow coins or by walking through a spinning heart Underwater Mario s health instead represents how long he can hold his breath slowly diminishing while underwater and replenishing when he surfaces As in previous Super Mario games he starts with a number of extra lives lost when his health is depleted or he falls into a bottomless pit The game ends if Mario loses all his lives When Mario finishes a course he gains a life for every fifty yellow coins the player collected and extra life mushrooms are hidden in various places such as trees and may chase Mario through the air or fall to the ground and disappear shortly if not collected br In absence of the power ups normally found in previous games such as the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower three colors of translucent blocks red green and blue appear throughout many stages Three switches of the same colors can be found in secret areas that turn their corresponding blocks solid and allow Mario to obtain three types of special cap power ups The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly after doing a triple jump or being shot from a cannon the Metal Cap makes him immune to enemies fire noxious gases allows him to withstand wind and water currents perform on land moves underwater and have unlimited air capacity underwater and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and invulnerable and allows him to walk through some obstacles A shell remains after stomping a Koopa Troopa which Mario can use to surf on water lava and quicksand br br br Setting and objective br The hub world takes place in Princess Peach s Castle which consists of three floors a tower and a basement plus a moat and a courtyard outside the castle The player s main objective is to look for paintings that when jumped into bring them into courses containing Power Stars which upon their collection unlock more of the castle hub world Each of the fifteen courses has seven Power Stars and an additional fifteen are hidden as secrets and as bonuses for a total of Power Stars in the game br The courses are filled with enemies as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance or ask favors such as Bob omb Buddies who will allow Mario to access cannons on request Some Power Stars only appear after completing certain tasks often hinted at by the name of the course These challenges include collecting one hundred yellow coins or eight red coins on a stage defeating a boss racing an opponent and solving puzzles The final level of the game is blocked by endless stairs similar to the Penrose stairs concept but Mario can bypass them by collecting seventy Power Stars The music in the endless stairs before collecting seventy Power Stars resembles a Shepard scale There are many hidden mini courses and other secrets within the castle which may contain extra Power Stars required for the full completion of the game If the player returns to the game after collecting all Power Stars Yoshi can be found on the roof of Princess Peach s Castle who will give the player a message from the developers accompanied by one hundred extra lives and an improved triple jump br br br Plot br The game begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him When he arrives Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within its walls using the power of the castle s Power Stars The Power Stars are hidden in the castle s paintings which serve as portals to other worlds where Bowser s minions keep watch over the Stars Mario explores the castle and enters these worlds gaining access to more rooms as he recovers more Stars Mario unlocks two doors to different floors of the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in hidden worlds After getting at least of the Stars Mario breaks the curse of the endless stairs that block the entrance to Bowser s final hiding place After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle and Bowser escapes swearing revenge he obtains a special Power Star which gives him the Wing Cap and he flies back to the castle s courtyard Peach is released from the stained glass window above the castle s entrance and she rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him br br br Development br br In the early s Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto conceived a D Mario design while developing the game Star Fox for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System Star Fox used the Super FX graphics chip which added more processing power Miyamoto considered using the chip to develop a Super NES game Super Mario FX with gameplay based on an entire world in miniature like miniature trains According to engineer Dylan Cuthbert who worked on Star Fox Super Mario FX was never the title of a game but was the codename of the Super FX chip itself Miyamoto reformulated the idea for the Nintendo not for its greater power but because its controller has more buttons for gameplay At the January Consumer Electronics Show CES where Star Fox made its debut Nintendo s booth demonstrated a talking D polygon animation of Mario s head it returned in the start screen programmed by Giles Goddard br Production of Super Mario began on September at Nintendo s Entertainment Analysis Development division and concluded on May According to Miyamoto the development team consisted of around fifteen to twenty people Development began with the characters and the camera system months were spent selecting a view and layout The original concept involved the fixed path of an isometric game such as Super Mario RPG which moved to a free roaming D design with some linear paths particularly to coerce the player into Bowser s lair according to Giles Goddard br br Super Mario is one of the first games for which Nintendo produced its illustrations internally instead of by outsourcing The graphics were made using N World a Silicon Graphics SGI based toolkit The development team prioritized Mario s movement and before levels were created tested and refined Mario s animations on a simple grid The D illustrations were created by Shigefumi Hino Hisashi Nogami Hideki Fujii Tomoaki Kuroume and Yusuke Nakano and the game was animated by co director Yoshiaki Koizumi and Satoru Takiwaza Y ichi Kotabe illustrator and character designer for the Mario series made a D drawing of Mario from various angles and directed the creation of the character models In an interview with The Washington Post Yoshiaki Koizumi recalled that his challenge was animating the D models without any precedents To assist players with depth perception the team positioned a faux shadow directly beneath each object regardless of the area s lighting Yoshiaki Koizumi described the feature as an iron clad necessity which might not be realistic but it s much easier to play br Miyamoto s guiding design philosophy was to include more details than earlier games by using the Nintendo s power to feature all the emotions of the characters He likened the game s style to a D interactive cartoon Some details were inspired by the developers personal lives for example the Boos are based on assistant director Takashi Tezuka s wife who as Miyamoto explained is very quiet normally but one day she exploded maddened by all the time Tezuka spent at work br Super Mario was first run on an SGI Onyx emulator which only emulated the console s application programming interface and not its hardware The first test scenario for controls and physics involved Mario interacting with a golden rabbit named MIPS after the Nintendo s MIPS architecture processors the rabbit was included in the final game as a Power Star holder Super Mario features more puzzles than earlier Mario games It was developed simultaneously with The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time but as Ocarina of Time was released more than two years later some puzzles were taken for Super Mario The developers tried to include a multiplayer cooperative mode whereby players would control Mario and his brother Luigi in split screen Nevertheless hardware constraints and the developers inability to implement the mode satisfactorily led to its removal br br The music was composed by veteran composer Koji Kondo who created new interpretations of the familiar melodies from earlier media as well as new material Yoji Inagaki was responsible for the sound design tasked with producing hundreds of sound effects He and Kondo felt that music and sound effects were equally important According to Inagaki the average Nintendo game had about sound effects and made comparisons to Ocarina of Time with and The Legend of Zelda Majora s Mask with br Super Mario is one of the first games to feature Charles Martinet as the voice of Mario and Leslie Swan then senior editor of Nintendo Power and English localizer for Super Mario as the voice of Princess Peach br br br Release br Super Mario was first shown as a playable prototype in November at Nintendo Space World This version was only fifty percent complete and only about two percent of texture mapping was finished It featured thirty two courses Miyamoto had hoped to create more possibly up to forty but was ultimately reduced to fifteen According to Nintendo of America chairman Howard Lincoln Miyamoto s desire to add more was a major factor in the decision to delay the Nintendo release from Christmas to Summer Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi later said Game creators can finish games quickly if they compromise But users have sharp eyes They soon know if the games are compromised Miyamoto asked for two more months and I gave them to him unconditionally The game was later shown at E with multiple Nintendo s set up for people to play According to Giles Goddard the stress of the project caused some programmers to quit or move to different departments br br br Advertising and sales br Peter Main Nintendo s vice president of marketing at the time stated Super Mario was meant as the killer app for the Nintendo The US million marketing campaign included videotapes sent to more than five hundred thousand Nintendo Power subscribers and advertisements shown on MTV Fox and Nickelodeon br Super Mario was officially released in Japan in June North America in September and in Europe and Australia in March

prototype s smoothness and how the action was a blast despite the game being only fifty percent complete at the time Ed Semrad of Electronic Gaming Monthly agreed praising the new D animation of Mario

Super Mario received critical acclaim with a score of out of from review aggregator Metacritic based on thirteen reviews and a score of from review aggregator GameRankings which ranked it the eighteenth best video game of all time based on twenty two reviews br The design variety of controls and use of D gameplay received praise from video game publications Maximum found its strongest points were the sense of freedom and its replayability comparing it to Super Mario World and citing its similar gimmick of allowing access to new areas upon finding switches One of GameFan s four reviewers E Storm cited the water levels as overjoy ing and showed how Super Mario delved into an entirely new realm of gaming Official Nintendo Magazine called it beautiful in both looks and design Doug Perry of IGN agreed that it transitioned the series to D perfectly Electronic Gaming Monthly discussed the levels in their initial review praising them for their size and challenge and later ranked it the fourth best console game of all time arguing that it had breached the entire genre of D gaming while working virtually flawlessly br Computer and Video Games editor Paul Davies praised the D environment and said that it enhanced the interaction and described the control scheme as intuitive and versatile Total hailed the gameplay as being so imaginative and having such variety that their reviewers were still hooked after one month Writing for AllGame Jonti Davies commented on the diversity of the gameplay and the abundance of activities found in each course Nintendo Life s Corbie Dillard agreed calling the variety the game s greatest genius Writing for GameRevolution Nebojsa Radakovic described Super Mario as one of the few true D platform games N Magazine likened it to an enormous playground which was a pleasure to experiment in but opined that the exploration element was slightly brought down by how many hints and tips there were Victor Lucas of EP Daily agreed praising the freedom but suggesting players skip all the sign posts br Super Mario also received praise for its graphics GameSpot praised the graphics for being clean yet simple and not detracting from the details of the game world GamePro particularly praised the combination of unprecedented technical performance and art design calling it the most visually impressive game of all time Paul Davies described the graphics as so amazing to see you find yourself stopping to admire them Jonti Davies called the visuals phenomenal and the frame rate respectable Doug Perry found the graphics simple but magnificent a sentiment shared by Next Generation Hyper reviewer Nino Alegeropoulos called it the best looking console game to date and opined that its high resolution and frame rate for the time made it look infinitely better than a cartoon Total said that the graphics lack of pixellation and jagged edges made it look like they were from a top of the range graphics workstation br The camera system received mixed reviews Next Generation found that Super Mario was less accessible than previous Mario games frustrated by the camera s occasional erratic movements and lack of optimal angle Nebojsa Radakovic and Doug Perry added that the camera was sometimes blocked by or went through objects Electronic Gaming Monthly s Dan Hsu Shawn Smith and Crispin Boyer all removed half a point from their scores claiming that the camera sometimes could not move to a wanted angle or rapidly shifted in an undesirable manner a criticism that returned in Electronic Gaming Monthly s Best Games of All Time list Game Informer stated in their re review by present day standards the camera would almost be considered broken Nintendo Power also noted the learning curve of the shifting camera In contrast Corbie Dillard claimed that the camera did not have any problems and that it succeeded at helping the player traverse complex environments This sentiment was shared by Total claiming that there were very few occasions where the camera was at a suboptimal angle Paul Davies acknowledged that he was critical of the camera saying that in some occasions it was difficult to position ideally but ultimately dismissed it as one hiccup of a revolutionary game br br br Awards br Super Mario won numerous awards including various Game of the Year honors by members of the gaming media and in Nintendo s own best selling Player s Choice selection It has been placed high on the greatest games of all time lists by many reviewers including IGN Game Informer Edge Official Nintendo Magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly and Nintendo Power Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded it a Gold award in its initial review and it won Electronic Gaming Monthly s Game of the Year for both editors pick and

Best Console Game and Best Game of Maximum gave it a Maximum Game of the Month Award before its international release ranking it the greatest game the magazine had ever reviewed Digitiser ranked it the best game of above Final Fantasy VII as runner up br br br Legacy br br Super Mario was key to the early success of and anticipation for the Nintendo Lee Hutchinson a former Babbage s employee notes how the game was spurred by a feverish video game press and how the success of the game defied the rule that a wide variety of launch games was necessary for broad appeal Eventually the Nintendo lost much of its market share to Sony s PlayStation partly due to its cartridge and controller design decisions which were reportedly implemented by Miyamoto for Super Mario br In Super Mario was among the entries in the Smithsonian American Art Museum s The Art of Video Games exhibit br br br Influence br Super Mario set many precedents for D platformers as one of the most influential video games The game is known for its nonlinear open freedom which has been acclaimed by video game developers and journalists Up com wrote about its central hub world which provides a safe tutorial and a level selector and is now a staple of the D platformer genre As the genre evolved many of the series s conventions were rethought drastically placing emphasis on exploration over traditional platform jumping or hop and bop action Though some disputed its quality others argued that it established an entirely new genre for the series Its mission based level design inspired game designers such as GoldenEye producer and director Martin Hollis and the development team of Tony Hawk s Pro Skater Dan Houser a prominent figure in the development of the Grand Theft Auto series stated Anyone who makes D games who says they ve not borrowed something from Mario or Zelda of the Nintendo is lying Square Enix has stated that a coincidental meeting with Disney employees resulted in the creation of the Kingdom Hearts series inspired by Super Mario s use of D environments and exploration Chris Sutherland who served as the lead designer for Banjo Kazooie agreed that Super Mario set the benchmark for D platformers and claimed that any other game in the genre on the Nintendo would inevitably be compared with Super Mario br Super Mario introduced a free floating camera that can be controlled independently of the character To increase freedom of exploration and fluid control in a D world Super Mario designers created a dynamic virtual video camera that turns and accelerates according to the character s actions This camera system became the standard for D platformers Nintendo Power praised the game s camera movements along with The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time s addition of the lock on camera and concluded that the two games were trailblazers for the D era PC Magazine s K Thor Jensen considers Super Mario to be the first truly realized D platformer with the integration of camera control into its core gameplay which he called the medium s true evolutionary leap br Super Mario s use of the analog stick was novel offering more precise and wide ranging character movements than the digital D pads of other consoles At the time D games generally only allowed the player to either control the character in relation to a fixed camera angle or in relation to the character s perspective Super Mario s controls in contrast are fully analog and interpret a degree range of motion into navigation through a D space relative to the camera The analog stick allows for precise control over subtleties such as running speed In Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked Super Mario the most important game since they began publication in stating that while there were D games before it Nintendo s was the first to get the control scheme right br In July a pristine sealed copy of Super Mario was auctioned for the largest amount ever paid for a video game Heritage Auctions s video games specialist said It seems impossible to overstate the importance of this title not only to the history of Mario and Nintendo but to video games as a whole br br br Successors br A sequel was planned for the disk drive add on under the codename Super Mario In July Nintendo insiders stated that Miyamoto was assembling a team consisting mostly of developers who had worked on Super Mario Miyamoto affirmed that work on the sequel had only commenced at the time of the E convention The project was canceled due to its lack of progress and the commercial failure of the Nintendo Disk Drive br Super Mario successors include Super Mario Sunshine for the GameCube and Super Mario Galaxy for the Wii building on its core design of power ups and its D open ended gameplay Super Mario Galaxy includes a remake of Super Mario s Whomp s Fortress level called Throwback Galaxy Super Mario D Land and Super Mario D World are departures from the open ended design instead focused on platforming reminiscent of D games br The Nintendo Switch game Super Mario Odyssey returns to Super Mario s open design it includes numerous references to the latter The Mario Suit and Mario Cap which change Mario s appearance to his in Super Mario can be purchased after completing the main storyline Additionally Mario can travel to the Mushroom Kingdom which includes Princess Peach s Castle and its courtyard The Kingdom s Power Moons resemble Super Mario s Power Stars br br br Rumors conspiracy theories and glitches br Rumors spread rapidly after the game s release The most popular was a pervasive rumor that Luigi existed as an unlockable character In IGN offered a prize of if a player could find Luigi to no avail Fueling the rumor was a very blurry message on a statue in the courtyard of Princess Peach s Castle thought to say L is real This was disproved in when a fan received a letter from Nintendo that the programmers included the text as a joke and it was not supposed to say anything In July years and month after the initial release of Super Mario unused assets for Luigi from the scrapped multiplayer mode were discovered in the game s development files in an event known as the Nintendo Gigaleak br Satirical conspiracy theories about the game became popular in and were grouped into the Super Mario iceberg an Internet meme of an iceberg with the less likely theories representing places closer to the bottom of the ocean One popular rumor involves a Wario Apparition based on an E presentation with Charles Martinet voicing a disembodied Wario head Some fans believed that the Wario head remained in some copies of the game Conspiracy theorists also spread the rumor that every copy of Super Mario is personalized claiming that certain bizarre phenomena existed in only certain copies of the game br In the years since the game s release players have used glitches to reach previously unreachable parts of the game including in a coin not meant to be collected Speedrun techniques include the Lakitu skip a glitch that disables a dialog box explaining camera movement the Bob omb clip which uses a glitch in a Bob omb s explosion animation to clip through walls and the backwards long jump glitch which involves the player performing a repetitive move the backwards long jump allowing Mario to reach very high speed values and has numerous applications in speedrunning the latter was patched in the Shind re release Rumble Pak version The Super Mario D All Stars re release also patched this as it was based on the Shind version In YouTuber Vinesauce posted a compilation of various corruptions of the game replicated with a program named naughty Another YouTuber Pannenkoek creates highly technical and analytical videos of Super Mario glitches and mechanics which have been covered many times by the video game press The game has also inspired challenges that attempt to beat it with certain restrictions such as not being able to press the A button requiring deep understanding about the game s mechanics and bugs In May a player named Marbler managed to beat the entire game without pressing the A button br br br Fan projects br

next year fans released a Windows port with support for widescreen displays and K resolution Nintendo enlisted a law firm to remove videos of the port and its listings from websites The port would allow for more graphical mods and forks such as Render which implemented the original high resolution source textures and created new character models and environments resembling those seen in the game s CG renders and Super Mario Plus a fork of the Windows port featuring a new permanent death option bug fixes and an improved camera system Fans created ports for several more platforms including the Nintendo DS PlayStation PlayStation Vita Dreamcast and Android br br br Medical literature br In a study was conducted to see the plasticity effects on the human brain after playing Super Mario
