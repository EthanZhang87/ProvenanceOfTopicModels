id: 3688898
Captain America s shield is a fictional item appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics It is the primary defensive and offensive piece of equipment used by Captain America and is intended to be an emblem of American culture br Over the years Captain America has used several shields of varying composition and design His original heater shield first appeared in Captain America Comics March published by Marvel s s predecessor Timely Comics The circular shield best associated with the character debuted in the next issue Captain America Comics br br In his debut Captain America secretly U S Army Private Steve Rogers is equipped with a heater style shield made from steel After complaints by rival comic book publisher MLJ that the design was too similar to that of its own patriotic hero the Shield Timely Comics replaced the triangular shield with a disc shaped one br While the origin and fate of the original shield were not described in the original comics from the s the shield s fate was revealed decades later in through a retconned story According to the tale King T Chaka of Wakanda met Captain America in early and gave him a sample of vibranium an alien metal with unique vibration absorption properties and found only in Wakanda and the Savage Land The vibranium was used to make Captain America s circular shield and his triangular one was retired br Captain America received a second triangular shield that he used until given his disc shaped shield presented to him by President Franklin Roosevelt This second triangular shield was kept in storage with Rogers other personal effects after the war It was recovered at some point after Rogers joined the superhero team the Avengers in The Avengers and was kept at Avengers Mansion It was destroyed by the supervillain Mr Hyde during a raid on the mansion by Baron Zemo s Masters of Evil and later plucked from time and restored by Zemo in Thunderbolts October The shield along with other sentimental items thought destroyed was returned to Captain America A third triangular shield is kept in the Smithsonian Institution It was used by Captain America when he foiled a terrorist attack on the museum itself after the loss of his usual shield it was then given to him in gratitude This shield is destroyed several issues later by a Kree alien warrior br The shield destroyed by Hyde and restored by Zemo was eventually passed on to Elijah Bradley the teenage hero known as the Patriot and leader of the Young Avengers br br In the history of the original shield was revised In the limited series Captain America Black Panther Flags of Our Fathers Captain America Sergeant Nick Fury and the Howling Commandos meet Azzari grandfather of T Challa the Black Panther and king of Wakanda during World War II Aided by Wakandan military forces they repel a series of Nazi attacks led by the Red Skull and Baron Strucker During the battle the Red Skull wearing a battle suit crushes the triangular shield and Captain America uses a circular vibranium shield provided by T Challa to incapacitate the Skull The weapon serves as the inspiration for the circular shield that the super soldier begins using upon his return to America and the encounter marks the beginning of friendly relations between the United States and Wakanda br br The round shield most associated with Captain America made its debut in Captain America Comics April A near indestructible concavo convex metal disc approximately feet m in diameter weighing pounds kg it has remained Captain America s most constant shield over the decades br In Captain America March it is established that the shield was presented to Rogers by President Franklin D Roosevelt The shield is created by fictional American metallurgist Myron MacLain who had been commissioned by the US government to create an indestructible armor material to aid the war effort MacLain experiments with vibranium br During one of his experiments to fuse vibranium with an experimental steel alloy MacLain falls asleep and awakens to find that the resulting alloy had been set in a tank hatch mold However he was not able to duplicate it because as MacLain described it some unknown factor was present during the experiment that he could not identify The shield was then painted to become Captain America s weapon and symbol MacLain would later attempt to recreate the shield s metal to no avail his experiments instead eventually yielding the super metal adamantium While adamantium has been portrayed as practically indestructable MacLain said was no match for the mysterious Proto Adamantium shield br Rogers shield is more durable than regular adamantium and is essentially indestructible The vibranium grants the shield unusual properties allowing it to absorb all of the kinetic impact and vibrations from any blows that the shield receives without injuring Rogers in the process br Soon after his revival from suspended animation and rescue by the Avengers Rogers briefly experimented with Stark s modification of the shield which included a magnetic mechanism that enabled Rogers to hold the shield through a corresponding magnetic mechanism attached to his left glove as well as communications equipment These modifications allowed Rogers to launch the shield from his glove and control it mid flight However Rogers decided to have those modifications removed and restored the holding straps since he found that he preferred to physically throw the shield himself and the electronic equipment spoiled the shield s balance to enable him to do that effectively br After Rogers death S H I E L D takes over custody of the shield with one replica on display in a museum and another replica buried with Rogers The real one is kept by S H I E L D to be used by the new Captain America whenever they deem it appropriate to train a new one After failing to find a S H I E L D agent capable of throwing it properly Stark offers the shield to Clint Barton known at that time as Ronin who does manage to throw it During his first outing as Captain America Barton encounters the Young Avengers and scolds Kate Bishop for using the Hawkeye name She tells him that the Real Cap gave her that name in honor of his at the time dead friend This leads Barton to refuse to be Captain America The shield is subsequently stolen by the Winter Soldier who did not want anyone else to carry the shield Inevitably in an effort to honor Rogers last wishes Stark offers to let the Winter Soldier Bucky Barnes keep the shield and serve as the new Captain America Bucky accepts This offer is made off the books and only the two of them the Black Widow and the Falcon are aware of the situation br Although Bucky attempted to return the shield to Rogers after his resurrection Rogers let Bucky keep it as he felt that he could do more good in his new role as Commander Steve Rogers rather than Captain America Rogers used a photonic shield in its place when circumstances called for him to go into combat He reclaimed the shield for good after Bucky was apparently killed during the Fear Itself event Bucky really going underground after his past as the Winter Soldier was exposed that also resulted in the shield being broken and reassembled by Asgardian blacksmiths who add some of the mystical metal Uru to the reconstructed shield making it even stronger than before although it is left with a noticeable scar that Rogers decided to keep to give the shield character This premise was not observed in subsequent storylines or considered canon as artists have not continued depicting the shield with the scar br br In the Marvel Comics DC Comics inter company crossover limited series JLA Avengers Superman is given the shield by Captain America to wield in battle in the final confrontation with Krona and is impressed with its might When he asks where he could get one just like it while battling foes Thor replies Enjoy it while thou canst Superman There is none other like it in all the worlds Throughout the final battle the shield changes forms between the pointed shield and the circular shield due to various temporal ripples caused by Krona s equipment and Superman even loses the shield altogether at one point when he morphs into his energy form while Cap reacquires the photonic shield although the metal shield reappears on Superman s arm after he morphs back into his regular form br br Over time the shield has been damaged or destroyed several times within the confines of the Earth continuity br br In The Avengers the Molecule Man used his total control over matter to disintegrate the shield along with Thor s hammer Iron Man s armor and the Silver Surfer s board After he does so he comments that the board s molecules are weird and while there are odd forces interweaving among the hammer s molecules the shield is weirdest of all He later reassembles these items with the exception of the armor as the electronic circuits are too complicated for him to understand at that time br During the Secret Wars limited series the shield is partially destroyed by Doctor Doom who has stolen the power of the godlike being known as the Beyonder Even broken Rogers is able to wield what is left as an effective weapon with the shield largely retaining its balance when thrown When the Beyonder reclaims its power the heroes are temporarily granted the ability to realize their wishes Rogers uses this to reconstruct the shield br During the miniseries The Infinity Gauntlet Thanos who possesses near omnipotence via the Infinity Gauntlet shatters the shield with a blow of his fist while in combat with Captain America The shield is soon restored by Thanos alleged granddaughter Nebula when she obtains the Gauntlet and uses it to undo the events of Thanos s temporary godhood resulting in her erasing the death and destruction that Thanos had caused over the previous hours br Due to a stray molecule being out of place when Rogers reconstructed the shield using the Beyonder s residual power a vibranium cancer was introduced to the shield spreading with each subsequent impact until it finally shattered after it was retrieved from the bottom of the ocean Rogers having lost the shield during a previous mission until War Machine retrieved it Learning that the vibranium cancer could only be cured with the destruction of the shield Rogers took the shield to the main vibranium deposit in Wakanda so that he could use a device created by Tony Stark to halt the cancer before it could contaminate the Wakandan vibranium and destroy the world only to be intercepted by the villain Klaw who sought to absorb the power of the cancer and become stronger Fortunately the amount of energy Klaw had absorbed was released when he struck the shattered shield with full force after Rogers picked it up on reflex resulting in Klaw unintentionally restoring the shield to its original state realigning its molecules and destroying cancer br During the miniseries Fear Itself the Serpent the Asgardian god of fear and brother to Odin breaks it in half with his bare hands after magically feeding on the fear of the entire planet After the battle the shield is repaired by Asgardian dwarves and Tony Stark with added Asgardian uru infused enhancements and Stark s own technology to make it stronger though a scar is left which the dwarves are unable to remove Stark offers a solution to the scar but Rogers declines saying that it gave the old girl a little bit of character This premise was not observed in subsequent storylines which did not depict the shield with the scar br br While Rogers was asleep in suspended animation three other men used the identity of Captain America all using steel replicas of the discus shield The s Captain America was placed in suspended animation after becoming mentally unstable By the time he was revived years later Rogers had returned When the two clashed in the s Captain America s shield was broken br In the s in a story written by Mark Gruenwald Rogers chose to resign the mantle of Captain America rather than submit to the orders of the United States government and took the alias as The Captain instead During this period the role of Captain America was assumed by John Walker the former Super Patriot who used both the costume and the indestructible shield In his new identity of The Captain Rogers initially used a pure adamantium shield provided by Tony Stark but a falling out between the two as a result of the Armor Wars storyline led Rogers to return it He then began to use a pure vibranium shield provided by the Black Panther When Rogers returned to his Captain America identity Walker became the U S Agent and returned the original shield to him Walker would go on to have his own array of different shields over the years the first of which appeared to be the last vibranium shield Rogers was using as the Captain br At one point when Rogers was exiled from the United States and was briefly unable to use his shield Sharon Carter provided him with a photonic energy shield designed to mimic a vibranium matrix br During the time when the shield was lost in the Atlantic Rogers tried using a pure adamantium shield but was unable to get used to the balance He also tried fighting without a shield but also found it awkward br Sharon Carter next provided him with another photonic shield but one whose shape could be controlled to morph the energy field into a wider force field a bo staff or even fire a projection of the shield While he enjoyed the versatility Rogers noticed a number of drawbacks particularly its inability to ricochet Rogers gave one of the energy shield gloves to a freedom fighter in an oppressive future he traveled to and received a replacement from S H I E L D when he got back to his own time br In Secret Avengers he uses a new energy shield which could be generated on either arm or both and was able to be thrown and ricochet off surfaces to hit targets before it dissipates preventing enemies from using it against him A new shield would be generated moments later Moon Knight who had acquired a copy of the technology had it described to him as a zero point energy shield br In Captain America Steve Rogers Steve wields a new version of the triangular shield that can deploy an energy blade on its pointy end and can be divided in two allowing him to use both halves in combat br On Earth Vance Astro wielded the shield for a time as Major Victory br br Captain America s shield is a recurring item throughout the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise Like its comic book counterpart it is circular relatively lightweight but unlike its comic book counterpart it is made of the nearly indestructible Wakandan metal vibranium It is created by Howard Stark and given to Steve Rogers during World War II Within the MCU the shield is seen as a symbol of Captain America s strength and legacy br br In Iron Man a partially completed replica of the shield appears when Pepper Potts watches Tony Stark trying to remove his damaged armor Stark subsequently used the alloy of a prototype made by his father to create his Iron Man armor br In Iron Man Stark s replica of the shield is noticed by Phil Coulson and it is subsequently used to hold the apparatus that allows Stark to discover a new element badassium br In Captain America The First Avenger Steve Rogers uses an ornamental version of the triangular shield during World War II on a musical tour with the USO promoting war bonds He then uses that shield in his first combat mission It is rendered useless after Johann Schmidt punches a large dent in it He later notices an unadorned circular shield among Howard Stark s proposed weapons which Stark says is made of a rare metal called Vibranium that is much stronger and one third the weight of steel Although Stark says it is a prototype Rogers decides to use it after it stops caliber bullets shot at it by Peggy Carter It is painted in the familiar red white and blue pattern modeled after the colors of the American flag Rogers uses the shield throughout the war It protects Rogers from not only standard weapons but also the energy based weapons Hydra uses that are powered by the Tesseract Rogers also uses the shield as an offensive weapon and becomes highly skilled in accurately throwing deflecting and retrieving it Rogers has the shield with him when he is frozen in In Rogers and the shield are discovered by S H I E L D agents in the Arctic within a crashed frozen aircraft br In The Avengers Rogers uses the shield while fighting against Loki and is able to deflect an energy blast from his Mind Stone powered scepter The shield also guards Rogers from Thor s hammer Mjolnir and the subsequent shockwave created when the two weapons collide causes both Thor and Rogers to fall to the ground and decimate nearby foliage He also uses the shield during the battle against the Chitauri and Stark deflects his energy beams off it to amplify their power br In Iron Man Trevor Slattery is seen with a tattoo depicting the shield on the back of his neck br In Thor The Dark World Loki s illusion impersonating Rogers also depicts a recreation of his shield br In Captain America The Winter Soldier Rogers uses his shield while fighting against Georges Batroc and his men It protects both him and Natasha Romanoff from a high powered explosive He later uses it to crash through walls in an office building while chasing the Winter Soldier When Rogers throws it at the Winter Soldier he uses his metal arm to catch and throw the shield back much to Rogers surprise Rogers uses the shield to absorb some of the impact after he jumps from the Triskelion building and lands unharmed hundreds of feet below He also uses it to take down a Quinjet and it protects him and Romanoff against a ballistic missile He later uses it in confrontations against the Winter Soldier where it counters the latter s metal arm and also takes a direct hit from a grenade launcher without damage br In Avengers Age of Ultron the handles of the shield are outfitted with magnetic elements allowing Rogers to better control the shield and call it back to his gauntlets Rogers throws and calls it back to him while riding his motorcycle into battle He and Thor combine the shield and Mjolnir to create massive shockwaves capable of destroying Hydra tanks During Ultron s initial attack Clint Barton accurately throws the shield to Rogers who uses it to completely obliterate an Ultron sentry He continues to use it in combat throughout against Ultron his sentries and Pietro Maximoff the latter of which he knocks unconscious with it Ultron laments that the shield which he calls a frisbee is an example of human foolishness given the versatility of the vibranium it is made of During his confrontation with Ultron Rogers loses the shield when it falls off a truck but it is retrieved by Romanoff and returns it to Rogers The shield guards against and reflects Ultron s energy beams and pierces Ultron s shoulder when Rogers kicks it at him He later throws the shield to Romanoff during the Battle of Sokovia and she uses it to defend herself against Ultron s sentries br In Captain America Civil War Rogers uses the shield throughout During his fight with Brock Rumlow he throws the shield high into the air to protect himself and nearby civilians after an explosive device is thrown and sticks to it He uses the shield as he attempts to protect Barnes from law enforcement in Bucharest When he confronts T Challa the shield is scratched by T Challa s vibranium claws The United Nations seizes the shield temporarily until it is stolen and returned to Rogers by Sharon Carter Later the shield is temporarily stolen by Peter Parker but quickly returned to Rogers by Scott Lang He uses the shield in confrontations with Parker T Challa James Rhodes and Stark Barnes uses the shield to attack Rhodes and Stark as well During his final confrontation with Stark Rogers uses it to disable some of his armor s flight capability deflect Stark s energy beams and finally in combination with Barnes to overwhelm Stark After he uses the shield to destroy Stark s arc reactor and disable the Iron Man armor As Rogers leaves with Bucky Stark calls out that his father Howard made the shield for Rogers and that he does not deserve it Rogers only response is to leave the shield with Stark br In Spider Man Homecoming video footage captured by Spider Man during the events of the Civil War depicting the title character stealing the shield from Rogers is shown br In Avengers Endgame Stark returns the shield to Rogers as a gesture of reconciliation between them Rogers takes the shield with him when he time travels via the Quantum Realm to an alternate where he faces an alternate version of himself who mistakes him for Loki in disguise leading to the two versions using their shields to fight each other Later during the battle against an alternate Thanos Rogers proves worthy of using Thor s hammer Mjolnir and combines Mjolnir with his shield for combination attacks However the shield is fractured by Thanos double sided blade with a fractured third of it being broken off by Thanos s attack Just before going to confront Thanos alone Rogers uses the shield s strap to set his injured arm Following the Avengers victory an elderly Rogers returning from an alternate timeline bequeaths a new alternate shield now fully repaired and with a slight design change to the star in the center to Sam Wilson br In The Falcon and the Winter Soldier Wilson gives the alternate new shield to the US government to be placed in the Smithsonian museum exhibit dedicated to Rogers The government then gives the shield to John Walker who they name the new Captain America Walker uses the shield in combat throughout the series and proves proficient in using it Karli Morgenthau leader of the Flag Smashers calls the shield a symbol of a bygone era and believes it should be destroyed During a confrontation with the Dora Milaje

The shield appears identical to the one used by the other Captain Carter in What If Carter uses the shield to battle Wanda Maximoff However she is killed when Wanda bisects her with the shield br br In production for Captain America The First Avenger the shield which is depicted as both a defensive tool and a weapon came in four types metal fiberglass rubber and computer graphics CG Prop master Barry Gibbs specified that We had the hero shield which was made of aluminum for our beauty shots and close up work We then created a lighter shield that was aluminum faced with fiberglass back for use on a daily basis And then we had a stunt shield made of polyurethane which is sort of a synthetic rubber and we made an ultrasoft one we put on Evans back so that if there were an accident it wouldn t hurt him Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said Evans would practice swinging the practical shield so he knew the arc and the speed at which he should move We would take the shield from him and shoot the scene with him miming it Then we would add in a CG shield br The premise of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier revolves around a moment in the film Avengers Endgame which depicts Steve Rogers bequeathing the shield and the mantle of Captain America to his friend Sam Wilson Marvel Studios chief executive Kevin Feige said this was intended to be a classic passing of the torch from one hero to another but when Marvel Studios got the opportunity to make television series for Disney they decided to expand this into an entire story about Wilson who is a Black man

Universe The shield was destroyed when Gregory Stark smashed it with Thor s hammer though Captain America would wield another later br In Ultimate Nightmare Ultimate Captain America encounters his Russian counterpart who has been driven mad due to being trapped in an underground complex for many years He has created a replica of the shield which turns out to be made out of scrap metal and human remains and grafted directly onto his forearm and which proves far less powerful than Captain America s own shield br br In the s Captain America TV movies Steve Rogers is given a transparent plexiglass shield painted with concentric stripes red and clear transparent and a central star The shield was designed to act as the windscreen for his motorcycle but could be detached and used in its traditional offensive defensive role when Rogers goes on foot Furthermore the shield can apparently return to Rogers in a smooth arc when thrown without needing to be ricocheted and with enough force to knock a man down in the return path br In the company Factory X released a line of licensed prop replicas of items from the Marvel Universe An aluminum replica of Captain America s shield was among

Gruenwald who either commissioned it or received it as a gift It eventually found its way into the hands of Marvel editor Tom Brevoort and was kept in his office until being passed on to Colbert In a pre show conversation with a studio audience Colbert speaking out of character said that when his wife saw the shield and the accompanying note she started crying He confessed he was bemused by her reaction to a fictional character sending a prop shield to a fictional version of himself The shield was put on display hanging on the wall along with other trophies on The Colbert Report set for

effective against the bullets of German soldiers but was not of practical use when he could use much more advanced technology br In the action comedy Free Guy which takes place in a video m game world
