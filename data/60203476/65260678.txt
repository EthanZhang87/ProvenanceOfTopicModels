Among Us is a online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by American game studio Innersloth The game allows for cross platform play it was released on iOS and Android devices in June and on Windows later that year in November It was ported to the Nintendo Switch in December and on the PlayStation PlayStation Xbox One and Xbox Series X S in December A virtual reality adaptation Among Us VR was released on November br Among Us takes place in space themed settings where players are colorful armless cartoon astronauts Each player takes on one of two roles most are Crewmates but a small number are Impostors Crewmates work to complete assigned tasks in the game while identifying and voting out suspected Impostors who appear identical to Crewmates using social deduction while Impostors have the objective of killing the Crewmates The game was inspired by the party game Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing br While the game was initially released in to little mainstream attention it received a massive rise in popularity in due to many Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it during the COVID pandemic It received favorable reviews from critics for fun and entertaining gameplay The game and its stylized characters have been the subject of various internet memes br br Among Us is a multiplayer game for four to fifteen players Up to three players are randomly and secretly chosen to be the Impostors each round As of five playable maps are available a spaceship called The Skeld an office building called MIRA HQ a planet base called Polus The Airship a setting from Innersloth s Henry Stickmin series and the Fungle a mushroom jungle map The Crewmates can win the game one of two ways either by completing all assigned tasks or by ejecting all Impostors Impostors can likewise win in two ways either by killing or ejecting all Crewmates or by sabotaging a critical system on the map provided the Crewmates do not resolve it in time At the start of the game Crewmates are assigned tasks to complete around the map in the form of minigames minipuzzles and simple toggles mostly consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as fixing wires and downloading data Impostors cannot complete tasks but may pretend to perform fake tasks to feign appearance as legitimate Crewmates Impostors however can perform sabotages ranging from minor such as disabling lights limiting the Crewmates vision to critical such as disabling oxygen generators requiring immediate counteraction by Crewmates to prevent their deaths Impostors may enter and traverse ventilation ducts commonly known as venting and kill nearby Crewmates To help Crewmates identify Impostors there are various surveillance systems on each map such as security cameras on The Skeld a door log system with sensors in MIRA HQ and a vitals indicator in Polus that shows the living status of all players In addition certain visual tasks provide animated cues such as scanning oneself in the Skeld s medbay As Impostors cannot perform tasks Crewmates can use visual tasks to confirm their identity to nearby Crewmates br Any living player may call a group meeting by reporting a dead body or by pressing an Emergency Meeting button During meetings players discuss via the in game text chat or an external voice chat application such as Discord who they believe to be Impostors based on available witness testimonies with Impostors lying to hide their identity or falsely accusing other players Impostors can be identified beyond reasonable doubt if they are seen venting or killing a Crewmate but ultimately players must weigh the veracity or value of each other s statements Players then vote for who they believe is an Impostor if a plurality vote is obtained the player who received the most votes is ejected from the game Players who are killed or ejected become ghosts which can still perform tasks Crewmates or sabotages Impostors but are otherwise unable to be seen by or interact with living players Effectively spectators and ghosts may see and pass through walls follow players or other ghosts and chat with other ghosts br A November update added additional specialized roles to the game Crewmates can also be Engineers Scientists as well as normal crewmates When a crewmates dies they can be a guardian angel The guardian angel role is not given at the beginning of the game Engineers can traverse vents like Impostors albeit to a limited capacity On the other hand impostors can stay in the vent as long as they want Scientists can check vitals from anywhere on the map to see if any player has been killed this round Ghosts of Crewmates can become Guardian Angels which can temporarily protect living players from being killed Impostors likewise can be Shapeshifters allowing them to temporarily morph into other players and assume their color and appearance However they might leave evidence behind depending on the game settings br An alternative Hide and Seek game mode was added in December There are no meetings or ejections and a single Impostor whose identity is known to the Crewmates attempts to kill all Crewmates within a fixed countdown timer Crewmates must hide or flee from the Impostor and can complete tasks to roll down the timer as well as enter vents for a brief time to hide from the Impostor Impostors cannot sabotage or vent in this mode Crewmates are also given a display showing their proximity to the Impostor as well as the number of remaining Crewmates Near the end of the game the impostor gets the seek button allowing them to see where crewmates are br Before each game various options can be adjusted to customize aspects of gameplay such as player movement speed the allowed number of emergency meetings number of tasks and visual tasks or whether or not an Impostor is revealed after being voted off allowing participants to manually balance the game s settings to their desires Players may modify their own appearances with cosmetics including skins hats visors and pets some of which are purchasable as microtransactions br br Among Us was inspired by the live party game Mafia and the science fiction horror film The Thing The idea for the concept was originally given by Marcus Bromander co founder of Innersloth who had played Mafia since he was a kid In the original game function cards were dealt and players wandered around a house aimlessly while another person secretly killed the players drawing a finger around their neck Most of its mechanics were still present in Among Us but the team wanted to alleviate the need to create an interesting home model and have someone wandering around in a boring environment So they decided that the game would be space themed and also added tasks which according to Forest Willard programmer at Innersloth changed several times during development br Development began in November The game was initially intended to be a mobile only local multiplayer game with a single map Bromander paused development on Innersloth s other game The Henry Stickmin Collection in order to build Among Us first map The Skeld When they began developing the first map they intended that the ship was always in crisis and that the Impostors could do tasks However they found this setup stressful and decided that it would not leave much time for detective work and informed meeting conversations Willard described playtesting as painful and frustrating as the game would break down during sessions forcing him to send playtesters new builds off of Google Play The team tested the game with of their friends and never tested the game with or the maximum of players The game was developed using the Unity engine br The game was released in June to Android and iOS under the AppID spacemafia Shortly after release Among Us had an average player count of to concurrent players Bromander blamed the game s poor release on Innersloth being really bad at marketing The team nearly abandoned the project multiple times but continued work on it due to a small but vocal player base adding in online multiplayer new tasks and customization options The game was released on Steam on November Cross platform play was supported upon release of the Steam version Originally the game had no audio to avoid revealing hidden information in a local setting and Willard mixed sounds from numerous sound packs to compose the SFX during the game s Steam release br On August Innersloth released a second map MIRA HQ a tightly packed headquarters roughly the size of The Skeld A third map Polus was added on November and is set in a research station The fourth map the Airship was released on March and is based on a location in the Henry Stickmin universe MIRA HQ and Polus originally cost players US via in app purchase Their prices were reduced to US on January then made free on June While the map packs are still available for purchase on all platforms they now only provide the player the skins that were bundled with the maps According to programmer Forest Willard the team stuck with the game a lot longer than we probably should have from a pure business standpoint putting out regular updates to the game as often as once per week This led to a steady increase in players causing the game s player base to snowball Bromander attributed this to the studio having enough savings to keep working on the game even while it was not selling particularly well br br In August the team shifted focus onto a sequel Among Us During this time Forest Willard and Amy Liu continued to update Among Us increasing the maximum player base adding four servers and three regions and implementing longer multiplayer codes to support more concurrent games On September the team announced that they abandoned development of the sequel in favor of reworking the original game s codebase which they described as outdated and not built to support adding so much new content so the team made plans to rework the game s core code to enable adding new features The team subsequently announced their plans to fix the game s server issues and widespread cheating problem as well as add a system for banning disruptive players In October colorblind support for the wires task was added to the Among Us beta on Steam as well as some

welcoming and respectful place Punishment includes temporary to permanent bans They also stated that reports would be viewed manually and not by bots that account creations would be required if

entirely new communication system for the game Versions of the game for Xbox consoles were later announced br Among Us was released for the Nintendo Switch on December the same day it was announced

pandemic was frequently cited as a reason for the popularity of Among Us as it allowed for socializing despite social distancing br br Emma Kent of Eurogamer believed that the release of Innersloth s The Henry Stickmin Collection also contributed to awareness of Among Us and PC Gamer s Wes Fenlon credited Twitch streamer SR Kaif for prim ing Among Us for its big moment Fenlon also praised Among Us for improvements over other popular tabletop games that had been inspired by Mafia such as Secret Hitler He said other video game adaptations of Mafia such as Town of Salem and Werewolves Within were just add ing an online interface for the basic Werewolf rules whereas Among Us is as an entirely new take on the concept Along with Fall Guys and the Jackbox Party Packs Among Us provided a narrative less experience that helped to avoid the cultural trauma of the pandemic according to M J Lewis of Wired br The game s popularity continued into the following months YouTube reported that videos about Among Us were viewed billion times in September and TikTok videos related to Among Us had over billion views in October YouTuber CG wrote a song based on the game in September titled Show Yourself and gained over million views in four months In September the game exceeded million downloads and its player count rose to million concurrent players nearly thousand of which were on Steam then peaked at million in late September The sudden increase in players overloaded the game s server which according to Willard was a totally free Amazon server and it was terrible This forced him to work quickly under crunch time to resolve these issues br br In August Innersloth opened an online store for Among Us themed merchandise The game s popularity inspired many original songs fan art and internet memes Willard expressed that fan created content really is the best part of making Among Us and Bromander called it my favorite thing to see The game popularized the slang word sus meaning suspicious or suspect which had been used before the game s release Other slang terms as well as internet memes popularized and inspired by Among Us include sussy and sussy baka derived from sus when the imposter is sus a meme based on Among Us usually alongside an edited photo of Jerma and amogus a satiric misspelling of Among Us In addition the meme Among Us everywhere is a phenomenon where unexpected objects resemble the Crewmate character In September sus was added to Merriam Webster s dictionary br During its time of widespread popularity Among Us was controversially played by the U S Navy Esports team in which players on the stream used in game names referencing the slur nigger Gamer Word and the bombing of Nagasaki Japan and Nagasaki The stream was deemed offensive and intolerable by some viewers The sailor responsible for the stream was later kicked off the team In October U S Representatives Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Ilhan Omar streamed the game alongside

game received several mods made by the community which added roles game modes cosmetics etc Among Us was featured in Twitch Rivals an online gaming tournament which was held on December During the event players were able to receive an exclusive pet called Glitch Pet which is the Twitch logo br br In May an eBay user named Tav listed a Chicken McNugget from the BTS Meal by McDonald s for online auction The nugget was listed because the seller felt it resembled a Crewmate and was inspired by a auction for a Cheeto that looked similar to the gorilla Harambe which sold for US Despite Tav only expecting the nugget to sell for around US a bidding war began two days later and the nugget was sold to an anonymous buyer for US Tav decided to include Szechuan sauce after a comment on social media from Xbox Several news outlets covered the auction who largely cited it as an example of an absurd price caused by internet memes and following the sale multiple other listings selling nuggets of a similar shape were made in hopes of profiting from the popularity of the original listing Several TikTokers and QAnon adjacent conspiracy theorists promoted misinformation and rumors claiming that the high price of the listing was a front for child sex trafficking In the listing was recognized by Guinness World Records as the most expensive chicken nugget sold at online auction That October Chilean chicken brand Super Pollo partnered with Innersloth to launch a Crewmate shaped chicken nugget into the Earth s thermosphere br br In mid October a hacker known as Eris Loris began targeting mainly North American servers Several players on the Among Us subreddit and Twitter reported this player hacking their lobbies and spamming in game chat with promotions for his YouTube channel links to his Discord server and controversial political messages Eris Loris threatened to personally hack players that refused to subscribe to his YouTube channel The Discord server has been found to contain large amounts of offensive content such as racist language gore pornography and images depicting animal abuse br A Eurogamer report from October features an interview with a person claiming to be Eris Loris conducted via the Discord server from one of the links provided in the hacked games In the interview Loris claims he created the bot responsible for the hacks in only six hours and had enlisted up to volunteers to form a botnet which boosted the strength of their attacks Loris claimed that the hack impacted million players in million games He added that the hacks were part of a publicity stunt to influence players to vote for Donald Trump in the United States presidential election br Innersloth added an in game message warning players about the hacks on October and released a statement on Twitter the next day They said they were super aware of the hacking issue and stated that an emergency server update would be pushed out to combat the hacks They encouraged players to stick to private games and to avoid playing on public ones until the update was released The team plans to address the hacking vulnerabilities as part of a planned overhaul for the game At the end of January players

of score based on critic reviews while the Nintendo Switch version received a of score based on critic reviews both them indicating generally favorable reviews It was also considered one of the Best PC Games for being ranked th and as the Best Discussed PC Game of Since December IGN considered it one of s best reviewed games so far br Elliott Osange of Bonus Stage considered that the game is silly fun but felt that it is more fun to be an Impostor Craig Pearson of Rock Paper Shotgun had the same opinion found playing as an Impostor a lot more fun than playing as a Crewmate which he called exhausting In reference to the game s popularity among streamers Evelyn Lau of The National said Watching the reactions of people trying to guess who the imposter is and sometimes getting it very wrong or lying terribly about not being the imposter is all quite entertaining Alice O Conner of Rock Paper Shotgun described the game as Mafia or Werewolf but with minigames Andrew Penney of TheGamer said the game was worth it for the price and that who you play with dictates how fun the game is L avis de Tiraxa of Jeuxvideo com praised the game s Freeplay mode which offers newer players to browse the map alone to accommodate the places as they would need to play several games in order to perfect their strategies br Leana Hafer from IGN stated in her verdict on the game I don t have any sus that this will be the last game of its breed to make a splash since we re already seeing its influence on even mega games like Fortnite As a negative point she pointed out some technical problems such as the difficulty of finding rooms that aren t already full or are a long way from getting there She also lamented the lack of mechanic to punish players who rage quit when they don t get to play as impostor or are caught dead to rights in the middle of a murder Tiraxa of Jeuxvideo com was more critical of the game lamenting the lack of an inbuilt voice chat server bugs which prevent some from joining the party in a totally unexplained way public servers with strangers which she considered less entertaining than private servers with friends and the large development progress stating that the game has a bit of a way to go before it reaches its full potential The mobile version of the game although being free to play was criticized Osange of Bonus Stage called the presence of ads and in app purchases of cosmetic changes that are mostly available for free on the PC version nonsense He also called the PC version stable but also stated that the Android version is a device by device situation br The Nintendo Switch version received some criticism William Antonelli of Insider said that the Switch controls give many tasks a satisfying game response However he also stated that most of the tasks could be done quickly with the Switch s touchscreen control which can only be used when the console is in handheld mode He noted that many of the game s tasks are difficult to complete using a gamepad which is required when the console is connected to a larger screen and considered this version inferior to the PC and mobile versions He also stated that the communication system is frustrating as using the joystick to select letters is slow and said the fact that the game has support for multiplayer across multiple platforms gives Switch players immediate disadvantage PJ O Reilly of Nintendo Life noted that the Switch lacked much of the additional content available on other platforms such as skins which he called a shame br Among Us has been frequently compared to Fall Guys as both became popular as party games during the COVID pandemic the developers of both games have positively acknowledged each other on Twitter Comparisons have also been drawn between the two games avatars which have been said to look like jelly beans Among Us has also been compared to The Thing Town of Salem Werewolves Within and Secret Hitler br br As of September Steam Spy estimated

mode in Fortnite Creative in December called The Spy Within which had very similar mechanics to Among Us in which among ten players the others have to complete tasks to earn enough coins within a limited time while trying to deduce which two players are trying to sabotage that effort Epic later added another official and internally developed limited mode to Fortnite called Impostors in August which was recognized as even a closer take on Among Us as the same basic mechanics as The Spy Within were used but now taking place within an underground bunker with a layout similar to the Among Us map Innersloth responded in frustration to this mode which gave no credit to Innersloth Innersloth s co founder Marcus Bromander stated Is it really that hard to put more effort into putting your own spin on it though while studio representative Callum Underwood said that Innersloth was open to collaborations Just ask and if you follow some basic rules it s usually fine In an October blog posting Epic Games did credit Innersloth and Among Us as inspirations for the Impostors mode On June both Epic and Innersloth announced a collab between Fortnite and Among Us with a back bling of a Crewmate
