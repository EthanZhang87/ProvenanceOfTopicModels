Hartman and Joan Lunden from the late s to the mid s with Charles Gibson and Lunden and in April with Roberts and Stephanopoulos br Good Morning America won the first three Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Morning Program sharing the inaugural award with Today and winning the and awards outright br br On January ABC launched AM America in an attempt to compete with NBC s Today The program was hosted by Bill Beutel and Stephanie Edwards with Peter Jennings reading the news Jennings had been a replacement for Bob Kennedy who had been scheduled to be the program s newsreader but died two months before the premiere from bone cancer Because the show could not find an audience against Today and its anchor team of Jim Hartz and Barbara Walters ABC sought a new approach The network found that one of its affiliates WEWS in Cleveland Ohio had been pre empting AM America in favor of airing a locally produced show called The Morning Exchange br Unlike AM America and Today The Morning Exchange featured an easygoing and less dramatic approach by offering news and weather updates only at the top and bottom of every hour and using the rest of the time to discuss general interest entertainment topics The Morning Exchange also established a group of regular guests who were experts in certain fields including health entertainment consumer affairs and travel Also unlike both the NBC and ABC shows The Morning Exchange was not broadcast from a newsroom set but instead one that resembled a suburban living room br In the process of screening the Cleveland morning program as a creative source ABC also began looking at another local show Good Morning which was produced by Boston ABC affiliate WCVB TV Good Morning was very similar in format to The Morning Exchange but with a lesser emphasis on news and weather In fact once the revamped ABC morning show took to the air late in under the title Good Morning America WCVB station manager Bob Bennett accused ABC entertainment president Fred Silverman of deliberately stealing the title of Good Morning no legal cease and desist action was finalized against ABC in the matter however The launch of Good Morning America did result in the Boston morning show changing its name to Good Day Currently WCVB s morning news program is titled EyeOpener br ABC took an episode of The Morning Exchange and used it as a television pilot The format replaced AM America on Monday November as Good Morning America The first cohosts were actor David Hartman and actress Nancy Dussault Dussault was replaced in April by Sandy Hill previously at KABC TV in Los Angeles The show s title is the same as the beginning of the chorus of Steve Goodman s song City of New Orleans br For the first seven years weather forecasts were presented by John Coleman former chief meteorologist for ABC owned and operated station WLS TV in Chicago who left GMA in to start The Weather Channel with Landmark Communications CEO Frank Batten Dave Murray later chief meteorologist at KTVI in St Louis provided the forecasts for both Good Morning America and ABC s early morning news program ABC News This Morning from to In August he was replaced by Spencer Christian who worked at WABC TV in New York City and served as fill in meteorologist for both Coleman and Murray whenever they were away on vacation or assignment br br The program s Nielsen ratings climbed slowly but steadily throughout the s and into the s while Today experienced a slight slump in viewership especially with Walters decision to leave NBC for a job at ABC News On August Tom Brokaw began anchoring Today while the program began a search for a female co host Within a year Today managed to beat back the Good Morning America ratings threat with Brokaw and new co host Jane Pauley featuring art and entertainment contributor Gene Shalit Good Morning America continued to threaten Today s ratings dominance into the s especially after Brokaw left the latter program to become co anchor of NBC Nightly News with Roger Mudd for months before being named sole anchor of that program For the first time Good Morning America became the highest rated morning news program in the United States as Today fell to second place br At the outset Good Morning America was a talk program with a main host Hartman who was joined by a sidekick co host Dussault and Hill were scripted as less than equal hosts In an exasperated Hill left Good Morning America after run ins with Hartman who was said to have had a problem with strong women She was replaced by Joan Lunden then a reporter at ABC s New York City flagship WABC TV Hartman and Lunden led the show through several years of success Lunden s popularity led to her promotion to co anchor in and to more equal footing with Hartman than any woman before her The partnership ended on February when Hartman retired after broadcasts br After Hartman s departure Lunden was paired with ABC News correspondent Charles Gibson on February which ultimately resulted in ratings for the program skyrocketing The team of Lunden and Gibson became the most popular news partnership on television in the late s and early s and for the first time Good Morning America regularly won the ratings against Today At one point prior to Spencer Christian s arrival in forecasts on the program were provided by WXYZ TV chief meteorologist Jerry Hodak via a split screen between the WXYZ studios in Detroit and the Good Morning America set in New York City br br Good Morning America entered the s with continued overwhelming ratings success Gibson and Lunden became a hard team to beat however the program stumbled from its top spot in late falling to second place behind Today in what would begin a year streak as the top rated morning news program for that show which began the week of December Lunden began to discuss working less and mentioned to network executives that the morning schedule is the hardest in the business ABC executives promised Lunden that a prime time program Behind Closed Doors would premiere on the network in br On September Lunden decided to step down as host of Good Morning America after years and was replaced by ABC News correspondent Lisa McRee The pairing of Gibson and McRee fared well in the ratings However ratings sharply declined when Gibson also left the show to make way for Kevin Newman on May With McRee and Newman as anchors longtime viewers of Good Morning America switched to Today whose ratings skyrocketed br br To improve Good Morning America s ratings performance which briefly fell to third place among the morning shows in January ABC News management selected Shelley Ross from the field of executive producer candidates As part of Ross s proposed changes Ross ousted the McRee Newman team and lobbied to bring in Diane Sawyer and team her with Charles Gibson who had been reluctant to return On January the Gibson Sawyer team paired by Ross debuted on air which during the first full season resulted in a dramatic increase in viewership while all other network news franchises saw losses br br The show moved from the ABC News headquarters in Manhattan s Lincoln Square district to its present home at the Times Square Studios on September The new location made it possible for the program to feature a live audience inside the studio similar to the Window on the World set used by Today Under Ross Good Morning America became a competitive news operation with more exclusive bookings news and live stock market updates for West Coast viewers and new on screen graphics that included a news ticker Good Morning America began originating entire shows from unique locations which according to Nielsen Media Research resulted in more people watching the program and for longer periods of time GMA became the first to originate a live show from an aircraft carrier during wartime the USS Enterprise from the White House after the Columbine High School massacre from The Pentagon for the reopening of the wing damaged during the September attacks in from The Vatican for the th anniversary of Pope John Paul II s election as Pope and from the Tower of London on the th anniversary of Elizabeth II s accession to the throne Viewership during this time increased by nearly one million households and revenue soared br Although Today remained the top rated morning news show the Sawyer Gibson and Ross team inched close creating a viable rival According to Linda McLoof executive director of news research at ABC News from to When Shelley left her viewing momentum was initially sustained but a season later the audience began to decline It is like passing the baton in a relay race Antonio Mora served as newsreader for the program until March when he left to become an anchor at CBS owned and operated station WBBM TV in Chicago He was replaced by former ESPN anchor and correspondent Robin Roberts br br On May ABC News announced that Robin Roberts would be promoted from
