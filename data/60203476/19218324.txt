id: 19218324
Anabolic steroids also known as anabolic androgenic steroids AAS are a class of drugs that are structurally related to testosterone the main male sex hormone and produce effects by binding to the androgen receptor AR Anabolic steroids have a number of medical uses but are also used by athletes to increase muscle size strength and performance br Health risks can be produced by long term use or excessive doses of AAS These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels increased low density lipoprotein and decreased high density lipoprotein acne high blood pressure liver damage mainly with most oral AAS and left ventricular hypertrophy These risks are further increased when athletes take steroids alongside other drugs causing significantly more damage to their bodies The effect of anabolic steroids on the heart can cause myocardial infarction and strokes Conditions pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS In women and children AAS can cause irreversible masculinization br Ergogenic uses for AAS in sports racing and bodybuilding as performance enhancing drugs are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain advantage in physical competitions Their use is referred to as doping and banned by most major sporting bodies Athletes have been looking for drugs to enhance their athletic abilities since the Olympics started in Ancient Greece For many years AAS have been by far the most detected doping substances in IOC accredited laboratories Anabolic steroids are classified as Schedule III controlled substances in many countries meaning that AAS have recognized medical use but are also recognized as having a potential for abuse and dependence leading to their regulation and control In countries where AAS are controlled substances there is often a black market in which smuggled clandestinely manufactured or even counterfeit drugs are sold to users br br br Uses br br br Medical br br Since the discovery and synthesis of testosterone in the s AAS have been used by physicians for many purposes with varying degrees of success These can broadly be grouped into anabolic androgenic and other uses br br br Anabolic br Bone marrow stimulation For decades AAS were the mainstay of therapy for hypoplastic anemias due to leukemia kidney failure or aplastic anemia br Growth stimulation AAS can be used by pediatric endocrinologists to treat children with growth failure However the availability of synthetic growth hormone which has fewer side effects makes this a secondary treatment br Stimulation of appetite and preservation and increase of muscle mass AAS have been given to people with chronic wasting conditions such as cancer and AIDS br Stimulation of lean body mass and prevention of bone loss in elderly men as some studies indicate However a placebo controlled trial of low dose testosterone supplementation in elderly men with low levels of testosterone found no benefit on body composition physical performance insulin sensitivity or quality of life br Prevention or treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women Nandrolone decanoate is approved for this use Although they have been indicated for this indication AAS saw very little use for this purpose due to their virilizing side effects br Aiding weight gain following surgery or physical trauma during chronic infection or in the context of unexplained weight loss br Counteracting the catabolic effect of long term corticosteroid therapy br Oxandrolone improves both short term and long term outcomes in people recovering from severe burns and is well established as a safe treatment for this indication br Treatment of idiopathic short stature hereditary angioedema alcoholic hepatitis and hypogonadism br Methyltestosterone is used in the treatment of delayed puberty hypogonadism cryptorchidism and erectile dysfunction in males and in low doses to treat menopausal symptoms specifically for osteoporosis hot flashes and to increase libido and energy postpartum breast pain and engorgement and breast cancer in women br Growth hormones used in veterinary medicine e g trenbolone acetate are also used in intensive animal farming for faster gains in muscle mass for higher yields of meat from livestock and higher milk production in the dairy industry br br br Androgenic br Androgen replacement therapy for men with low levels of testosterone such as those associated with late onset hypogonadism also effective in improving libido for elderly males br Induction of male puberty Androgens are given to many boys distressed about extreme delay of puberty Testosterone is now nearly the only androgen used for this purpose and has been shown to increase height weight and fat free mass in boys with delayed puberty br Masculinizing hormone therapy for transgender men other transmasculine people and intersex people by producing masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as a voice deepening increased bone and muscle mass masculine fat distribution facial and body hair and clitoral enlargement as well as mental changes such as alleviation of gender dysphoria and increased sex drive br br br Other br Treatment of breast cancer in women although they are now very rarely used for this purpose due to their marked virilizing side effects br In low doses as a component of hormone therapy for postmenopausal and transgender women for instance to increase energy well being libido and quality of life as well as to reduce hot flashes Testosterone is usually used for this purpose although methyltestosterone is also used br Male hormonal contraception currently experimental but potential for use as effective safe reliable and reversible male contraceptives br Assistant in the treatment of Raynaud s Phenomenon and peripheral acrocyanosis Testosterone and other anabolics tend to be potent vasodilators which can significantly improve bloodflow in individuals prone to vasoconstriction br br br Enhancing performance br br Most steroid users are not athletes In the United States between million and million people of the population are thought to have used AAS Studies in the United States have shown that AAS users tend to be mostly middle class men with a median age of about who are noncompetitive bodybuilders and non athletes and use the drugs for cosmetic purposes Among to year old boys use of steroids and similar drugs jumped percent from to with percent saying they use them for looks rather than sports a study by insurer Blue Cross Blue Shield found Another study found that non medical use of AAS among college students was at or less than According to a recent survey of steroid users were noncompetitive bodybuilders and non athletes while about reported unsafe injection practices such as reusing needles sharing needles and sharing multidose vials though a study found that sharing of needles was extremely uncommon among individuals using AAS for non medical purposes less than Another study found that of non medical AAS users had post secondary degrees and more had completed college and fewer had failed to complete high school than is expected from the general populace The same study found that individuals using AAS for non medical purposes had a higher employment rate and a higher household income than the general population AAS users tend to research the drugs they are taking more than other controlled substance users however the major sources consulted by steroid users include friends non medical handbooks internet based forums blogs and fitness magazines which can provide questionable or inaccurate information br AAS users tend to be unhappy with the portrayal of AAS as deadly in the media and in politics According to one study AAS users also distrust their physicians and in the sample had not disclosed their AAS use to their physicians Another study had similar findings showing that while of individuals using AAS for non medical purposes were willing to seek medical supervision for their steroid use lacked trust in their physicians felt that the medical community s knowledge of non medical AAS use was lacking and felt that the public has an exaggerated view of the side effects of AAS use A recent study has also shown that long term AAS users were more likely to have symptoms of muscle dysmorphia and also showed stronger endorsement of more conventional male roles A recent study in the Journal of Health Psychology showed that many users believed that steroids used in moderation were safe br AAS have been used by men and women in many different kinds of professional sports to attain a competitive edge or to assist in recovery from injury These sports include bodybuilding weightlifting shot put and other track and field cycling baseball wrestling mixed martial arts boxing football and cricket Such use is prohibited by the rules of the governing bodies of most sports AAS use occurs among adolescents especially by those participating in competitive sports It has been suggested that the prevalence of use among high school students in the U S may be as high as br br br Dosages br br br Available forms br br The AAS that have been used most commonly in medicine are testosterone and its many esters but most typically testosterone undecanoate testosterone enanthate testosterone cypionate and testosterone propionate nandrolone esters typically nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate stanozolol and metandienone methandrostenolone Others that have also been available and used commonly but to a lesser extent include methyltestosterone oxandrolone mesterolone and oxymetholone as well as drostanolone propionate dromostanolone propionate metenolone methylandrostenolone esters specifically metenolone acetate and metenolone enanthate and fluoxymesterone Dihydrotestosterone DHT known as androstanolone or stanolone when used medically and its esters are also notable although they are not widely used in medicine Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine br Designer steroids are AAS that have not been approved and marketed for medical use but have been distributed through the black market Examples of notable designer steroids include testosterone dihydroboldenone methasterone trenbolone enanthate desoxymethyltestosterone tetrahydrogestrinone and methylstenbolone br br br Routes of administration br br There are four common forms in which AAS are administered oral pills injectable steroids creams gels for topical application and skin patches Oral administration is the most convenient Testosterone administered by mouth is rapidly absorbed but it is largely converted to inactive metabolites and only about one sixth is available in active form In order to be sufficiently active when given by mouth testosterone derivatives are alkylated at the position e g methyltestosterone and fluoxymesterone This modification reduces the liver s ability to break down these compounds before they reach the systemic circulation br Testosterone can be administered parenterally but it has more irregular prolonged absorption time and greater activity in muscle in enanthate undecanoate or cypionate ester form These derivatives are hydrolyzed to release free testosterone at the site of injection absorption rate and thus injection schedule varies among different esters but medical injections are normally done anywhere between semi weekly to once every weeks A more frequent schedule may be desirable in order to maintain a more constant level of hormone in the system Injectable steroids are typically administered into the muscle not into the vein to avoid sudden changes in the amount of the drug in the bloodstream In addition because estered testosterone is dissolved in oil intravenous injection has the potential to cause a dangerous embolism clot in the bloodstream br Transdermal patches adhesive patches placed on the skin may also be used to deliver a steady dose through the skin and into the bloodstream Testosterone containing creams and gels that are applied daily to the skin are also available but absorption is inefficient roughly varying between individuals and these treatments tend to be more expensive Individuals who are especially physically active and or bathe often may not be good candidates since the medication can be washed off and may take up to six hours to be fully absorbed There is also the risk that an intimate partner or child may come in contact with the application site and inadvertently dose themselves children and women are highly sensitive to testosterone and can develop unintended masculinization and health effects even from small doses Injection is the most common method used by individuals administering AAS for non medical purposes br The traditional routes of administration do not have differential effects on the efficacy of the drug Studies indicate that the anabolic properties of AAS are relatively similar despite the differences in pharmacokinetic principles such as first pass metabolism However the orally available forms of AAS may cause liver damage in high doses br br br Adverse effects br br Known possible side effects of AAS include br br Dermatological integumental oily skin acne vulgaris acne conglobata seborrhea stretch marks due to rapid muscle enlargement hypertrichosis excessive body hair growth androgenic alopecia pattern hair loss scalp baldness fluid retention edema br Reproductive endocrine libido changes reversible infertility hypogonadotropic hypogonadism br Male specific spontaneous erections nocturnal emissions priapism erectile dysfunction gynecomastia mostly only with aromatizable and hence estrogenic AAS oligospermia azoospermia testicular atrophy intratesticular leiomyosarcoma prostate hypertrophy prostate cancer br Female specific masculinization irreversible

segmental glomerulosclerosis renal cell carcinoma br Others glucose intolerance insulin resistance immune dysfunction br br br Physiological br Depending on the length of drug use there is a chance that the immune system can be damaged Most of these side effects are dose dependent the most common being elevated blood pressure especially in those with pre existing hypertension In addition to morphological changes of the heart which may have a permanent adverse effect on cardiovascular efficiency br AAS have been shown to alter fasting blood sugar and glucose tolerance tests AAS such as testosterone also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease or coronary artery disease Acne is fairly common among AAS users mostly due to stimulation of the sebaceous glands by increased testosterone levels Conversion of testosterone to DHT can accelerate the rate of premature baldness for males genetically predisposed but testosterone itself can produce baldness in females br A number of severe side effects can occur if adolescents use AAS For example AAS may prematurely stop the lengthening of bones premature epiphyseal fusion through increased levels of estrogen metabolites resulting in stunted growth Other effects include but are not limited to accelerated bone maturation increased frequency and duration of erections and premature sexual development AAS use in adolescence is also correlated with poorer attitudes related to health br br br Cancer br WHO organization International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC list AAS under Group A Probably carcinogenic to humans br br br Cardiovascular br Other side effects can include alterations in the structure of the heart such as enlargement and thickening of the left ventricle which impairs its contraction and relaxation and therefore reducing ejected blood volume Possible effects of these alterations in the heart are hypertension cardiac arrhythmias congestive heart failure heart attacks and sudden cardiac death These changes are also seen in non drug using athletes but steroid use may accelerate this process However both the connection between changes in the structure of the left ventricle and decreased cardiac function as well as the connection to steroid use have been disputed br AAS use can cause harmful changes in cholesterol levels Some steroids cause an increase in LDL cholesterol and a decrease in HDL cholesterol br br br Growth defects br AAS use in adolescents quickens bone maturation and may reduce adult height in high doses Low doses of AAS such as oxandrolone are used in the treatment of idiopathic short stature but this may only quicken maturation rather than increasing adult height br br br Feminization br br Although all anabolic steroids have androgenic effects some of them paradoxically results in feminization such as breast tissue in males a condition called gynecomastia These side effect are caused by the natural conversion of testosterone into estrogen and estradiol by the action of aromatase enzyme encoded by the CYP A gene br Prolonged use of androgenic anabolic steroids by men results in temporary shut down of their natural testosterone production due to an inhibition of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis This manifests in testicular atrophy inhibition of the production of sperm sexual function and infertility A short months use of androgenic anabolic steroids by men followed by a course of testosterone boosting therapy e g clomifene and human chorionic gonadotropin usually results in return to normal testosterone production br br br Masculinization br br Female specific side effects include increases in body hair permanent deepening of the voice enlarged clitoris and temporary decreases in menstrual cycles Alteration of fertility and ovarian cysts can also occur in females When taken during pregnancy AAS can affect fetal development by causing the development of male features in the female fetus and female features in the male fetus br br br Kidney problems br Kidney tests revealed that nine of the ten steroid users developed a condition called focal segmental glomerulosclerosis a type of scarring within the kidneys The kidney damage in the bodybuilders has similarities to that seen in morbidly obese patients but appears to be even more severe br br br Liver problems br High doses of oral AAS compounds can cause liver damage Peliosis hepatis has been increasingly recognised with the use of AAS br br br Neuropsychiatric br br A review in CNS Drugs determined that significant psychiatric symptoms including aggression and violence mania and less frequently psychosis and suicide have been associated with steroid abuse Long term steroid abusers may develop symptoms of dependence and withdrawal on discontinuation of AAS High concentrations of AAS comparable to those likely sustained by many recreational AAS users produce apoptotic effects on neurons raising the specter of possibly irreversible neurotoxicity Recreational AAS use appears to be associated with a range of potentially prolonged psychiatric effects including dependence syndromes mood disorders and progression to other forms of substance use but the prevalence and severity of these various effects remains poorly understood There is no evidence that steroid dependence develops from therapeutic use of AAS to treat medical disorders but instances of AAS dependence have been reported among weightlifters and bodybuilders who chronically administered supraphysiologic doses Mood disturbances e g depression hypo mania psychotic features are likely to be dose and drug dependent but AAS dependence or withdrawal effects seem to occur only in a small number of AAS users Large scale long term studies of psychiatric effects on AAS users are not currently available br br br Diagnostic Statistical Manual assertion br DSM IV lists General diagnostic criteria for a personality disorder guideline that The pattern must not be better accounted for as a manifestation of another mental disorder or to the direct physiological effects of a substance e g drug or medication or a general medical condition e g head trauma As a result AAS users may get misdiagnosed by a psychiatrist not told about their habit br br br Personality profiles br Cooper Noakes Dunne Lambert and Rochford identified that AAS using individuals are more likely to score higher on borderline times antisocial times paranoid times schizotypal times histrionic times passive aggressive times and narcissistic times personality profiles than non users Other studies have suggested that antisocial personality disorder is slightly more likely among AAS users than among non users Pope Katz Bipolar dysfunction substance dependency and conduct disorder have also been associated with AAS use br br br Mood and anxiety br Affective disorders have long been recognised as a complication of AAS use Case reports describe both hypomania and mania along with irritability elation recklessness racing thoughts and feelings of power and invincibility that did not meet the criteria for mania hypomania Of bodybuilders who used AAS reported unspecified mood disturbance br br br Aggression and hypomania br From the mid s onward the media reported roid rage as a side effect of AAS br A review determined that some but not all randomized controlled studies have found that AAS use correlates with hypomania and increased aggressiveness but pointed out that attempts to determine whether AAS use triggers violent behavior have failed primarily because of high rates of non participation A study on a nationally representative sample of young adult males in the United States found an association between lifetime and past year self reported AAS use and involvement in violent acts Compared with individuals that did not use steroids young adult males that used AAS reported greater involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the effects of key demographic variables previous violent behavior and polydrug use A review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time an extremely small percentage of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports br The relationship between AAS use and depression is inconclusive A review found that AAS may both relieve and cause depression and that cessation or diminished use of AAS may also result in depression but called for additional studies due to disparate data br br br Reproductive br Androgens such as testosterone androstenedione and dihydrotestosterone are required for the development of organs in the male reproductive system including the seminal vesicles epididymis vas deferens penis and prostate AAS are testosterone derivatives designed to maximize the anabolic effects of testosterone AAS are consumed by elite athletes competing in sports like weightlifting bodybuilding and track and field Male recreational athletes take AAS to achieve an enhanced physical appearance br AAS consumption disrupts the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis HPG axis in males In the HPG axis gonadotropin releasing hormone GnRH is secreted from the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete the two gonadotropins follicle stimulating hormone FSH and luteinizing hormone LH In adult males LH stimulates the Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone which is required to form new sperm through spermatogenesis AAS consumption leads to dose dependent suppression of gonadotropin release through suppression of GnRH from the hypothalamus long loop mechanism or from direct negative feedback on the anterior pituitary to inhibit gonadotropin release short loop mechanism leading to AAS induced hypogonadism br br br Pharmacology br br br Mechanism of action br br The pharmacodynamics of AAS are unlike peptide hormones Water soluble peptide hormones cannot penetrate the fatty cell membrane and only indirectly affect the nucleus of target cells through their interaction with the cell s surface receptors However as fat soluble hormones AAS are membrane permeable and influence the nucleus of cells by direct action The pharmacodynamic action of AAS begin when the exogenous hormone penetrates the membrane of the target cell and binds to an androgen receptor AR located in the cytoplasm of that cell From there the compound hormone receptor diffuses into the nucleus where it either alters the expression of genes or activates processes that send signals to other parts of the cell Different types of AAS bind to the AAR with different affinities depending on their chemical structure br The effect of AAS on muscle mass is caused in at least two ways first they increase the production of proteins second they reduce recovery time by blocking the effects of stress hormone cortisol on muscle tissue so that catabolism of muscle is greatly reduced It has been hypothesized that this reduction in muscle breakdown may occur through AAS inhibiting the action of other steroid hormones called glucocorticoids that promote the breakdown of muscles AAS also affect the number of cells that develop into fat storage cells by favouring cellular differentiation into muscle cells instead br br br Molecular Interaction of AAS with Androgen Receptors br Anabolic steroids interact with ARs across various tissues including muscle bone and reproductive systems Upon binding to the AR anabolic steroids trigger a translocation of the hormone receptor complex to the cell nucleus where they either alter gene expression or activate cellular signaling pathways this results in increased protein synthesis enhanced muscle growth and reduced muscle catabolism br Anabolic steroids influence cellular differentiation while favoring the development of muscle cells over fat storage cells Research in this field has shown that structural modifications in anabolic steroids are critical in determining their binding affinity to ARs and their resulting anabolic and androgenic activities These modifications affect a steroid s ability to influence gene expression and cellular processes highlighting the complex biophysical interactions of anabolic steroids at the cellular level br br br Anabolic and androgenic effects br br As their name suggests AAS have two different but overlapping types of effects anabolic meaning that they promote anabolism cell growth and androgenic or virilizing meaning that they affect the development and maintenance of masculine characteristics br Some examples of the anabolic effects of these hormones are increased protein synthesis from amino acids increased appetite increased bone remodeling and growth and stimulation of bone marrow which increases the production of red blood cells Through a number of mechanisms AAS stimulate the formation of muscle cells and hence cause an increase in the size of skeletal muscles leading to increased strength br The androgenic effects of AAS are numerous Depending on the length of use the side effects of the steroid can be irreversible Processes affected include pubertal growth sebaceous gland oil production and sexuality especially in fetal development Some examples of virilizing effects are growth of the clitoris in females and the penis in male children the adult penis size does not change due to steroids increased vocal cord size increased libido suppression of natural sex hormones and impaired production of sperm Effects on women include deepening of the voice facial hair growth and possibly a decrease in breast size Men may develop an enlargement of breast tissue known as gynecomastia testicular atrophy and a reduced sperm count br The androgenic anabolic ratio of an AAS is an important factor when determining the clinical application of these compounds Compounds with a high ratio of androgenic to an anabolic effects are the drug of choice in androgen replacement therapy e g treating hypogonadism in males whereas compounds with a reduced androgenic anabolic ratio are preferred for anemia and osteoporosis and to reverse protein loss following trauma surgery or prolonged immobilization Determination of androgenic anabolic ratio is typically performed in animal studies which has led to the marketing of some compounds claimed to have anabolic activity with weak androgenic effects This disassociation is less marked in humans where all AAS have significant androgenic effects br A commonly used protocol for determining the androgenic anabolic ratio dating back to the s uses the relative weights of ventral prostate VP and levator ani muscle LA of male rats The VP weight is an indicator of the androgenic effect while the LA weight is an indicator of the anabolic effect Two or more batches of rats are castrated and given no treatment and respectively some AAS of interest The LA VP ratio for an AAS is calculated as the ratio of LA VP weight gains produced by the treatment with that compound using castrated but untreated rats as baseline LAc t LAc VPc t VPc The LA VP weight gain ratio from rat experiments is not unitary for testosterone typically but it is normalized for presentation purposes and used as basis of comparison for other AAS which have their androgenic anabolic ratios scaled accordingly as shown in the table above In the early s this procedure was standardized and generalized throughout OECD in what is now known as the Hershberger assay br br br Body composition and strength improvements br Anabolic steroids notably influence muscle fiber characteristics affecting both the size and type of muscle fibers This alteration significantly contributes to enhanced muscle strength and endurance Anabolic androgenic steroids AAS cause these changes by directly impacting the muscle tissue s cellular components Studies have shown that these changes are not merely superficial but represent a profound transformation in the muscle s structural and functional properties This transformation is a key factor in the steroids ability to enhance physical performance and endurance br Body weight in men may increase by to kg as a result of short term weeks AAS use which may be attributed mainly to an increase of lean mass Animal studies also found that fat mass was reduced but most studies in humans failed to elucidate significant fat mass decrements The effects on lean body mass have been shown to be dose dependent Both muscle hypertrophy and the formation of new muscle fibers have been observed The hydration of lean mass remains unaffected by AAS use although small increments of blood volume cannot be ruled out br The upper region of the body thorax neck shoulders and upper arm seems to be more susceptible for AAS than other body regions because of predominance of ARs in the upper body The largest difference in muscle fiber size between AAS users and non users was observed in type I muscle fibers of the vastus lateralis and the trapezius muscle as a result of long term AAS self administration After drug withdrawal the effects fade away slowly but may persist for more than weeks after cessation of AAS use br Strength improvements in the range of to of baseline strength depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well as the administration period Overall the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the bench press For almost two decades it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced strength athletes A randomized controlled trial demonstrated however that even in novice athletes a week strength training program accompanied by testosterone enanthate at mg week may improve strength more than training alone does This dose is sufficient to significantly improve lean muscle mass relative to placebo even in subjects that did not exercise at all The anabolic effects of testosterone enanthate were highly dose dependent br br br Dissociation of effects br Endogenous natural AAS like testosterone and DHT and synthetic AAS mediate their effects by binding to and activating the AR On the basis of animal bioassays the effects of these agents have been divided into two partially dissociable types anabolic myotrophic and androgenic Dissociation between the ratios of these two types of effects relative to the ratio observed with testosterone is observed in rat bioassays with various AAS Theories for the dissociation include differences between AAS in terms of their intracellular metabolism functional selectivity differential recruitment of coactivators and non genomic mechanisms i e signaling through non AR membrane androgen receptors or mARs Support for the latter two theories is limited and more hypothetical but there is a good deal of support for the intracellular metabolism theory br The measurement of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely on a simple but outdated and unsophisticated model using rat tissue bioassays It has been referred to as the myotrophic androgenic index In this model myotrophic or anabolic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat bulbocavernosus levator ani muscle and androgenic activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat ventral prostate or alternatively the rat seminal vesicles in response to exposure to the AAS The measurements are then compared to form a ratio br br br Intracellular metabolism br Testosterone is metabolized in various tissues by reductase into DHT which is to fold more potent as an AR agonist and by aromatase into estradiol which is an estrogen and lacks significant AR affinity In addition DHT is metabolized by hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase HSD and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase HSD into androstanediol and androstanediol respectively which are metabolites with little or no AR affinity reductase is widely distributed throughout the body and is concentrated to various extents in skin particularly the scalp face and genital areas prostate seminal vesicles liver and the brain In contrast expression of reductase in skeletal muscle is undetectable Aromatase is highly expressed in adipose tissue and the brain and is also expressed significantly in skeletal muscle HSD is highly expressed in skeletal muscle as well br Natural AAS like testosterone and DHT and synthetic AAS are analogues and are very similar structurally For this reason they have the capacity to bind to and be metabolized by the same steroid metabolizing enzymes According to the intracellular metabolism explanation the androgenic to anabolic ratio of a given AR agonist is related to its capacity to be transformed by the aforementioned enzymes in conjunction with the AR activity of any resulting products For instance whereas the AR activity of testosterone is greatly potentiated by local conversion via reductase into DHT in tissues where reductase is expressed an AAS that is not metabolized by reductase or is already reduced such as DHT itself or a derivative like mesterolone or drostanolone would not undergo such potentiation in said tissues Moreover nandrolone is metabolized by reductase but unlike the case of testosterone and DHT the reduced metabolite of nandrolone has much lower affinity for the AR than does nandrolone itself and this results in reduced AR activation in reductase expressing tissues As so called androgenic tissues such as skin hair follicles and male reproductive tissues are very high in reductase expression while skeletal muscle is virtually devoid of reductase this may primarily explain the high myotrophic androgenic ratio and dissociation seen with nandrolone as well as with various other AAS br Aside from reductase aromatase may inactivate testosterone signaling in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue so AAS that lack aromatase affinity in addition to being free of the potential side effect of gynecomastia might be expected to have a higher myotrophic androgenic ratio in comparison In addition DHT is inactivated by high activity of HSD in skeletal muscle and cardiac tissue and AAS that lack affinity for HSD could similarly be expected to have a higher myotrophic androgenic ratio although perhaps also increased long term cardiovascular risks In accordance DHT mestanolone methyl DHT and mesterolone methyl DHT are all described as very poorly anabolic due to inactivation by HSD in skeletal muscle whereas other DHT derivatives with other structural features like metenolone oxandrolone oxymetholone drostanolone and stanozolol are all poor substrates for HSD and are described as potent anabolics br The intracellular metabolism theory explains how and why remarkable dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects might occur despite the fact that these effects are mediated through the same signaling receptor and why this dissociation is invariably incomplete In support of the model is the rare condition congenital reductase type deficiency in which the reductase type enzyme is defective production of DHT is impaired and DHT levels are low while testosterone levels are normal Males with this condition are born with ambiguous genitalia and a severely underdeveloped or even absent prostate gland In addition at the time of puberty such males develop normal musculature voice deepening and libido but have reduced facial hair a female pattern of body hair i e largely restricted to the pubic triangle and underarms no incidence of male pattern hair loss and no prostate enlargement or incidence of prostate cancer They also notably do not develop gynecomastia as a consequence of their condition br br br Functional selectivity br An animal study found that two different kinds of androgen response elements could differentially respond to testosterone and DHT upon activation of the AR Whether this is involved in the differences in the ratios of anabolic to myotrophic effect of different AAS is unknown however br br br Non genomic mechanisms br Testosterone signals not only through the nuclear AR but also through mARs including ZIP and GPRC A It has been proposed that differential signaling through mARs may be involved in the dissociation of the anabolic and androgenic effects of AAS Indeed DHT has less than of the affinity of testosterone for ZIP and the synthetic AAS metribolone and mibolerone are ineffective competitors for the receptor similarly This indicates that AAS do show differential interactions with the AR and mARs However women with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome CAIS who have a XY male genotype and testes but a defect in the AR such that it is non functional are a challenge to this notion They are completely insensitive to the AR mediated effects of androgens like testosterone and show a perfectly female phenotype despite having testosterone levels in the high end of the normal male range These women have little or no sebum production incidence of acne or body hair growth including in the pubic and axillary areas Moreover CAIS women have lean body mass that is normal for females but is of course greatly reduced relative to males These observations suggest that the AR is mainly or exclusively responsible for masculinization and myotrophy caused by androgens The mARs have however been found to be involved in some of the health related effects of testosterone like modulation of prostate cancer risk and progression br br br Antigonadotropic effects br Changes in endogenous testosterone levels may also contribute to differences in myotrophic androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS AR agonists are antigonadotropic that is they dose dependently suppress gonadal testosterone production and hence reduce systemic testosterone concentrations By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body with that of the exogenous AAS the myotrophic androgenic ratio of a given AAS may be further dose dependently increased and this hence may be an additional factor contributing to the differences in myotrophic androgenic ratio among different AAS In addition some AAS such as nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone are also potent progestogens and activation of the progesterone receptor PR is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR The combination of sufficient AR and PR activation can suppress circulating testosterone levels into the castrate range in men i e complete suppression of gonadal testosterone production and circulating testosterone levels decreased by about As such combined progestogenic activity may serve to further increase the myotrophic androgenic ratio for a given AAS br br br GABAA receptor modulation br Some AAS such as testosterone DHT stanozolol and methyltestosterone have been found to modulate the GABAA receptor similarly to endogenous neurosteroids like allopregnanolone androstanediol dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and pregnenolone sulfate It has been suggested that this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to the neurological and behavioral effects of AAS br br br Comparison of AAS br AAS differ in a variety of ways including in their capacities to be metabolized by steroidogenic enzymes such as reductase hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and aromatase in whether their potency as AR agonists is potentiated or diminished by reduction in their ratios of anabolic myotrophic to androgenic effect in their estrogenic progestogenic and neurosteroid activities in their oral activity and in their capacity to produce hepatotoxicity br br br Reductase and androgenicity br Testosterone can be robustly converted by reductase into DHT in so called androgenic tissues such as skin scalp prostate and seminal vesicles but not in muscle or bone where reductase either is not expressed or is only minimally expressed As DHT is to fold more potent as an agonist of the AR than is testosterone the AR agonist activity of testosterone is thus markedly and selectively potentiated in such tissues In contrast to testosterone DHT and other dihydrogenated AAS are already reduced and for this reason cannot be potentiated in androgenic tissues Nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone can be metabolized by reductase similarly to testosterone but reduced metabolites of nortestosterone derivatives e g dihydronandrolone tend to have reduced activity as AR agonists resulting in reduced androgenic activity in tissues that express reductase In addition some nortestosterone derivatives including trestolone methyl nortestosterone MENT methyl nortestosterone MNT and dimethandrolone dimethyl nortestosterone cannot be reduced Conversely certain alkylated AAS like methyltestosterone are reduced and potentiated in androgenic tissues similarly to testosterone Alkylated DHT derivatives cannot be potentiated via reductase however as they are already reduced br The capacity to be metabolized by reductase and the AR activity of the resultant metabolites appears to be one of the major if not the most important determinant of the androgenic myotrophic ratio for a given AAS AAS that are not potentiated by reductase or that are weakened by reductase in androgenic tissues have a reduced risk of androgenic side effects such as acne androgenic alopecia male pattern baldness hirsutism excessive male pattern hair growth benign prostatic hyperplasia prostate enlargement and prostate cancer while incidence and magnitude of other effects such as muscle hypertrophy bone changes voice deepening and changes in sex drive show no difference br br br Aromatase and estrogenicity br Testosterone can be metabolized by aromatase into estradiol and many other AAS can be metabolized into their corresponding estrogenic metabolites as well As an example the alkylated AAS methyltestosterone and metandienone are converted by aromatase into methylestradiol Dihydrogenated derivatives of testosterone such as DHT cannot be aromatized whereas nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone can be but to a greatly reduced extent Some nortestosterone derivatives such as dimethandrolone and MNT cannot be aromatized due to steric hindrance provided by their methyl group whereas the closely related AAS trestolone methyl nortestosterone in relation to its lack of an methyl group can be aromatized AAS that are alkylated and not also reduced or demethylated are also aromatized but to a lesser extent than is testosterone However it is notable that estrogens that are substituted e g ethinylestradiol and methylestradiol are of markedly increased estrogenic potency due to improved metabolic stability and for this reason alkylated AAS can actually have high estrogenicity and comparatively greater estrogenic effects than testosterone br The major effect of estrogenicity is gynecomastia woman like breasts AAS that have a high potential for aromatization like testosterone and particularly methyltestosterone show a high risk of gynecomastia at sufficiently high dosages while AAS that have a reduced potential for aromatization like nandrolone show a much lower risk though still potentially significant at high dosages In contrast AAS that are reduced and some other AAS e g methylated nortestosterone derivatives have no risk of gynecomastia In addition to gynecomastia AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity which results in increased potency in suppression of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis and gonadal testosterone production br br br Progestogenic activity br Many nortestosterone derivatives including nandrolone trenbolone ethylestrenol ethylnandrol metribolone R trestolone MNT dimethandrolone and others are potent agonists of the progesterone receptor PR and hence are progestogens in addition to AAS Similarly to the case of estrogenic activity the progestogenic activity of these drugs serves to augment their antigonadotropic activity This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as antispermatogenic agents and male contraceptives or put in another way increased potency and effectiveness in producing azoospermia and reversible male infertility br br br Oral activity and hepatotoxicity br Non alkylated testosterone derivatives such as testosterone itself DHT and nandrolone all have poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active A notable exception to this are AAS that are androgen precursors or prohormones including dehydroepiandrosterone DHEA androstenediol androstenedione boldione androstadienedione bolandiol norandrostenediol bolandione norandrostenedione dienedione mentabolan MENT dione trestione and methoxydienone methoxygonadiene although these are relatively weak AAS AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively in the form of esters administered by intramuscular injection which act as depots and function as long acting prodrugs Examples include testosterone as testosterone cypionate testosterone enanthate and testosterone propionate and nandrolone as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate among many others see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters An exception is the very long chain ester testosterone undecanoate which is orally active albeit with only very low oral bioavailability approximately In contrast to most other AAS alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well br In addition to oral activity alkylation also confers a high potential for hepatotoxicity and all alkylated AAS have been associated albeit uncommonly and only after prolonged use different estimates between and with hepatotoxicity In contrast testosterone esters have only extremely rarely or never been associated with hepatotoxicity and other non alkylated AAS only rarely although long term use may reportedly still increase the risk of hepatic changes but at a much lower rate than alkylated AAS and reportedly not at replacement dosages In accordance D ring glucuronides of testosterone and DHT have been found to be cholestatic br Aside from prohormones and testosterone undecanoate almost all orally active AAS are alkylated A few AAS that are not alkylated are orally active Some examples include the testosterone ethers cloxotestosterone quinbolone and silandrone which are prodrugs to testosterone boldenone testosterone and testosterone respectively the DHT ethers mepitiostane mesabolone and prostanozol which are also prodrugs the methylated DHT derivatives mesterolone and metenolone although these are relatively weak AAS and the nortestosterone derivatives dimethandrolone and MNT which have improved resistance to first pass hepatic metabolism due to their methyl groups in contrast to them the related AAS trestolone methyl nortestosterone is not orally active As these AAS are not alkylated they show minimal potential for hepatotoxicity br br br Neurosteroid activity br DHT via its metabolite androstanediol produced by hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase HSD is a neurosteroid that acts via positive allosteric modulation of the GABAA receptor Testosterone via conversion into DHT also produces androstanediol as a metabolite and hence has similar activity Some AAS that are or can be reduced including testosterone DHT stanozolol and methyltestosterone among many others can or may modulate the GABAA receptor and this may contribute as an alternative or additional mechanism to their central nervous system effects in terms of mood anxiety aggression and sex drive br br br Chemistry br br AAS are androstane or estrane steroids They include testosterone androst en ol one and

urine although both blood and hair have been investigated for this purpose The AAS whether of endogenous or exogenous origin are subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation by a variety of enzymatic pathways The primary urinary metabolites may be detectable for up to days after the last use depending on the specific agent dose and route of administration A number of the drugs have common metabolic pathways and their excretion profiles may overlap those of the endogenous steroids making interpretation of testing results a very significant challenge to the analytical chemist Methods for detection of the substances or their excretion products in urine specimens usually involve gas chromatography mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography mass spectrometry br br br History br br br Discovery of androgens br The use of gonadal steroids pre dates their identification and isolation Use of cow urine for treatment of ascites heart failure renal failure and vitiligo has been elaborately described in Sushruta Samhita suggesting that ancient Indians had some understanding of steroidal properties of cow urine around th century BCE Extraction of hormones from urines began in China around BCE Medical use of testicle extract began in the late th century while its effects on strength were still being studied The isolation of gonadal steroids can be traced back to when Adolf Butenandt a chemist in Marburg purified milligrams of the male hormone androstenone from tens of thousands of litres of urine This steroid was subsequently synthesized in by Leopold Ru i ka a chemist in Zurich br In the s it was already known that the testes contain a more powerful androgen than androstenone and three groups of scientists funded by competing pharmaceutical companies in the Netherlands Germany and Switzerland raced to isolate it This hormone was first identified by Karoly Gyula David E Dingemanse J Freud and Ernst Laqueur in a May paper On Crystalline Male Hormone from Testicles Testosterone They named the hormone testosterone from the stems of testicle and sterol and the suffix of ketone The chemical synthesis of testosterone was achieved in August that year when Butenandt and G Hanisch published a paper describing A Method for Preparing Testosterone from Cholesterol Only a week later the third group Ruzicka and A Wettstein announced a patent application in a paper On the Artificial Preparation of the Testicular Hormone Testosterone Androsten one ol Ruzicka and Butenandt were offered the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work but the Nazi government forced Butenandt to decline the honor although he accepted the prize after the end of World War II br Clinical trials on humans involving either PO doses of methyltestosterone or injections of testosterone propionate began as early as There are often reported rumors that German soldiers were administered AAS during the Second World War the aim being to increase their aggression and stamina but these are as yet unproven Adolf Hitler himself according to his physician was injected with testosterone derivatives to treat various ailments AAS were used in experiments conducted by the Nazis on concentration camp inmates and later by the allies attempting to treat the malnourished victims that survived Nazi camps President John F Kennedy was administered steroids both before and during his presidency br br br Development of synthetic AAS br The development of muscle building properties of testosterone was pursued in the s in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Bloc countries such as East Germany where steroid programs were used to enhance the performance of Olympic and other amateur weight lifters In response to the success of Russian weightlifters the U S Olympic Team physician John Ziegler worked with synthetic chemists to develop an AAS with reduced androgenic effects Ziegler s work resulted in the production of methandrostenolone which Ciba Pharmaceuticals marketed as Dianabol The new steroid was approved for use in the U S by the Food and Drug Administration FDA in It was most commonly administered to burn victims and the elderly The drug s off label users were mostly bodybuilders and weight lifters Although Ziegler prescribed only small doses to athletes he soon discovered that those having used Dianabol developed enlarged prostates and atrophied testes AAS were placed on the list of banned substances of the International Olympic Committee IOC in and a decade later the committee introduced out of competition doping tests because many athletes used AAS in their training period rather than during competition br Three major ideas governed modifications of testosterone into a multitude of AAS Alkylation at C position with methyl or ethyl group created POly active compounds because it slows the degradation of the drug by the liver esterification of testosterone and nortestosterone at the C position allows the substance to be administered parenterally and increases the duration of effectiveness because agents soluble in oily liquids may be present in the body for several months and alterations of the ring structure were applied for both PO and parenteral agents to seeking to obtain different anabolic to androgenic effect ratios br br br Society and culture br br br Etymology br Androgens were discovered in the s and were characterized as having effects described as androgenic i e virilizing and anabolic e g myotrophic renotrophic The term anabolic steroid can be dated as far back as at least the mid s when it was used to describe the at the time hypothetical concept of a testosterone derived steroid with anabolic effects but with minimal or no androgenic effects This concept was formulated based on the observation that steroids had ratios of renotrophic to androgenic potency that differed significantly which suggested that anabolic and androgenic effects might be dissociable br In a testosterone derived steroid known as norethandrolone ethyl nortestosterone was synthesized at G D Searle Company and was studied as a progestin but was not marketed Subsequently in it was re examined for testosterone like activity in animals and was found to have similar anabolic activity to testosterone but only one sixteenth of its androgenic potency It was the first steroid with a marked and favorable separation of anabolic and androgenic effect to be discovered and has accordingly been described as the first anabolic steroid Norethandrolone was introduced for medical use in and was quickly followed by numerous similar steroids for instance nandrolone phenylpropionate in and stanozolol in With these developments anabolic steroid became the preferred term to refer to such steroids over androgen and entered widespread use br Although anabolic steroid was originally intended to specifically describe testosterone derived steroids with a marked dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effect it is applied today indiscriminately to all steroids with AR agonism based anabolic effects regardless of their androgenic potency including even non synthetic and non preferentially anabolic steroids like testosterone While many anabolic steroids have diminished androgenic potency in comparison to anabolic potency there is no anabolic steroid that is exclusively anabolic and hence all anabolic steroids retain at least some degree of androgenicity Likewise all androgens are inherently anabolic Indeed it is probably not possible to fully dissociate anabolic effects from androgenic effects as both types of effects are mediated by the same signaling receptor the AR As such the distinction between the terms anabolic steroid and androgen is questionable and this is the basis for the revised and more recent term anabolic androgenic steroid AAS br David Handelsman has criticized terminology and understanding surrounding AAS in many publications According to Handelsman the pharmaceutical industry attempted to dissociate the so called androgenic and anabolic effects of AAS in the mid th century in order to create non masculinizing anabolic agents that would be more suitable for use in women and children However this effort failed comprehensively and was abandoned by the s This failure was due to the subsequent discovery of a singular androgen receptor AR mediating the effects of AAS in both muscle and reproductive tissue along with misinterpretation of flawed animal androgen bioassays employed to distinguish between androgenic or virilizing effects and anabolic or myotrophic effects i e the Hershberger assay involving the unrepresentative levator ani muscle In reality all AAS have essentially similar AR mediated effects even if some may differ in potency to a degree in certain tissues e g skin hair follicles prostate gland based on susceptibility to reduction and associated metabolic amplification or inactivation or lack thereof Per Handelsman the terms anabolic steroid and anabolic androgenic steroid are obsolete meaningless and falsely distinguish these agents from androgens when there is no physiological basis for such distinction In fact it has been noted that the use and distinction of the concepts anabolic and androgenic as well as the term anabolic androgenic steroid are oxymoronic as anabolic refers to muscle building while androgenic refers to induction and maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics which in principle would include anabolic or muscle building effects Handelsman has argued that these terms should be discarded and instead AAS should all simply be referred to as androgens with him using this term exclusively to refer to these agents in his publications Although the term anabolic androgenic steroid is technically valid in describing two types of actions of these agents Handelsman considers the term unnecessary and redundant and likens it to hypothetical never used terms like luteal gestational progestins or mammary uterine estrogens Handelsman also notes that anabolic steroid is easily and unnecessarily confusable with corticosteroids Aside from AAS Handelsman has criticized the term selective androgen receptor modulator SARM and claims about these agents as well br br br Legal status br br The legal status of AAS varies from country to country some have stricter controls on their use or prescription than others though in many countries they are not illegal In the U S AAS are currently listed as Schedule III controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act which makes simple possession of such substances without a prescription a federal crime punishable by up to one year in prison for the first offense Unlawful distribution or possession with intent to distribute AAS as a first offense is punished by up to ten years in prison In Canada AAS and their derivatives are part of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and are Schedule IV substances meaning that it is illegal to obtain or sell them without a prescription however possession is not punishable a consequence reserved for schedule I II or III substances Those guilty of buying or selling AAS in Canada can be imprisoned for up to months Import and export also carry similar penalties br In Canada researchers have concluded that steroid use among student athletes is extremely widespread A study conducted in by the Canadian Centre for Drug Free Sport found that nearly Canadians between the ages of and use steroids AAS are also illegal without prescription in Australia Argentina Brazil and Portugal and are listed as Class C Controlled Drugs in the United Kingdom AAS are readily available without a prescription in some countries such as Mexico and Thailand br br br United States br br The history of the U S legislation on AAS goes back to the late s when the U S Congress considered placing AAS under the Controlled Substances Act following the controversy over Ben Johnson s victory at the Summer Olympics in Seoul AAS were added to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act in the Anabolic Steroids Control Act of br The same act also introduced more stringent controls with higher criminal penalties for offenses involving the illegal distribution of AAS and human growth hormone By the early s after AAS were scheduled in the U S several pharmaceutical companies stopped manufacturing or marketing the products in the U S including Ciba Searle Syntex and others In the Controlled Substances Act AAS are defined to be any drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone other than estrogens progestins and corticosteroids that promote muscle growth The act was amended by the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of which added prohormones to the list of controlled substances with effect from January br Even though they can still be prescribed by a medical doctor in the U S the use of anabolic steroids for injury recovery purposes has been a taboo subject even amongst the majority of sports medicine doctors and endocrinologists br br br United Kingdom br In the United Kingdom AAS are classified as class C drugs which puts them in the same class as benzodiazepines AAS are in Schedule which is divided in parts Part contains most of the benzodiazepines and Part contains the AAS br Part drugs are subject to full import and export controls with possession being an offence without an appropriate prescription There is no restriction on the possession when it is part of a medicinal product Part drugs require a Home Office licence for importation and export unless the substance is in the form of a medicinal product and is for self administration by a person br br br Status in sports br br AAS are banned by all major sports bodies including Association of Tennis Professionals Major League Baseball F d ration Internationale de Football Association the Olympics the National Basketball Association the National Hockey League World Wrestling Entertainment and the National Football League The World Anti Doping Agency WADA maintains the list of performance enhancing substances used by many major sports bodies and includes all anabolic agents which includes all AAS and precursors as well as all hormones and related substances br br br Usage br br br Law enforcement br United States federal law enforcement officials have expressed concern about AAS use by police officers It s a big problem and from the number of cases it s something we shouldn t ignore It s not that we set out to target cops but when we re in the middle of an active investigation into steroids there have been quite a few cases that have led back to police officers says Lawrence Payne a spokesman for the United States Drug Enforcement Administration The FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin stated that Anabolic steroid abuse by police officers is a serious problem that merits greater awareness by departments across the country It is also believed that police officers across the United Kingdom are using criminals to buy steroids which he claims to be a top risk factor for police corruption br br br Professional wrestling br br Following the Chris Benoit double murder and suicide in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigated steroid usage in the wrestling industry The Committee investigated WWE and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling now known as Impact Wrestling asking for documentation of their companies drug policies WWE CEO and chairman Linda and Vince McMahon respectively both testified The documents stated that wrestlers roughly percent had tested positive for drug use since most commonly for steroids br br br Economics br br AAS are frequently produced in pharmaceutical laboratories but in nations where stricter laws are present they are also produced in small home made underground laboratories usually from raw substances imported from abroad In these countries the majority of steroids are obtained illegally through black market trade These steroids are usually manufactured in other countries and therefore must be smuggled across international borders As with most significant smuggling operations organized crime is involved br In the late s the worldwide trade in illicit AAS increased significantly and authorities announced record captures on three continents In Finnish authorities announced a record seizure of million AAS tablets A year later the DEA seized million units of AAS in the largest U S seizure ever In the first three months of Australian customs reported a record seizures of AAS shipments br In the U S Canada and Europe illegal steroids are sometimes purchased just as any other illegal drug through dealers who are able to obtain the drugs from a number of sources Illegal AAS are sometimes sold at gyms and competitions and through the mail but may also be obtained through pharmacists veterinarians and physicians In addition a significant number of counterfeit products are sold as AAS in particular via mail order from websites posing as overseas pharmacies In the U S black market importation continues from Mexico Thailand and other countries where steroids are more easily available as they are legal br br br Research br AAS alone and in combination with progestogens have been studied as potential male hormonal contraceptives
