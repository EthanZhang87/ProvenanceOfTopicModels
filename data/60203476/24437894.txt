Massachusett people who had small seasonal communities When a group of settlers led by John Winthrop arrived in the Shawmut Peninsula was nearly empty of the Native people as many had died of European diseases brought by early settlers and traders Archaeological excavations unearthed one of the oldest fishweirs in New England on Boylston Street which Native people constructed as early as years before European arrival in the Western Hemisphere br br br Settlement by Europeans br The first European to live in what would become Boston was a Cambridge educated Anglican cleric named William Blaxton He was the person most directly responsible for the foundation of Boston by Puritan colonists in This occurred after Blaxton invited one of their leaders Isaac Johnson to cross Back Bay from the failing colony of Charlestown and share the peninsula The Puritans made the crossing in September br br br The name Boston br Before Johnson died on September he named their then new settlement across the river Boston This was one of his last official acts as the leader of the Charlestown community The settlement s name came from Johnson s hometown of Boston Lincolnshire from which he his wife namesake of the Arbella and John Cotton grandfather of Cotton Mather had emigrated to New England The name of the English town ultimately derives from its patron saint St Botolph in whose church John Cotton served as the rector until his emigration with Johnson In early sources Lincolnshire s Boston was known as St Botolph s town later contracted to Boston Before this renaming the settlement on the peninsula had been known as Shawmut by Blaxton and Tremontaine by the Puritan settlers he had invited br br br Puritan occupation br Puritan influence on Boston began even before the settlement was founded with the Cambridge Agreement This document created the Massachusetts Bay Colony and was signed by its first governor John Winthrop Puritan ethics and their focus on education also influenced the early history of the city America s first public school Boston Latin School was founded in Boston in br Boston was the largest town in the Thirteen Colonies until Philadelphia outgrew it in the mid th century Boston s oceanfront location made it a lively port and the then town primarily engaged in shipping and fishing during its colonial days Boston was a primary stop on a Caribbean trade route and imported large amounts of molasses which led to the creation of Boston baked beans br Boston s economy stagnated in the decades prior to the Revolution By the mid th century New York City and Philadelphia had surpassed Boston in wealth During this period Boston encountered financial difficulties even as other cities in New England grew rapidly br br br Revolution and the siege of Boston br br Many crucial events of the American Revolution occurred in or near Boston The then town s mob presence along with the colonists growing lack of faith in either Britain or its Parliament fostered a revolutionary spirit there When the British parliament passed the Stamp Act in a Boston mob ravaged the homes of Andrew Oliver the official tasked with enforcing the Act and Thomas Hutchinson then the Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts The British sent two regiments to Boston in in an attempt to quell the angry colonists This did not sit well with the colonists however In during the Boston Massacre British troops shot into a crowd that had started to violently harass them The colonists compelled the British to withdraw their troops The event was widely publicized and fueled a revolutionary movement in America br In Parliament passed the Tea Act Many of the colonists saw the act as an attempt to force them to accept the taxes established by the Townshend Acts The act prompted the Boston Tea Party where a group of angered Bostonians threw an entire shipment of tea sent by the East India Company into Boston Harbor The Boston Tea Party was a key event leading up to the revolution as the British government responded furiously with the Coercive Acts demanding compensation for the destroyed tea from the Bostonians This angered the colonists further and led to the American Revolutionary War The war began in the area surrounding Boston with the Battles of Lexington and Concord br Boston itself was besieged for almost a year during the siege of Boston which began on April The New England militia impeded the movement of the British Army Sir William Howe then the commander in chief of the British forces in North America led the British army in the siege On June the British captured Charlestown now part of Boston during the Battle of Bunker Hill The British army outnumbered the militia stationed there but it was a pyrrhic victory for the British because their army suffered irreplaceable casualties It was also a testament to the skill and training of the militia as their stubborn defense made it difficult for the British to capture Charlestown without suffering further irreplaceable casualties br Several weeks later George Washington took over the militia after the Continental Congress established the Continental Army to unify the revolutionary effort Both sides faced difficulties and supply shortages in the siege and the fighting was limited to small scale raids and skirmishes The narrow Boston Neck which at that time was only about a hundred feet wide impeded Washington s ability to invade Boston and a long stalemate ensued A young officer Rufus Putnam came up with a plan to make portable fortifications out of wood that could be erected on the frozen ground under cover of darkness Putnam supervised this effort which successfully installed both the fortifications and dozens of cannons on Dorchester Heights that Henry Knox had laboriously brought through the snow from Fort Ticonderoga The astonished British awoke the next morning to see a large array of cannons bearing down on them General Howe is believed to have said that the Americans had done more in one night than his army could have done in six months The British Army attempted a cannon barrage for two hours but their shot could not reach the colonists cannons at such a height The British gave up boarded their ships and sailed away This has become known as Evacuation Day which Boston still celebrates each year on March After this Washington was so impressed that he made Rufus Putnam his chief engineer br br br Post revolution and the War of br br After the Revolution Boston s long seafaring tradition helped make it one of the nation s busiest ports for both domestic and international trade Boston s harbor activity was significantly curtailed by the Embargo Act of adopted during the Napoleonic Wars and the War of Foreign trade returned after these hostilities but Boston s merchants had found alternatives for their capital investments in the meantime Manufacturing became an important component of the city s economy and the city s industrial manufacturing overtook international trade in economic importance by the mid th century The small rivers bordering the city and connecting it to the surrounding region facilitated shipment of goods and led to a proliferation of mills and factories Later a dense network of railroads furthered the region s industry and commerce br During this period Boston flourished culturally as well It was admired for its rarefied literary life and generous artistic patronage Members of old Boston families eventually dubbed the Boston Brahmins came to be regarded as the nation s social and cultural elites They are often associated with the American upper class Harvard University and the Episcopal Church br Boston was a prominent port of the Atlantic slave trade in the New England Colonies but was soon overtaken by Salem Massachusetts and Newport Rhode Island Boston eventually became a center of the American abolitionist movement The city reacted largely negatively to the Fugitive Slave Act of contributing to President Franklin Pierce s attempt to make an example of Boston after Anthony Burns s attempt to escape to freedom br In the citizens of Boston voted to change the official name from the Town of Boston to the City of Boston and on March the people of Boston accepted the charter incorporating the city At the time Boston was chartered as a city the population was about while
