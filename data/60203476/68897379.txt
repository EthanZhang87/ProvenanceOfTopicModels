character is a Tibetan man while the film version is an androgynous Celtic Swinton s casting was widely criticized as whitewashing Director Scott Derrickson and co writer C Robert Cargill wanted to avoid adapting the character as portrayed in the comics as they felt it was perpetuating Asian Fu Manchu stereotypes from the time period while also aggravating the Tibetan sovereignty debate Derrickson initially wanted to change the character to an Asian woman but he felt that this would either invoke the Dragon Lady stereotype or Asian fetishism depending on the age of the actress He also wanted to avoid the stereotype of a Western character coming to Asia to learn about being Asian so he ultimately decided to cast a non Asian actor in the role Swinton was cast because Derrickson felt that she could play the domineering secretive ethereal enigmatic and mystical side of the character Swinton also chose to portray the character as androgynous though using female pronouns Derrickson said he was pleased with the diversity of the film s cast in terms of both gender and ethnicity but acknowledged that Asians have been whitewashed and stereotyped in American cinema for over a century and people should be mad or nothing will change What I did was the lesser of two evils but it is still an evil Looking back at the casting in May Feige said the studio thought they were
