br Twelve extraterrestrial spacecraft hover over various locations around the Earth In the ensuing widespread panic affected nations send military and scientific experts to monitor and study them In the United States US Army Colonel Weber recruits Banks and physicist Ian Donnelly to study the craft above Montana On board Banks and Donnelly make contact with two cephalopod like seven limbed aliens whom they call heptapods Donnelly nicknames them Abbott and Costello Banks and Donnelly research the complex written language of the heptapods consisting of palindromic phrases written with circular symbols and share the results with other nations As Banks studies the language she starts to have flashback like visions of her daughter br When Banks is able to establish sufficient shared vocabulary to ask why the heptapods have come they answer with a statement that could be translated as offer weapon China interprets this as use weapon prompting them to break off communications and other nations follow Banks argues that the symbol interpreted as weapon can be more abstractly related to the concepts of means or tool China s translation likely results from interacting with the heptapods using mahjong a highly competitive game br Rogue soldiers plant a bomb in the Montana craft Unaware Banks and Donnelly reenter the alien vessel and the aliens give them a more complex message Just before the bomb explodes one of the aliens ejects Donnelly and Banks from the vessel knocking them unconscious When they wake the heptapod craft has moved beyond reach and the US military is preparing to evacuate in case of retaliation br China s General Shang issues an ultimatum to his local alien craft demanding that it leave China within hours Russia Pakistan and Sudan follow suit communications between the international research teams are terminated as worldwide panic sets in br Donnelly discovers that the symbol for time is present throughout the message and that the writing occupies exactly one twelfth of the D space into which it is projected Banks suggests that the full message is split between the twelve crafts and that the heptapods want all the nations to collaborate in order to decipher it br Banks goes alone to the Montana craft which sends down a transport pod Abbott has been mortally injured as a result of the explosion Costello explains that they have come to help humanity because in years time they will need humanity s help in return Banks realizes the weapon is their language Learning the language alters humans linear perception of time allowing them to experience memories of future events Banks s visions of her daughter are revealed to be premonitions her daughter will not be born until sometime in the future br Banks returns to the camp as it is being evacuated and tells Donnelly that the aliens language is the tool that was meant by the word weapon She has a premonition of a United Nations event celebrating global unity achieved by deciphering the heptapods language At the event General Shang of China thanks Banks for persuading him to stop the attack when she called his private number and recited his wife s dying words He then shows her his private number and whispers his wife s words into her ear br In the present Banks takes CIA agent Halpern s satellite phone from a table and calls Shang s private number to recite the words The Chinese announce that they are standing down and releasing their twelfth of the message The other countries follow suit and the twelve spacecraft depart br Based on what she has learned she writes and publishes a book called The Universal Language a guide to the heptapod language which will eventually teach humanity to perceive time the same way as the heptapods br During the evacuation Donnelly expresses his love for Banks They talk about their life choices and whether he would change them if he could see his life from beginning to end Banks knows that she will agree to have a child with him despite knowing their fate that Hannah will die from an incurable disease and that Donnelly will leave them both as a result of her revealing that she knew this br br Arrival is based on the Nebula winning science fiction novella Story of Your Life by Ted Chiang The novella involves Earth s first communication with heptapods who speak in a cryptic language Screenwriter Eric Heisserer had been introduced to the story through another of Chiang s stories Understand and had begun reading Chiang s collected works when Story of Your Life had a profound emotional effect on him As a result he tried to adapt the story into a film script as he wanted to share it with a wider audience After writing an initial spec script Heisserer pitched it to production companies for several years without receiving any interest and nearly gave up on the project Heisserer believes it was not until he had successfully completed and produced s Hours that others took interest in his work he having proved himself capable Eventually Dan Levine and Dan Cohen of Laps Entertainment expressed interest in Heisserer s script Shawn Levy of Laps said they had become aware of Story of Your Life around and considered it a powerful work when they learned of Heisserer s script adaptation they started working closely with him helping him refine the script before they began seeking a director and distribution studio br br One of the directors that Laps approached was Denis Villeneuve Villeneuve had wanted to make a science fiction film for some time although he never found the right thing Cohen and Levine introduced Villeneuve to the novella which he immediately took to although his work on Prisoners meant that he did not have the time to properly adapt it into a screenplay with Heisserer Heisserer completed a first draft which he and Villeneuve reworked into the final script Villeneuve changed the title as he felt the original sounded like a romantic comedy and that the script had become very different from the short story While Villeneuve went through hundreds of possible titles Arrival was the first one his team of producers and writers had suggested br Heisserer made several changes to Story of Your Life between writing his original screenplays and the final script the main one being that the heptapods actually arrived on Earth in a type of first contact situation as he felt this helped to create the tension and conflict needed for a film Heisserer said that earlier versions of the script had a different ending the gift from the heptapods was to have been blueprints to an interstellar ship like an ark of sorts to enable humanity to help them in years But after the release of Interstellar in Heisserer and Villeneuve agreed that this would not work and decided that the heptapods gift would be what was there in front of us the power of their language br Amy Adams entered negotiations to star in the film in April and was confirmed by the time Jeremy Renner joined the film in March Forest Whitaker signed on in April with Michael Stuhlbarg joining in June Adams consulted with linguist Jessica Coon to prepare for her role br br Principal photography lasted for days beginning on June after Renner had fulfilled his obligations to Captain America Civil War Filming was done mainly in and around Montreal Quebec with Saint Fabien serving as Montana The team took some time to find the right site to represent the landing of the spacecraft because producers wanted to avoid a mountainous site that might dwarf the scale of the ship but thought a barren location would be clich Most of the filming that did not involve the exterior of a ship was done indoors on sound stages although a real house in Chemin de l le Vaudreuil Dorion was used as Banks s home The scenes of the university where Banks teaches were shot on the main campus of Universit de Montr al including HEC Montr al s auditorium and cafeteria Bradford Young was sought out by Villeneuve as he was looking for a cinematographer with a sensibility toward natural lighting Said Villeneuve I wanted the movie to have strong roots in realism I wanted a cinematographer who would not be afraid to deal with intimacy It s a very specific sensibility that I felt in Bradford s previous work Color timing was used as a means of matching Louise s state of mind at a given moment Young said I went for cooler colors when I wanted Amy to feel worn down We tried to pull back on that a little bit but then Denis stopped me in the color timing and told me not to be so concerned about skin tone and let her be pasty let her exist in that melancholy space let us feel that visually When discussing the film with Villeneuve Young described the director s goal of making a dirty science fiction film by making it look more grounded and slightly boring as Villeneuve put it Young also used the book Speedway by photographer Martina Hoogland Ivanow as a reference for the film s look br br Production designer Patrice Vermette discussed the film in a February interview with Popular Mechanics saying that a big influence on the film s look was the works of James Turrell particularly the design of the meeting room aboard the alien craft I wanted the simplicity and the sensorial experience you feel in a room like that That big screen was always there in the script and I used it as an element to unite Louise s world For me that big screen is more than a screen that room which they called in the script the interview room is a classroom That big white screen you see it represented in Louise s house with the big window You also see it in her school in her classroom br Rodeo FX completed visual shots for the film and said that its biggest challenge was the sequence in which Louise and Ian first enter the alien craft br The asteroid Eunomia is the inspiration for the look of the heptapod ships br br Both the book and the screenwriting required the invention of a form of alien linguistics which recurs in the plot The film uses a script designed by the artist Martine Bertrand wife of the production designer Patrice Vermette based on scriptwriter Heisserer s original concept Computer scientists Stephen and Christopher Wolfram analyzed it to provide the basis for Banks s work in the film Their works are summarized in a GitHub repository Three linguists from McGill University were consulted The sound files for the alien language were created with consultation from Morgan Sonderegger a phonetics expert Lisa Travis was consulted for set design during the construction of the scientist s workplaces Jessica Coon a Canada Research Chair in Syntax and Indigenous Languages was consulted for her linguistics expertise during the review of the script Heisserer said at the Alamo Drafthouse s Fantastic Fest premiere of Arrival at the end of September that Shang s wife s last words translated into English were In war there are no winners only widows Villeneuve decided not to include subtitles for the line Heisserer said he would have preferred it not be kept secret and was happy to reveal the translation br br J hann J hannsson began writing the score as the shooting started drawing on the screenplay and concept art for inspiration He developed one of the main themes in the first week using vocals and experimental piano loops The original soundtrack was released by Deutsche Grammophon on November br Max Richter s preexisting piece On the Nature of Daylight is featured in the film s opening and closing scenes Due to the prominent use of Richter s music which had also featured in Martin Scorsese s film Shutter Island J hannsson s score was deemed ineligible for the Academy Award for Best Original Score the rationale being that voters would be influenced by the use of preexisting music when judging its merits br br A teaser trailer was released in August followed the next week by the first official trailer Paramount Pictures released a series of promotional posters with one showing a UFO hovering above a Hong Kong skyline that included Shanghai s Oriental Pearl Tower The inaccuracy angered Hong Kong social media users The posters were withdrawn and a statement attributed the inaccuracy to a third party vendor br In May while titled Story of Your Life Paramount acquired the US and Canadian distribution rights Shortly

Australian distribution rights Spentzos Films acquired distribution rights for Greece Reliance Entertainment for India ultimately it was MVP Entertainment that released it there Lev Cinemas for Israel

A to F scale br Robbie Collin of The Telegraph praised the film calling it introspective philosophical and existentially inclined yet it unfolds in an unwavering tenor of chest tightening excitement And there is a mid film revelation less a sudden twist than sleek unwinding of everything you think you know that feels when it hits you like your seat is tipping back Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert com gave the film three out of four It s a movie designed to simultaneously challenge viewers move them and get them talking For the most part it succeeds For Time Sam Lansky called it sophisticated grownup sci fi a movie about aliens for people who don t like movies about aliens IGN reviewer Chris Tilly gave it a score of out of saying Arrival is a language lesson masquerading as a blockbuster though much more entertaining than that sounds it s smart sophisticated sci fi that asks big questions and does a pretty good job of answering them Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times praised Adams s performance writing Arrival is really Adams film a showcase for her ability to quietly and effectively meld intelligence empathy and reserve Writing for USA Today Brian Truitt called Adams a definite contender for the Oscar for Best Actress saying she was spectacular in giving Louise the right emotional balance br Conversely Forrest Wickman of Slate had a more mixed opinion of the film praising the cinematography and musical score but writing that he thought it was similar to Christopher Nolan s only intermittently stellar Interstellar and criticizing the dialogue as clunky br Rex Reed writing for the New York Observer gave the film one out of four calling it Villeneuve s latest exercise in pretentious poopery and referring to a lack of action in the storyline br The Guardian rated it the third best film of Critic Catherine Shoard said that it amounts to something transcendent something to reignite your excitement for cinema for life Numerous other publications and websites including io Den of Geek Mir Fantastiki The Atlantic Blastr and Digital Trends named Arrival the best film of br br David Adger a linguistics professor who teaches at Queen Mary University of London had a favorable view of the accuracy of the linguistics in Arrival saying the portrayal of trying different hypotheses about the language coming up with generalizations and testing them out was spot on br Similarly Jessica Coon a linguistics professor who teaches at McGill University and helped with the film s linguistics said what the film gets exactly right is both the interactive nature but also that you really have to start small She noted that the creators had not invented a complete language br Linguistics professor Betty Birner who teaches at Northern Illinois University said that the film s use of the Sapir Whorf hypothesis went beyond anything that is plausible She also felt the film oversimplified the process of translating the aliens language skipping straight from Banks establishing the basic vocabulary of the language to her being able to understand abstract concepts such as weapon br br For the Academy Awards Arrival was nominated for Best Picture Best
