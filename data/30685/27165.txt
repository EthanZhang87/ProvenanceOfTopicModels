title: Sexism
id: 27165
Sexism is prejudice or discrimination based on one s sex or gender Sexism can affect anyone but primarily affects women and girls It has been linked to gender roles and stereotypes and may include the belief that one sex or gender is intrinsically superior to another Extreme sexism may foster sexual harassment rape and other forms of sexual violence Discrimination in this context is defined as discrimination toward people based on their gender identity or their gender or sex differences An example of this is workplace inequality Sexism refers to violation of equal opportunities formal equality based on gender or refers to violation of equality of outcomes based on gender also called substantive equality Sexism may arise from social or cultural customs and norms br br According to legal scholar Fred R Shapiro the term sexism was most likely coined on November by Pauline M Leet during a Student Faculty Forum at Franklin and Marshall College Specifically the word sexism appears in Leet s forum contribution Women and the Undergraduate and she defines it by comparing it to racism stating in part When you argue that since fewer women write good poetry this justifies their total exclusion you are taking a position analogous to that of the racist I might call you in this case a sexist Both the racist and the sexist are acting as if all that has happened had never happened and both of them are making decisions and coming to conclusions about someone s value by referring to factors which are in both cases irrelevant br According to the Oxford English Dictionary the first time the term sexism appeared in print was in Caroline Bird s speech On Being Born Female which was delivered before the Episcopal Church Executive Council in Greenwich Connecticut and subsequently published on November in Vital Speeches of the Day p br Sexism may be defined as an ideology based on the belief that one sex is superior to another It is discrimination prejudice or stereotyping based on gender and is most often expressed toward women and girls br Sociology has examined sexism as manifesting at both the individual and the institutional level According to Richard Schaefer sexism is perpetuated by all major social institutions Sociologists describe parallels among other ideological systems of oppression such as racism which also operates at both the individual and institutional level Early female sociologists Charlotte Perkins Gilman Ida B Wells and Harriet Martineau described systems of gender inequality but did not use the term sexism which was coined later Sociologists who adopted the functionalist paradigm e g Talcott Parsons understood gender inequality as the natural outcome of a dimorphic model of gender br Psychologists Mary Crawford and Rhoda Unger define sexism as prejudice held by individuals that encompasses negative attitudes and values about women as a group Peter Glick and Susan Fiske coined the term ambivalent sexism to describe how stereotypes about women can be both positive and negative and that individuals compartmentalize the stereotypes they hold into hostile sexism or benevolent sexism br Feminist author bell hooks defines sexism as a system of oppression that results in disadvantages for women Feminist philosopher Marilyn Frye defines sexism as an attitudinal conceptual cognitive orientational complex of male supremacy male chauvinism and misogyny br Philosopher Kate Manne defines sexism as one branch of a patriarchal order In her definition sexism rationalizes and justifies patriarchal norms in contrast with misogyny the branch which polices and enforces patriarchal norms Manne says that sexism often attempts to make patriarchal social arrangements seem natural good or inevitable so that there appears to be no reason to resist them br br Evidence is lacking to support the idea that many pre agricultural societies afforded women a higher status than women today however historians are reasonably sure that women had roughly equal social power to men in many such societies br br After the adoption of agriculture and sedentary cultures the concept that one gender was inferior to the other was established most often this was imposed upon women and girls br The status of women in ancient Egypt depended on their fathers or husbands but they had property rights and could attend court including as plaintiffs Examples of unequal treatment of women in the ancient world include written laws preventing women from participating in the political process for instance women in ancient Rome could not vote or hold political office Another example is scholarly texts that indoctrinate children in female inferiority women in ancient China were taught the Confucian principles that a woman should obey her father in childhood husband in marriage and son in widowhood On the other hand women of the Anglo Saxon era were commonly afforded equal status br br Sexism may have been the impetus that fueled the witch trials between the th and th centuries In early modern Europe and in the European colonies in North America claims were made that witches were a threat to Christendom The misogyny of that period played a role in the persecution of these women br In Malleus Maleficarum by Heinrich Kramer the book which played a major role in the witch hunts and trials the author argues that women are more likely to practice witchcraft than men and writes that br br All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman What else is a woman but a foe to friendship an inescapable punishment a necessary evil a natural temptation a desirable calamity a domestic danger a delectable detriment an evil of nature painted with fair colors br Witchcraft remains illegal in several countries including Saudi Arabia where it is punishable by death In a woman was beheaded in that country for witchcraft and sorcery Murders of women after being accused of witchcraft remain common in some parts of the world for example in Tanzania about elderly women are murdered each year following such accusations br When women are targeted with accusations of witchcraft and subsequent violence it is often the case that several forms of discrimination interact for example discrimination based on gender with discrimination based on caste as is the case in India and Nepal where such crimes are relatively common br br Until the th century U S and English law observed the system of coverture where by marriage the husband and wife are one person in law that is the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage U S women were not legally defined as persons until Minor v Happersett U S A similar legal doctrine called marital power existed under Roman Dutch law and is still partially in force in present day Eswatini br Restrictions on married women s rights were common in Western countries until a few decades ago for instance French married women obtained the right to work without their husband s permission in and in West Germany women obtained this right in During the Franco era in Spain a married woman required her husband s consent called permiso marital for employment ownership of property and traveling away from home the permiso marital was abolished in In Australia until a married woman s passport application had to be authorized by her husband br Women in parts of the world continue to lose their legal rights in marriage For example Yemeni marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission In Iraq the law allows husbands to legally punish their wives In the Democratic Republic of Congo the Family Code states that the husband is the head of the household the wife owes her obedience to her husband a wife has to live with her husband wherever he chooses to live and wives must have their husbands authorization to bring a case in court or initiate other legal proceedings br Abuses and discriminatory practices against women in marriage are often rooted in financial payments such as dowry bride price and dower These transactions often serve as legitimizing coercive control of the wife by her husband and in giving him authority over her for instance Article of the Code of Personal Status Tunisia states that The husband shall not in default of payment of the dower force the woman to consummate the marriage implying that if the dower is paid marital rape is permitted In this regard critics have questioned the alleged gains of women in Tunisia and its image as a progressive country in the region arguing that discrimination against women remains very strong there br The World Organisation Against Torture OMCT has recognized the independence and ability to leave an abusive husband as crucial in stopping mistreatment of women However in some parts of the world once married women have very little chance of leaving a violent husband obtaining a divorce is very difficult in many jurisdictions because of the need to prove fault in court While attempting a de facto separation moving away from the marital home is also impossible because of laws preventing this For instance in Afghanistan a wife who leaves her marital home risks being imprisoned for running away In addition many former British colonies including India maintain the concept of restitution of conjugal rights under which a wife may be ordered by court to return to her husband if she fails to do so she may be held in contempt of court Other problems have to do with the payment of the bride price if the wife wants to leave her husband may demand the return of the bride price that he had paid to the woman s family and the woman s family often cannot or does not want to pay it back br Laws regulations and traditions related to marriage continue to discriminate against women in many parts of the world and to contribute to the mistreatment of women in particular in areas related to sexual violence and to self determination regarding sexuality the violation of the latter now being acknowledged as a violation of women s rights In Navi Pillay then High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that br br Women are frequently treated as property they are sold into marriage into trafficking into sexual slavery Violence against women frequently takes the form of sexual violence Victims of such violence are often accused of promiscuity and held responsible for their fate while infertile women are rejected by husbands families and communities In many countries married women may not refuse to have sexual relations with their husbands and often have no say in whether they use contraception Ensuring that women have full autonomy over their bodies is the first crucial step towards achieving substantive equality between women and men Personal issues such as when how and with whom they choose to have sex and when how and with whom they choose to have children are at the heart of living a life in dignity br br Gender has been used as a tool for discrimination against women in the political sphere Women s suffrage was not achieved until when New Zealand was the first country to grant women the right to vote Saudi Arabia is the most recent country as of August to extend the right to vote to women in Some Western countries allowed women the right to vote only relatively recently Swiss women gained the right to vote in federal elections in and Appenzell Innerrhoden became the last canton to grant women the right to vote on local issues in when it was forced to do so by the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland French women were granted the right to vote in In Greece women obtained the right to vote in In Liechtenstein women obtained the right to vote in through the women s suffrage referendum of br While almost every woman today has the right to vote there is still progress to be made for women in politics Studies have shown that in several democracies including Australia Canada and the United States women are still represented using gender stereotypes in the press Multiple authors have shown that gender differences in the media are less evident today than they used to be in the s but are still present Certain issues e g education are likely to be linked with female candidates while other issues e g taxes are likely to be linked with male candidates In addition there is more emphasis on female candidates personal qualities such as their appearance and their personality as females are portrayed as emotional and dependent br There is a widespread imbalance of lawmaking power between men and women The ratio of women to men in legislatures is used as a measure of gender equality in the United Nations Gender Empowerment Measure and its newer incarnation the Gender Inequality Index Speaking about China Lanyan Chen stated that since men more than women serve as the gatekeepers of policy making this may lead to women s needs not being properly represented In this sense the inequality in lawmaking power also causes gender discrimination br br Until the early s some high end restaurants had two menus a regular menu with the prices listed for men and a second menu for women which did not have the prices listed it was called the ladies menu so that the female diner would not know the prices of the items In Kathleen Bick took a male business partner out to dinner at L Orangerie in West Hollywood After she was given a women s menu without prices and her guest got one with prices Bick hired lawyer Gloria Allred to file a discrimination lawsuit on the grounds that the women s menu went against the California Civil Rights Act Bick stated that getting a women s menu without prices left her feeling humiliated and incensed The owners of the restaurant defended the practice saying it was done as a courtesy like the way men would stand up when a woman enters the room Even though the lawsuit was dropped the restaurant ended its gender based menu policy br br A study found little evidence that levels of sexism had changed from to in the United States br br Gender stereotypes are widely held beliefs about the characteristics and behavior of women and men Empirical studies have found widely shared cultural beliefs that men are more socially valued and more competent than women in a number of activities Dustin B Thoman and others hypothesize that t he socio cultural salience of ability versus other components of the gender math stereotype may impact women pursuing math Through the experiment comparing the math outcomes of women under two various gender math stereotype components which are the ability of math and the effort on math respectively Thoman and others found that women s math performance is more likely to be affected by the negative ability stereotype which is influenced by sociocultural beliefs in the United States rather than the effort component As a result of this experiment and the sociocultural beliefs in the United States Thoman and others concluded that individuals academic outcomes can be affected by the gender math stereotype component that is influenced by the sociocultural beliefs br br Sexism in language exists when language devalues members of a certain gender Sexist language in many instances promotes male superiority Sexism in language affects consciousness perceptions of reality encoding and transmitting cultural meanings and socialization Researchers have pointed to the semantic rule in operation in language of the male as norm This results in sexism as the male becomes the standard and those who are not male are relegated to the inferior Sexism in language is considered a form of indirect sexism because it is not always overt br Examples include br br Using generic masculine terms to reference a group of mixed gender such as mankind man referring to humanity guys or officers and men br Using the singular masculine pronoun he his him as the default to refer to a person of unknown gender br Terms ending in man that may be performed by those of non male genders such as businessman chairman or policeman br Using unnecessary gender markers such as male nurse implying that simply a nurse is by default assumed to be female br br Various th century feminist movements from liberal feminism and radical feminism to standpoint feminism postmodern feminism and queer theory have considered language in their theorizing Most of these theories have maintained a critical stance on language that calls for a change in the way speakers use their language br One of the most common calls is for gender neutral language Many have called attention however to the fact that the English language is not inherently sexist in its linguistic system but the way it is used becomes sexist and gender neutral language could thus be employed br br Romanic languages such as French and Spanish may be seen as reinforcing sexism in that the masculine form is the default The word mademoiselle meaning miss was declared banished from French administrative forms in by Prime Minister Fran ois Fillon Current pressure calls for the use of the masculine plural pronoun as the default in a mixed sex group to change As for Spanish Mexico s Ministry of the Interior published a guide on how to reduce the use of sexist language br German speakers have also raised questions about how sexism intersects with grammar The German language is heavily inflected for gender number and case nearly all nouns denoting the occupations or statuses of human beings are gender differentiated For more gender neutral constructions gerund nouns are sometimes used instead as this eliminates the grammatical gender distinction in the plural and significantly reduces it in the singular For example instead of die Studenten the men students or die Studentinnen the women students one writes die Studierenden the people who are studying However this approach introduces an element of ambiguity because gerund nouns more precisely denote one currently engaged in the activity rather than one who routinely engages in it as their primary occupation br In Chinese some writers have pointed to sexism inherent in the structure of written characters For example the character for man is linked to those for positive qualities like courage and effect while the character for wife is composed of a female part and a broom considered of low worth br br Gender specific pejorative terms intimidate or harm another person because of their gender Sexism can be expressed in language with negative gender oriented implications such as condescension For example one may refer to a female as a girl rather than a woman implying that she is subordinate or not fully mature Other examples include obscene language Some words are offensive to transgender people including tranny she male or he she Intentional misgendering assigning the wrong gender to someone and the pronoun it are also considered pejorative br br Occupational sexism refers to discriminatory practices statements or actions based on a person s sex occurring in the workplace One form of occupational sexism is wage discrimination In the Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD found that while female employment rates have expanded and gender employment and wage gaps have narrowed nearly everywhere on average women still have less chance to have a job and are paid less than men The report stated In many countries labour market discrimination i e the unequal treatment of equally productive individuals only because they belong to a specific group is still a crucial factor inflating disparities in employment and the quality of job opportunities Evidence presented in this edition of the Employment Outlook suggests that about percent of the variation in gender employment gaps and percent of the variation in gender wage gaps across OECD countries can be explained by discriminatory practices in the labor market br It also found that although almost all OECD countries including the U S have established anti discrimination laws these laws are difficult to enforce br Women who enter predominantly male work groups can experience the negative consequences of tokenism performance pressures social isolation and role encapsulation Tokenism could be used to camouflage sexism to preserve male workers advantage in the workplace No link exists between the proportion of women working in an organization company and the improvement of their working conditions Ignoring sexist issues may exacerbate women s occupational problems br In the World Values Survey of responders were asked if they thought wage work should be restricted to men only In Iceland the percentage that agreed was whereas in Egypt it was br br Research has repeatedly shown that mothers in the United States are less likely to be hired than equally qualified fathers and if hired receive a lower salary than male applicants with children br One study found that female applicants were favored however its results have been met with skepticism from other researchers since it contradicts most other studies on the issue Joan C Williams a distinguished professor at the University of California s Hastings College of Law raised issues with its methodology pointing out that the fictional female candidates it used were unusually well qualified Studies using more moderately qualified graduate students have found that male students are much more likely to be hired offered better salaries and offered mentorship br In Europe studies based on field experiments in the labor market provide evidence for no severe levels of discrimination based on female gender However unequal treatment is still measured in particular situations for instance when candidates apply for positions at a higher functional level in Belgium when they apply at their fertile ages in France and when they apply for male dominated occupations in Austria br br Studies have concluded that on average women earn lower wages than men worldwide Some people argue that this results from widespread gender discrimination in the workplace Others argue that the wage gap results from different choices by men and women such as women placing more value than men on having children and men being more likely than women to choose careers in high paying fields such as business engineering and technology br Eurostat found a persistent average gender pay gap of in the EU member states in Similarly the OECD found that female full time employees earned less than their male counterparts in OECD countries in br In the United States the female to male earnings ratio was in female full time year round FTYR workers earned as much as male FTYR workers Women s earnings relative to men s fell from to rose rapidly from to leveled off from to and rose from to As of the late s it has decreased back to around to levels When the first Equal Pay Act was passed in female full time workers earned as much as male full time workers br Research conducted in Czechia and Slovakia shows that even after the governments passed anti discrimination legislation two thirds of the gender gap in wages remained unexplained and segregation continued to represent a major source of the gap br The gender gap can also vary across occupation and within occupation In Taiwan for example studies show how the bulk of gender wage discrepancies occur within occupation In Russia research shows that the gender wage gap is distributed unevenly across income levels and that it mainly occurs at the lower end of income distribution The research also found that wage arrears and payment in kind attenuated wage discrimination particularly amongst the lowest paid workers suggesting that Russian enterprise managers assigned lowest importance to equity considerations when allocating these forms of payment br The gender pay gap has been attributed to differences in personal and workplace characteristics between men and women such as education hours worked and occupation innate behavioral and biological differences between men and women and discrimination in the labor market such as gender stereotypes and customer and employer bias Women take significantly more time off to raise children than men In certain countries such as South Korea it has also been a long established practice to lay off female employees upon marriage A study by Professor Linda C Babcock in her book Women Don t Ask shows that men are eight times more likely to ask for a pay raise suggesting that pay inequality may be partly a result of behavioral differences between the sexes However studies generally find that a portion of the gender pay gap remains unexplained after accounting for factors assumed to influence earnings the unexplained portion of the wage gap is attributed to gender discrimination br Estimates of the discriminatory component of the gender pay gap vary The OECD estimated that approximately of the gender pay gap across OECD countries is because of discrimination Australian research shows that discrimination accounts for approximately of the wage differential between men and women Studies examining the gender pay gap in the United States show that a much of the wage differential remains unexplained after controlling for factors affecting pay One study of college graduates found that the portion of the pay gap unexplained after all other factors are taken into account is five percent one year after graduating and a decade after graduation A study by the American Association of University Women found that women graduates in the United States are paid less than men doing the same work and majoring in the same field br br Wage discrimination is theorized as contradicting the economic concept of supply and demand which states that if a good or service in this case labor is in demand and has value it will find its price in the market If a worker offered equal value for less pay supply and demand would indicate a greater demand for lower paid workers If a business hired lower wage workers for the same work it would lower its costs and enjoy a competitive advantage According to supply and demand if women offered equal value demand and wages should rise since they offer a better price lower wages for their service than men do br Research at Cornell University and elsewhere indicates that mothers in the United States are less likely to be hired than equally qualified fathers and if hired receive a lower salary than male applicants with children The OECD found that a significant impact of children on women s pay is generally found in the United Kingdom and the United States Fathers earn more on average than men without children do br There is research to suggest that the gender wage gap leads to big losses for the economy br br The non adjusted gender pay gap the difference without taking into account differences in working hours occupations education and work experience is not itself a measure of discrimination Rather it combines differences in the average pay of women and men to serve as a barometer of comparison Differences in pay are caused by br br occupational segregation with more men in higher paid industries and women in lower paid industries br vertical segregation fewer women in senior and hence better paying positions br ineffective equal pay legislation br women s overall paid working hours and br barriers to entry into the labor market such as education level and single parenting rate br Some variables that help explain the non adjusted gender pay gap include economic activity working time and job tenure Gender specific factors including gender differences in qualifications and discrimination overall wage structure and the differences in remuneration across industry sectors all influence the gender pay gap br Eurostat estimated in that after allowing for average characteristics of men and women women still earn less than men Since this estimate accounts for average differences between men and women it is an estimation of the unexplained gender pay gap i e that which cannot be accounted for by factors such as differences in profession br br The popular notion of glass ceiling effects implies that gender or other disadvantages are stronger at the top of the hierarchy than at lower levels and that these disadvantages become worse later in a person s career br In the United States women account for of the overall labor force but make up only three percent of corporate CEOs and top executives Some researchers see the root cause of this situation in the tacit discrimination based on gender conducted by current top executives and corporate directors primarily male and the historic absence of women in top positions which may lead to hysteresis preventing women from accessing powerful male dominated professional networks or same sex mentors The glass ceiling effect is noted as being especially persistent for women of color According to a report women of colour perceive a concrete ceiling and not simply a glass ceiling br In the economics profession it has been observed that women are more inclined than men to dedicate their time to teaching and service Since continuous research work is crucial for promotion the cumulative effect of small contemporaneous differences in research orientation could generate the observed significant gender difference in promotion In the high tech industry research shows that regardless of the intra firm changes extra organizational pressures will likely contribute to continued gender stratification as firms upgrade leading to the potential masculinization of skilled high tech work br The United Nations asserts that progress in bringing women into leadership and decision making positions around the world remains far too slow br br Research by David Matsa and Amalia Miller suggests that a remedy to the glass ceiling could be increasing the number of women on corporate boards which could lead to increases in the number of women working in top management positions The same research suggests that this could also result in a feedback cycle in which the presence of more female managers increases the qualified pool of potential female board members for the companies they manage as well as other companies leading to greater female board membership and then further increases in female executives br br A study found that being overweight harms women s career advancement but presents no barrier for men Overweight women were significantly underrepresented among company bosses making up between five and of female CEOs However the proportion of overweight male CEOs was between and over representing overweight men On the other hand approximately five percent of CEOs were obese among both genders The author of the study stated that the results suggest that the glass ceiling effect on women s advancement may reflect not only general negative stereotypes about the competencies of women but also weight bias that results in the application of stricter appearance standards to women br br Transgender people also experience significant workplace discrimination and harassment Unlike sex based discrimination refusing to hire or firing a worker for their gender identity or expression is not explicitly illegal in most U S states In June the United States Supreme Court ruled that federal civil rights law protects gay lesbian and transgender workers Writing for the majority Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision exactly what Title VII forbids The ruling however did not protect LGBT employees from being fired based on their sexual orientation or gender identity in businesses of workers or less br In August Kimberly Nixon filed a complaint with the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal against Vancouver Rape Relief Women s Shelter Nixon a trans woman had been interested in volunteering as a counsellor with the shelter When the shelter learned that she was transsexual they told Nixon that she would not be allowed to volunteer with the organization Nixon argued that this constituted illegal discrimination under Section of the British Columbia Human Rights Code Vancouver Rape Relief countered that individuals are shaped by the socialization and experiences of their formative years and that Nixon had been socialized as a male growing up and that therefore Nixon would not be able to provide sufficiently effective counselling to the female born women that the shelter served Nixon took her case to the Supreme Court of Canada which refused to hear the case br br In social philosophy objectification is the act of treating a person as an object or thing Objectification plays a central role in feminist theory especially sexual objectification Feminist writer and gender equality activist Joy Goh Mah argues that by being objectified a person is denied agency According to the philosopher Martha Nussbaum a person might be objectified if one or more of the following properties are applied to them br br Instrumentality treating the object as a tool for another s purposes The objectifier treats the object as a tool of his or her purposes br Denial of autonomy treating the object as lacking in autonomy or self determination The objectifier treats the object as lacking in autonomy and self determination br Inertness treating the object as lacking in agency or activity The objectifier treats the object as lacking in agency and perhaps also in activity br Fungibility treating the object as interchangeable with other objects The objectifier treats the object as interchangeable a with other objects of the same type and or b with objects of other types br Violability treating the object as lacking in boundary integrity and violable The objectifier treats the object as lacking in boundary integrity as something that it is permissible to break up smash break into br Ownership treating the object as if it can be owned bought or sold The objectifier treats the object as something that is owned by another can be bought or sold etc br Denial of subjectivity treating the object as if there is no need for concern for its experiences or feelings The objectifier treats the object as something whose experience and feelings if any need not be taken into account br Rae Helen Langton in Sexual Solipsism Philosophical Essays on Pornography and Objectification proposed three more properties to be added to Nussbaum s list br br Reduction to Body the treatment of a person as identified with their body or body parts br Reduction to Appearance the treatment of a person primarily in terms of how they look or how they appear to the senses br Silencing the treatment of a person as if they are silent lacking the capacity to speak br According to objectification theory objectification can have important repercussions on women particularly young women as it can negatively impact their psychological health and lead to the development of mental disorders such as unipolar depression sexual dysfunction and eating disorders br br While advertising used to portray women and men in obviously stereotypical roles e g as a housewife breadwinner in modern advertisements they are no longer solely confined to their traditional roles However advertising today still stereotypes men and women albeit in more subtle ways including by sexually objectifying them Women are most often targets of sexism in advertising When in advertisements with men they are often shorter and put in the background of images shown in more feminine poses and generally present a higher degree of body display br Today some countries for example Norway and Denmark have laws against sexual objectification in advertising Nudity is not banned and nude people can be used to advertise a product if they are relevant to the product advertised Sol Olving head of Norway s Kreativt Forum an association of the country s top advertising agencies explained You could have a naked person advertising shower gel or a cream but not a woman in a bikini draped across a car br Other countries continue to ban nudity on traditional obscenity grounds but also make explicit reference to sexual objectification such as Israel s ban of billboards that depicts sexual humiliation or abasement or presents a human being as an object available for sexual use br br Anti pornography feminist Catharine MacKinnon argues that pornography contributes to sexism by objectifying women and portraying them in submissive roles MacKinnon along with Andrea Dworkin argues that pornography reduces women to mere tools and is a form of sex discrimination The two scholars highlight the link between objectification and pornography by stating br br We define pornography as the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures and words that also includes i women are presented dehumanized as sexual objects things or commodities or ii women are presented as sexual objects who enjoy humiliation or pain or iii women are presented as sexual objects experiencing sexual pleasure in rape incest or other sexual assault or iv women are presented as sexual objects tied up cut up or mutilated or bruised or physically hurt or v women are presented in postures or positions of sexual submission servility or display or vi women s body parts including but not limited to vaginas breasts or buttocks are exhibited such that women are reduced to those parts or vii women are presented being penetrated by objects or animals or viii women are presented in scenarios of degradation humiliation injury torture shown as filthy or inferior bleeding bruised or hurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual br Robin Morgan and Catharine MacKinnon suggest that certain types of pornography also contribute to violence against women by eroticizing scenes in which women are dominated coerced humiliated or sexually assaulted br Some people opposed to pornography including MacKinnon charge that the production of pornography entails physical psychological and economic coercion of the women who perform and model in it Opponents of pornography charge that it presents a distorted image of sexual relations and reinforces sexual myths it shows women as continually available and willing to engage in sex at any time with any person on their terms responding positively to any requests br MacKinnon writes br br Pornography affects people s belief in rape myths So for example if a woman says I didn t consent and people have been viewing pornography they believe rape myths and believe the woman did consent no matter what she said That when she said no she meant yes When she said she didn t want to that meant more beer When she said she would prefer to go home that means she s a lesbian who needs to be given a good corrective experience Pornography promotes these rape myths and desensitizes people to violence against women so that you need more violence to become sexually aroused if you re a pornography consumer This is very well documented br Defenders of pornography and anti censorship activists including sex positive feminists argue that pornography does not seriously impact a mentally healthy individual since the viewer can distinguish between fantasy and reality Some also contend that both men and women are objectified in pornography particularly sadistic or masochistic pornography in which men are objectified and sexually used by women br br Prostitution is the business or practice of engaging in sexual relations for payment Sex workers are often objectified and are seen as existing only to serve clients thus calling their sense of agency into question There is a prevailing notion that because they sell sex professionally prostitutes automatically consent to all sexual contact As a result sex workers face higher rates of violence and sexual assault This is often dismissed ignored and not taken seriously by authorities br In many countries prostitution is dominated by brothels or pimps who often claim ownership over sex workers This sense of ownership furthers the concept that sex workers are void of agency This is literally the case in instances of sexual slavery br Various authors have argued that female prostitution is based on male sexism that condones the idea that unwanted sex with a woman is acceptable that men s desires must be satisfied and that women are coerced into and exist to serve men sexually The European Women s Lobby condemned prostitution as an intolerable form of male violence br br Carole Pateman writes that br Prostitution is the use of a woman s body by a man for his own satisfaction There is no desire or satisfaction on the part of the prostitute Prostitution is not mutual pleasurable exchange of the use of bodies but the unilateral use of a woman s body by a man in exchange for money br br Some scholars believe that media portrayals of demographic groups can both maintain and disrupt attitudes and behaviors toward those groups According to Susan Douglas Since the early s much of the media have come to overrepresent women as having made it completely in the professions as having gained sexual equality with men and having achieved a level of financial success and comfort enjoyed primarily by Tiffany s encrusted doyennes of Laguna Beach These images may be harmful particularly to women and racial and ethnic minority groups For example a study of African American women found they feel that media portrayals of themselves often reinforce stereotypes of this group as overly sexual and idealize images of lighter skinned thinner African American women images African American women describe as objectifying In a recent analysis of images of Haitian women in the Associated Press photo archive from to several themes emerged emphasizing the otherness of Haitian women and characterizing them as victims in need of rescue br In an attempt to study the effect of media consumption on males Samantha and Bridges found an effect on body shame though not through self objectification as it was found in comparable studies of women The authors conclude that the current measures of objectification were designed for women and do not measure men accurately Another study found a negative effect on eating attitudes and body satisfaction of consumption of beauty and fitness magazines for women and men respectively but again with different mechanisms namely self objectification for women and internalization for men br br Frederick Attenborough argues that sexist jokes can be a form of sexual objectification which reduce the butt of the joke to an object They not only objectify women but can also condone violence or prejudice against women Sexist humor the denigration of women through humor for instance trivializes sex discrimination under the veil of benign amusement thus precluding challenges or opposition that nonhumorous sexist communication would likely incur A study of male undergraduate students by Ford found that sexist humor can promote the behavioral expression of prejudice against women amongst sexist men According to the study when sexism is presented in a humorous manner it is viewed as tolerable and socially acceptable Disparagement of women through humor freed sexist participants from having to conform to the more general and more restrictive norms regarding discrimination against women br br Gender discrimination is discrimination based on actual or perceived gender identity Gender identity is the gender related identity appearance or mannerisms or other gender related characteristics of an individual with or without regard to the individual s designated sex at birth Gender discrimination is theoretically different from sexism Whereas sexism is prejudice based on biological sex gender discrimination specifically addresses discrimination towards gender identities including third gender genderqueer and other non binary identified people It is especially attributed to how people are treated in the workplace and banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity and expression has emerged as a subject of contention in the American legal system br According to a recent report by the Congressional Research Service although the majority of federal courts to consider the issue have concluded that discrimination on the basis of gender identity is not sex discrimination there have been several courts that have reached the opposite conclusion Hurst states that c ourts often confuse sex gender and sexual orientation and confuse them in a way that results in denying the rights not only of gays and lesbians but also of those who do not present themselves or act in a manner traditionally expected of their sex br br Oppositional sexism is a term coined by transfeminist author Julia Serano who defined oppositional sexism as the belief that male and female are rigid mutually exclusive categories Oppositional sexism plays a vital role in a number of social norms such as cisnormativity and heteronormativity br Oppositional sexism normalizes masculine expression in males and feminine expression in females while simultaneously demonizing femininity in males and masculinity in females This concept plays a crucial role in supporting cissexism the social norm that views cisgender people as both natural and privileged as opposed to transgender people br The idea of having two opposite genders is tied to sexuality through what gender theorist Judith Butler calls a compulsory practice of heterosexuality Because oppositional sexism is tied to heteronormativity in this way non heterosexuals are seen as breaking gender norms br The concept of opposite genders sets a dangerous precedent according to Serano where if men are big then women must be small and if men are strong then women must be weak The gender binary and oppositional norms work together to support traditional sexism the belief that femininity is inferior to and serves masculinity br Serano states that oppositional sexism works in tandem with traditional sexism This ensures that those who are masculine have power over those who are feminine and that only those that are born male will be seen as authentically masculine br br Transgender discrimination is discrimination towards peoples whose gender identity differs from the social expectations of the biological sex they were born with Forms of discrimination include but are not limited to identity documents not reflecting one s gender sex segregated public restrooms and other facilities dress codes according to binary gender codes and lack of access to and existence of appropriate health care services In a recent adjudication the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC concluded that discrimination against a transgender person is sex discrimination br The National Transgender Discrimination Survey NTDS a U S study by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in collaboration with the National Black Justice Coalition that was at its time the most extensive survey of transgender discrimination showed that Black transgender people in the United States suffer the combination of anti transgender bias and persistent structural and individual racism and that black transgender people live in extreme poverty that is more than twice the rate for transgender people of all races four times the general Black population rate and over eight times the general US population rate Further discrimination is faced by gender nonconforming individuals whether transitioning or not because of displacement from societally acceptable gender binaries and visible stigmatization According to the NTDS transgender gender nonconforming TGNC individuals face between eight percent and higher rates of self and social discrimination and violence than binary transgender individuals Lisa R Miller and Eric Anthony Grollman found in their study that gender nonconformity may heighten trans people s exposure to discrimination and health harming behaviors Gender nonconforming trans adults reported more events of major and everyday transphobic discrimination than their gender conforming counterparts br In another study conducted in collaboration with the League of United Latin American Citizens Latino a transgender people who were non citizens were most vulnerable to harassment abuse and violence br An updated version of the NTDS survey called the U S Transgender Survey was published in December br br A child marriage is a marriage where one or both spouses are under a practice that disproportionately affects women Child marriages are most common in South Asia the Middle East and Sub Saharan Africa but occur in other parts of the world too The practice of marrying young girls is rooted in patriarchal ideologies of control of female behavior and is also sustained by traditional practices such as dowry and bride price Child marriage is strongly connected with protecting female virginity UNICEF states that br br Marrying girls under years old is rooted in gender discrimination encouraging premature and continuous child bearing and giving preference to boys education Child marriage is also a strategy for economic survival as families marry off their daughters at an early age to reduce their economic burden br Consequences of child marriage include restricted education and employment prospects increased risk of domestic violence child sexual abuse pregnancy and birth complications and social isolation Early and forced marriage are defined as forms of modern day slavery by the International Labour Organization In some cases a woman or girl who has been raped may be forced to marry her rapist to restore the honor of her family marriage by abduction a practice in which a man abducts the woman or girl whom he wishes to marry and rapes her to force the marriage is common in Ethiopia br br Conscription or compulsory military service has been criticized as sexist During the Modern era prior to the late th century mostly men were subjected to conscription br although there were several instances of conscription of women in Antiquity and the Middle Ages Today most countries still require only men to serve in the military br In his book The Second Sexism Discrimination Against Men and Boys philosopher David Benatar states that t he prevailing assumption is that where conscription is necessary it is only men who should be conscripted and similarly that only males should be forced into combat This he believes is a sexist assumption Anthropologist Ayse G l Altinay has commented that given equal suffrage rights there is no other citizenship practice that differentiates as radically between men and women as compulsory male conscription br Only nine countries conscript women into their armed forces China Eritrea Israel Libya Malaysia North Korea Norway Peru and Taiwan Other countries such as Finland Turkey and Singapore still use a system of conscription which requires military service from men only although women may serve voluntarily In Norway became the first NATO country to introduce obligatory military service for women as an act of gender equality and in the Dutch government started preparing a gender neutral draft law The gender selective draft has been challenged in the United States br Conditions in the military have been described as sexually abusive and the sexual persecution of women Relentless sexist ridicule hostility and sexual harassment has been frequently reported Women in the military are more likely to be raped by a male fellow soldier than killed by the enemy Prosecution of the reported crimes fails to move forward as the Pentagon claimed it would undermine the leadership of the commanders br br Although the exact rates are widely disputed there is a large body of cross cultural evidence that domestic violence is mostly committed by men against women In addition there is a broad consensus that women are more often subjected to severe forms of abuse and are more likely to be injured by an abusive partner The United Nations recognizes domestic violence as a form of gender based violence which it describes as a human rights violation and the result of sexism br Domestic violence is tolerated and even legally accepted in many parts of the world For instance in the United Arab Emirates UAE s Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to discipline his wife and children physically if he does not leave visible marks In Equality Now drew attention to a section of the Penal Code of Northern Nigeria titled Correction of Child Pupil Servant or Wife which reads Nothing is an offence which does not amount to the infliction of grievous hurt upon any persons which is done d by a husband for the purpose of correcting his wife such husband and wife being subject to any native law or custom in which such correction is recognized as lawful br Honor killings are another form of domestic violence practiced in several parts of the world and their victims are predominantly women Honor killings can occur because of refusal to enter into an arranged marriage maintaining a relationship relatives disapprove of extramarital sex becoming the victim of rape dress seen as inappropriate or homosexuality The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime states that h onour crimes including killing are one of history s oldest forms of gender based violence br According to a report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights concerning cultural practices in the family that reflect violence against women br br The Special Rapporteur indicated that there had been contradictory decisions with regard to the honor defense in Brazil and that legislative provisions allowing for partial or complete defense in that context could be found in the penal codes of Argentina Ecuador Egypt Guatemala Iran Israel Jordan Peru Syria Venezuela and the Palestinian National Authority br Practices such as honor killings and stoning continue to be supported by mainstream politicians and other officials in some countries In Pakistan after the Balochistan honor killings in which five women were killed by tribesmen of the Umrani Tribe of Balochistan Pakistani federal minister for Postal Services Israr Ullah Zehri defended the practice These are centuries old traditions and I will continue to defend them Only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid Following the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani which has placed Iran under international pressure for its stoning sentences Mohammad Javad Larijani a senior envoy and chief of Iran s Human Rights Council defended the practice of stoning he claimed it was a lesser punishment than execution because it allowed those convicted a chance at survival br Dowry deaths result from the killing of women who are unable to pay the high dowry price for their marriage According to Amnesty International the ongoing reality of dowry related violence is an example of what can happen when women are treated as property br br Women have traditionally had limited access to higher education In the past when women were admitted to higher education they were encouraged to major in less scientific subjects the study of English literature in American and British colleges and universities was instituted as a field considered suitable to women s lesser intellects br Educational specialties in higher education produce and perpetuate inequality between men and women Disparity persists particularly in computer and information science where in the US women received only of the undergraduate degrees and in engineering where women obtained only of the degrees in Only one out of five of physics doctorates in the US are awarded to women and only about half those women are American Of all the physics professors in the country only are women As of women account for just of all workers in STEM fields and on average earn almost less than men in the same industries br World literacy is lower for females than for males Data from The World Factbook shows that of women are literate compared to of men aged and over In some parts of the world girls continue to be excluded from proper public or private education In parts of Afghanistan girls who go to school face serious violence from some local community members and religious groups According to UN estimates only Afghanistan Pakistan and Yemen had less than girls per boys at school Jayachandran and Lleras Muney s study of Sri Lankan economic development has suggested that increases in the life expectancy for women encourages educational investment because a longer time horizon increases the value of investments that pay out over time br Educational opportunities and outcomes for women have greatly improved in the West Since the proportion of women enrolled in college in the United States has exceeded the enrollment rate for men and the gap has widened over time As of women made up the majority of the million college students enrolled in the United States However research by Diane Halpern has indicated that boys receive more attention praise blame and punishment in the grammar school classroom and this pattern of more active teacher attention directed at male students continues at the postsecondary level Over time female students speak less in a classroom setting Teachers also tend to spend more time supporting the academic achievements of girls br Boys are frequently diagnosed with ADHD which some see as a result of school systems being more likely to apply these labels to males A recent study by the OECD in over countries found that teachers give boys lower grades for the same work The researchers attribute this to stereotypical ideas about boys and recommend teachers to be aware of this gender bias One study found that students give female professors worse evaluation scores than male professors even though the students appear to do as well under female professors as male professors br Gender bias and gender based discrimination still permeate the education process in many settings For example in the teaching and learning process including differential engagement expectations and interactions by teachers with their male and female students as well as gender stereotypes in textbooks and learning materials There has been a lack in adequate resources and infrastructure to ensure safe and enabling learning environments and insufficient policy legal and planning frameworks that respect protect and fulfil the right to education br br Feminists argue that clothing and footwear fashion have been oppressive to women restricting their movements increasing their vulnerability and endangering their health Using thin models in the fashion industry has encouraged the development of bulimia and anorexia nervosa as well as locking female consumers into false feminine identities br The assignment of gender specific baby clothes can instill in children a belief in negative gender stereotypes One example is the assignment in some countries of the color pink to girls and blue to boys The fashion is recent one At the beginning of the th century the trend was the opposite blue for girls and pink for boys In the early s The Women s Journal wrote that pink being a more decided and stronger colour is more suitable for the boy while blue which is more delicate and dainty is prettier for the girl DressMaker magazine also explained that t he preferred colour to dress young boys in is pink Blue is reserved for girls as it is considered paler and the more dainty of the two colours and pink is thought to be stronger akin to red Today in many countries it is considered inappropriate for boys to wear dresses and skirts but this is also a relatively recent view From the mid th century until the late th or early th century young boys in the Western world were unbreeched and wore gowns or dresses until an age that varied between two and eight br Laws that dictate how women must dress are seen by many international human rights organizations such as Amnesty International as gender discrimination In many countries women face violence for failing to adhere to certain dress codes whether by the authorities such as the religious police family members or the community Amnesty International states br br Interpretations of religion culture or tradition cannot justify imposing rules about dress on those who choose to dress differently States should take measures to protect individuals from being coerced to dress in specific ways by family members community or religious groups or leaders br The production process also faces criticism for sexist practices In the garment industry approximately percent of workers are female Much garment production is located in Asia because of low labor costs Women who work in these factories are sexually harassed by managers and male workers paid low wages and discriminated against when pregnant br br Female genital mutilation is defined by the World Health Organization WHO as all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non medical reasons The WHO further states The practice has no health benefits for girls and women and can cause severe bleeding and problems urinating and later cysts infections as well as complications in childbirth and increased risk of newborn deaths It is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women The European Parliament stated in a resolution that the practice clearly goes against the European founding value of equality between women and men and maintains traditional values according to which women are seen as the objects and properties of men br br Female infanticide is the killing of newborn female children while female selective abortion is the terminating of a pregnancy based upon the female sex of the fetus Gendercide is the systematic killing of members of a specific gender and it is an extreme form of gender based violence Female infanticide is more common than male infanticide and is especially prevalent in South Asia in countries such as China India and Pakistan Recent studies suggest that over million women and girls are missing in China and India as a result of infanticide br Sex selective abortion involves terminating a pregnancy based upon the predicted sex of the baby The abortion of female fetuses is most common in areas where a culture values male children over females such as parts of East Asia and South Asia China India Korea the Caucasus Azerbaijan Armenia and Georgia and Western Balkans Albania Macedonia Montenegro Kosovo One reason for this preference is that males are seen as generating more income than females The trend has grown steadily over the previous decade and may result in a future shortage of women br Forced sterilization and forced abortion are also forms of gender based violence Forced sterilization was practiced during the first half of the th century by many Western countries and there are reports of this practice being currently employed in some countries such as Uzbekistan and China br In China the one child policy interacting with the low status of women has been deemed responsible for many abuses such as female infanticide sex selective abortion abandonment of baby girls forced abortion and forced sterilization br In India the custom of dowry is strongly related to female infanticide sex selective abortion abandonment and mistreatment of girls Such practices are especially present in the northwestern part of the country Jammu and Kashmir Haryana Punjab Uttarakhand and Delhi See Female foeticide in India and Female infanticide in India br br In several Organisation of Islamic Cooperation OIC countries the legal testimony of a woman is worth legally half of that of a man see Status of women s testimony in Islam Such countries include Algeria in criminal cases Bahrain in Sharia courts Egypt in family courts Iran in most cases Iraq in some cases Jordan in Sharia courts Kuwait in family courts Libya in some cases Morocco in family cases Palestine in cases related to marriage divorce and child custody Qatar in family law matters Syria in Sharia courts United Arab Emirates in some civil matters Yemen not allowed to testify at all in cases of adultery and retribution and Saudi Arabia Such laws have been criticized by Human Rights Watch and Equality Now as being discriminatory towards women br The criminal justice system in many common law countries has also been accused of discriminating against women Provocation is in many common law countries a partial defense to murder which converts what would have been murder into manslaughter It is meant to be applied when a person kills in the heat of passion upon being provoked by the behavior of the victim This defense has been criticized as being gendered favoring men because of it being used disproportionately in cases of adultery and other domestic disputes when women are killed by their partners As a result of the defense exhibiting a strong gender bias and being a form of legitimization of male violence against women and minimization of the harm caused by violence against women it has been abolished or restricted in several jurisdictions br The traditional leniency towards crimes of passion in Latin American countries has been deemed to have its origin in the view that women are property In Widney Brown advocacy director for Human Rights Watch stated that S o called crimes of passion have a similar dynamic to honor killings in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights OHCHR has called for the elimination of discriminatory provisions in the legislation including mitigating factors for crimes of passion br In the United States some studies have shown that for identical crimes men are given harsher sentences than women Controlling for arrest offense criminal history and other pre charge variables sentences are over heavier for men Women are more likely to avoid charges entirely and to avoid imprisonment if convicted The gender disparity varies according to the nature of the case For example the gender gap is less pronounced in fraud cases than in drug trafficking and firearms This disparity occurs in US federal courts despite guidelines designed to avoid differential sentencing The death penalty may also suffer from gender bias According to Shatz and Shatz t he present study confirms what earlier studies have shown that the death penalty is imposed on women relatively infrequently and that it is disproportionately imposed for the killing of women br There have been several reasons postulated for the gender criminal justice disparity in the United States One of the most common is the expectation that women are predominantly care givers Other possible reasons include the girlfriend theory whereby women are seen as tools of their boyfriends the theory that female defendants are more likely to cooperate with authorities and that women are often successful at turning their violent crime into victimhood by citing defenses such as postpartum depression or battered wife syndrome However none of these theories account for the total disparity and sexism has also been suggested as an underlying cause br Gender discrimination also helps explain the differences between trial outcomes in which some female defendants are sentenced to death and other female defendants are sentenced to lesser punishments Phillip Barron argues that female defendants are more likely to be sentenced to death for crimes that violate gender norms such as killing children or killing strangers br Transgender people face widespread discrimination while incarcerated They are generally housed according to their legal birth sex rather than their gender identity Studies have shown that transgender people are at an increased risk for harassment and sexual assault in this environment They may also be denied access to medical procedures related to their reassignment br Some countries use stoning as a form of capital punishment According to Amnesty International the majority of those stoned are women and women are disproportionately affected by stoning because of sexism in the legal system br br One study found that O n average women receive lighter sentences in comparison with men roughly of the gender differences in incarceration cannot be explained by the observed criminal characteristics of offense and offender We also find evidence of considerable heterogeneity across judges in their treatment of female and male offenders There is little evidence however that tastes for gender discrimination are driving the mean gender disparity or the variance in treatment between judges br A study by Knepper found that female plaintiffs filing workplace sex discrimination claims are substantially more likely to settle and win compensation whenever a female judge is assigned to the case Additionally female judges are percentage points less likely than male judges to grant motions filed by defendants which suggests that final negotiations are shaped by the emergence of the bias br br The United Nations Population Fund writes that Family planning is central to gender equality and women s empowerment Women in many countries around the world are denied medical and informational services related to reproductive health including access to pregnancy care family planning and contraception In countries with very strict abortion laws particularly in Latin America women who suffer miscarriages are often investigated by the police under suspicion of having deliberately provoked the miscarriage and are sometimes jailed a practice which Amnesty International called a ruthless campaign against women s rights Doctors may be reluctant to treat pregnant women who are very ill because they are afraid the treatment may result in fetal loss According to Amnesty International Discriminatory attitudes towards women and girls also means access to sex education and contraceptives are near impossible in El Salvador The organization has also criticized laws and policies which require the husband s consent for a woman to use reproductive health services as being discriminatory and dangerous to women s health and life F or the woman who needs her husband s consent to get contraception the consequences of discrimination can be serious even fatal br br Research by Lisak and Roth into factors motivating perpetrators of sexual assault including rape against women revealed a pattern of hatred towards women and pleasure in inflicting psychological and physical trauma rather than sexual interest Mary Odem and Peggy Reeves Sanday posit that rape is the result not of pathology but of systems of male dominance cultural practices and beliefs br Odem Jody Clay Warner and Susan Brownmiller argue that sexist attitudes are propagated by a series of myths about rape and rapists They state that in contrast to those myths rapists often plan a rape before they choose a victim and acquaintance rape not assault by a stranger is the most common form of rape xiv Odem also asserts that these rape myths propagate sexist attitudes about men by perpetuating the belief that men cannot control their sexuality br Sexism can promote the stigmatization of women and girls who have been raped and inhibit recovery In many parts of the world women who have been raped are ostracized rejected by their families subjected to violence and in extreme cases may become victims of honor killings because they are deemed to have brought shame upon their families br The criminalization of marital rape is very recent having occurred during the past few decades in many countries it is still legal Several countries in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia made spousal rape illegal before other European countries and some English speaking countries outside Europe outlawed it later mostly in the s and s some countries outlawed it in the s The WHO wrote that Marriage is often used to legitimize a range of forms of sexual violence against women The custom of marrying off young children particularly girls is found in many parts of the world This practice legal in many countries is a form of sexual violence since the children involved are unable to give or withhold their consent br In countries where fornication or adultery are illegal victims of rape can be charged criminally br br Sexism is manifested by the crime of rape targeting women civilians and soldiers committed by soldiers combatants or civilians during armed conflict war or military occupation This arises from the long tradition of women being seen as sexual booty and from the misogynistic culture of military training br br This article incorporates text from a free content work Licensed under CC BY SA IGO Text taken from From access to empowerment UNESCO strategy for
