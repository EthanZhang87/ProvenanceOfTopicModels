Fable is a literary genre defined as a succinct fictional story in prose or verse that features animals legendary creatures plants inanimate objects or forces of nature that are anthropomorphized and that illustrates or leads to a particular moral lesson a moral which may at the end be added explicitly as a concise maxim or saying br A fable differs from a parable in that the latter excludes animals plants inanimate objects and forces of nature as actors that assume speech or other powers of humankind Conversely an animal tale specifically includes talking animals as characters br Usage has not always been so clearly distinguished In the King James Version of the New Testament mythos was rendered by the translators as fable in the First Epistle to Timothy the Second Epistle to Timothy the Epistle to Titus and the First Epistle of Peter br A person who writes fables is referred to as a fabulist br br br History br The fable is one of the most enduring forms of folk literature spread abroad modern researchers agree less by literary anthologies than by oral transmission Fables can be found in the literature of almost every country br br br Aesopic or Aesop s fable br The varying corpus denoted Aesopica or Aesop s Fables includes most of the best known western fables which are attributed to the legendary Aesop supposed to have been a slave in ancient Greece around BCE When Babrius set down fables from the Aesopica in verse for a Hellenistic Prince Alexander he expressly stated at the head of Book II that this type of myth that Aesop had introduced to the sons of the Hellenes had been an invention of Syrians from the time of Ninos personifying Nineveh to Greeks and Belos ruler Epicharmus of Kos and Phormis are reported as having been among the first to invent comic fables Many familiar fables of Aesop include The Crow and the Pitcher The Tortoise and the Hare and The Lion and the Mouse br In the first century AD Phaedrus died AD produced Latin translations in iambic verse of fables then circulating under the name of Aesop In ancient Greek and Roman education the fable was the first of the progymnasmata training exercises in prose composition and public speaking wherein students would be asked to learn fables expand upon them invent their own and finally use them as persuasive examples in longer forensic or deliberative speeches The need of instructors to teach and students to learn a wide range of fables as material for their declamations resulted in their being gathered together in collections like those of Aesop While Phaedrus s Latinizations became classic transmitted through the Middle Ages though attributed to a certain Romulus now considered legendary the writing of fables in Greek did not stop in the nd century AD Babrius wrote beast fables in Greek in the manner of Aesop which would also become influential in the Middle Ages and sometimes transmitted as Aesop s work br br br Africa br African oral culture has a rich story telling tradition As they have for thousands of years people of all ages in Africa continue to interact with nature including plants animals and earthly structures such as rivers plains and mountains Children and to some extent adults are mesmerized by good story tellers when they become animated in their quest to tell a good fable br The Anansi oral story originates from the tribes of Ghana All Stories Are Anansi s was translated by Harold Courlander and Albert Kofi Prempeh and tells the story of a god like creature Anansi who wishes to own all stories in the world The character Anansi is often depicted as a spider and is known for its cunning nature to obtain what it wants typically seen outwitting other animal characters br Joel Chandler Harris wrote African American fables in the Southern context of slavery under the name of Uncle Remus His stories of the animal characters Brer Rabbit Brer Fox and Brer Bear are modern examples of African American story telling this though should not transcend critiques and controversies as to whether or not Uncle Remus was a racist or apologist for slavery The Disney movie Song of the South introduced many of the stories to the public and others not familiar with the role that storytelling played in the life of cultures and groups without training in speaking reading writing or the cultures to which they had been relocated to from world practices of capturing Africans and other indigenous populations to provide slave labor to colonized countries br br br India br India has a rich tradition of fables many derived from traditional stories and related to local natural elements Indian fables often teach a particular moral In some stories the gods have animal aspects while in others the characters are archetypal talking animals similar to those found in other cultures Hundreds of fables were composed in ancient India during the first millennium BCE often as stories within frame stories Indian fables have a mixed cast of humans and animals The dialogues are often longer than in fables of Aesop and often comical as the animals try to outwit one another by trickery and deceit In Indian fables humanity is not presented as superior to the animals Prime examples of the fable in India are the Panchatantra and the Jataka tales These included Vishnu Sarma s Panchatantra the Hitopadesha Vikram and The Vampire and Syntipas Seven Wise Masters which were collections of fables that were later influential throughout the Old World Ben E Perry compiler of the Perry Index of Aesop s fables has argued controversially that some of the Buddhist Jataka tales and some of the fables in the Panchatantra may have been influenced by similar Greek and Near Eastern ones Earlier Indian epics such as Vyasa s Mahabharata and Valmiki s Ramayana also contained fables within the main story often as side stories or back story The most famous folk stories from the Near East were the One Thousand and One Nights also known as the Arabian Nights br The Panchatantra is an ancient Indian assortment of fables The earliest recorded work ascribed to Vishnu Sharma dates to around BCE The tales are likely much older than the compilation having been passed down orally prior to the book s compilation The word Panchatantra is a blend of the words pancha which means five in Sanskrit and tantra which means weave It implies weaving together multiple threads of narrative and moral lessons together to form a book br br br Europe br br Fables had a further long tradition through the Middle Ages and became part of European high literature The Roman writer Avianus active around AD wrote Latin fables mostly based on Babrius using very little material from Aesop Fables attributed to Aesop circulated widely in collections bearing the title of Romulus as though an author named Romulus had translated and rewritten them though today most scholars regard this Romulus to be a legendary figure Many of these Latin version were in fact Phaedrus s st century versified Latinizations Collections titled Romulus inspired a flurry of medieval authors to newly translate sometimes into local vernaculars versify and rewrite fables Among them Ad mar de Chabannes th century Alexander Neckam th century Novus Aesopus and shorter Novus Avianus Gualterus Anglicus th century and Marie de France th th century wrote fables adapted from models generally understood to be Aesop Avianus or the so called Romulus br In the later Middle Ages Aesop s fables were newly gathered and edited with a prefatory biography of Aesop This biography usually simply titled Life of Aesop Vita Aesopi is more invented than factual and itself a sort of moralistic fable known in several versions this Aesop Romance as scholars term it today enjoyed nearly as much fame as the fables themselves by the end of the fifteenth century The most common version of this tale like biography is attributed to the Byzantine scholar Maximus Planudes who also gathered and edited fables for posterity In the Renaissance Aesopic fables were hugely popular They were published in luxurious illuminated manuscripts such as the so called Medici Aesop made around in Florence based on the corpus established by Planudes probably for the son of Lorenzo de Medici now kept in the New York Public Library Early on Aesopic fables were also disseminated in print usually with Planudes s Life of Aesop as a preface The German humanist Heinrich Steinh wel published a bilingual Latin and German edition of the fables in Ulm in This publication gave rise to many re editions of the sole German prose translation known as the Esopus or Esopus teutsch It became one the great bestsellers of the last decades of the fifteenth century Several authors adapted or versified fables from this corpus such as the German poet and playwright Burkard Waldis whose versified Esopus of was influential Even the artist and polymath Leonardo da Vinci composed some fables in his native Florentine dialect br During the th century the French fabulist Jean de La Fontaine saw the soul of the fable in the moral a rule of behavior Starting with the Aesopian pattern La Fontaine set out to satirize the court the church the rising bourgeoisie indeed the entire human scene of his time La Fontaine s model was subsequently emulated by England s John Gay Poland s Ignacy Krasicki Italy s Lorenzo Pignotti and Giovanni Gherardo de Rossi Serbia s Dositej Obradovi Spain s Tom s de Iriarte y Oropesa France s Jean Pierre Claris de Florian and Russia s Ivan Krylov br br br Modern era br In modern times while the fable has been trivialized in children s books it has also been fully adapted to modern adult literature Felix Salten s Bambi is a Bildungsroman a story of a protagonist s coming of age cast in the form of a fable James Thurber used the ancient fable style in his books Fables for Our Time and Further Fables for Our Time and in his stories The Princess and the Tin Box in The Beast in Me and Other Animals and The Last Clock A Fable for the Time Such As It Is of Man in Lanterns and Lances W adys aw Reymont s The Revolt a metaphor for the Bolshevik Revolution of described a revolt by animals that take over their farm in order to introduce equality George Orwell s Animal Farm similarly satirized Stalinist Communism in particular and totalitarianism in general in the guise of animal fable br In the st century the Neapolitan writer Sabatino Scia is the author of more than two hundred fables that he describes as western protest fables The characters are not only animals but also things beings and elements from nature Scia s aim is the same as in the traditional fable playing the role of revealer of human society In Latin America the brothers Juan and Victor Ataucuri Garcia have contributed to the resurgence of the fable But they do so with a novel idea use the fable as a means of dissemination of traditional literature of that place In the book F bulas Peruanas published in they have collected myths legends and beliefs of Andean and Amazonian Peru to write as fables The result has been an extraordinary work rich in regional nuances br br br Fabulists br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br
