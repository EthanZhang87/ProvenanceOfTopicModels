and casting br According to Lewis scholar Paul F Ford Lewis decided to not name Ramandu s daughter as an indication of the awe in which he wanted to surround her Fantasy writer Colin Duriez said that Lewis was inspired by J R R Tolkien s Middle Earth elves specifically L thien and Arwen who are both married to humans to create the character Duriez also connected Ramandu s daughter s parentage from the heavens to Tolkien s descriptions of angelic entities known as Maiar in his novels br For the television serial English actress Gabrielle Anwar portrays Ramandu s daughter in one of her earliest roles she is credited as Princess Australian actress Laura Brent plays the character in the film version of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader it was her first role in a feature film Lewis step son Douglas Gresham created the name Lilliandil for the movie and he said that it was intended to mimic the imagery of the sea of lilies in the book as well as a very feminine and ethereal feel br br br Character analysis br According to academics Lewis characterizes Ramandu s daughter through her goodness Elizabeth Baird Hardy a scholar of mythology cited the character as one of the few positive individuals who first appears as a full grown adult Fantasy literature scholar Monika B Hilder interpreted Ramandu s daughter and Caspian X as wise rulers willing to suffer for what is right for as long as they both shall live English literature professor Devin Brown wrote that the character s respect for Aslan defines her goodness in comparison to the evilness of the White Witch and her anger toward the lion br Analyzing Ramandu s daughter as a saintly mother author Cathy McSporran contrasted her with the Lady of the Green Kirtle She identified the latter and all witches in The Chronicles of Narnia series as embodying what Lewis characterizes as an infernal Venus he coined this term in his book The Screwtape Letters to reference a female character who seduces a man to his death McSporran defined Ramandu s daughter as the natural opponent of witches due to her innate goodness and beauty According to McSporran the character s maternal care for Rilian and ability to see through magical disguises are signs of her opposition to the Lady of the Green Kirtle br Critics commented on the relationship between Ramandu s daughter and Caspian X The pair s relationship is one of the few romantic story arcs in The Chronicles of Narnia series Devin Brown positively compared their courtship to that of Arwen and Aragorn from J R R Tolkien s novel The Lord of the Rings Brown also wrote that Lewis foreshadows to the relationship through Caspian X s failed courtship with the Duke of Galma prior to The Voyage of the Dawn Treader While Lewis scholar Michael Ward cited the couple as an example of how the author was not averse to his characters growing up and having romances children s literature scholar Jennifer L Miller felt that Lewis does not elaborate on their marriage in the novels Miller wrote that the characters interactions as husband and wife were restricted to the space between The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Silver Chair only occurring in a place separate from Narnia She argued that the portrayal of the pair s relationship represented how romantic love and desire can exist in exotic strange locations far from Narnia while Lewis reserved the fictional world as the land of innocence and wonder where such ideas would be inadmissible br br br Religious analysis br Some critics argued that Lewis portrays Ramandu s daughter through Christian virtues Connecting Ramandu s daughter with the women in the House of Holiness from Edmund Spenser s epic poem The Faerie Queene Elizabeth Baird Hardy interpreted her titles as idealized identifications of the virtues they represent with Lewis character corresponding to charity and hope Monika B Hilder argued that it is Ramandu s daughter s beauty that is used to signal her virtue specifically through her positive effect on Caspian X While describing the character s identity and agency Hilder referred to her as a mature virtuous woman who is neither enchanted nor requires marriage to be whole Hilder wrote that Ramandu s daughter has an active moral agency which underscores powerful humility as well as feminine obedience and spirituality br Ramandu s daughter was compared to women in the Bible Hardy wrote that Ramandu s daughter was similar to Eve before the fall of man describing them as free from pretension and keenly aware of their roles in the universe Hardy paralleled the death of Ramandu s daughter with the fall of Eve comparing Rilian s addiction to sorcery and sexuality to the original sin Aside from Eve Ramandu s daughter was also likened to the Grail Maiden Cathy McSporran likened the character s possession of the Knife of Stone an instrument used to martyr Aslan to the maiden s connection with the Holy Grail and the spear used in the crucifixion of Jesus br br br Notes
