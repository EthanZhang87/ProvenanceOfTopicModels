title: Gremlin
id: 263158
A gremlin is a mischievous folkloric creature invented at the beginning of the th century to originally explain malfunctions in aircraft and later in other machinery processes and their operators Depictions of these creatures vary widely Stories about them and references to them as the causes of especially inexplicable technical and mental problems of pilots were especially popular during and after World War II br Use of the term in the sense of a mischievous creature that sabotages aircraft first arose in Royal Air Force RAF slang among British pilots stationed in Malta the Middle East and India in the s with the earliest printed record in a poem published in the journal Aeroplane in Malta on April Later sources have sometimes claimed that the concept goes back to World War I but there is no print evidence of this br There is evidence of earlier RAF reference in the s to a lowly menial person in other words a low ranking officer or enlisted man saddled with oppressive assignments br br br Aviation origins br br Although their origin is found in myths among airmen claiming that gremlins were responsible for sabotaging aircraft the folklorist John W Hazen states that some people derive the name from the Old English word gremian to vex while Carol Rose in her book Spirits Fairies Leprechauns and Goblins An Encyclopedia attributes the name to a portmanteau of Grimm s Fairy Tales and Fremlin Beer According to Paul Quinion it is plausible that the term is a blend of the word goblin with the name of the manufacturer of the most common beer available in the RAF in the s Fremlin br An early reference to the gremlin is in aviator Pauline Gower s novel The ATA Women with Wings where Scotland is described as gremlin country a mystical and rugged territory where scissor wielding gremlins cut the wires of biplanes when unsuspecting pilots were about An article by Hubert Griffith in the servicemen s fortnightly Royal Air Force Journal dated April also chronicles the appearance of gremlins although the article states the stories had been in existence for several years with later recollections of it having been told by Battle of Britain Spitfire pilots as early as br br This concept of gremlins was popularized during World War II among airmen of the Royal Air Force RAF units in particular the men of the high altitude Photographic Reconnaissance Units PRU of RAF Benson RAF Wick and RAF St Eval The flight crews blamed gremlins for otherwise inexplicable accidents which sometimes occurred during their flights Gremlins were also thought at one point to have enemy sympathies but investigations revealed that enemy aircraft had similar and equally inexplicable mechanical problems As such gremlins were portrayed as equal opportunity tricksters taking no sides in the conflict but acting out their mischief from their own self interest In reality the gremlins were a form of buck passing or deflecting blame This led John Hazen to note that the gremlin has been looked on as new phenomenon a product of the machine age the age of air The concept of gremlins as a scapegoat was important to the morale of pilots according to the author and historian Marlin Bressi Gremlins while imaginary played a very important role to the airmen of the Royal Air Force Gremlin tales helped build morale among pilots which in turn helped them repel the Luftwaffe invasion during the Battle of Britain during the summer of The war may have had a very different outcome if the R A F pilots had lost their morale and allowed Germany s plans for Operation Sea Lion the planned invasion of the U K to develop In a way it could be argued that gremlins troublesome as they were ultimately helped the Allies win the war Bressi also noted Morale among the R A F pilots would have suffered if they pointed the finger of blame at each other It was far better to make the scapegoat a fantastic and comical creature than another member of your own squadron Examples of Gremlins can be seen in the IBCC Digital Archive br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Popularization by Roald Dahl br br British author Roald Dahl is credited with getting the gremlins known outside the Royal Air Force He would have been familiar with the myth having carried out his military service in Squadron of the Royal Air Force in the Middle East Dahl had his own experience in an accidental crash landing in the Western Desert when he ran out of fuel In January he was transferred to Washington D C as Assistant Air attach at the British Embassy It was there that he wrote his first children s novel The Gremlins in which Gremlins were tiny men who lived on RAF fighters In the same novel Dahl called the wives of gremlins Fifinellas their male children Widgets and their female children Flibbertigibbets Dahl showed the finished manuscript to Sidney Bernstein the head of the British Information Service who came up with the idea to send it to Walt Disney br The manuscript arrived in Disney s hands in July and he considered using it as material for a live action animated full length feature film offering Dahl a contract The film project was changed to an animated feature and entered pre production with characters roughed out and storyboards created Disney managed to have the story published in the December issue of Cosmopolitan magazine At Dahl s urging in early a revised version of the story again titled The Gremlins was published as a picture book by Random House It was later updated and re published in by Dark Horse Comics br The publication of The Gremlins by Random House consisted of copies with Dahl ordering copies for himself as promotional material for himself and the upcoming film handing them out to everyone he knew including the British ambassador in Washington Lord Halifax and the US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt who read it to her grandchildren The book was considered an international success with more sold in Australia but initial efforts to reprint the book were precluded by a wartime paper shortage Reviewed in major publications Dahl was considered a writer of note and his appearances in Hollywood to follow up with the film project were met with notices in Hedda Hopper s columns br The film project was reduced to an animated short and eventually cancelled in August when copyright and RAF rights could not be resolved But thanks mainly to Disney the story had its share of publicity which helped in introducing the concept to a wider audience Issues of Walt Disney s Comics and Stories published between June and February contained a nine episode series of short silent stories featuring a Gremlin Gus as their star The first was drawn by Vivie Risto and the rest of them by Walt Kelly This served as their introduction to the comic book audience as they are human gremlins who lived in their own village as little flying human people br While Roald Dahl was famous for making gremlins known worldwide many returning Air Servicemen swear they saw creatures tinkering with their equipment One crewman swore he saw one before an engine malfunction that caused his B Mitchell bomber to rapidly lose altitude forcing the aircraft to return to base Folklorist Hazen likewise offers his own alleged eyewitness testimony of these creatures which appeared in an academically praised and peer reviewed publication describing an occasion he found a parted cable which bore obvious tooth marks in spite of the fact that the break occurred in a most inaccessible part of the plane At this point Hazen states he heard a gruff voice demand How many times must you be told to obey orders and not tackle jobs you aren t qualified for This is how it should be done Upon which Hazen heard a musical twang and another cable was parted br Critics of this idea state that the stress of combat and the dizzying heights caused such hallucinations often believed to be a coping mechanism of the mind to help explain the many problems aircraft faced while in combat br br br In media br br br Film br In Bob Clampett directed Falling Hare a Merrie Melodies cartoon featuring Bugs Bunny Inspired by Roald Dahl s book and Walt Disney s proposed film this short is one of the earliest films to include multiple gremlins though only one was consequential It features
