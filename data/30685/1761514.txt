id: 1761514
In mythology legend or fiction a magic sword is a sword with magical powers or other supernatural qualities Renowned swords appear in the folklore of every nation that used swords br In some traditions the sword is ascribed no powers of its own It is famous because it is the hero s sword or because of its origin as when a god gives it to the hero Other swords keep their wielders safe or destroy their enemies A more localized motif is the sword that has been broken and must be reforged commonly found in Northern Europe Such a sword symbolizes the initial defeat and loss of honor of its wielder Subsequent victory and the restoration of honor is achieved by reforging it either at the wielder s hand or that of his heir br br br History br It is probable that the roots of the sentient weapon myths stem from ancient peoples belief that sword making and metallurgy was in fact a magical process Through the fires of the forge fire was also given spiritual connotations a lump of earth was transformed into a shiny usable object that could be hammered into many shapes Extending further from the transformation of ore into metal the difficulty of actually obtaining a quality blade which took intense concentration and skill added to its esoteric qualities While any blacksmith could manufacture a knife or an axehead only a swordsmith could create a high quality sword The secrets of doing so were jealously guarded as well as formulas for alloys br The skill necessary to forge a balanced blade one which is not too brittle or too soft and able to hold a usefully sharp edge in the age before automated machines blast furnaces and the knowledge of molecular chemistry made the creation of a sword seem almost miraculous A few degrees too hot or too cold within a very limited temperature range which could only be discerned by the glowing hue of a hot billet could make or break a sword A lack of expertise in knowing when and how to apply carbon and flux and quench the blade could ruin weeks of work Thus the swordsmith almost felt like he was one with his work giving the process his complete devotion of concentration and thought This led to the belief that he was actually imbuing the blade with an essence of his spirit In Japan the swordsmiths were so concerned with this belief that they would undergo purification rituals and meditation before even attempting to start a new blade for fear that they might inadvertently create an evil sword br The Vikings prized their swords above all other things handing them down from generation to generation and giving them names The value of the blade was not only determined by its quality but also by how many battles that it was used in Polynesian people such as the M ori also had comparable reverence for their weapons They believed a weapon contained a spiritual force called mana and that the weapon held the spirits of its maker its line of owners and also stole the spirits of those it killed These weapons where highly prized for their mana and cherished as heirlooms The Samurai of Japan believed that their swords had their own soul that could possess them It was not the wielder but their swords that desired to kill Samurai were just the instrument that the sword used to complete that task Since most of them were Buddhists a religion that finds violence and murder abhorent that train of thought gave them some peace of mind in their killing vocation br Later as the concept of demons spiritual possession and elementals entered the realm of mythological themes it was only a natural leap to attribute magical properties of the swords of folklore to indwelling spirits br br Magic swords may exhibit various degrees of sentience from being merely influenced by the wielder to being able to think for itself or even control its owner br br br Biblical br The Bible relates in the Book of Genesis how God seeking to deter Adam and Eve from returning to the Garden of Eden placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way By some accounts the Cherubim are replaced with the Archangel Michael who wields a similar weapon br King David was

only sword In most variants this sword was then broken and he receives from The Lady of the Lake a new sword called Excalibur arguably the most famous of magic swords Caliburn was the original name of Excalibur In Welsh legend Arthur s sword is known as Caledfwlch br Geoffrey of Monmouth s History of the Kings of Britain is the first non Welsh source to speak of the sword Geoffrey says the sword was forged in Avalon and Latinises the name Caledfwlch as Caliburnus When his influential pseudo history made it to Continental Europe writers altered the name further until it finally took on the popular form Excalibur However in other variants Excalibur itself is the sword in the stone It is not clear from the various accounts of the Arthur legend whether Excalibur itself was possessed of magical powers or merely had a magical origin though its scabbard protected its bearer from physical harm Many interpretations of the legend appear to endow Excalibur with a cutting strength and durability beyond that of ordinary weapons br In Wolfram Von Echenbach s Parzival the eponymous hero is given a sword by the Grail king Anfortas Parzival s cousin explains that The sword will withstand the first blow unscathed at the second it will shatter If you then take it back to the spring it will become whole again from the flow of the water You must have the water at the source If the pieces are not lost and you fit them together properly as soon as the spring water wets them the sword will become whole again the joinings and edges stronger than before br br br Chinese br Ancient Chinese mythology relates the tale of L Dongbin who slew dragons with a magic sword and performed freak feats with it br br br Germanic br br In Norse mythology the god Frey possessed a magic sword that struck out at Jotuns of its own accord Many other swords appear in Norse legend in the hands of heroes br Tyrfing appears in the Hervarar Saga Svafrlami was the King of Gardariki and a grandson of the god Odin He caught the dwarves Dvalin and Durin and forced them to forge a sword with a golden hilt that would never miss a stroke would never rust and would cut through stone and iron
