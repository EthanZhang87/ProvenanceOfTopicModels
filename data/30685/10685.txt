Filk music is a musical culture genre and community tied to science fiction fantasy and horror fandom and a type of fan labor The genre has existed since the early s and been played primarily since the mid s The genre has a niche but faithful popularity in the underground br br br Etymology and definitions br The term filk originally a typographical error predates See also below br br Interfilk a charity registered in California to promote cultural exchange through filk music offered multiple sources of definitions without summary for filk music c c but since relies almost entirely on an article by Jordin Kare titled Filk Music originally published by Sing Out magazine for their definition Kare quotes Nick Smith of the Los Angeles Filkharmonics as stating It is a mixture of song parodies and original music humorous and serious about subjects like science fiction fantasy computers cats politics the space program books movies TV shows love war death and summarizes that almost anything goes at a filksing br Filk has been defined as what is sung or performed by the network of people who originally gathered to sing at science fiction or fantasy conventions br Another definition focuses on filking as a community of those who are interested in filk music and who form part of the social network self identified with filking As described later in this article the origins of filk in science fiction conventions and its current organization emphasizes the social network aspect of filking The social aspect of filk as contrasted with the performer vs audience dichotomy of much of modern music was described in a speech by ethnomusicologist Sally Childs Helton br br br Styles and subjects br The range of topics in filk songs stems from its cultural roots in fandom Many songs honor specific works in science fiction fantasy or speculative fiction Other songs are about science fantasy computers technology in general or values related to technological change br A significant number of filk songs are parodies whether in the original sense of simply re using a tune or in the modern sense of specifically humorous re use br One subtype of filk songs is the ose song one on themes of death and gloom The term derives from the word morose as in ose morose even more ose br br br History br In the early s the term filk music started as a misspelling of folk music in an essay by Lee Jacobs The Influence of Science Fiction on Modern American Filk Music Wrai Ballard then editor of the Spectator Amateur Press Society refused to publish it for fear that the article s bawdy content could get them into trouble with the Post Office under the Comstock Laws but found the typo itself amusing and mentioned it repeatedly thus Jacobs typo became the self identified term for the genre subculture while it was still an informal unrecognized activity at conventions Its first documented deliberate use was by Karen Anderson in Die Zeitschrift f r vollst ndigen Unsinn The Journal for Utter Nonsense No June for a song written by her husband Poul Anderson br At the World Science Fiction Convention author Bob Asprin announced publicly the creation of a group of volunteers he dubbed the Dorsai Irregulars and a singing session ensued later that night In the s and s filking slowly became established as an acknowledged activity at science fiction conventions Some convention organizers allotted hotel function space late at night for filkers or filking occurred in hallways bars or any other place that the filkers could find Some convention organizers in the s began inviting guests specifically for their filking Some specialized conventions focused entirely on filk beginning with FilkCon in Chicago in organized by Margaret Middleton and Curt Clemmer later joined by BayFilk in Northern California the Ohio Valley Filk Fest OVFF in Columbus Ohio ConChord in Los Angeles and in San Diego California GAFilk in Atlanta Georgia Musicon in Nashville Tennessee FilKONtario near Toronto Ontario a rotating British filkcon and one NEFilk in the northeastern US and the German FilkCONtinental br br br Filk circles br br br Physical layout br br As the name implies a rough circle of chairs is usually formed Traditionally filk circles are started in the evening and tend to continue very late into the night br br br Musical instruments br A wide range of instruments can be found in a filk circle although the most common is the acoustic guitar Acoustic instruments are more common than electric instruments although portable keyboards and even theremins are not unheard of br br br Types br br Filk circles are often given an organizational structure to make it easier for participants to know when it is time to perform or time to listen to other performers There are many ways to accomplish this but the most common types of filk circle are listed below br br br Bardic br The advantage of the bardic circle is that it has a clear structure which enforces politeness It ensures everyone in the circle gets their turn so that even shy people can have a chance to request or perform There are disadvantages however A bardic circle with large numbers of participants will take a long time to traverse the entire circle making people wait too long for their turn Such a circle was lamented in a filk by Suzette Haden Elgin I ve been here with my song at the ready since day before yesterday night br br br Chaos br In a chaos circle there is no sequential organization Any performer can simply begin playing a song after the prior song is finished or any participant can shout out a request Care must be taken to prevent two songs from starting at the same time Frequently the word follower is shouted in a chaos circle meaning that a performer believes they have the perfect song to follow the prior song and they want to play it now br The chaos circle s advantage is its spontaneity and energy Runs of songs will frequently get started with each new song intended to make some sort of connection to or commentary on the prior song s topic The disadvantage is that it takes concentration and effort to be polite and respectful in a chaos circle It is easy to accidentally interrupt another performer who s trying to start up a song of their own especially in a very large circle where one might not be able to easily hear the other performer on the opposite side of the room Chaos circles thus have a reputation of favoring bold loud performers who can command attention One countermeasure to such conflicts is for someone generally not one of the current starting up performers to shout Filker up possibly pointing to the one being interrupted This alerts the room and specifically the usually unintentional interrupter to be quiet and pay attention to the filker who has started performing br br br Token bardic br A token bardic circle also known as a poker chip bardic circle attempts to combine the enforced politeness of the bardic circle with the freeform nature of the chaos circle A container full of some type of token such as poker chips is supplied for the circle Each person participating in the circle is given a fixed number of tokens when they enter the room frequently two tokens and can throw a token into the center of the circle at any time to claim a pick or play turn When all the active tokens in the circle are used up they are scooped up and redistributed for the next round br br br Etiquette br The etiquette of the filk circle begins with a respect for all music including and perhaps especially amateur music and amateur performers Everyone is encouraged to perform regardless of their skill level No one is criticized except to occasionally give tips or suggestions br br br Cultural perspective br At a deep level the folk culture of filk validates creative arts in the midst of an explicitly technological culture When accepting induction into the Filk Hall of Fame in ethnomusicologist Sally Childs Helton said We have taken our right to be creative and to literally play in the best sense of that word Filk combines folk roots live music circles and dominant acoustical instrumentation on the one hand with high tech cultural maintenance on the other hand a dense network of filkers web pages recordings sound reinforcement at filk conventions e mail lists and so on The eclectic content of filk frequently contains that assertion of human creativity especially in connection with technology See for example Leslie Fish s Hope Eyrie While there are significant numbers of memorial songs pessimistic songs blame carelessness incompetence and corruption only rarely considering the frailties of a society built on technology or hopes for the future Because these themes cross international boundaries in filk they are not explainable as a purely American optimism vis a vis technology in contrast to Nye br That openness to participation is a marked norm in filking br Occasional discussions over the boundaries of filk indicates the extent to which participants in filking are both aware of and keenly interested in the definition of filk as a community Newsgroup debates over such topics as whether Weird Al Yankovic is a filker suggest the deep feelings involved In practice most formal recognition of filkers in various awards are to those who regularly attend self identified filk events not to professional artists whose work may be considered found filk br br br Pegasus Awards br The OVFF convention committee solicits nominations for finalists for the Pegasus Awards the nominating ballot during the late spring and summer There is an opinion poll that runs during the year as well to help interested folk brainstorm ideas for the nominating ballot The finalist ballot is distributed in the early fall and must be returned by the opening night of OVFF Voting can be done online either to nominate finalists or to vote for the finalists themselves The final round of voting happens at OVFF itself where handwritten ballots are collected after the annual Pegasus concert The entire process is administered by the OVFF convention committee br br br Filk Hall of Fame br The Filk Hall of Fame was created by David Hayman in as a complement to the Pegasus Awards br Anyone may make a nomination br br br See also br Banned from Argo
