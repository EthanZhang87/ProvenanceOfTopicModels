id: 76065
The Faerie Queene is an English epic poem by Edmund Spenser Books I III were first published in then republished in together with books IV VI The Faerie Queene is notable for its form at over lines and over stanzas it is one of the longest poems in the English language it is also the work in which Spenser invented the verse form known as the Spenserian stanza On a literal level the poem follows several knights as a means to examine different virtues and though the text is primarily an allegorical work it can be read on several levels of allegory including as praise or later criticism of Queen Elizabeth I In Spenser s Letter of the Authors he states that the entire epic poem is cloudily enwrapped in Allegorical devices and that the aim of publishing The Faerie Queene was to fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline br Spenser presented the first three books of The Faerie Queene to Elizabeth I in probably sponsored by Walter Raleigh The poem was a clear effort to gain court favour and as a reward Elizabeth granted Spenser a pension for life amounting to a year though there is no further evidence that Elizabeth ever read any of the poem This royal patronage elevated the poem to a level of success that made it Spenser s defining work br br br Summary br br Book I is centred on the virtue of Holiness as embodied in the Redcrosse Knight Largely self contained Book I can be understood to be its own miniature epic The Redcrosse Knight and his lady Una travel together as he fights the monster Errour then travel separately after the wizard Archimago tricks the Redcrosse Knight into thinking that Una is unchaste using a false dream After he leaves the Redcrosse Knight meets Duessa who feigns distress in order to entrap him Duessa leads

and Guyon leave to rescue Florimell while Britomart rescues the Redcrosse Knight Britomart reveals to the Redcrosse Knight that she is pursuing Sir Artegall because she is destined to marry him The Redcrosse Knight defends Artegall and they meet Merlin who explains more carefully Britomart s destiny to found the English monarchy Britomart leaves and fights Sir Marinell Arthur looks for Florimell

able to rescue Amoret from the wizard Busirane Unfortunately when they emerge from the castle Scudamore is gone The version with Books I III depicts the lovers happy reunion but this was changed in the version which contained all six books br Book IV is called The Legend of Cambell and Telamond or Of Friendship But despite its title Cambell s companion in Book IV is actually named Triamond and the plot does not center on their friendship the two men appear only briefly in the story The book is largely a continuation of events begun in Book III First Scudamore is convinced by the hag Ate discord that Britomart has run off with Amoret and becomes jealous A three day tournament is then held by Satyrane where Britomart beats Arthegal both in disguise Scudamore and Arthegal unite against Britomart but when her helmet comes off in battle Arthegal falls in love with her He surrenders removes his helmet and Britomart recognizes him as the man in the enchanted mirror Arthegal pledges his

Scudamore embark together on a search for her The reader discovers that Amoret was abducted by a savage man and is imprisoned in his cave One day Amoret darts out past the savage and is rescued from him by the squire Timias and Belphoebe Arthur then appears offering his service as a knight to the lost woman She accepts and after a couple of trials on the way Arthur and Amoret finally happen across Scudamore and Britomart The two lovers are reunited Wrapping up a different plotline from Book III the recently recovered Marinell discovers Florimell suffering in Proteus dungeon He returns home and becomes sick with love and pity Eventually he confesses his feelings to his mother and she pleads with Neptune to have the girl released which the god grants br Book V is centred on the virtue of Justice as embodied in Sir Artegall who defeats a demagogic giant and mediates several conflicts including a joust held in honor of Florimell s nuptials The knight then attempts to free several men from their indenture to the Amazon Radigund She defeats Artegall in battle by guile and according to the terms of their duel he a stickler for legal agreements must become her slave as well Britomart eventually rescues her betrothed and kills Radigund thereby restoring a just relationship of the sexes We are introduced to the court of Mercilla where Duessa is put on trial and found guilty Departing from Artegall Spenser presents Prince Arthur s quest to slay the beast Gerioneo in order to restore the lady Belge to her rights In the final canto Artegall aids Sir Burbon and slays the monstrous Grantorto br Book VI is centred on the virtue of Courtesy as embodied in Sir Calidore who is on a mission from the Faerie Queene to slay the Blatant Beast After helping reconcile two lovers and taking on the courteous young Tristram as his page he falls prey to the pleasant distractions of pastoral life and eventually wins the affections of Pastorella away from the ultimately agreeable but somewhat cowardly Coridon This book also features the knight Calepine and his quest for his lady Serena who is cared for by a strangely well mannered Savage who like the humble Pastorella turns out to be a long lost scion of nobility Arthur later takes on Serena and leaves her to the care of his page Timias and a Hermit who has been a knight Calidore rescues his love from the Blatant Beast capturing and binding the monster which nonetheless we are told eventually escapes to prowl about the world once more to seek the ruin of more reputations br Published with The Faerie Queene in the Folio of and generally agreed to have been part of Spenser s plan for Book VII are the Cantos of Mutability in which Jove s sway over the universe is challenged by Mutability the Titan goddess of change who takes her case to a court presided over by Nature who after spirited arguments on both sides rules against the Titaness and in favor of Jove br br br Major characters br br Acrasia seductress of knights Guyon destroys her Bower of Bliss at the end of Book Similar characters in other epics Circe Homer s Odyssey Alcina Ariosto Armida Tasso or the fairy woman from Keats poem La Belle Dame sans Merci br Amoret ta the betrothed of Scudamour kidnapped by Busirane on her wedding night saved by Britomart She represents the virtue of married love and her marriage to Scudamour serves as the example that Britomart and Artegall seek to copy Amoret and Scudamor are separated for a time by circumstances but remain loyal to each other until they presumably are reunited br Archimago an evil sorcerer who is sent to stop the knights in the service of the Faerie Queene Of the knights Archimago hates Redcrosse most of all hence he is symbolically the nemesis of England br Artegall also spelled Artegal Arthegal or Arthegall a knight who is the embodiment and champion of Justice He meets Britomart after defeating her in a sword fight she had been dressed as a knight and removing her helmet revealing her beauty Artegall quickly falls in love with Britomart Artegall has a companion in Talus a metal man who wields a flail and never sleeps or tires but will mercilessly pursue and kill any number of villains Talus obeys Artegall s command and serves to represent justice without mercy hence Artegall is the more human face of justice Later Talus does not rescue Artegall from enslavement by the wicked slave mistress Radigund because Artegall is bound by a legal contract to serve her Only her death at Britomart s hands liberates him Chrysaor was the golden sword of Sir Artegall This sword was also the favorite weapon of Demeter the Greek goddess of the harvest Because it was Tempred with Adamant it could cleave through anything br Arthur of the Round Table but playing a different role here He is madly in love with the Faerie Queene and spends his time in pursuit of her when not helping the other knights out of their sundry predicaments Prince Arthur is the Knight of Magnificence the perfection of all virtues br Ate a fiend from Hell disguised as a beautiful maiden Ate opposes Book IV s virtue of friendship through spreading discord She is aided in her task by Duessa the female deceiver of Book I whom Ate summoned from Hell Ate and Duessa have fooled the false knights Blandamour and Paridell into taking them as lovers Her name is possibly inspired by the Greek goddess of misfortune At said to have been thrown from Heaven by Zeus similar to the fallen angels br Belphoebe the beautiful sister of Amoret who spends her time in the woods hunting and avoiding the numerous amorous men who chase her Timias the squire of Arthur eventually wins her love after she tends to the injuries he sustained in battle however Timias must endure much suffering to prove his love when Belphoebe sees him tending to a wounded woman and misinterpreting his actions flies off hastily She is only drawn back to him after seeing how he has wasted away without her br br Britomart a female knight the embodiment and champion of Chastity She is young and beautiful and falls in love with Artegall upon first seeing his face in her father s magic mirror Though there is no interaction between them she travels to find him again dressed as a knight and accompanied by her nurse Glauce Britomart carries an enchanted spear that allows her to defeat every knight she encounters until she loses to a knight who turns out to be her beloved Artegall Parallel figure in Ariosto Bradamante Britomart is one of the most important knights in the story She searches the world including a pilgrimage to the shrine of Isis and a visit with Merlin the magician She rescues Artegall and several other knights from the evil slave mistress Radigund Furthermore Britomart accepts Amoret at a tournament refusing the false Florimell br Busirane the evil sorcerer who captures Amoret on her wedding night When Britomart enters his castle to defeat him she finds him holding Amoret captive She is bound to a pillar and Busirane is torturing her The clever Britomart handily defeats him and returns Amoret to her husband br Caelia the ruler of the House of

concord She marries Cambell after bringing an end to his fight with Triamond br Colin Clout a shepherd noted for his songs and bagpipe playing briefly appearing in Book VI He is the same Colin Clout as in Spenser s pastoral poetry which is fitting because Calidore is taking a sojourn into a world of pastoral delight ignoring his duty to hunt the Blatant Beast which is why he set out to Ireland to begin with Colin Clout may also be said to be Spenser himself br Cymochles a knight in Book II who is defined by indecision and fluctuations of the will He and his fiery brother Pyrochles represent emotional maladies that threaten temperance The two brothers are both slain by Prince Arthur in Canto VIII br Chrysogonee mother of Belphoebe and her twin Amoretta She hides in the forest and becoming

an assistant or at least a servant to Archimago br br Florimell a lady in love with the knight Marinell who initially rejects her Hearing that he has been wounded she sets out to find him and faces various perils culminating in her capture by the sea god Proteus She is reunited with Marinell at the end of Book IV and is married to him in Book V br Guyon the Knight of Temperance the hero of Book II He is the leader of the Knights of Maidenhead and carries the image of Gloriana on his shield According to the Golden Legend St George s name shares etymology with Guyon which specifically means the holy wrestler br br Marinell the knight of the sea son of a water nymph he avoided all love because his mother had learnt that a maiden was destined to do him harm this prophecy was fulfilled when he was stricken down in battle by Britomart though he was not mortally wounded br Orgoglio an evil giant His name means pride in Italian br The Redcrosse Knight hero of Book I Introduced in the first canto of the poem he bears the emblem of Saint George patron saint of England a red cross on a white background that is still the flag of England The Redcrosse Knight is declared the real Saint George in Canto X He also learns that he is of English ancestry having been stolen by a Fay and raised in Faerieland In the climactic battle of Book I Redcrosse slays the dragon that has laid waste to Eden He marries Una at the end of Book I but brief appearances in Books II and III show him still questing through the world br Satyrane a wild half satyr man raised in the wild and the epitome of natural human potential Tamed by Una he protects her but ends up locked in a battle against the chaotic Sansloy which remains unconcluded Satyrane finds Florimell s girdle which she drops while flying from a beast He holds a three day tournament for the right to possess the girdle His Knights of Maidenhead win the day with Britomart s help br Scudamour the lover of Amoret His name means shield of love This character is based on Sir James Scudamore a jousting champion and courtier to Queen Elizabeth I Scudamour loses his love Amoret to the sorcerer Busirane Though the edition of The Faerie Queene has Scudamour united with Amoret through Britomart s assistance the continuation in Book IV has them separated never to be reunited br Talus an iron man who helps Arthegall to dispense justice in Book V The name is likely from Latin talus ankle with reference to that which justice stands on and perhaps also to the ankle of Achilles who was otherwise invincible or the mythological bronze man Talos br Triamond one of the Knights of Friendship a hero of Book IV Friend of Cambell One of three brothers when Priamond and Diamond died their souls joined with his body After battling Cambell Triamond marries Cambell s sister Canacee br Una the personification of the True Church She travels with the Redcrosse Knight who represents England whom she has recruited to save her parents castle from a dragon She also defeats Duessa who represents the false Catholic church and the person of Mary Queen of Scots in a trial reminiscent of that which ended in Mary s beheading Una is also representative of Truth br br br Themes br br br Allegory of virtue br br A letter written by Spenser to Sir Walter Raleigh in contains a preface for The Faerie Queene in which Spenser describes the allegorical presentation of virtues through Arthurian knights in the mythical Faerieland Presented as a preface to the epic in most published editions this letter outlines plans for twenty four books twelve based each on a different knight who exemplified one of twelve private virtues and a possible twelve more centred on King Arthur displaying twelve public virtues Spenser names Aristotle as his source for these virtues though the influences of Thomas Aquinas and the traditions of medieval allegory can be observed as well It is impossible to predict how the work would have looked had Spenser lived to complete it since the reliability of the predictions made in his letter to Raleigh is not absolute as numerous divergences from that scheme emerged as early as in the first Faerie Queene publication br In addition to the six virtues Holiness Temperance Chastity Friendship Justice and Courtesy the Letter to Raleigh suggests that Arthur represents the virtue of Magnificence which according to Aristotle and the rest is the perfection of all the rest and containeth in it them all and that the Faerie Queene herself represents Glory hence her name Gloriana The unfinished seventh book the Cantos of Mutability appears to have represented the virtue of constancy br br br Religion br br The Faerie Queene was written during the Reformation a time of religious and political controversy After taking the throne following the death of her half sister Mary Elizabeth changed the official religion of the nation to Protestantism The plot of book one is similar to Foxe s Book of Martyrs which was about the persecution of the Protestants and how Catholic rule was unjust Spenser includes the controversy of Elizabethan church reform within the epic Gloriana has godly English knights destroy Catholic continental power in Books I and V Spenser also endows many of his villains with the worst of what Protestants considered a superstitious Catholic reliance on deceptive images br br br Politics br The poem celebrates memorializes and critiques the House of Tudor of which Elizabeth was a part much as Virgil s Aeneid celebrates Augustus s Rome The Aeneid states that Augustus descended from the noble sons of Troy similarly The Faerie Queene suggests that the Tudor lineage can be connected to King Arthur The poem is deeply allegorical and allusive many prominent Elizabethans could have found themselves partially represented by one or more of Spenser s figures Elizabeth herself is the most prominent example She appears in the guise of Gloriana the Faerie Queen but also in Books III and IV as the virgin Belphoebe daughter of Chrysogonee and twin to Amoret the embodiment of womanly married love Perhaps also more critically Elizabeth is seen in Book I as Lucifera the maiden queen whose brightly lit Court of Pride masks a dungeon full of prisoners br The poem also displays Spenser s thorough familiarity with literary history The world of The Faerie Queene is based on English Arthurian legend but much of the language spirit and style of the piece draw more on Italian epic particularly Ludovico Ariosto s Orlando Furioso and Torquato Tasso s Jerusalem Delivered br Book V of The Faerie Queene the Book of Justice is Spenser s most direct discussion of political theory In it Spenser attempts to tackle the problem of policy toward Ireland and recreates the trial of Mary Queen of Scots br br br Archetypes br Some literary works sacrifice historical context to archetypal myth reducing poetry to Biblical quests whereas Spenser reinforces the actuality of his story by adhering to archetypal patterns Throughout The Faerie Queene Spenser does not concentrate on a pattern which transcends time but uses such a pattern to focus the meaning of the past on the present By reflecting on the past Spenser achieves ways of stressing the importance of Elizabeth s reign In turn he does not convert event into myth but myth into event Within The Faerie Queene Spenser blurs the distinction between archetypal and historical elements deliberately For example Spenser probably does not believe in the complete truth of the British Chronicle which Arthur reads in the House of Alma In this instance the Chronicle serves as a poetical equivalent for factual history Even so poetical history of this kind is not myth rather it consists of unique if partially imaginary events recorded in chronological order The same distinction resurfaces in the political allegory of Books I and V However the reality to interpreted events becomes more apparent when the events occurred nearer to the time when the poem was written br br br Symbolism and allusion br Throughout The Faerie Queene Spenser creates a network of allusions to events issues and particular persons in England and Ireland including Mary Queen of Scots the Spanish Armada the English Reformation and even the Queen herself It is also known that James VI of Scotland read the poem and was very insulted by Duessa a very negative depiction of his mother Mary Queen of Scots The Faerie Queene was then banned in Scotland This led to a significant decrease in Elizabeth s support for the poem Within the text both the Faerie Queene and Belphoebe serve as two of the many personifications of Queen Elizabeth some of which are far from complimentary br Though it praises her in some ways The Faerie Queene questions Elizabeth s ability to rule so effectively because of her gender and also inscribes the shortcomings of her rule There is a character named Britomart who represents married chastity This character is told that her destiny is to be an immortal womb to have children Here Spenser is referring to Elizabeth s unmarried state and is touching on anxieties of the s about what would happen after her death since the kingdom had no heir br The Faerie Queene s original audience would have been able to identify many of the poem s characters by analyzing the symbols and attributes that spot Spenser s text For example readers would immediately know that a woman who wears scarlet clothes and resides along the Tiber River represents the Roman Catholic Church However marginal notes jotted in early copies of The Faerie Queene suggest that Spenser s contemporaries were unable to come to a consensus about the precise historical referents of the poem s myriad figures In fact Sir Walter Raleigh s wife identified many of the poem s female characters as allegorical representations of herself br Other symbols prevalent in The Faerie Queene are the numerous animal characters present in the poem They take the role of visual figures in the allegory and in illustrative similes and metaphors Specific examples include the swine present in Lucifera s castle who embodied gluttony and Duessa the deceitful crocodile who may represent Mary Queen of Scots in a negative light br The House of Busirane episode in Book III in The Faerie Queene is partially based on an early modern English folktale called Mr Fox s Mottos In the tale a young woman named Lady Mary has been enticed by Mr Fox who resembles Bluebeard in his manner of killing his wives She defeats Mr Fox and tells about his deeds Notably Spenser quotes the story as Britomart makes her way through the House with warning mottos above each doorway Be bold be bold but not too bold br br br Composition br br br Spenser s intentions br While writing his poem Spenser strove to avoid gealous opinions and misconstructions because he thought it would place his story in a better light for his readers Spenser stated in his letter to Raleigh published with the first three books that the general end of the book is to fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline Spenser considered his work a historical fiction which men should read for delight rather than the profit of the ensample The Faerie Queene was written for Elizabeth to read and was dedicated to her However there are dedicatory sonnets in the first edition to many powerful Elizabethan figures br Spenser addresses lodwick in Amoretti when talking about The Faerie Queene still being incomplete This could be either his friend Lodowick Bryskett or his long deceased Italian model Ludovico Ariosto whom he praises in Letter to Raleigh br br br Dedication br br The poem is dedicated to Elizabeth I who is represented in the poem as the Faerie Queene Gloriana as well as the character Belphoebe Spenser prefaces the poem with sonnets additionally dedicated to Sir Christopher Hatton Lord Burleigh the Earl of Oxford the Earl of Northumberland the Earl of Cumberland the Earl of Essex the Earl of Ormond and Ossory High Admiral Charles Howard Lord Hunsdon Lord Grey of Wilton Lord Buckhurst Sir Francis Walsingham Sir John Norris Sir Walter Raleigh the Countess of Pembroke on the subject of her brother Sir Philip Sidney and Lady Carew br br br Social commentary br In October after nine years in Ireland Spenser voyaged to England and saw the Queen It is possible that he read to her from his manuscript at this time On February the Queen gave him a pension of fifty pounds per year He was paid in four instalments on March June September and December br After the first three books of The Faerie Queene were published in Spenser found himself disappointed in the monarchy among other things his annual pension from the Queen was smaller than he would have liked and his humanist perception of Elizabeth s court was shattered by what he saw there Despite these frustrations however Spenser kept his aristocratic prejudices and predispositions Book VI stresses that there is almost no correlation between noble deeds and low birth and reveals that to be a noble person one must be a gentleman of choice stock br Throughout The Faerie Queene virtue is seen as a feature for the nobly born and within Book VI readers encounter worthy deeds that indicate aristocratic lineage An example of this is the hermit to whom Arthur brings Timias and Serena Initially the man is considered a goodly knight of a gentle race who withdrew from public service to religious life when he grew too old to fight Here we note the hermit s noble blood seems to have influenced his gentle selfless behaviour Likewise audiences acknowledge that young Tristram speaks so well and acts so heroically that Calidore frequently contributes him with noble birth even before learning his background in fact it is no surprise that Tristram turns out to be the son of a king explaining his profound intellect However Spenser s most peculiar example of noble birth is demonstrated through the characterization of the Salvage Man Using the Salvage Man as an example Spenser demonstrated that ungainly appearances do not disqualify one from noble birth By giving the Salvage Man a frightening exterior Spenser stresses that virtuous deeds are a more accurate indication of gentle blood than physical appearance br On the opposite side of the spectrum The Faerie Queene indicates qualities such as cowardice and discourtesy that signify low birth During his initial encounter with Arthur Turpine hides behind his retainers chooses ambush from behind instead of direct combat and cowers to his wife who covers him with her voluminous skirt These actions demonstrate that Turpine is morally emasculated by fear and furthermore the usual social roles are reversed as the lady protects the knight from danger Scholars believe that this characterization serves as a negative example of knighthood and strives to teach Elizabethan aristocrats how to identify a commoner with political ambitions inappropriate to his rank br br br Poetic structure br The Faerie Queene was written in Spenserian stanza which Spenser created specifically for The Faerie Queene Spenser varied existing epic stanza forms the rhyme royal used by Chaucer with the rhyme pattern ABABBCC and the ottava rima which originated in Italy with the rhyme pattern ABABABCC Spenser s stanza is the longest of the three with nine iambic lines the first eight of them five footed that is pentameters and the ninth six footed that is a hexameter or Alexandrine which form interlocking quatrains and a final couplet The rhyme pattern is ABABBCBCC Over two thousand stanzas were written for the Faerie Queene Many see Spenser s purposeful use of archaic language as an intentional means of aligning himself with Chaucer and placing himself within a trajectory of building English national literary history br br br Theological structure br br In Elizabethan England no subject was more familiar to writers than theology Elizabethans learned to embrace religious studies in petty school where they read from selections from the Book of Common Prayer and memorized Catechisms from the Scriptures This influence is evident in Spenser s text as demonstrated in the moral allegory of Book I Here allegory is organized in the traditional arrangement of Renaissance theological treatises and confessionals While reading Book I audiences first encounter original sin justification and the nature of sin before analysing the church and the sacraments Despite this pattern Book I is not a theological treatise within the text moral and historical allegories intermingle and the reader encounters elements of romance However Spenser s method is not a rigorous and unyielding allegory but a compromise among conflicting elements In Book I of The Faerie Queene the discussion of the path to salvation begins with original sin and justification skipping past initial matters of God the Creeds and Adam s fall from grace This literary decision is pivotal because these doctrines center the fundamental theological controversies of the Reformation br br br Sources br br br Myth and history br During The Faerie Queene s inception Spenser worked as a civil servant in relative seclusion from the political and literary events of his day As Spenser laboured in solitude The Faerie Queene manifested within his mind blending his experiences into the content of his craft Within his poem Spenser explores human consciousness and conflict relating to a variety of genres including sixteenth century Arthurian literature The Faerie Queene was influenced strongly by Italian works as were many other works in England at that time The Faerie Queene draws heavily on Ariosto and Tasso br The first three books of The Faerie Queene operate as a unit representing the entire cycle from the fall of Troy to the reign of Elizabeth Using in medias res Spenser introduces his historical narrative at three different intervals using chronicle civil conversation and prophecy as its occasions br Despite the historical elements of his text Spenser is careful to label himself a historical poet as opposed to a historiographer Spenser notes this differentiation in his letter to Raleigh noting a Historiographer discourseth of affairs orderly as they were done but a Poet thrusteth into the midst and maketh a pleasing Analysis of all br Spenser s characters embody Elizabethan values highlighting political and aesthetic associations of Tudor Arthurian tradition in order to bring his work to life While Spenser respected British history and contemporary culture confirmed his attitude his literary freedom demonstrates that he was working in the realm of mythopoeic imagination rather than that of historical fact In fact Spenser s Arthurian material serves as a subject of debate intermediate between legendary history and historical myth offering him a range of evocative tradition and freedom that historian s responsibilities preclude Concurrently Spenser adopts the role of a sceptic reflected in the way in which he handles the British history which extends to the verge of self satire br br br Medieval subject matter br The Faerie Queene owes in part its central figure Arthur to a medieval writer Geoffrey of Monmouth In his Prophetiae Merlini Prophecies of Merlin Geoffrey s Merlin proclaims that the Saxons will rule over the Britons until the Boar of Cornwall Arthur again restores them to their rightful place as rulers The prophecy was adopted by the Welsh and eventually used by the Tudors Through their ancestor Owen Tudor the Tudors had Welsh blood through which they claimed to be descendants of Arthur and rightful rulers of Britain The tradition begun by Geoffrey of Monmouth set the perfect atmosphere for Spenser s choice of Arthur as the central figure and natural bridegroom of Gloriana br br br Reception br br br Diction br Since its inception four centuries ago Spenser s diction has been scrutinized by scholars Despite the enthusiasm the poet and his work received Spenser s experimental diction was largely condemned before it received the acclaim it has today Seventeenth century philologists such as Davenant considered Spenser s use of obsolete language as the most vulgar accusation that is laid to his charge Scholars have recently observed that the classical tradition tucked within The Faerie Queene is related to the problem of his diction because it involves the principles of imitation and decorum Despite these initial criticisms Spenser is now recognized as a conscious literary artist and his language is deemed the only fitting vehicle for his tone of thought and feelings Spenser s use of language was widely contrasted to that of free and unregulated sixteenth century Shakespearian grammar Spenser s style is standardized lyrically sophisticated and full of archaisms that give the poem an original taste Sugden argues in The Grammar of Spenser s Faerie Queene that the archaisms reside chiefly in vocabulary to a high degree in spelling to some extent in the inflexions and only slightly in the syntax br Samuel Johnson also commented critically on Spenser s diction with which he became intimately acquainted during his work on A Dictionary of the English Language and found it a useful source for obsolete and archaic words Johnson however mainly considered Spenser s early pastoral poems a genre of which he was not particularly fond br The diction and atmosphere of The Faerie Queene relied on much more than just Middle English for instance classical allusions and classical proper names abound especially in the later books and he coined some names based on Greek such as Poris and Phao lilly white Classical material is also alluded to or reworked by Spenser such as the rape of Lucretia which was reworked into the story of the character Amavia in Book Two br br br Language br Spenser s language in The Faerie Queene as in The Shepheardes Calender is deliberately archaic though the extent of this has been exaggerated by critics who follow Ben Jonson s dictum that in affecting the ancients Spenser writ no language Allowing that Jonson s remark may only apply to the Calendar Bruce Robert McElderry Jr states after a detailed investigation of The Faerie Queene s diction that Jonson s statement is a skillful epigram but it seriously misrepresents the truth if taken at anything like its face value The number of archaisms used in the poem is not overwhelming one source reports thirty four in Canto I of Book I that is thirty four words out of a total forty two hundred words less than one percent According to McElderry language does not account for the poem s archaic tone The subject matter of The Faerie Queene is itself the most powerful factor in creating the impression of archaism br Examples of medieval archaisms in morphology and diction include br br Infinitive in en vewen to view br Prefix y retained in participle yclad clad clothed br Adjective combrous harassing troublesome br Verb keepe heed give attention to br br br Adaptation and derivative works br Numerous adaptations in the form of children s literature have been made the work was a popular choice in the th and early th century with over different versions written with the earliest being E W Bradburn s Legends from Spencer s Fairy Queen for Children written in the form of a dialogue between mother and children the th century versions oft concentrated on the moral aspect of the tale In terms of the English speaking world adaptions of the work were relatively more popular in the United Kingdom than in the United States compared to contemporary works like Bunyan s The Pilgrim s Progress presumably due to the differences in appeal of the intended audiences Royal court vs Ordinary people and their relative appeal to the general American readership br The Edwardian era was particularly rich in adaptation for children and the works richly illustrated with contributing artists including A G Walker Gertrude Demain Hammond T H Robinson Frank C Pap Brinsley Le Fanu and H J Ford Additionally Walter Crane illustrated a six volume collection of the complete work published considered a great example of the Arts and Crafts movement br In The Mathematics of Magic the second of Fletcher Pratt and L Sprague de Camp s Harold Shea stories the modern American adventurers Harold Shea and Reed Chalmers visit the world of The Faerie Queene where they discover that the greater difficulties faced by Spenser s knights in the later portions of the poem are explained by the evil enchanters of the piece having organized a guild to more effectively oppose them Shea and Chalmers reveal this conspiracy to the knights and assist in its overthrow In the process Belphebe and Florimel of Faerie become respectively the wives of Shea and Chalmers and accompany them on further adventures in other worlds of myth and fantasy br A considerable part of Elizabeth Bear s Promethean Age series takes place in a Kingdom of Faerie which is loosely based on the one described by Spenser As depicted by Bear Spenser was aware of this Kingdom s existence and his work was actually a description of fact rather than invented fantasy Queen Elizabeth I had a secret pact of mutual help with the Queen of Faerie and such historical characters as Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare visited Faerie and had adventures there br According to Richard Simon Keller George Lucas s Star Wars film also contains elements of a loose adaptation as well as being influenced by other works with parallels including the story of the Red Cross Knight championing Una against the evil Archimago in the original compared with Lucas s Luke Skywalker Princess Leia and Darth Vader Keller sees extensive parallels between the film and book one of Spenser s work stating A lmost everything of importance that we see in the Star Wars movie has its origin in The Faerie Queene from small details of weaponry and dress to large issues of chivalry and spirituality br br br References in
