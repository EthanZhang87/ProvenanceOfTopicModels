title: Ceremonial magic
id: 211676
Ceremonial magic also known as ritual magic high magic or learned magic encompasses a wide variety of rituals of magic The works included are characterized by ceremony and numerous requisite accessories to aid the practitioner It can be seen as an extension of ritual magic and in most cases synonymous with it Popularized by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn it draws on such schools of philosophical and occult thought as Hermetic Qabalah Enochian magic Thelema and the magic of various grimoires Ceremonial magic is part of Hermeticism and Western esotericism br The synonym magick is an archaic spelling of magic used during the Renaissance which was revived by Aleister Crowley to differentiate occult magic from stage magic He defined it as the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will including ordinary acts of will as well as ritual magic Crowley wrote that it is theoretically possible to cause in any object any change of which that object is capable by nature John Symonds and Kenneth Grant attach a deeper occult significance to this preference br Crowley saw magic as the essential method for a person to reach true understanding of the self and to act according to one s true will which he saw as the reconciliation between freewill and destiny Crowley describes this process in his Magick Book br br br Definitions and general purpose br The term magick is an Early Modern English spelling for magic used in works such as the translation of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa s De Occulta Philosophia Three Books of Occult Philosophy or Of Magick Aleister Crowley chose the spelling to differentiate his practices and rituals from stage magic which may be more appropriately termed illusion and the term has since been re popularised by those who have adopted elements of his teachings Crowley defined Magick as the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with will br br br Qabalah and the Tree of Life br br The Tree of Life is a tool used to categorize and organize various mystical concepts At its most simple level it is composed of ten spheres or emanations called sephiroth sing sephira which are connected by twenty two paths The sephiroth are represented by the planets and the paths by the characters of the Hebrew alphabet which are subdivided by the four classical elements the seven classical planets and the twelve signs of the Zodiac Within the western magical tradition the Tree is used as a kind of conceptual filing cabinet Each sephira and path is assigned various ideas such as gods cards of the Tarot astrological planets and signs elements etc br Crowley considered a deep understanding of the Tree of Life to be essential to the magician br br The Tree of Life has got to be learnt by heart you must know it backwards forwards sideways and upside down it must become the automatic background of all your thinking You must keep on hanging everything that comes your way upon its proper bough br Similar to yoga learning the Tree of Life is not so much magic as it is a way to map out one s spiritual universe As such the adept may use the Tree to determine a destination for astral travel to choose which gods to invoke for what purposes et cetera It also plays an important role in modeling the spiritual journey where the adept begins in Malkuth which is the every day material world of phenomena with the ultimate goal being at Kether the sphere of Unity with the All br br br Components br br br Body of light br br The body of light sometimes called the astral body or the subtle body is a quasi material aspect of the human body being neither solely physical nor solely spiritual posited by a number of philosophers and elaborated on according to various esoteric occult and mystical teachings Other terms used for this body include body of glory spirit body radiant body luciform body augoeides radiant astroeides starry or sidereal body and celestial body br Crowley referred to the augoeides a Greek term for the body of light and connected it with the Knowledge Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel associated with each human being He stressed that the body of light must be built up though the use of imagination and that it must then be animated exercised and disciplined According to Asprem br br The practice of creating a body of light in imagination builds on the body image system potentially working with alterations across all of its three modalities perceptual conceptual and affective an idealized body is produced body image model new conceptual structures are attached to it e g the doctrine of multiple separable bodies while emotional attachments of awe dignity and fear responses are cultivated through the performance of astral rituals and protections from astral dangers through the simulation of symbols and magical weapons br br br Grimoires br br A grimoire is a textbook of magic typically including instructions on how to create magical objects like talismans and amulets how to perform magical spells charms and divination and how to summon or invoke supernatural entities such as angels spirits deities and demons In many cases the books themselves are believed to be imbued with magical powers although in many cultures other sacred texts that are not grimoires such as the Bible have been believed to have supernatural properties intrinsically The only contents found in a grimoire would be information on spells rituals the preparation of magical tools and lists of ingredients and their magical correspondences In this manner while all books on magic could be thought of as grimoires not all magical books should be thought of as grimoires br While the term grimoire is originally European and many Europeans throughout history particularly ceremonial magicians and cunning folk have used grimoires the historian Owen Davies noted that similar books can be found all around the world ranging from Jamaica to Sumatra He also noted that in this sense the world s first grimoires were created in Europe and the Ancient Near East br br br Magical formulae br br A magical formula or word of power is a word that is believed to have specific supernatural effects They are words whose meaning illustrates principles and degrees of understanding that are often difficult to relay using other forms of speech or writing It is a concise means to communicate very abstract information through the medium of a word or phrase br These words often have no intrinsic meaning in and of themselves However when deconstructed each individual letter may refer to some universal concept found in the system in which the formula appears Additionally in grouping certain letters together one is able to display meaningful sequences that are considered to be of value to the spiritual system that utilizes them e g spiritual hierarchies historiographic data psychological stages etc br A formula s potency is understood and made usable by the magician only through prolonged meditation on its levels of meaning Once these have been interiorized by the magician they may then utilize the formula to maximum effect br br br Magical record br A magical record is a journal or other source of documentation containing magical events experiences ideas and any other information that the magician may see fit to add There can be many purposes for such a record such as recording evidence to verify the effectiveness of specific procedures per the scientific method that Aleister Crowley claimed should be applied to the practice of magic or to ensure that data may propagate beyond the lifetime of the magician Benefits of this process vary but usually include future analysis and further education by the individual and or associates with whom the magician feels comfortable in revealing such intrinsically private information br Crowley was highly insistent upon the importance of this practice As he writes in Liber E It is absolutely necessary that all experiments should be recorded in detail during or immediately after their performance The more scientific the record is the better Yet the emotions should be noted as being some of the conditions Let then the record be written with sincerity and care thus with practice it will be found more and more to approximate to the ideal Other items he suggests for inclusion include the physical and mental condition of the experimenter the time and place and environmental conditions including the weather br br br Magical weapons br br The practice of ceremonial magic often requires tools made or consecrated specifically for this use called magical weapons which are required for a particular ritual or series of rituals They may be a symbolic representation of psychological elements of the magician or of metaphysical concepts br In Magick Book Part II Magick Aleister Crowley lists the tools required as a magic circle drawn on the ground and inscribed with the names of god an altar a wand cup sword and pentacle to represent his true will his understanding his reason and the lower parts of his being respectively On the altar too is a phial of oil to represent his aspiration and for consecrating items to his intent The magician is surrounded by a scourge dagger and chain intended to keep his intent pure An oil lamp book of conjurations and bell are required as is the wearing of a crown robe and lamen The crown affirms his divinity the robe symbolizes silence and the lamen declare his work The book of conjurations is his magical record his karma In the East is the magic fire in which all burns up at last br br br Techniques br br According to Crowley there is a single definition of the purpose for ritual magic to achieve Union with God through the uniting of the Microcosm with the Macrocosm Since this process is so arduous it is also acceptable to use magic to develop the self i e one s body of light or to create ideal circumstances for the Work e g having access to a place in which to do ritual undisturbed There are many kinds of magic but the categories of ritual that are recommended by Crowley include br br Banishing the elimination of unwanted forces The Magician must therefore take the utmost care in the matter of purification firstly of himself secondly of his instruments thirdly of the place of working br Invocation where the magician identifies with the Deity invoked There are three methods br Devotion where identity with the God is attained by love and by surrender by giving up or suppressing all irrelevant and illusionary parts of yourself br Calling forth where identity is attained by paying special attention to the desired part of yourself positive as the first method is negative e g assumption of godforms br Drama where identity is attained by sympathy It is very difficult for the ordinary man to lose himself completely in the subject of a play or of a novel but for those who can do so this method is unquestionably the best e g many initiations and the Gnostic Mass br Evocation which is bringing a spiritual being before not into the magician e g goetia br Eucharistic ritual which consists in taking common things transmuting them into things divine and consuming them br Consecration the active dedication of a thing to a single purpose br Divination such as the use of the Thoth Tarot or other tools used to gather information br br br Vibration of god names br In magical rituals a vocal technique called vibration is commonly used This was a basic aspect of magical training for Crowley who described it in Liber O According to that text vibration involves a physical set of steps starting in a standing position breathing in through the nose while imagining the name of the god entering with the breath imagining that breath travelling through the entire body stepping forward with the left foot while throwing the body forward with arms outstretched visualizing the name rushing out when spoken ending in an upright stance with the right forefinger placed upon the lips According to Crowley in Liber O success in this technique is signaled by physical exhaustion and though only by the student himself is it perceived when he hears the name of the God vehemently roared forth as if by the concourse of ten thousand thunders and it should appear to him as if that Great Voice proceeded from the Universe and not from himself br br br Banishing br br The purpose of banishing rituals is to eliminate forces that might interfere with a magical operation and they are often performed at the beginning of an important event or ceremony although they can be performed for their own sake as well The area of effect can be a magic circle or a room The general theory of magic proposes that there are various forces which are represented by the classical elements air earth fire and water the planets the signs of the Zodiac and adjacent spaces in the astral world There are many banishing rituals but most are some variation on two of the most common The Star Ruby and the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram br Crowley describes banishing in his Magick Book ch br br in the banishing ritual of the pentagram we not only command the demons to depart but invoke the Archangels and their hosts to act as guardians of the Circle during our pre occupation with the ceremony proper In more elaborate ceremonies it is usual to banish everything by name Each element each planet and each sign perhaps even the Sephiroth themselves all are removed including the very one which we wished to invoke for that forces as existing in Nature is always impure But this process being long and wearisome is not altogether advisable in actual working It is usually sufficient to perform a general banishing and to rely upon the aid of the guardians invoked The Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is the best to use br He further states br br Those who regard this ritual as a mere devise to invoke or banish spirits are unworthy to possess it Properly understood it is the Medicine of Metals and the Stone of the Wise br br br Purification br br Purification is similar in theme to banishing but is a more rigorous process of preparing the self and her temple for serious spiritual work Crowley mentions that ancient magicians would purify themselves through arduous programs such as through special diets fasting sexual abstinence keeping the body meticulously tidy and undergoing a complicated series of prayers He goes on to say that purification no longer requires such activity since the magician can purify the self via willed intention Specifically the magician labors to purify the mind and body of all influences which may interfere with the Great Work br br The point is to seize every occasion of bringing every available force to bear upon the objective of the assault It does not matter what the force is by any standard of judgment so long as it plays its proper part in securing the success of the general purpose We must constantly examine ourselves and assure ourselves that every action is really subservient to the One Purpose br Crowley recommended symbolically ritual practices such as bathing and robing before a main ceremony The bath signifies the removal of all things extraneous or antagonistic to the one thought The putting on of the robe is the positive side of the same operation It is the assumption of the frame of mind suitable to that one thought br br br Consecration br br Consecration is an equally important magical operation It is essentially the dedication usually of a ritual instrument or space to a specific purpose In Magick Book ch Crowley writes br br The ritual here in question should summarize the situation and devote the particular arrangement to its purpose by invoking the appropriate forces Let it be well remembered that each object is bound by the Oaths of its original consecration as such Thus if a pantacle has been made sacred to Venus it cannot be used in an operation of Mars br br br Invocation br br Invocation is the bringing in or identifying with a particular deity or spirit Crowley wrote of two keys to success in this arena to inflame thyself in praying and to invoke often For Crowley the single most important invocation or any act of magic for that matter was the invocation of one s Holy Guardian Angel or secret self which allows the adept to know his or her true will br Crowley describes the experience of invocation br br The mind must be exalted until it loses consciousness of self The Magician must be carried forward blindly by a force which though in him and of him is by no means that which he in his normal state of consciousness calls I Just as the poet the lover the artist is carried out of himself in a creative frenzy so must it be for the Magician br Crowley Magick Book discusses three main categories of invocation although in the great essentials these three methods are one In each case the magician identifies himself with the Deity invoked br br Devotion where identity with the God is attained by love and by surrender by giving up or suppressing all irrelevant and illusionary parts of yourself br Calling forth where identity is attained by paying special attention to the desired part of yourself br Drama where identity is attained by sympathy It is very difficult for the ordinary man to lose himself completely in the subject of a play or of a novel but for those who can do so this method is unquestionably the best br Another invocatory technique that the magician can employ is called the assumption of godforms where with concentrated imagination of oneself in the symbolic shape of any God one should be able to identify oneself with the idea which the god represents A general method involves positioning the body in a position that is typical for a given god imagining that the image of the god is coinciding with or enveloping the body accompanied by the practice of vibration of the appropriate god name s br br br Evocation br br There is a distinct difference between invocation and evocation as Crowley explains br br To invoke is to call in just as to evoke is to call forth This is the essential difference between the two branches of Magick In invocation the macrocosm floods the consciousness In evocation the magician having become the macrocosm creates a microcosm You invoke a God into the Circle You evoke a Spirit into the Triangle br br Generally evocation is used for two main purposes to gather information and to obtain the services or obedience of a spirit or demon Crowley believed that the most effective form of evocation was found in the grimoire on Goetia see below which instructs the magician in how to safely summon forth and command infernal spirits However it is equally possible to evoke angelic beings gods and other intelligences related to planets elements and the Zodiac br Unlike with invocation which involves a calling in evocation involves a calling forth most commonly into what is called the triangle of art br br br Eucharist br The word eucharist originally comes from the Greek word for thanksgiving However within magic it takes on a special meaning the transmutation of ordinary things usually food and drink into divine sacraments which are then consumed The object is to infuse the food and drink with certain properties usually embodied by various deities so that the adept takes in those properties upon consumption Crowley describes the process of the regular practice of eucharistic ritual br br The magician becomes filled with God fed upon God intoxicated with God Little by little his body will become purified by the internal lustration of God day by day his mortal frame shedding its earthly elements will become in very truth the Temple of the Holy Ghost Day by day matter is replaced by Spirit the human by the divine ultimately the change will be complete God manifest in flesh will be his name br br There are several eucharistic rituals within the magical canon Two of the most well known are The Mass of the Phoenix and The Gnostic Mass The first is a ritual designed for the individual which involves sacrificing a Cake of Light a type of bread that serves as the host to Ra i e the Sun and infusing a second Cake with the adept s own blood either real or symbolic in a gesture reflecting the myth of the Pelican cutting its own breast to feed its young and then consuming it with the words There is no grace there is no guilt This is the Law Do what thou wilt The other ritual The Gnostic Mass is a very popular public ritual although it can be practiced privately that involves a team of participants including a Priest and Priestess This ritual is an enactment of the mystical journey that culminates with the Mystic Marriage and the consumption of a Cake of Light and a goblet of wine a process termed communication Afterwards each Communicant declares There is no part of me that is not of the gods br br br Divination br br The art of divination is generally employed for the purpose of obtaining information that can guide the adept in his Great Work The underlying theory states that there exists intelligences either outside of or inside the mind of the diviner that can offer accurate information within certain limits using a language of symbols Normally divination within magic is not the same as fortune telling which is more interested in predicting future events Rather divination tends to be more about discovering information about the nature and condition of things that can help the magician gain insight and to make better decisions br There are literally hundreds of different divinatory techniques in the world However Western occult practice mostly includes the use of astrology calculating the influence of heavenly bodies bibliomancy reading random passages from a book such as Liber Legis or the I Ching Thoth Tarot a deck of cards each with symbolic meaning usually laid out in a meaningful pattern and geomancy a method of making random marks on paper or in earth that results in a combination of sixteen patterns br It is an accepted truism within magic that divination is imperfect As Crowley writes In estimating the ultimate value of a divinatory judgment one must allow for more than the numerous sources of error inherent in the process itself The judgment can do no more than the facts presented to it warrant It is naturally impossible in most cases to make sure that some important factor has not been omitted One must not assume that the oracle is omniscient br br br History br br br Renaissance magic br br The term originates in th century Renaissance magic referring to practices described in various Medieval and Renaissance grimoires and in collections such as that of Johannes Hartlieb Georg Pictor uses the term synonymously with goetia br James Sanford in his translation of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa s De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum has The partes of ceremoniall Magicke be Geocie and Theurgie For Agrippa ceremonial magic was in opposition to natural magic While he had his misgivings about natural magic which included astrology alchemy and also what we would today consider fields of natural science such as botany he was nevertheless prepared to accept it as the highest peak of natural philosophy Ceremonial magic on the other hand which included all sorts of communication with spirits including necromancy and witchcraft he denounced in its entirety as impious disobedience towards God br br br Francis Barrett br br Among the various sources for ceremonial magic Francis Barrett a late th century Englishman called himself a student of chemistry metaphysics and natural occult philosophy Barrett was enthusiastic about reviving interest in the occult arts and published a magical textbook called The Magus The Magus dealt with the natural magic of herbs and stones magnetism talismanic magic alchemy numerology the elements and biographies of famous adepts from history It was a compilation almost entirely consisting of selections from Cornelius Agrippa s Three Books of Occult Philosophy the Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy attributed to Agrippa and Robert Turner s translation of the Heptameron of Peter of Abano Barrett made modifications and modernized spelling and syntax Possibly influencing the novelist Edward Bulwer Lytton the book gained little other notice until it influenced Eliphas Levi br br br liphas L vi br br liphas L vi conceived the notion of writing a treatise on magic with his friend Bulwer Lytton This appeared in under the title Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie and was translated into English by Arthur Edward Waite as Transcendental Magic its Doctrine and Ritual br In he published a sequel La Clef des Grands Myst res The Key to the Great Mysteries Further magical works by L vi include Fables et Symboles Stories and Images and La Science des Esprits The Science of Spirits In he wrote Le Grand Arcane ou l Occultisme D voil The Great Secret or Occultism Unveiled this however was only published posthumously in br L vi s version of magic became a great success especially after his death That Spiritualism was popular on both sides of the Atlantic from the s contributed to his success His magical teachings were free from obvious fanaticisms even if they remained rather murky he had nothing to sell and did not pretend to be the initiate of some ancient or fictitious secret society He incorporated the Tarot cards into his magical system and as a result the Tarot has been an important part of the paraphernalia of Western magicians He had a deep impact on the magic of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and later Aleister Crowley and it was largely through this impact that L vi is remembered as one of the key founders of the twentieth century revival of magic br br br Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn br br The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn founded was a secret society devoted to the study and practice of the occult metaphysics and paranormal activities during the late th and early th centuries Known as a magical order the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was active in Great Britain and focused its practices on theurgy and spiritual development Many present day concepts of ritual and magic that are at the centre of contemporary traditions such as Wicca and Thelema were inspired by the Golden Dawn which became one of the largest single influences on th century Western occultism br The three founders William Robert Woodman William Wynn Westcott and Samuel Liddell Mathers were Freemasons Westcott appears to have been the initial driving force behind the establishment of the Golden Dawn br The Golden Dawn was the first of three Orders although all three are often collectively referred to as the Golden Dawn The First Order taught esoteric philosophy based on the Hermetic Qabalah and personal development through study and awareness of the four classical elements as well as the basics of astrology tarot divination and geomancy The Second or Inner Order the Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis taught magic including scrying astral travel and alchemy br br br Aleister Crowley br br English author and occultist Aleister Crowley wrote about magical practices and theory including those of theurgy high magic and goetia low magic In The Book of the Law and The Vision and the Voice the Aramaic magical formula Abracadabra was changed to Abrahadabra which he called the new formula of the Aeon of Horus He also famously spelled magic in the archaic manner as magick to differentiate the true science of the Magi from all its counterfeits He also stated that The spirits of the Goetia are portions of the human brain br His book Magick Liber ABA Book is a lengthy treatise on magic in which he which also presents his own system of Western occult practice synthesised from many sources including Yoga Hermeticism medieval grimoires contemporary magical theories from writers like Eliphas Levi and Helena Blavatsky and his own original contributions It consists of four parts Mysticism Magick Elementary Theory Magick in Theory and Practice and the Law The Equinox of The Gods It also includes numerous appendices presenting many rituals and explicatory papers br br br Dion Fortune br br Dion Fortune was a Welsh occultist ceremonial magician novelist and author She was a co founder of the Fraternity of the Inner Light an occult organisation that promoted philosophies which she claimed had been taught to her by spiritual entities known as the Ascended Masters A prolific writer she produced a large number of articles and books on her occult ideas and also authored seven novels several of which expound occult themes br Fortune was a ceremonial magician The magical principles on which her Fraternity was based were adopted from the late nineteenth century Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn with other influences coming from Theosophy and Christian Science The magical ceremonies performed by Fortune s Fraternity were placed into two categories initiations in which the candidate was introduced to magical forces and evocation in which these forces were manipulated for a given purpose br The Fraternity s rituals at their Bayswater temple were carried out under a dim light as Fortune believed that bright light disperses etheric forces An altar was placed in the centre of a room with the colours of the altar cloth and the symbols on the altar varying according to the ceremony being performed A light was placed on the altar while incense usually frankincense was burned The senior officers sat in a row along the eastern end of the room while officers who were believed to be channels for cosmic forces were positioned at various positions on the floor The lodge was opened by walking around the room in a circle chanting with the intent of building a psychic force up as a wall Next the cosmic entities would be invoked with the members believing that these entities would manifest in astral form and interact with the chosen officers br Fortune was particularly concerned with the issue of sex She believed that this erotic attraction between men and women could be harnessed for use in magic She urged her followers to be naked under their robes when carrying out magical rituals for this would increase the creative sexual tension between the men and women present Although sex features in her novels it is never described in graphic detail The scholar Andrew Radford noted that Fortune s reactionary and highly heteronormative view of sacralised sexuality should be seen as part of a wider tradition among esoteric currents going back to the ideas of Emanuel Swedenborg and Andrew Jackson Davis and also being found in the work of occultists like Paschal Beverly Randolph and Ida Craddock br The religious studies scholar Hugh Urban noted that Fortune was one of the key links between early twentieth century ceremonial magic and the developing Pagan religion of Wicca Similarly the Wiccan high priestess Vivianne Crowley characterised Fortune as a proto Pagan The scholar and esotericist Nevill Drury stated that Fortune in many ways anticipated feminist ideas in contemporary Wicca particularly through her belief that all goddesses were a manifestation of a single Great Goddess Graf agreed adding that Fortune s works found resonance in the work of the later feminist Wiccan Starhawk and in particular in the latter s book The Spiral Dance br In researching ceremonial magic orders and other esoteric groups active in the London area during the s Luhrmann found that within them Fortune s novels were treated as fictionalized ideals and that they were recommended to newcomers as the best way to understand magic The Pagan studies scholar Joanne Pearson added that Fortune s books and in particular the novels The Sea Priestess and Moon Magic were owned by many Wiccans and other Pagans The religious studies scholar Graham Harvey compared The Sea Priestess to the Wiccan Gerald Gardner s novel High Magic s Aid stating that while neither were great literature they evoke Paganism better than later more didactic works br br br Jack Parsons br br John Whiteside Parsons was an American rocket engineer chemist and Thelemite occultist Parsons converted to Thelema the new religious movement founded by the English occultist Aleister Crowley Together with his first wife Helen Northrup Parsons joined the Agape Lodge the Californian branch of Ordo Templi Orientis O T O in At Crowley s bidding Parsons replaced Wilfred Talbot Smith as its leader in and ran the Lodge from his mansion on Orange Grove Boulevard br Parsons identified four obstacles that prevented humans from achieving and performing their true will all of which he connected with fear the fear of incompetence the fear of the opinion of others the fear of hurting others and the fear of insecurity He insisted that these must be overcome writing that The Will must be freed of its fetters The ruthless examination and destruction of taboos complexes frustrations dislikes fears and disgusts hostile to the Will is essential to progress br In Parsons separated from Helen after having an affair with her sister Sara when Sara left him for L Ron Hubbard Parsons conducted the Babalon Working a series of rituals intended to invoke the Thelemic goddess Babalon on Earth The Babalon Working was a series of magic ceremonies or rituals performed from January to March by Parsons and Scientology founder L Ron Hubbard This ritual was essentially designed to manifest an individual incarnation of the archetypal divine feminine called Babalon The project was based on the ideas of Crowley and his description of a similar project in his novel Moonchild br When Parsons declared that the first of the series of rituals was complete and successful he almost immediately met Marjorie Cameron in his own home and regarded her as the elemental that he and Hubbard had called through the ritual Soon Parsons began the next stage of the series an attempt to conceive a child through sex magic workings Although no child was conceived this did not affect the result of the ritual to that point Parsons and Cameron who Parsons now regarded as the Scarlet Woman Babalon called forth by the ritual soon married br The rituals performed drew largely upon rituals and sex magic described by Crowley Crowley was in correspondence with Parsons during the course of the Babalon Working and warned Parsons of his potential overreactions to the magic he was performing while simultaneously deriding Parsons work to others br A brief text entitled Liber self referenced within the text as The Book of Babalon was written by Jack Parsons as a transmission from the goddess or force called Babalon received by him during the Babalon Working Parsons wrote that Liber constituted a fourth chapter of Crowley s Liber AL Vel Legis The Book of the Law the holy text of Thelema br br br Phyllis Seckler br br Phyllis Seckler also known as Soror Meral was a ninth degree IX member of the Sovereign Sanctuary of the Gnosis of Ordo Templi Orientis O T O and a lineage holder in the A A tradition She was a student of Jane Wolfe herself a student of Aleister Crowley br Sekler was a member of O T O Agape Lodge the only working Lodge of the O T O at the time of Aleister Crowley s death Seckler was also instrumental in preserving important parts of Crowley s literary heritage typing parts of his Confessions and the complete texts of The Vision and the Voice and Magick Without Tears during the s Seckler was also instrumental in re activing the O T O with Grady Louis McMurtry during the early mid s following the death of Crowley s appointed successor Karl Germer br Seckler continued her lifelong work with the A A founding the College of Thelema and co founding with James A Eshelman the Temple of Thelema and later warranting the formation of the Temple of the Silver Star Seeking to guide her students to an understanding of the Law of Thelema especially deeper understanding of oneself and of one s magical will Sekler published the bi annual Thelemic journal In the Continuum which featured her essays on Thelema and initiation as well as instructional articles for the students of the A A illustrations and essays which help to clarify some of Crowley s thoughts and aid in the understanding of Thelemic principles expressed in Liber AL Printed for years from through In the Continuum also published rare works by Aleister Crowley which at the time were out of print or hard to find br Seckler served as a master of Lodge of O T O in California from its inception in until her death br br br Kenneth Grant br br Kenneth Grant was an English ceremonial magician and advocate of the Thelemic religion A poet novelist and writer he founded his own Thelemic organisation the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis later renamed the Typhonian Order with his wife Steffi Grant br Grant was fascinated by the work of the occultist Aleister Crowley having read a number of his books Eager to meet Crowley Grant wrote letters to Crowley s publishers asking that they pass his letters on to Crowley himself These eventually resulted in the first meeting between the two in autumn at the Bell Inn in Buckinghamshire After several further meetings and an exchange of letters Grant agreed to work for Crowley as his secretary and personal assistant Now living in relative poverty Crowley was unable to pay Grant for his services in money instead paying him in magical instruction br In March Grant moved into a lodge cottage in the grounds of Netherwood a Sussex boarding house where Crowley was living He continued living there with Crowley for several months dealing with the old man s correspondences and needs In turn he was allowed to read from Crowley s extensive library on occult subjects and performed ceremonial magic workings with him becoming a high initiate of Crowley s magical group Ordo Templi Orientis O T O Crowley saw Grant as a potential leader of O T O in the UK writing in his diary value of Grant If I die or go to the USA there must be a trained man to take care of the English O T O br Grant drew eclectically on a range of sources in devising his teachings Although based in Thelema Grant s Typhonian tradition has been described as a bricolage of occultism Neo Vedanta Hindu tantra Western sexual magic Surrealism ufology and Lovecraftian gnosis According to Djurdjevic Grant s writing style is notorious for being opaque with verbal and conceptual labyrinths The historian of religion Manon Hedenborg White noted that Grant s writings do not lend themselves easily to systematization She added that he deliberately employs cryptic or circuitous modes of argumentation and lacks clear boundaries between fact and fiction br Grant promoted what he termed the Typhonian or Draconian tradition of magic and wrote that Thelema was only a recent manifestation of this wider tradition In his books he portrayed the Typhonian tradition as the world s oldest spiritual tradition writing that it had ancient roots in Africa The religious studies scholar Gordan Djurdjevic noted that Grant s historical claims regarding Typhonian history were at best highly speculative and lacked any supporting evidence however he suggested that Grant may never have intended these claims to be taken literally br Grant adopted a perennialist interpretation of the history of religion Grant s wrote that Indian spiritual traditions like Tantra and Yoga correlate to Western esoteric traditions and that both stem from a core ancient source has parallels in the perennial philosophy promoted by the Traditionalist School of esotericists He believed that by mastering magic one masters this illusory universe gaining personal liberation and recognising that only the Self really exists Doing so according to Grant leads to the discovery of one s true will the central focus of Thelema br Grant further wrote that the realm of the Self was known as the Mauve Zone and that it could be reached while in a state of deep sleep where it has the symbolic appearance of a swamp He also believed that the reality of consciousness which he deemed the only true reality was formless and thus presented as a void although he also taught that it was symbolised by the Hindu goddess Kali and the Thelemic goddess Nuit br Grant s views on sex magic drew heavily on the importance of sexual dimorphism among humans and the subsequent differentiation of gender roles Grant taught that the true secret of sex magic were bodily secretions the most important of which was a woman s menstrual blood In this he differed from Crowley who viewed semen as the most important genital secretion Grant referred to female sexual secretions as kalas a term adopted from Sanskrit He thought that because women have kalas they have oracular and visionary powers The magical uses of female genital secretions are a recurring theme in Grant s writings br br br James Lees br br James Lees August was an English magician known for discovering the system he called English Qaballa br Lees was born in Bolton Lancashire He established a career as an analytic chemist In his search for truth he also studied psychology Not finding the answers he wanted from science he turned to the study of astrology even making a living for a time as a horary astrologer br Still resolved to discover further answers Lees decided to study Kabbalah and the Tree of Life From here he proceeded to experiment with invocations from the Key of Solomon Satisfied with the results he proceeded to perform the month working described in The Book of Abramelin by means of the Bornless Ritual Having successfully invoked his Holy Guardian Angel he turned his attention to ascending the Middle Pillar of the Tree of Life culminating with an experience known as crossing the abyss br Then in November Lees discovered the order value of the English Alphabet Following this discovery Lees founded the O A A in order to assist others in the pursuit of their own spiritual paths The first public report of the system known as
