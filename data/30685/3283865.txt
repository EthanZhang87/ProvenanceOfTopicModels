The Lady of the Green Kirtle also called Queen of Underland and Queen of the Deep Realm is the main antagonist in The Silver Chair by C S Lewis She enslaved Prince Rilian of Narnia and a horde of gnomes by her witchcraft and planned to use them to take over Narnia She is foiled by three friends of Aslan Eustace Scrubb Jill Pole and Puddleglum and is finally killed by Rilian br br br Overview br The Green Lady has kidnapped Prince Rilian son of King Caspian X and has fatally poisoned his mother Ramandu s daughter The Lady plans to conquer Narnia from underground using the enslaved prince as her general br She understands that Eustace Jill and Puddleglum have been sent to rescue Rilian and meets them as they head north from Narnia She slyly directs them to the giants castle Harfang for the Autumn Feast and bids them explain that she salutes the giants by them for she knows that man pies are a traditional dish for this feast and that this is an easy way to get rid of her adversaries br When the three unexpectedly turn up instead in her own domain she attempts to dull their senses and critical thinking through hypnotic magic She very nearly convinces them that neither Narnia nor the Earth truly exist but Puddleglum successfully counters the illusion br She finally uses her shapeshifting skill to transform into a gigantic green serpent but the Prince recognizes her serpent form as the same one that killed his mother ten years earlier and after a brief struggle he strikes off her head br br br The Green Lady and the White Witch br The story never makes clear who the Green Lady really is or where she comes from The Silver Chair includes her among several Northern Witches a group that evidently also includes Jadis the White Witch Some readers believe that Jadis and the Lady of The Green Kirtle are the same person Jadis however is slain by Aslan centuries earlier in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and Lewis never describes her being brought back to life br The speculation is probably reinforced by the set of character sketches included in some later editions of the books One sketch describes Jadis as completely evil even in The Silver Chair Since it is the Lady of the Green Kirtle who appears in The Silver Chair some conclude that this must refer to the Green Lady This theory has influenced adaptations of the books for example actress Barbara Kellerman portrayed both The White Witch and The Lady of the Green Kirtle in the BBC series The Chronicles of Narnia The character sketches however are recent additions to the books they were not written by Lewis and in this regard are not supported by Lewis s text Lewis scholar Peter Schakel even writes that the character sketch states incorrectly that the Queen of Underland is an embodiment of Jadis br The mechanics of how Jadis could return are never made clear since she is killed at the end of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe her last chronological appearance in the books In Prince Caspian Nikabrik and his companions suggest that the White Witch could be resurrected who ever heard of a witch that really died In Lewis s text this plan is never put to the test though the Walden Media film adaptation introduces a ritual that begins to pull Jadis back to life before the spell is broken The Magician s Nephew written as a prequel to the Narnia series relates that Jadis gained immortality by eating a magic apple but except for the LeFay fragment this book was written after Prince Caspian was finished While it is possible that Lewis meant this to give a route to reincarnating Jadis the text never follows up on it br br br Literary inspirations br Carina Rumberger Yanda suggests that the Lady of the Green Kirtle may be associated with the eponymous character of John Keats s Lamia Like Lamia the Lady is sometimes a snake and sometimes a maid More beautiful than ever Spread a green kirtle br Her transformation into a serpent br br Her arms appeared to be fastened to her sides Her legs were intertwined with each other and her feet had disappeared The long green train of her skirt thickened and grew solid and seemed to be all one piece with the writhing green pillar of her interlocked legs br echoes the description of Satan s transformation in Milton s Paradise Lost br br His Armes clung to his Ribs his Leggs entwiningEach other till supplanted down he fellA monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone br br br Adaptations br In the BBC production of The Chronicles of Narnia Lady of the Green Kirtle was portrayed by Barbara Kellerman the same actress who played the White Witch br In the film The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader the DVD commentary states that the power behind the Green Mist was the Lady of the Green Kirtle even though she is not shown in the film br In July the official Narnia website allowed fans the opportunity to name the Lady of the Green Kirtle The winning name was to be selected by Mark Gordon and David Magee for use in the cancelled film version of The Silver Chair br br br Notes br br br br Lewis C S The Silver Chair London Geoffrey Bles br Sammons Martha A Guide Through Narnia Wheaton
