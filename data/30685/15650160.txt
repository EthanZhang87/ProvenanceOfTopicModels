At a concert in the series finale she and Faraday are reunited br br br Development br br br Creation and casting br br After Naomi Marsha Thomason parachuted onto the island in season three the producers began to plan who else would be on the freighter she came from They wanted these new characters to be scientists who would be interested in finding the island for their own personal reasons They decided to create a character who would be interested in lost civilizations and named her Charlotte Staples Lewis as a reference to C S Lewis which Lost producer Damon Lindelof said was a clue to the direction the show would be taking during season four br The role was originally offered to Kristen Bell however she chose to join Heroes as Elle Bishop instead The producers cast English actress Rebecca Mader because she won them over with her charm and presence and charisma During casting Charlotte was described as a hot twentysomething precocious loquacious and funny a very successful academic who also knows how to handle herself in the real world She also has lots of repressed and pent up emotions beneath the surface The Lost producers described her as a female version of Indiana Jones During auditions the producers provide fake scenes to keep new characters identities a secret Mader s audition scene was a flashback that she was disappointed was not used for the show Whilst recording her audition a producer who was with her noticed that the shows on her r sum were from the British Broadcasting Corporation so asked her to redo the audition again with a British accent According to Lindelof this opened up another dimension to the character that the producers hadn t foreseen so Charlotte was changed from American to English Mader was pleased to be able to use her own accent as many of her previous roles had been American characters br Mader subsequently began to watch the first three seasons of Lost on DVD and was watching the fourth episode when she received the news that she had been chosen for the role She watched all the previous episodes of Lost in the few weeks before she started working on the show She found it a really amazing moment and felt like she had just stepped into the show When she was cast Mader was unaware of whether she would be a guest star or would develop into a regular and was planned to feature in eight episodes of season four Mader helped develop Charlotte s outfit and was pleased to be wearing comfortable jeans and boots for the role She only required a small amount of hair and makeup done and stated I just wanted to rough it I wanted to roll around in the mud with a gun This was a welcome change to her usual roles which required full on hair makeup and heels br br br Storyline progression br Charlotte s discovery of a polar bear with a Dharma Initiative collar caused fan speculation about her connection with the island Mader herself was unaware of Charlotte s backstory beyond the flashback in Confirmed Dead she noted I feel like I m almost in the same seat as the audience like What the hell is going on and What the hell is going to happen next it s really exciting actually She found it freeing to not know her character s history and felt it made her give a natural performance Mader felt Charlotte s relationship with Faraday allowed her character to develop and show a softer more human side and thought their relationship resonated with the audience as she and Jeremy Davies had good chemistry Eight episodes of season four were written before production stopped due to the Writers Guild of America strike Once the strike was resolved a further six episodes were written two less than originally planned for the season and as a result Charlotte s role continued into season five She enjoyed speaking Korean in Something Nice Back Home and wished the full scene had been aired Mader was excited when she discovered that Charlotte grew up on the island and hoped to have scenes with Nestor Carbonell who plays Richard Alpert as his character also has a history on the island However when negotiating contracts in June she found out that her character would die during season five Mader summed up Charlotte s season five arc as her demise Charlotte s death scene was written by Eddy Kitsis and Adam Horowitz and was amongst their favourite scenes they wrote during season five Horowitz loved the emotion in the scene due to the audience only just learning Charlotte s backstory and Kitsis thought Mader s performance elevate d the words to a whole other level Mader called it the best thing she ha d ever done in her entire career and enjoyed playing a significant role within the episode br br Three episodes after Charlotte s death Faraday sees a young Charlotte in a scene set in This created a continuity error as her date of birth was given in Confirmed Dead as July Lost producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse explained in the Official Lost Audio Podcast that Mader changed the age of Charlotte so she would not be portraying someone in their mid thirties However Mader retaliated on her Facebook page that the timeline error was their fault and was unhappy about being blamed for it Lindelof and Cuse clarified that it was their mistake and apologized for blaming Mader Fellow Lost producer Greggory Nations had noticed Mader was eight years younger than the age Charlotte was originally conceived to be so suggested Charlotte s birthday be changed to the same as Mader s without realizing the effect this would have on the subsequent season br Mader returned to the show for two guest appearances in season six to show Charlotte in the afterlife Mader described Charlotte as the role of a lifetime and cited it as a reason that she was cast in better roles following the series conclusion br br br Reception br br The producers of Lost were nervous about how well the new characters would be received after two characters introduced in season three Nikki Kiele Sanchez and Paulo Rodrigo Santoro were hated by the fan community IGN s Chris Carabott described Charlotte as well as the other new characters from the freighter as great and exciting James Poniewozik of Time liked the introduction of the new characters from the freighter because Each got just one flashback and a little time on the island and yet by the end of the episode he felt he had a true handle on what they were like as individuals Jeff Jensen from Entertainment Weekly liked that the fascinating new characters brought mind blowing new possibilities and exciting new theory fodder Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV called it the perfect introduction Michael Ausiello of TV Guide also liked their introduction and praised the actors performances br During the season Charlotte s storylines had mixed reactions Jensen thought Charlotte and Faraday s mission to the Tempest in The Other Woman felt forced Dan Compora from Airlock Alpha liked Charlotte and Juliet s fight scene in this episode BuddyTV s Oscar Dahl thought the whole plot at the Tempest was filler and wondered if it had been added just to give Charlotte and Faraday something to do After Charlotte speaks Korean in Something Nice Back Home James Poniewozik from Time became curious about her past because she is the member of the four freighties whom we know the least about and the most secretive and sinister seeming of the bunch Chris Carabott was also intrigued after this scene which he called one of the more unexpected scenes br Carabott felt Charlotte s death could have been explored further but as there was so much happening in the episode not enough time was made for her death Alan Sepinwall of The Star Ledger noted it was Jeremy Davies portrayal of Faraday s grief that made him care about her death Cynthia Littleton from Variety said this was one of the few times Charlotte did not annoy her as she acts as a translator for Jin finally do ing something worthwhile Noel Murray of The A V Club felt distracted by Charlotte in this episode because her reaction to time travel was different from what was shown in The Constant and found it incredibly awkward when Charlotte explained her whole backstory to Faraday TV Guide s Mickey O Connor praised Mader s acting saying Well done Rebecca Mader who has really done some fine work on Lost br br br br Explanatory notes br br Citations
