Elements of the supernatural and the fantastic were an element of literature from its beginning The modern genre is distinguished from tales and folklore which contain fantastic elements first by the acknowledged fictitious nature of the work and second by the naming of an author Works in which the marvels were not necessarily believed or only half believed such as the European romances of chivalry and the tales of the Arabian Nights slowly evolved into works with such traits Authors like George MacDonald created the first explicitly fantastic works br Later in the twentieth century the publication of The Lord of the Rings by J R R Tolkien enormously influenced fantasy writing establishing the form of epic fantasy This also did much to establish the genre of fantasy as commercially distinct and viable Today fantasy continues as an expansive multi layered milieu encompassing many subgenres including traditional high fantasy sword and sorcery fairytale fantasy and dark fantasy br br br Differences between fantasy and earlier fantastic works br br Even the most fantastic myths legends and fairy tales differ from modern fantasy genre in three respects br Modern genre fantasy postulates a different reality either a fantasy world separated from ours or a hidden fantasy side of our own world In addition the rules geography history etc of this world tend to be defined even if they are not described outright Traditional fantastic tales take place in our world often in the past or in far off unknown places It seldom describes the place or the time with any precision often saying simply that it happened long ago and far away A modern rationalized analog to these stories can be found in the Lost World tales of the th and th centuries br The second difference is that the supernatural in fantasy is by design fictitious In traditional tales the degree to which the author considered the supernatural to be real can span the spectrum from legends taken as reality to myths understood as describing in understandable terms more complicated reality to late intentionally fictitious literary works br Finally the fantastic worlds of modern fantasy are created by an author or group of authors often using traditional elements but usually in a novel arrangement and with an individual interpretation Traditional tales with fantasy elements used familiar myths and folklore and any differences from tradition were considered variations on a theme the traditional tales were never intended to be separate from the local supernatural folklore Transitions between the traditional and modern modes of fantastic literature are evident in early Gothic novels the ghost stories in vogue in the th century and Romantic novels all of which used extensively traditional fantastic motifs but subjected them to authors concepts br By one standard no work created before the fantasy genre was defined can be considered to belong to it no matter how many fantastic elements it includes By another the genre includes the whole range of fantastic literature both the modern genre and its traditional antecedents as many elements which were treated as true or at least not obviously untrue by earlier authors are wholly fictitious and fantastic for modern readers But even by the more limited definition a full examination of the history of the fantastic in literature is necessary to show the origins of the modern genre Traditional works contain significant elements which modern fantasy authors have drawn upon extensively for inspiration in their own works br br br Development of fantasy br br br Romances br br With increases in learning in the medieval European era literary fiction joined earlier myths and legends Among the first genres to appear was romance This genre embraced fantasy and not only simply followed traditional myths and fables but in its final form added new fantastical elements br Romance at first dealt with traditional themes above all three thematic cycles of tales assembled in imagination at a late date as the Matter of Rome focusing on military heroes like Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar the Matter of France Charlemagne and Roland his principal paladin and the Matter of Britain the lives and deeds of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table within which was incorporated the quest for the Holy Grail although a number of non cyclical romances also achieved a great deal of popularity br The romances themselves were fictional but such tales as Valentine and Orson Guillaume de Palerme and Queste del Saint Graal were only the beginning of the fantasy genre combining realism and fantasy br During the Renaissance romance continued to be popular The trend was to more fantastic fiction The English Le Morte d Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory c was written in prose this work dominates the Arthurian literature often being regarded as the canonical form of the legend Arthurian motifs have appeared steadily in literature from its publication though the works have been a mix of fantasy and non fantasy works At the time it and the Spanish Amadis de Gaula also prose spawned many imitators and the genre was popularly well received producing such masterpiece of Renaissance poetry as Ludovico Ariosto s Orlando furioso and Torquato Tasso s Gerusalemme Liberata Ariosto s tale with its endlessly wandering characters many marvels and adventures was a source text for many fantasies of adventure With such works as Amadis of Gaul and Palmerin of England the genre of fantasy was clearly inaugurated as the marvels are deployed to amaze and surprise readers br br One English romance is The Faerie Queene of Edmund Spenser br br br The Enlightenment br br Literary fairy tales such as were written by Charles Perrault and Madame d Aulnoy c became very popular early in the Age of Enlightenment Many of Perrault s tales became fairy tale staples and influenced latter fantasy as such Indeed when Madame d Aulnoy termed her works contes de f e fairy tales she invented the term that is now generally used for the genre thus distinguishing such tales from those involving no marvels This would influence later writers who took up the folk fairy tales in the same manner in the Romantic era br Several fantasies aimed at an adult readership were also published in th century France including Voltaire s br contes philosophique The Princess of Babylon and The White Bull and Jacques Cazotte s Faustian novel The Devil in Love br This era however was notably hostile to fantasy Writers of the new types of fiction such as Defoe Richardson and Fielding were realistic in style and many early realistic works were critical of fantastical elements in fiction Aside from a few tales of witchcraft and ghost stories very little fantasy was written during this time Even children s literature saw little fantasy it aimed at edifying and deplored fairy tales as lies br br br Romanticism br br Romanticism highly prized the supernatural tradition and imagination br Gothic tales permitted but did not require an element of the supernatural Some stories appeared to contain such elements and then explained them away The genre has been argued by some to straddle the border between fantasy and non fantasy but many elements from it particularly the houses of particular import being ancient owned by nobles and often endowed with legends were incorporated in modern fantasy br Of particular importance to the development of the genre was that the Gothic writers used novelistic techniques and love such as Defoe was using rather than the literary style of the romance and also began to use the landscape for purposes of expressing the characters moods br On the other hand the Gothic still held back the pure fantasy In The Castle of Otranto Walpole presented the work as a translation the fictitious original author is therefore responsible for its fantasical elements which Walpole distances himself from One noted Gothic novel which also br contains a large amount of fantasy elements derived from the Arabian Nights is Vathek by br William Thomas Beckford br The Romantic interest in medievalism also resulted in a revival of interest in the literary fairy tale The tradition begun with Giovanni Francesco Straparola and Giambattista Basile and developed by the Charles Perrault and the French pr cieuses was taken up by the German Romantic movement br Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu created medieval set stories such as Undine and Sintram and his Companions br which would later inspire British writers such as MacDonald and Morris br E T A Hoffmann s tales such as The Golden Pot and The Nutcracker and the Mouse King were notable additions to the canon of German fantasy br Ludwig Tieck s collection Phantasus br contained several short fairy tales including The Elves br In France the main writers of Romantic era fantasy were Charles Nodier with Smarra and br Trilby and Th ophile Gautier in br stories such as Omphale and One of Cleopatra s Nights br and the later novel Spirite br In Britain Sara Coleridge also wrote a fantasy novel Phantasmion described as the first fairytale novel written in English br br br Modern fantasy br br br Pre Tolkien br br In the early Victorian era stories continued to be told using fantastic elements less believed in Charles Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol using novelistic characterization to make his ghost story plausible Scrooge at first doubts the reality of the ghosts suspecting them his own imagination an explanation that is never conclusively refuted br The fairy tale tradition continued in the hands of such authors as William Makepeace Thackeray but The Rose and the Ring showed many elements of parody Hans Christian Andersen however initiated a new style of fairy tales original tales told in seriousness From this origin John Ruskin wrote The King of the Golden River a fairy tale that uses new levels of characterization creating in the South West Wind an irascible but kindly character similar to the later Gandalf br In the late th and early th centuries modern fantasy began to take shape The history of modern fantasy literature begins with George MacDonald the Scottish author of such novels as The Princess and the Goblin and Phantastes the latter can be considered to be the first fantasy novel written for adults MacDonald also wrote one of the first critical essays about the fantasy genre The Fantastic Imagination in his book A Dish of Orts MacDonald was a major influence on both J R R Tolkien and C S Lewis br br Another major fantasy author of this era was William Morris a socialist an admirer of Middle Ages a reviver of British handcrafts and a poet who wrote several fantastic romances and novels in the latter part of the century of which the most famous was The Well at the World s End He was deeply inspired by the medieval romances and sagas his style was deliberately archaic based on medieval romances In many respects Morris was an important milestone in the history of fantasy because while other writers wrote of foreign lands or of dream worlds Morris s works were the first to be set in an entirely invented world a fantasy world br These fantasy worlds were part of a general trend This era began a general trend toward more self consistent and substantive fantasy worlds Earlier works often feature a solitary individual whose adventures in the fantasy world are of personal significance and where the world clearly exists to give scope to these adventures and later works more often feature characters in a social web where their actions are to save the world and those in it from peril In Phantastes for instance George MacDonald has a mentor figure explain to the hero that the moral laws are the same in the world he is about to enter as in the world he came from this lends weight and importance to his actions in this world however fantastical it is br Authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Oscar Wilde in The Picture of Dorian Gray also developed fantasy in the telling of horror tales a separate branch of fantasy that was to have great influence on H P Lovecraft and other writers of dark fantasy Wilde also wrote a large number of children s fantasies collected in The Happy Prince and Other Stories and A House of Pomegranates br Despite MacDonald s future influence and Morris popularity at the time it was not until around the start of the th century that fantasy fiction began to reach a large audience with authors such as Lord Dunsany who following Morris s example wrote fantasy novels but also in the short story form He was particularly noted for his vivid and evocative style His style greatly influenced many writers not always happily Ursula K Le Guin in her essay on style in fantasy From Elfland to Poughkeepsie wryly referred to Lord Dunsany as the First Terrible Fate that Awaiteth Unwary Beginners in Fantasy alluding to young writers attempting to write in Lord Dunsany s style S T Joshi claims that Dunsany s work had the effect of segregating fantasy a mode whereby the author creates his own realm of pure imagination from supernatural horror From the foundations he established came the later work of E R Eddison Mervyn Peake and J R R Tolkien br According to historian Michael Saler speculative fiction entered a new stage in the s and s as a consequence of the rise of the secular society where the imagination in literature was freed from the influence of the church This allowed writers to combine aesthetic literature with the freedom of the New Romance literature and the techniques used in literary realism br H Rider Haggard developed the conventions of the Lost World subgenre which sometime included fantasy works as in Haggard s own She With Africa still largely unknown to European writers it offered scope to this type Other writers including Edgar Rice Burroughs and Abraham Merritt built on the convention br br Several classic children s fantasies such as Lewis Carroll s Alice in Wonderland J M Barrie s Peter Pan L Frank Baum s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz as well as the work of E Nesbit and Frank R Stockton were also published around this time Indeed C S Lewis noted that in the earlier part of the th century fantasy was more accepted in juvenile literature and therefore a writer interested in fantasy often wrote in it to find an audience despite concepts that could form an adult work br At this time the terminology for the genre was not settled Many fantasies were termed fairy tales including Max Beerbohm s The Happy Hypocrite and MacDonald s Phantastes It was not until that the term fantasist was used to describe a writer in this case Oscar Wilde who wrote fantasy fiction The name fantasy was not developed until later as late as J R R Tolkien s The Hobbit the term fairy tale was still being used br An important factor in the development of the fantasy genre was the arrival of magazines devoted to fantasy fiction The first br such publication was the German magazine Der Orchideengarten which ran from to br In the first English language fantasy fiction magazine Weird Tales was br created Many other similar magazines eventually followed most noticeably Unknown AKA Unknown Worlds and br The Magazine of Fantasy Science Fiction The pulp magazine format was at the height of its popularity at this time and was instrumental in bringing fantasy fiction to a wide audience in both the U S and Britain Such magazines also played a large role in the rise of science fiction and it was at this time the two genres began to be associated with each other br br Several of the genre s most prominent authors began their careers in these magazines including Clark Ashton Smith Fritz Leiber and Ray Bradbury The early works of many sword and sorcery authors such as Robert E Howard also began at this time By sword and sorcery had begun to find a wide audience with the success of Howard s Conan the Barbarian and Fritz Leiber s Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories Howard s works especially Conan were to have a noteworthy even defining influence on the sword and sorcery subgenre They were tales of vivid larger than life action and adventure and after the work of Tolkien the most widely read works of fantasy Leiber s stories were particularly noted for their uncommon realism for the time Unknown developed this trait with many stories in it showing credibility and realism Like Morris and Eddison before him Leiber continued the tradition of drawing on Northern European legend and folklore C L Moore was among Howard s first imitators with The Black God s Kiss in which she introduced Jirel of Joiry and the heroine protagonist to sword and sorcery According to Gary Lachman Helena Blavatsky had a significant influence on some of the biggest names in both fantasy and science fiction of the pulp era br Outside the pulp magazines several American writers used the medium of fantasy for humorous and satirical purposes including James Branch Cabell whose novel Jurgen became the subject of an unsuccessful prosecution br for obscenity Thorne Smith with Topper and Turnabout and Charles G Finney author of The Circus of Dr Lao br In Britain in the aftermath of World War I a notably large number of fantasy books aimed at an adult readership were published br including Living Alone by Stella Benson br A Voyage to Arcturus by David Lindsay Lady into Fox by br David Garnett Lud in the Mist by Hope Mirrlees and Lolly Willowes by br Sylvia Townsend Warner br E R Eddison another influential writer wrote during this era He drew inspiration from Northern sagas as Morris did but his prose style was modeled more on Tudor and Elizabethan English and his stories were filled with vigorous characters in glorious adventures Eddison s most famous work is The Worm Ouroboros a long heroic br fantasy set on an imaginary version of the planet Mercury His characters were often of great ability and noble if not royal birth These characters have been admired for his work in making his villains particularly more vivid characters than Tolkien s Others have observed that while it is popular to depict the great of the world trampling on the lower classes his characters often treat their subjects with arrogance and insolence and this is depicted as part of their greatness Indeed at the end of The Worm Ouroboros the heroes finding peace dull pray for and get the revival of their enemies so that they may go and fight them again regardless of the casualties that such a war would have br Several of these writers including Eddison Lindsay and Mirrlees had their fantasy work republished during the br s and s br In with the publication of The Sword in the Stone T H White introduced one of the most notable works of comic fantasy This strain continued with such writers as L Sprague de Camp br Literary critics of the era began to take an interest in fantasy as a genre of writing br and also to argue that it was a genre worthy of serious consideration br Herbert Read devoted a chapter of his book English Prose Style to discussing Fantasy as an aspect br of literature arguing it was unjustly considered suitable only for children The Western World does not seem to have conceived the necessity of Fairy Tales for Grown Ups Edward Wagenknecht also discussed fantasy elements br in both children s and adult fiction in his article The Little Prince Rides the White Deer br br br Tolkien br It was the advent of high fantasy in particular J R R Tolkien s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings which allowed fantasy to truly enter into the mainstream Tolkien had published The Hobbit in and The Lord of the Rings in the s while the first was a fairy tale fantasy the second was an epic fantasy that expanded upon the groundwork of The Hobbit Although Tolkien s works had been successful in Britain it was not until the late s that they became popular in America thanks to its burgeoning counterculture In the early s there was a renewed interest in sword and sorcery and publishers mined the pulps for older stories to reprint along with the limited amount of new material In demand for more Ace Books science fiction editor Donald A Wollheim felt Tolkien s three part novel had enough elements in common with sword and sorcery that it would appeal to the readers of the latter after which he published an unauthorized paperback edition On its first page blurb it was described as a book of sword and sorcery that anyone can read with delight and pleasure But the readers of the book would extend way beyond sword and sorcery fandom By the end of The Lord of the Rings had sold over million copies in America Its unexpected success caused American publishers to swiftly reissue a large number of older often obscure fantasy novels catapulting them to belated success br It is difficult to overstate the impact that The Lord of the Rings had on the fantasy genre in some respects it swamped all the works of fantasy that had been written before it and it unquestionably created fantasy as a marketing category It created an enormous number of Tolkienesque works using the themes found in The Lord of the Rings The author and editor of Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts Brian Attebery writes that fantasy is defined not by boundaries but by a centre which is The Lord of the Rings br Tolkien s works also helped fantasy literature to achieve a new degree of mainstream critical acclaim Numerous polls to identify the greatest book of the century found The Lord of the Rings selected by widely different groups br While constructing original fantasy worlds with detailed histories geographies and political landscapes had been a part of the genre from the time of L Frank Baum Tolkien s influence greatly popularized the notion This led to a subsequent decline of such devices as dream frames to explain away the fantastical nature of the setting This stemmed not only from his example but from his literary criticism his On Fairy Stories in which he termed such settings secondary worlds was a formative work of fantasy criticism br The impact that his books combined with the success of several other series such as C S Lewis s Chronicles of Narnia Mervyn Peake s Gormenghast series and Ursula K Le Guin s Earthsea helped cement the genre s popularity and gave birth to the current wave of fantasy literature br br br Post Tolkien br br With the immense success of Tolkien s works publishers began to search for a new series with similar mass market appeal Fantasy novels began to replace fiction magazines as the heart of the genre br Lin Carter edited the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series when Ballantine pursued the fantasy market it was so titled to avert the series being filed as children s literature The line contained mostly reprints but introduced some new fantasy works Reprinted authors included William Morris Lord Dunsany and George MacDonald more recent authors included Hope Mirrlees s Lud in the Mist Ernest Bramah s Kai Lung books and Evangeline Walton s The Island of the Mighty the success of which led to the publication of the other three novels she had written in that series and to a distinct strain of Celtic fantasy in later fantasy Another work in this series that was influential for the Celtic fantasy subgenre was Katherine Kurtz s Deryni Rising br Although many fantasy novels of this time proved popular it was not until s The Sword of Shannara that publishers found the sort of breakthrough success they had hoped for The book became the first fantasy novel to appear on and eventually top the New York Times bestseller list As a result the genre saw a boom in the number of titles published Fantasy novels of the late s and s included Stephen R Donaldson s Lord Foul s Bane the first in The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever series John Crowley s Little Big Raymond E Feist s Magician Robert Holdstock s Mythago Wood and Glen Cook s Black Company series br By the early s the fantasy market was much larger than that of almost all science fiction authors The long running series of light fantasies by Piers Anthony Xanth and Terry Pratchett Discworld regularly hit the bestseller lists from the s onward Notable books of the s include Robert Jordan s popular series The Wheel of Time Tad Williams Memory Sorrow and Thorn series and George R R Martin s A Song of Ice and Fire the basis of the American fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones A Song of Ice and Fire is considered a path breaking work which paved the way for a new kind of fantasy referred to as grimdark which was less idealistic and more violent in nature With J K Rowling s Harry Potter novels which have become the best selling book series of all time fantasy is becoming increasingly intertwined with mainstream fiction a process aided by the international popularity of other works such as Christopher Paolini s Inheritance Cycle Ranger s Apprentice by John Flanagan Brandon Sanderson s Stormlight Archive and Philip Pullman s His Dark Materials The success of major film adaptations such as The Lord of the Rings Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia film series has helped further this trend br Since the s the genre has been marked by the rise of female centric urban fantasy very different from Tolkien s works as shown by the popularity of Laurell K Hamilton s Anita Blake novels and Charlaine Harris The Southern Vampire Mysteries books br br br br br br
