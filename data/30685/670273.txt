In C S Lewis s Chronicles of Narnia series of novels Calormen is a large country to the southeast of Narnia Lewis probably derived its name from the Latin calor meaning heat When using the name as an adjective or an ethnonym Lewis spelled the name with an e at the end a Calormene soldier The Calormenes have dark faces and long beards br Narnia and Calormen are separated by the country of Archenland and a large desert In The Horse and His Boy Calormen is described as being many times the size of its northern neighbours and it is implied that its army is always either conquering more land or keeping down rebellions in wars with which neither Narnia nor Archenland are involved The border of the Calormene Empire extends from the Western Mountains to the Great Eastern Ocean The Calormene capital is Tashbaan a large walled city located on an island hill at the mouth of a river and close to the northern desert br br br History br The country of Calormen was first mentioned by Lewis in a passing reference in chapter of Prince Caspian though in the first edition it was spelt Kalormen He first wrote about Calormene characters in the subsequent Voyage of the Dawn Treader though neither of these is their first chronological appearance in the series They are presented with the following words The Calormenes have dark faces and long beards They wear flowing robes and orange coloured turbans and they are a wise wealthy courteous cruel and ancient people As narrated in that book after the Telmarine kings cut Narnia off from the sea the Lone Islands though in theory remaining a Narnian possession fell into the Calormene sphere of influence becoming a major source of slaves for Calormen and adopting the Calormene Crescent as the islands currency After Caspian the Seafarer restored Narnian rule and abolished slavery in the islands there was some apprehension of Calormen resorting to war to regain its influence there The book s plot then moves away and it remains unknown whether such a war took place However Lewis later placed Calormen at the focus of The Horse and His Boy set a thousand years earlier at the time of High King Peter br The origins of Calormen and the Calormenes are not made clear during the Chronicles According to the Narnian timeline published by Walter Hooper Calormen was founded by Archen outlaws who traveled over the Great Desert to the south some years after Archenland s founding In an alternative theory Calormen was founded by people accidentally crossing into Calormen from our world through a Middle Eastern portal similar to the English wardrobe in The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe which was subsequently lost or destroyed preventing their return The Calormenes speak a flowery version of the standard English favoured by both human and animal Narnians which might support this argument however Jadis also speaks English The reason for the ancient Persian Moorish Mughal Indian and Ottoman Turkish aspects of Calormene culture or the origin of their religion was not satisfactorily explained but stand in strong counterpoint to the largely European Anglo and Greco Roman and Christian aspects of Narnia and Archenland br Throughout the times covered by the Chronicles of Narnia Calormen and Narnia maintain an uneasy albeit generally peaceable coexistence The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle contain plot lines that focus on Calormen while some of the other books have peripheral references In The Horse and His Boy the main characters one a young member of the Calormene nobility escape from Calormen to Archenland and Narnia whilst the Calormene cavalry under Prince Rabadash attempts to invade Narnia and capture the Narnian Queen Susan for his bride The rather small horse Calormene invasion force is rebuffed at the gates of the Kingdom of Archenland In The Last Battle there is a reference to King Erlian having fought a war with the Calormenes King Tirian is until the events narrated in the book at peace with them and some level of trade and travel exist between Narnia and Calormen The Narnian King maintains a supply of Calormene armour and weapons for the purpose of conducting undercover operations in their country suggesting a kind of cold war br Calormenes are described as dark skinned with the men mostly bearded Flowing robes turbans and wooden shoes with an upturned point at the toe are common items of clothing and the preferred weapon is the scimitar Lavish palaces are present in the Calormene capital Tashbaan The overall leitmotif of Calormene culture is portrayed as ornate to the point of ostentation The people of Calormen are concerned with maintaining honour and precedent often speaking in maxims and quoting their ancient poets Veneration of elders and absolute deference to power are marks of Calormene society Power and wealth determine class and social standing and slavery is commonplace The unit of currency is the Crescent Narnians hold Calormenes in disdain for their treatment of animals and slaves Conversely Calormenes refer to the human inhabitants of Narnia as barbarians All of this appears quite consistent with the Osmanli Turkish Ottoman Empire its known and purported splendor rigid class structure and the always volatile relationship with many of its European neighbors br The ruler of Calormen is called the Tisroc and is believed by the Calormene people to have descended in a direct line from the god Tash whom the people worship in addition to other gods and goddesses The illustrations of Tash a vulture headed god by Pauline Baynes appear to be inspired by Hindu as opposed to Islamic imagery with multiple arms and a distinct resemblance to the ancient Indian deity Garuda Calormenes always follow a mention of the Tisroc with the phrase may he live forever Ranking below the Tisroc are his sons princes a Grand Vizier and the noble classes who are addressed as Tarkaan male and Tarkheena female The nobility have a band of gold on their arm and their marriages are usually arranged at a young age Beneath them are soldiers of the empire s vast army merchants and the peasantry with slaves being the lowest rung on the social ladder The Calormene leaders are portrayed as quite war like and the Tisrocs generally seem to have a wish to conquer the barbarian lands to their north to some degree deterred however by the magical reputation of the countries their various rulers and their being known to be under the protection of Aslan Significantly the final successful invasion of Narnia by the Calormene military which precipitates the end of the Narnian universe was conducted in close cooperation with the appearance of the false Aslan and the proclamation that Aslan and Tash are one and the same br Calormene social and political institutions are depicted as essentially unchanged between the time of The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle more than a thousand years in which Narnia has profoundly changed several times This is clearly an artifact of the order in which C S Lewis wrote and published the stories with the two stories above and The Magician s Nephew which also references ancient Mesopotamian civilisation in its depiction of Queen Jadis and Charn appearing last three of the seven br When at the end of The Last Battle the characters cross into the Real Narnia and find there the counterparts of all the places they had known in the destroyed Narnia there is a reference to a counterpart of Calormen being also there to its south complete with the capital Tashbaan presumably without the nastier aspects of Calormene culture but this is not discussed in detail br br br Tashbaan br The capital of Calormen is the walled city of Tashbaan situated on a river mouth located on the southern verge of the great desert dividing the empire from the northern states of Narnia and Archenland br Tashbaan is described as one of the wonders of the world br The city is a hot and crowded place though with fine streets magnificent palaces and gardens It is built on a natural slope rising to the palace of the Tisroc and the great Temple of Tash at the pinnacle of the hill The palace of the Tisroc is referred to as being magnificent beyond description and opens onto gardens that run right down to the river wall Tashbaan is surrounded by a strong wall that rises out of the water and is reached by long bridges from both banks providing the only place where crossing the great river of Calormen is possible for many miles The banks of the river are lined with gardens and country houses The Tombs of the Ancient Kings believed by the Carlomenes to be haunted lie directly across the river from Tashbaan on the edge of the desert br br br Calormene Poetry br The poetry of Calormen is prolix sententious and moralizing Quotations from Calormen poets are often quoted as proverbs These include such as the following br br Application to businessis the root of prosperitybut those who ask questionsthat do not concern themare steering the ship of follytowards the rock of indigence Natural affection is stronger than soupand offspring more precious than carbuncles He who attempts to deceive the judiciousis already baring his back for the scourge Swords can be kept off with shieldsbut the Eye of Wisdom pierces through every defence Deep draughts from the fountain of reason are desirablein order to extinguish the fire of youthful love br Calormenes disparage Narnian poetry contending that it is all about things like love and war and not about useful maxims but when the Calormen raised Cor and Aravis first hear Narnian or Cor s native Archenlandish poetry they find it much more exciting Calormen also prizes the art of story telling which according to Lewis forms part of the education of the nobility The talking horse Bree though not fond of most things Calormene thoroughly enjoys a story told in Calormene style by Aravis He also has the habit of rolling like inarticulate Calormene horses br br br Concepts of freedom and slavery br In The Horse and His Boy Lewis uses the cultural settings of Narnia Archenland and Calormen to develop a theme of freedom in contrast to slavery Lewis depicts the Calormene culture as one in which a primary guiding principle is that the weak must make way for the strong br br For in Tashbaan there is only one traffic regulation which is that everyone who is less important has to get out of the way for everyone who is more important unless you want a cut from a whip or a punch from the butt end of a spear br He also reveals the motivation for Calormene attempts to invade Archenland and ultimately Narnia as a refusal to abide the thought of free countries so close to the border of the Calormene empire as illustrated by this speech given by the Tisroc br br These little barbarian countries that call themselves free which is as much to say idle disordered and unprofitable are hateful to the gods and to all persons of discernment br In contrast the kings and queens of Narnia and Archenland as rulers of free people hold themselves responsible for the well being of their subjects As King Lune tells Shasta Cor br br For this is what it means to be a king to be first in every desperate attack and last in every desperate retreat and when there s hunger in the land as must be now and then in bad years to wear finer clothes and laugh louder over a scantier meal than any man in your land br br br Accusations of racism br C S Lewis has been accused of racism particularly in his depiction of the Calormenes In the Companion to Narnia the Catholic theologian Paul F Ford wrote C S Lewis was a man of his time and socioeconomic class Like many English men of this era Lewis was unconsciously but regrettably unsympathetic to things and people Middle Eastern Thus he sometimes engages in exaggerated stereotyping in contrasting things Narnian and things Calormene He intends this in a broadly comic way almost vaudevillian But in our post September world he would I am sure want to reconsider this insensitivity Outspoken atheist critic and novelist Philip Pullman has called the Chronicles of Narnia blatantly racist and in an interview with The Observer criticised the film adaptation of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by saying the books contained a peevish blend of racist misogynistic and reactionary prejudice br Calormenes live south of a desert wear turbans and pointed shoes their noblemen are called Tarkaans similar to the medieval Central Asian title tarkhan they are armed with scimitars and their money is called crescents br Of Lewis Kyrie O Connor writes In his time people thought it was amusing to make fun of other cultures We don t Read the stories ask questions and remember that the person who wrote this story was altogether too human Claims of racism can be seen as countered by Lewis s positive portrayal of two Calormenes and the lack of racism shown to them by Narnian nobility Lewis writes in The Last Battle that those who worship Tash and who are virtuous are in fact worshipping Aslan and those who are immoral and who worship Aslan are in fact worshipping Tash br br I and Tash are of such different kinds that no service which is vile can be done to me and none which is not vile can be done to him br br br In foreign languages br In the Russian translation of the Narnia books Calormen is known as Tarkhistan as a reference to the Tarkaan nobles and its Turkish and Persian cultural influences br br
