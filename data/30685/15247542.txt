title: Atheism
id: 15247542
Atheism in the broadest sense is an absence of belief in the existence of deities Less broadly atheism is a rejection of the belief that any deities exist In an even narrower sense atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities Atheism is contrasted with theism which in its most general form is the belief that at least one deity exists br Historically evidence of atheistic viewpoints can be traced back to classical antiquity and early Indian philosophy In the Western world atheism declined as Christianity gained prominence The th century and the Age of Enlightenment marked the resurgence of atheistic thought in Europe Atheism achieved a significant position in the th century with legislation protecting freedom of thought Broad estimates of those who have an absence of belief in a god range from million to billion people worldwide br Atheist organizations have defended the autonomy of science secular ethics and secularism Arguments for atheism range from philosophical to social and historical approaches Rationales for not believing in deities include the lack of evidence the problem of evil the argument from inconsistent revelations the rejection of concepts that cannot be falsified and the argument from nonbelief br Nonbelievers contend that atheism is a more parsimonious position than theism and that everyone is born without beliefs in deities therefore they argue that the burden of proof lies not on the atheist to disprove the existence of gods but on the theist to provide a rationale for theism br br br Definition br Writers disagree on how best to define and classify atheism contesting what supernatural entities are considered gods whether atheism is a philosophical position or merely the absence of one and whether it requires a conscious explicit rejection however the norm is to define atheism in terms of an explicit stance against theism Atheism has been regarded as compatible with agnosticism but has also been contrasted with it br br br Implicit vs explicit br br Some of the ambiguity involved in defining atheism arises from the definitions of words like deity and god The variety of wildly different conceptions of God and deities lead to differing ideas regarding atheism s applicability The ancient Romans accused Christians of being atheists for not worshiping the pagan deities Gradually this view fell into disfavor as theism came to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity With respect to the range of phenomena being rejected atheism may counter anything from the existence of a deity to the existence of any spiritual supernatural or transcendental concepts br Definitions of atheism also vary in the degree of consideration a person must put to the idea of gods to be considered an atheist Atheism has been defined as the absence of belief that any deities exist This broad definition would include newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas As far back as Baron d Holbach said that All children are born Atheists they have no idea of God Similarly George H Smith suggested that The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved but who is still unaware of those issues The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist br Implicit atheism is the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it and explicit atheism is the conscious rejection of belief It is usual to define atheism in terms of an explicit stance against theism For the purposes of his paper on philosophical atheism Ernest Nagel contested including the mere absence of theistic belief as a type of atheism Graham Oppy classifies as innocents those who never considered the question because they lack any understanding of what a god is for example one month old babies br br br Positive vs negative br br Philosophers such as Antony Flew and Michael Martin have contrasted positive strong hard atheism with negative weak soft atheism Positive atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist Negative atheism includes all other forms of non theism According to this categorization anyone who is not a theist is either a negative or a positive atheist Michael Martin for example asserts that agnosticism entails negative atheism Agnostic atheism encompasses both atheism and agnosticism However many agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism According to atheists arguments unproven religious propositions deserve as much disbelief as all other unproven propositions Atheist criticism of agnosticism says that the unprovability of a god s existence does not imply an equal probability of either possibility Australian philosopher J J C Smart argues that sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself even passionately as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalized philosophical skepticism which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic Consequently some atheist authors such as Richard Dawkins prefer distinguishing theist agnostic and atheist positions along a spectrum of theistic probability the likelihood that each assigns to the statement God exists br Before the th century the existence of God was so accepted in the Western world that even the possibility of true atheism was questioned This is called theistic innatism the notion that all people believe in God from birth within this view was the connotation that atheists are in denial Some atheists have challenged the need for the term atheism In his book Letter to a Christian Nation Sam Harris wrote br br In fact atheism is a term that should not even exist No one ever needs to identify himself as a non astrologer or a non alchemist We do not have words for people who doubt that Elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and their cattle Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs br br br Etymology br In early ancient Greek the adjective theos from the privative god meant godless It was first used as a term of censure roughly meaning ungodly or impious In the th century BCE the word began to indicate more deliberate and active godlessness in the sense of severing relations with the gods or denying the gods The term aseb s then came to be applied against those who impiously denied or disrespected the local gods even if they believed in other gods Modern translations of classical texts sometimes render theos as atheistic As an abstract noun there was also atheot s atheism Cicero transliterated the Greek word into the Latin theos The term found frequent use in the debate between early Christians and Hellenists with each side attributing it in the pejorative sense to the other br The term atheist from the French ath e in the sense of one who denies the existence of God or gods predates atheism in English being first found as early as and again in Atheist as a label of practical godlessness was used at least as early as The term atheism was derived from the French ath isme and appears in English about br Atheism was first used to describe a self avowed belief in late th century Europe specifically denoting disbelief in the monotheistic Abrahamic god In the th century globalization contributed to the expansion of the term to refer to disbelief in all deities though it remains common in Western society to describe atheism as disbelief in God br br br Arguments br br br Epistemological arguments br Skepticism based on the ideas of David Hume asserts that certainty about anything is impossible so one can never know for sure whether or not a god exists Hume however held that such unobservable metaphysical concepts should be rejected as sophistry and illusion br Michael Martin argues that atheism is a justified and rational true belief but offers no extended epistemological justification because current theories are in a state of controversy Martin instead argues for mid level principles of justification that are in accord with our ordinary and scientific rational practice br Other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or ontological assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as God and statements such as God is all powerful Theological noncognitivism holds that the statement God exists does not express a proposition but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism Philosophers A J Ayer and Theodore M Drange reject both categories stating that both camps accept God exists as a proposition they instead place noncognitivism in its own category br br br Ontological arguments br br Most atheists lean toward ontological monism the belief that there is only one kind of fundamental substance The philosophical materialism is a view that matter is the fundamental substance in nature This omits the possibility of a non material divine being According to physicalism only physical entities exist Philosophies opposed to the materialism or physicalism include idealism dualism and other forms of monism Naturalism is also used to describe the view that everything that exists is fundamentally natural and that there are no supernatural phenomena According to naturalist view science can explain the world with physical laws and through natural phenomena Philosopher Graham Oppy references a PhilPapers survey that says of philosophers in academics lean toward physicalism lean toward naturalism br According to Graham Oppy direct arguments for atheism aim at showing theism fails on its own terms while indirect arguments are those inferred from direct arguments in favor of something else that is inconsistent with theism For example Oppy says arguing for naturalism is an argument for atheism since naturalism and theism cannot both be true Fiona Ellis describes the expansive naturalism of John McDowell James Griffin and David Wiggins while also asserting there are things in human experience which cannot be explained in such terms such as the concept of value leaving room for theism Christopher C Knight asserts a theistic naturalism Nevertheless Oppy argues that a strong naturalism favors atheism though he finds the best direct arguments against theism to be the evidential problem of evil and arguments concerning the contradictory nature of God were one to exist br br br Logical arguments br br Some atheists hold the view that the various conceptions of gods such as the personal god of Christianity are ascribed logically inconsistent qualities Such atheists present deductive arguments against the existence of God which assert the incompatibility between certain traits such as perfection creator status immutability omniscience omnipresence omnipotence omnibenevolence transcendence personhood a personal being non physicality justice and mercy br Theodicean atheists believe that the world as they experience it cannot be reconciled with the qualities commonly ascribed to God and gods by theologians They argue that an omniscient omnipotent and omnibenevolent God is not compatible with a world where there is evil and suffering and where divine love is hidden from many people br Epicurus is credited with first expounding the problem of evil David Hume in his Dialogues concerning Natural Religion cited Epicurus in stating the argument as a series of questions Is God willing to prevent evil but not able Then he is impotent Is he able but not willing Then he is malevolent Is he both able and willing Then whence cometh evil Is he neither able nor willing Then why call him God Similar arguments have been made in Buddhist philosophy Vasubandhu th th century outlined numerous Buddhist arguments against God br br br Reductionary accounts of religion br br Philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach br and psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud have argued that God and other religious beliefs are human inventions created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels influenced by the work of Feuerbach argued that belief in God and religion are social functions used by those in power to oppress the working class According to Mikhail Bakunin the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice it is the most decisive negation of human liberty and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind in theory and practice He reversed Voltaire s aphorism that if God did not exist it would be necessary to invent him writing instead that if God really existed it would be necessary to abolish him br br br Atheism and ethics br br br Secular ethics br br Joseph Baker and Buster Smith assert that one of the common themes of atheism is that most atheists typically construe atheism as more moral than religion One of the most common criticisms of atheism has been to the contrary that denying the existence of a god either leads to moral relativism and leaves one with no moral or ethical foundation or renders life meaningless and miserable Blaise Pascal argued this view in his Pens es There is also a position claiming that atheists are quick to believe in God in times of crisis that atheists make deathbed conversions or that there are no atheists in foxholes There have however been examples to the contrary among them examples of literal atheists in foxholes There exist normative ethical systems that do not require principles and rules to be given by a deity br br According to Plato s Euthyphro dilemma the role of the gods in determining right from wrong is either unnecessary or arbitrary The argument that morality must be derived from God and cannot exist without a wise creator has been a persistent feature of political if not so much philosophical debate Moral precepts such as murder is wrong are seen as divine laws requiring a divine lawmaker and judge However many atheists argue that treating morality legalistically involves a false analogy and that morality does not depend on a lawmaker in the same way that laws do br Philosophers Susan Neiman and Julian Baggini among others assert that behaving ethically only because of a divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves to be able to discern for example that thou shalt steal is immoral even if one s religion instructs it and that atheists therefore have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations br Sociologist Phil Zuckerman analyzed previous social science research on secularity and non belief and concluded that societal well being is positively correlated with irreligion He found that there are much lower concentrations of atheism and secularity in poorer less developed nations particularly in Africa and South America than in the richer industrialized democracies br His findings relating specifically to atheism in the US were that compared to religious people in the US atheists and secular people are less nationalistic prejudiced antisemitic racist dogmatic ethnocentric closed minded and authoritarian and in US states with the highest percentages of atheists the murder rate is lower than average In the most religious states the murder rate is higher than average br br br Criticism of religion br br Some prominent atheists most recently Christopher Hitchens Daniel Dennett Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins and following such thinkers as Bertrand Russell Robert G Ingersoll Voltaire and novelist Jos Saramago have criticized religions citing harmful aspects of religious practices and doctrines br The th century German political theorist and sociologist Karl Marx called religion the sigh of the oppressed creature the heart of a heartless world and the soul of soulless conditions It is the opium of the people He goes on to say The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions The criticism of religion is therefore in embryo the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo br Sam Harris criticizes Western religion s reliance on divine authority as lending itself to authoritarianism and dogmatism Multiple studies have discovered there to be a correlation between religious fundamentalism and extrinsic religion when religion is held because it serves ulterior interests and authoritarianism dogmatism and prejudice br These arguments combined with historical events that are argued to demonstrate the dangers of religion such as the Crusades inquisitions witch trials and terrorist attacks have been used in response to claims of beneficial effects of belief in religion br Believers counter argue that some regimes that espouse atheism such as the Soviet Union have also been guilty of mass murder In response to those claims atheists such as Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins have stated that Stalin s atrocities were influenced not by atheism but by dogmatic ideology and that while Stalin and Mao happened to be atheists they did not do their deeds in the name of atheism br br br Atheism religions and spirituality br br People who self identify as atheists are often assumed to be irreligious but some sects within major religions reject the existence of a personal creator deity It has been said that atheism is not mutually exclusive with respect to some religious and spiritual belief systems including modern Neopagan movements In recent years certain religious denominations have accumulated a number of openly atheistic followers such as atheistic or humanistic Judaism and Christian atheists Atheism is accepted as a valid philosophical position within some varieties of Hinduism Jainism and Buddhism br br br History br br br Early Indian religions br br Ideas that would be recognized today as atheistic are documented from the Vedic period and the classical antiquity Atheistic schools are found in early Indian thought and have existed from the times of the historical Vedic religion Among the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy Samkhya the oldest philosophical school of thought does not accept God and the early Mimamsa also rejected the notion of God br The thoroughly materialistic and anti theistic philosophical Ch rv ka or Lok yata school that originated in India around the th century BCE is probably the most explicitly atheistic school of philosophy in India similar to the Greek Cyrenaic school This branch of Indian philosophy is classified as heterodox due to its rejection of the authority of Vedas and hence is not considered part of the six orthodox schools of Indian philosophy It is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement in ancient India br Satischandra Chatterjee and Dhirendramohan Datta explain in An Introduction to Indian Philosophy that our understanding of Ch rv ka philosophy is fragmentary based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools Though materialism in some form or other has always been present in India and occasional references are found in the Vedas the Buddhistic literature the Epics as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism nor any organized school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess But almost every work of the other schools states for refutation the materialistic views Our knowledge of Indian materialism is chiefly based on these Other Indian philosophies generally regarded as atheistic include Classical Samkhya and Purva Mimamsa The rejection of a personal creator God is also seen in Jainism and Buddhism in India br br br Classical antiquity br br Western atheism has its roots in pre Socratic Greek philosophy but atheism in the modern sense was extremely rare in ancient Greece Pre Socratic Atomists such as Democritus attempted to explain the world in a purely materialistic way and interpreted religion as a human reaction to natural phenomena but did not explicitly deny the gods existence br Anaxagoras whom Irenaeus calls the atheist was accused of impiety and condemned for stating that the sun is a type of incandescent stone an affirmation with which he tried to deny the divinity of the celestial bodies In the late fifth century BCE the Greek lyric poet Diagoras of Melos was sentenced to death in Athens under the charge of being a godless person after he made fun of the Eleusinian Mysteries but he fled the city to escape punishment In post classical antiquity philosophers such as Cicero and Sextus Empiricus described Diagoras as an atheist who categorically denied the existence of the gods but in modern scholarship Marek Winiarczyk has defended the view that Diagoras was not an atheist in the modern sense in a view that has proved influential On the other hand the verdict has been challenged by Tim Whitmarsh who argues that Diagoras rejected the gods on the basis of the problem of evil and this argument was in turn alluded to in Euripides fragmentary play Bellerophon A fragment from a lost Attic drama that featured Sisyphus which has been attributed to both Critias and Euripides claims that a clever man invented the fear of the gods in order to frighten people into behaving morally br br Does then anyone say there are gods in heaven There are not there are not if a man is willing not to give foolish credence to the ancient story Consider for yourselves don t form an opinion on the basis of my words br Protagoras has sometimes been taken to be an atheist but rather espoused agnostic views commenting that Concerning the gods I am unable to discover whether they exist or not or what they are like in form for there are many hindrances to knowledge the obscurity of the subject and the brevity of human life The Athenian public associated Socrates c BCE with the trends in pre Socratic philosophy towards naturalistic inquiry and the rejection of divine explanations for phenomena Aristophanes comic play The Clouds performed BCE portrays Socrates as teaching his students that the traditional Greek deities do not exist Socrates was later tried and executed under the charge of not believing in the gods of the state and instead worshipping foreign gods Socrates himself vehemently denied the charges of atheism at his trial From a survey of these th century BCE philosophers David Sedley has concluded that none of them openly defended radical atheism but since Classical sources clearly attest to radical atheist ideas Athens probably had an atheist underground br Religious skepticism continued into the Hellenistic period and from this period the most important Greek thinker in the development of atheism was the philosopher Epicurus c BCE Drawing on the ideas of Democritus and the Atomists he espoused a materialistic philosophy according to which the universe was governed by the laws of chance without the need for divine intervention see scientific determinism Although Epicurus still maintained that the gods existed he believed that they were uninterested in human affairs The aim of the Epicureans was to attain ataraxia peace of mind and one important way of doing this was by exposing fear of divine wrath as irrational The Epicureans also denied the existence of an afterlife and the need to fear divine punishment after death br Euhemerus c BCE published his view that the gods were only the deified rulers and founders of the past Although not strictly an atheist Euhemerus was later criticized by Plutarch for having spread atheism over the whole inhabited earth by obliterating the gods In the rd century BCE the Hellenistic philosophers Theodorus Cyrenaicus and Strato of Lampsacus were also reputed to deny the existence of the gods The Pyrrhonist philosopher Sextus Empiricus c CE compiled a large number of ancient arguments against the existence of gods recommending that one should suspend judgment regarding the matter His relatively large volume of surviving works had a lasting influence on later philosophers br The meaning of atheist changed over the course of classical antiquity Early Christians were widely reviled as atheists because they did not believe in the existence of the Graeco Roman deities During the Roman Empire Christians were executed for their rejection of the Roman gods in general and the Imperial cult of ancient Rome in particular There was however a heavy struggle between Christians and pagans in which each group accused the other of atheism for not practicing the religion which they considered correct When Christianity became the state religion of Rome under Theodosius I in heresy became a punishable offense br br br Early Middle Ages to the Renaissance br During the Early Middle Ages the Islamic world experienced a Golden Age Along with advances in science and philosophy Arab and Persian lands produced rationalists who were skeptical about revealed religion such as Muhammad al Warraq fl th century Ibn al Rawandi and Abu Bakr al Razi c as well as outspoken atheists such as al Ma arri Al Ma arri wrote and taught that religion itself was a fable invented by the ancients and that humans were of two sorts those with brains but no religion and those with religion but no brains Despite the fact that these authors were relatively prolific writers little of their work survives mainly being preserved through quotations and excerpts in later works by Muslim apologists attempting to refute them br br In Europe the espousal of atheistic views was rare during the Early Middle Ages and Middle Ages see Medieval Inquisition There were however movements within this period that furthered heterodox conceptions of the Christian god including differing views of the nature transcendence and knowability of God William of Ockham inspired anti metaphysical tendencies with his nominalist limitation of human knowledge to singular objects and asserted that the divine essence could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect Sects deemed heretical such as the Waldensians were also accused of being atheistic The resulting division between faith and reason influenced later radical and reformist theologians br The Renaissance did much to expand the scope of free thought and skeptical inquiry Individuals such as Leonardo da Vinci sought experimentation as a means of explanation and opposed arguments from religious authority Other critics of religion and the Church during this time included Niccol Machiavelli Bonaventure des P riers Michel de Montaigne and Fran ois Rabelais br br br Early modern period br Historian Geoffrey Blainey wrote that the Reformation had paved the way for atheists by attacking the authority of the Catholic Church which in turn quietly inspired other thinkers to attack the authority of the new Protestant churches Deism gained influence in France Prussia and England In French scholar Etienne Dolet was executed upon accusation of being an atheist The philosopher Baruch Spinoza was probably the first well known semi atheist to announce himself in a Christian land in the modern era according to Blainey Spinoza believed that natural laws explained the workings of the universe In he published his Short Treatise on God br Criticism of Christianity became increasingly frequent in the th and th centuries especially in France and England Some Protestant thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes espoused a materialist philosophy and skepticism toward supernatural occurrences By the late th century deism came to be openly espoused by intellectuals The first known explicit atheist was the German critic of religion Matthias Knutzen in his three writings of He was followed by two other explicit atheist writers the Polish ex Jesuit philosopher Kazimierz yszczy ski who most likely authored the world s first treatise on the non existence of God and in the s by the French priest Jean Meslier br br In the course of the th century other openly atheistic thinkers followed such as Baron d Holbach Jacques Andr Naigeon and other French materialists Baron d Holbach was a prominent figure in the French Enlightenment who is best known for his atheism and for his voluminous writings against religion the most famous of them being The System of Nature but also Christianity Unveiled The source of man s unhappiness is his ignorance of Nature The pertinacity with which he clings to blind opinions imbibed in his infancy which interweave themselves with his existence the consequent prejudice that warps his mind that prevents its expansion that renders him the slave of fiction appears to doom him to continual error br Although Voltaire is widely considered to have strongly contributed to atheistic thinking during the Revolution he also considered fear of God to have discouraged further disorder having said If God did not exist it would be necessary to invent him The philosopher David Hume developed a skeptical epistemology grounded in empiricism and Immanuel Kant s philosophy has strongly questioned the very possibility of metaphysical knowledge Both philosophers undermined the metaphysical basis of natural theology and criticized classical arguments for the existence of God br One goal of the French Revolution was a restructuring and subordination of the clergy with respect to the state through the Civil Constitution of the Clergy Attempts to enforce it led to anti clerical violence and the expulsion of many clerics from France lasting until the Thermidorian Reaction The radical Jacobins seized power in ushering in the Reign of Terror The Jacobins were deists and introduced the Cult of the Supreme Being as a new French state religion br In the latter half of the th century atheism rose to prominence under the influence of rationalistic and freethinking philosophers German philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach considered God to be a human invention and religious activities to be wish fulfillment He influenced philosophers such as Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche who denied the existence of deities and were critical of religion In George Holyoake was the last person imprisoned in Great Britain due to atheist beliefs Stephen Law notes that he may have also been the first imprisoned on such a charge Law states that Holyoake first coined the term secularism br br br th century br br Atheism advanced in many societies in the th century Atheistic thought found recognition in a wide variety of other broader philosophies such as Marxism logical positivism existentialism humanism and feminism and the general scientific movement br Proponents of naturalism such as Bertrand Russell and John Dewey emphatically rejected belief in God Analytical philosophers such as J N Findlay and J J C Smart argued against the existence of God br State atheism emerged in Eastern Europe and Asia particularly in the Soviet Union under Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin and in Communist China under Mao Zedong Atheist and anti religious policies in the Soviet Union included numerous legislative acts the outlawing of religious instruction in the schools and the emergence of the League of Militant Atheists Stalin softened his opposition to the Orthodox church in order to improve public acceptance of his regime during the second world war br In Time magazine asked Is God Dead in response to the Death of God theological movement citing the estimation that nearly half of all people in the world lived under an anti religious power and millions more in Africa Asia and South America seemed to lack knowledge of the Christian view of theology br br Leaders like Periyar E V Ramasamy a prominent atheist leader of India fought against Hinduism and Brahmins for discriminating and dividing people in the name of caste and religion In the United States atheist Vashti McCollum was the plaintiff in a Supreme Court case that struck down religious education in US public schools Madalyn Murray O Hair was one of the most influential American atheists she brought forth the Supreme Court case Murray v Curlett which banned compulsory prayer in public schools The Freedom From Religion Foundation was co founded by Anne Nicol Gaylor and her daughter Annie Laurie Gaylor in in the United States It promotes the separation of church and state br br br st century br br New Atheism is a movement among some early st century atheist writers who have advocated the view that religion should not be tolerated but should be countered criticized and exposed by rational argument wherever its influence arises The movement is commonly associated with Sam Harris Daniel Dennett Richard Dawkins Christopher Hitchens and Victor J Stenger The religiously motivated terrorist events of and the partially successful attempts to change the American science curriculum to include creationist ideas together with support for those ideas from the religious right have been cited by new atheists as evidence of a need to move toward a more secular society However critics have described the movement as secular fundamentalism br br br Demographics br br It is difficult to quantify the number of atheists in the world Respondents to religious belief polls may define atheism differently or draw different distinctions between atheism non religious beliefs and non theistic religious and spiritual beliefs A survey published in Encyclop dia Britannica found that the non religious made up about of the world s population and atheists about This figure did not include those who follow atheistic religions such as some Buddhists The average annual change for atheism from to was Scholars have indicated that global atheism may be in decline as a percentage of the global population due to irreligious countries having the lowest birth rates in the world and religious countries generally having higher birth rates br According to global Win Gallup International studies of respondents were convinced atheists in were convinced atheists in and in were convinced atheists As of the top surveyed countries with people who viewed themselves as convinced atheists were China Japan the Czech Republic France South Korea Germany Netherlands Austria Iceland Australia and Ireland A study by the NORC found that East Germany had the highest percentage of atheists while Czech Republic had the second highest amount The number of atheists per country is strongly correlated with the level of security for both the individual and society with some exceptions br br br Europe br br According to the Eurobarometer Poll the percentage of those polled who agreed with the statement you don t believe there is any sort of spirit God or life force varied from a high percentage in France Czech Republic Sweden Netherlands and Estonia medium high percentage in Germany Belgium UK to very low in Poland Greece Cyprus Malta and Romania with the European Union as a whole at In a Eurobarometer poll on discrimination in the European Union of those polled considered themselves non believers agnostics and considered themselves atheists br According to a Pew Research Center survey in about of Europeans are religiously unaffiliated including agnostics and atheists According to the same survey the religiously unaffiliated are the majority of the population only in two European countries Czech Republic and Estonia br br br Asia br There are three countries and one special administrative region of China or regions where the religiously unaffiliated make up a majority of the population North Korea Japan Hong Kong and China br br br Australasia

br According to the World Values Survey of Americans self identified as atheists in However the same survey showed that of all respondents stated no when asked if they believed in God According to a report by the Pew Research Center of the US adult population identify as atheist up from in and within the religiously unaffiliated or no religion demographic atheists made up According to the General Sociological Survey the number of atheists and agnostics in the US has remained relatively flat in the past years since in only identified as atheist and identified as agnostic and in only identified as atheists and identified as agnostics br According to the American Family Survey were found to be religiously unaffiliated in nothing in particular agnostic atheist According to the Pew Research Center in of the American population does not identify with a religion including atheists and agnostics According to a PRRI survey of the population is unaffiliated Atheists and agnostics combined make up about a quarter of this unaffiliated demographic According to a Pew Research Center study of Americans are religiously unaffiliated br br br Arab world br In recent years the profile of atheism has risen substantially in the Arab world In major cities across the region such as Cairo atheists have been organizing in caf s and social media despite regular crackdowns from authoritarian governments A poll by Gallup International revealed that of Saudis considered themselves to be convinced atheists However very few young people in the Arab world have atheists in their circle of friends or acquaintances According to one study less than did in Morocco Egypt Saudi Arabia or Jordan only to in the United Arab Emirates Bahrain Kuwait and Palestine When asked whether they have seen or heard traces of atheism in their locality community and society only about to responded yes in all the countries surveyed The only exception was the UAE with a percentage of br br br Attitudes toward atheism br br Statistically atheists are held in poor regard across the globe Non atheists seem to implicitly view atheists as prone to exhibit immoral behaviors In addition according to a Pew Research Center publication of French people of Americans and of Indonesians explicitly believe that a person must believe in God to be moral Pew furthermore noted that in a U S poll atheists and Muslims tied for the lowest rating among the major religious demographics on a feeling thermometer Also a study of religious college students found that they were more likely to perceive and interact with atheists negatively after considering their mortality suggesting that these attitudes may be the result of death anxiety br br br Wealth education and reasoning style br br Various studies have reported positive correlations between levels of education wealth and IQ with atheism According to data from Pew Research Center atheists in the United States are more likely to be white compared to the general U S population vs In a study researchers found intelligence to be negatively related to religious belief in Europe and the United States In a sample of countries the correlation between national IQ and disbelief in God was found to be According to evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber atheism blossoms in places where most people feel economically secure particularly in the social democracies of Europe as there is less uncertainty about the future with extensive social safety nets and better health care resulting in a greater quality of life and higher life expectancy By contrast in underdeveloped countries there are far fewer atheists br The relationship between atheism and IQ while statistically significant is not a large one and the reason for the relationship is not well understood One hypothesis is that the negative relationship between IQ and religiosity is mediated by individual differences in nonconformity in many countries religious belief is a conformist choice and there is evidence that more intelligent people are less likely to conform Another theory is that people of higher IQ are more likely to engage in analytical reasoning and that disbelief in religion results from the application of higher level analytical reasoning to the assessment of religious claims br In a study it was shown that compared to religious individuals atheists have higher reasoning capacities and this difference seemed to be unrelated to sociodemographic factors such as age education and country of origin In a study researchers found that atheists score higher on cognitive reflection tests than theists the authors wrote that The fact that atheists score higher agrees with the literature showing that belief is an automatic manifestation of the mind and its default mode Disbelieving seems to require deliberative cognitive ability A study in which new studies were reported and a meta analysis of all previous research on the topic was performed found that self identified atheists scored higher than theists on the cognitive reflection test and there is a negative correlation between religiosity and analytical thinking The authors note that recently it has been argued that analytic thinkers are not actually less religious rather the putative association may be a result of religiosity typically being measured after analytic thinking an order effect however they state Our results indicate that the association between analytical thinking and religious disbelief is not caused by a simple order effect There is good evidence that atheists and agnostics are more reflective than religious believers This analytic atheist effect has also been found among academic philosophers even when controlling for about a dozen potential confounds such as education br Some studies do not detect this correlation between atheism and analytic thinking in all of the countries that they study suggesting that the relationship between analytic thinking and atheism may depend on culture There is also evidence that gender may be involved in what has been termed the analytic atheist effect because men have been found more likely to endorse atheism and men often perform slightly better on tests of analytic thinking when not controlling for variables such as math anxiety the correlation between atheism and analytic reasoning may be partly explained by whatever explains observed gender differences in analytic thinking br br br See also br br Antireligion br Apatheism br A Rough History of Disbelief br Atheist existentialism br
