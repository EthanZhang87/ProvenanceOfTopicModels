Alternate history also referred to as alternative history allohistory althist or simply AH is a subgenre of speculative fiction in which one or more historical events have occurred but are resolved differently than in actual history As conjecture based upon historical fact alternate history stories propose What if scenarios about crucial events in human history and present outcomes very different from the historical record Some alternate histories are considered a subgenre of science fiction or historical fiction br Since the s as a subgenre of science fiction some alternative history stories have featured the tropes of time travel between histories the psychic awareness of the existence of an alternative universe by the inhabitants of a given universe and time travel that divides history into various timestreams br br Often described as a subgenre of science fiction alternative history is a genre of fiction wherein the author speculates upon how the course of history might have been altered if a particular historical event had an outcome different from the real life outcome An alternate history requires three conditions i A point of divergence from the historical record before the time in which the author is writing ii A change that would alter known history and iii An examination of the ramifications of that alteration to history Occasionally some types of genre fiction are misidentified as alternative history specifically science fiction stories set in a time that was the future for the writer but now is the past for the reader such as the novels A Space Odyssey by Arthur C Clarke by George Orwell and the movie because the authors did not alter the real history of the past when they wrote the stories br Similar to the genre of alternative history there is also the genre of secret history which can be either fictional or non fictional which documents events that might have occurred in history but which had no effect upon the recorded historical outcome Alternative history also is thematically related to but distinct from counterfactual history which is a form of historiography that explores historical events in an extrapolated timeline in which key historical events either did not occur or had an outcome different from the historical record in order to understand what did happen br br The earliest example of alternate or counterfactual history is found in Livy s Ab Urbe Condita Libri book IX sections Livy contemplated an alternative th century BC in which Alexander the Great had survived to attack Europe as he had planned asking What would have been the results for Rome if she had been engaged in a war with Alexander Livy concluded that the Romans would likely have defeated Alexander An even earlier possibility is Herodotus s Histories which contains speculative material br br Another example of counterfactual history was posited by cardinal and Doctor of the Church Peter Damian in the th century In his famous work De Divina Omnipotentia a long letter in which he discusses God s omnipotence he treats questions related to the limits of divine power including the question of whether God can change the past for example bringing about that Rome was never founded I see I must respond finally to what many people on the basis of your holiness s own judgment raise as an objection on the topic of this dispute For they say If as you assert God is omnipotent in all things can he manage this that things that have been made were not made He can certainly destroy all things that have been made so that they do not exist now But it cannot be seen how he can bring it about that things that have been made were not made To be sure it can come about that from now on and hereafter Rome does not exist for it can be destroyed But no opinion can grasp how it can come about that it was not founded long ago One early work of fiction detailing an alternate history is Joanot Martorell s epic romance Tirant lo Blanch which was written when the fall of Constantinople to the Turks was still a recent and traumatic memory for Christian Europe It tells the story of the knight Tirant the White from Brittany who travels to the embattled remnants of the Byzantine Empire He becomes a Megaduke and commander of its armies and manages to fight off the invading Ottoman armies of Mehmet II He saves the city from Islamic conquest and even chases the Turks deeper into lands they had previously conquered br br One of the earliest works of alternate history published in large quantities for the reception of a large audience may be Louis Geoffroy s Histoire de la Monarchie universelle Napol on et la conqu te du monde History of the Universal Monarchy Napoleon and the Conquest of the World which imagines Napoleon s First French Empire emerging victorious in the French invasion of Russia in and in an invasion of England in later unifying the world under Bonaparte s rule br The Book of Mormon published is described as an alternative history by Richard Lyman Bushman a biographer of Joseph Smith Smith claimed to have translated the document from golden plates which told the story of a Jewish group who migrated from Israel to the Americas and inhabited the region from about B C to A D becoming the ancestors of Native Americans In the biography Joseph Smith Rough Stone Rolling Bushman wrote that the Book of Mormon turned American history upside down and works on the premise that a history a book can reconstitute a nation It assumes that by giving a nation an alternative history alternative values can be made to grow br In the English language the first known complete alternate history may be Nathaniel Hawthorne s short story P s Correspondence published in It recounts the tale of a man who is considered a madman due to his perceptions of a different a reality in which long dead famous people such as the poets Robert Burns Lord Byron Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats the actor Edmund Kean the British politician George Canning and Napoleon Bonaparte are still alive br The first novel length alternate history in English would seem to be Castello Holford s Aristopia While not as nationalistic as Louis Geoffroy s Napol on et la conqu te du monde Aristopia is another attempt to portray a Utopian society In Aristopia the earliest settlers in Virginia discover a reef made of solid gold and are able to build a Utopian society in North America br br In H G Wells published A Modern Utopia As explicitly noted in the book itself Wells s main aim in writing it was to set out his social and political ideas the plot serving mainly as a vehicle to expound them This book introduced the idea of a person being transported from a point in our familiar world to the precise geographical equivalent point in an alternate world in which history had gone differently The protagonists undergo various adventures in the alternate world and then are finally transported back to our world again to the precise geographical equivalent point Since then that has become a staple of the alternate history genre br A number of alternate history stories and novels appeared in the late th and early th centuries see for example Joseph Edgar Chamberlin s The Ifs of History and Charles Petrie s If A Jacobite Fantasy In British historian Sir John Squire collected a series of essays from some of the leading historians of the period for his anthology If It Had Happened Otherwise In that work scholars from major universities as well as important non academic authors turned their attention to such questions as If the Moors in Spain Had Won and If Louis XVI Had Had an Atom of Firmness The essays range from serious scholarly efforts to Hendrik Willem van Loon s fanciful and satiric portrayal of an independent th century New Amsterdam a Dutch city state on the island of Manhattan Among the authors included were Hilaire Belloc Andr Maurois and Winston Churchill br One of the entries in Squire s volume was Churchill s If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of Gettysburg written from the viewpoint of a historian in a world in which the Confederacy had won the American Civil War The entry considers what would have happened if the North had been victorious in other words a character from an alternate world imagines a world more like the real one we live in although it is not identical in every detail Speculative work that narrates from the point of view of an alternate history is variously known as recursive alternate history a double blind what if or an alternate alternate history Churchill s essay was one of the influences behind Ward Moore s alternate history novel Bring the Jubilee in which General Robert E Lee won the Battle of Gettysburg and paved the way for the eventual victory of the Confederacy in the American Civil War named the War of Southron Independence in this timeline The protagonist the autodidact Hodgins Backmaker travels back to the aforementioned battle and inadvertently changes history which results in the emergence of our own timeline and the consequent victory of the Union instead br The American humorist author James Thurber parodied alternate history stories about the American Civil War in his story If Grant Had Been Drinking at Appomattox which he accompanied with this very brief introduction Scribner s magazine is publishing a series of three articles If Booth Had Missed Lincoln If Lee Had Won the Battle of Gettysburg and If Napoleon Had Escaped to America This is the fourth br Another example of alternate history from this period and arguably the first that explicitly posited cross time travel from one universe to another as anything more than a visionary experience is H G Wells Men Like Gods in which the London based journalist Mr Barnstable along with two cars and their passengers is mysteriously teleported into another world which the Earthlings call Utopia Being far more advanced than Earth Utopia is some years ahead of humanity in its development Wells describes a multiverse of alternative worlds complete with the paratime travel machines that would later become popular with American pulp writers However since his hero experiences only a single alternate world the story is not very different from conventional alternate history br In the s alternate history moved into a new arena The December issue of Astounding published Nat Schachner s Ancestral Voices which was quickly followed by Murray Leinster s Sidewise in Time While earlier alternate histories examined reasonably straightforward divergences Leinster attempted something completely different In his World gone mad pieces of Earth traded places with their analogs from different timelines The story follows Professor Minott and his students from a fictitious Robinson College as they wander through analogues of worlds that followed a different history Sidewise in Time has been described as the point at which the alternate history narrative first enters science fiction as a plot device and is the story for which the Sidewise Award for Alternate History is named br br A somewhat similar approach was taken by Robert A Heinlein in his novelette Elsewhen in which a professor trains his mind to move his body across timelines He then hypnotizes his students so that they can explore more of them Eventually each settles into the reality that is most suitable for him or her Some of the worlds they visit are mundane some are very odd and others follow science fiction or fantasy conventions br World War II produced alternate history for propaganda both British and American authors wrote works depicting Nazi invasions of their respective countries as cautionary tales br br The period around World War II also saw the publication of the time travel novel Lest Darkness Fall by L Sprague de Camp in which an American academic travels to Italy at the time of the Byzantine invasion of the Ostrogoths De Camp s time traveler Martin Padway is depicted as making permanent historical changes and implicitly forming a new time branch thereby making the work an alternate history br In William Tenn s short story Brooklyn Project a tyrannical US Government brushes aside the warnings of scientists about the dangers of time travel and goes on with a planned experiment with the result that minor changes to the prehistoric past cause Humanity to never have existed its place taken by tentacled underwater intelligent creatures who also have a tyrannical government which also insists on experimenting with time travel br Time travel as the cause of a point of divergence POD which can denote either the bifurcation of a historical timeline or a simple replacement of the future that existed before the time travelling event has continued to be a popular theme In Ward Moore s Bring the Jubilee the protagonist lives in an alternate history in which the Confederacy has won the American Civil War He travels backward through time and brings about a Union victory at the Battle of Gettysburg br When a story s assumptions about the nature of time travel lead to the complete replacement of the visited time s future rather than just the creation of an additional time line the device of a time patrol is often used where guardians move through time to preserve the correct history br A more recent example is Making History by Stephen Fry in which a time machine is used to alter history so that Adolf Hitler was never born That ironically results in a more competent leader of Nazi Germany and results in the country s ascendancy and longevity in the altered timeline br br While many justifications for alternate histories involve a multiverse the many world theory would naturally involve many worlds in fact a continually exploding array of universes In quantum theory new worlds would proliferate with every quantum event and even if the writer uses human decisions every decision that could be made differently would result in a different timeline A writer s fictional multiverse may in fact preclude some decisions as humanly impossible as when in Night Watch Terry Pratchett depicts a character informing Vimes that while anything that can happen has happened nevertheless there is no history whatsoever in which Vimes has ever murdered his wife When the writer explicitly maintains that all possible decisions are made in all possible ways one possible conclusion is that the characters were neither brave nor clever nor skilled but simply lucky enough to happen on the universe in which they did not choose the cowardly route take the stupid action fumble the crucial activity etc few writers focus on this idea although it has been explored in stories such as Larry Niven s story All the Myriad Ways where the reality of all possible universes leads to an epidemic of suicide and crime because people conclude their choices have no moral import br In any case even if it is true that every possible outcome occurs in some world it can still be argued that traits such as bravery and intelligence might still affect the relative frequency of worlds in which better or worse outcomes occurred even if the total number of worlds with each type of outcome is infinite it is still possible to assign a different measure to different infinite sets The physicist David Deutsch a strong advocate of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics has argued along these lines saying that By making good choices doing the right thing we thicken the stack of universes in which versions of us live reasonable lives When you succeed all the copies of you who made the same decision succeed too What you do for the better increases the portion of the multiverse where good things happen This view is perhaps somewhat too abstract to be explored directly in science fiction stories but a few writers have tried such as Greg Egan in his short story The Infinite Assassin where an agent is trying to contain reality scrambling whirlpools that form around users of a certain drug and the agent is constantly trying to maximize the consistency of behavior among his alternate selves attempting to compensate for events and thoughts he experiences he guesses are of low measure relative to those experienced by most of his other selves br Many writers perhaps the majority avoid the discussion entirely In one novel of this type H Beam Piper s Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen a Pennsylvania State Police officer who knows how to make gunpowder is transported from our world to an alternate universe where the recipe for gunpowder is a tightly held secret and saves a country that is about to be conquered by its neighbors The paratime patrol members are warned against going into the timelines immediately surrounding it where the country will be overrun but the book never depicts the slaughter of the innocent thus entailed remaining solely in the timeline where the country is saved br The cross time theme was further developed in the s by Keith Laumer in the first three volumes of his Imperium sequence which would be completed in Zone Yellow Piper s politically more sophisticated variant was adopted and adapted by Michael Kurland and Jack Chalker in the s Chalker s G O D Inc trilogy featuring paratime detectives Sam and Brandy Horowitz marks the first attempt at merging the paratime thriller with the police procedural Kurland s Perchance the first volume of the never completed Chronicles of Elsewhen presents a multiverse of secretive cross time societies that utilize a variety of means for cross time travel ranging from high tech capsules to mutant powers Harry Turtledove has launched the Crosstime Traffic series for teenagers featuring a variant of H Beam Piper s paratime trading empire br br The concept of a cross time version of a world war involving rival paratime empires was developed in Fritz Leiber s Change War series starting with the Hugo Award winning The Big Time followed by Richard C Meredith s Timeliner trilogy in the s Michael McCollum s A Greater Infinity and John Barnes Timeline Wars trilogy in the s br Such paratime stories may include speculation that the laws of nature can vary from one universe to the next providing a science fictional explanation or veneer for what is normally fantasy Aaron Allston s Doc Sidhe and Sidhe Devil take place between our world the grim world and an alternate fair world where the Sidhe retreated to Although technology is clearly present in both worlds and the fair world parallels our history about fifty years out of step there is functional magic in the fair world Even with such explanation the more explicitly the alternate world resembles a normal fantasy world the more likely the story is to be labelled fantasy as in Poul Anderson s House Rule and Loser s Night In both science fiction and fantasy whether a given parallel universe is an alternate history may not be clear The writer might allude to a POD only to explain the existence and make no use of the concept or may present the universe without explanation of its existence br br Isaac Asimov s short story What If is about a couple who can explore alternate realities by means of a television like device This idea can also be found in Asimov s novel The End of Eternity in which the Eternals can change the realities of the world without people being aware of it Poul Anderson s Time Patrol stories feature conflicts between forces intent on changing history and the Patrol who work to preserve it One story Delenda Est describes a world in which Carthage triumphed over the Roman Republic The Big Time by Fritz Leiber describes a Change War ranging across all of history br Keith Laumer s Worlds of the Imperium is one of the earliest alternate history novels it was published by Fantastic Stories of the Imagination in in magazine form and reprinted by Ace Books in as one half of an Ace Double Besides our world Laumer describes a world ruled by an Imperial aristocracy formed by the merger of European empires in which the American Revolution never happened and a third world in post war chaos ruled by the protagonist s doppelganger br br Philip K Dick s novel The Man in the High Castle is an alternate history in which Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan won World War II This book contains an example of alternate alternate history in that one of its characters authored a book depicting a reality in which the Allies won the war itself divergent from real world history in several aspects The several characters live within a divided United States in which the Empire of Japan takes the Pacific states governing them as a puppet Nazi Germany takes the East Coast of the United States and parts of the Midwest with the remnants of the old United States government as the Neutral Zone a buffer state between the two superpowers The book has inspired an Amazon series of the same name br Vladimir Nabokov s novel Ada or Ardor A Family Chronicle is a story of incest that takes place within an alternate North America settled in part by Czarist Russia and that borrows from Dick s idea of alternate alternate history the world of Nabokov s hero is wracked by rumors of a counter earth that apparently is ours Some critics believe that the references to a counter earth suggest that the world portrayed in Ada is a delusion in the mind of the hero another favorite theme of Dick s novels Strikingly the characters in Ada seem to acknowledge their own world as the copy or negative version calling it Anti Terra while its mythical twin is the real Terra Like history science has followed a divergent path on Anti Terra it boasts all the same technology as our world but all based on water instead of electricity e g when a character in Ada makes a long distance call all the toilets in the house flush at once to provide hydraulic power br Guido Morselli described the defeat of Italy and subsequently France in World War I in his novel Past Conditional Contro passato prossimo wherein the static Alpine front line which divided Italy from Austria during that war collapses when the Germans and the Austrians forsake trench warfare and adopt blitzkrieg twenty years in advance br Kingsley Amis set his novel The Alteration in the th century but major events in the Reformation did not take place and Protestantism is limited to the breakaway Republic of New England Martin Luther was reconciled to the Roman Catholic Church and later became Pope Germanian I br In Nick Hancock and Chris England s book What Didn t Happen Next An Alternative History of Football it is suggested that had Gordon Banks been fit to play in the FIFA World Cup quarter final there would have been no Thatcherism and the post war consensus would have continued indefinitely br Kim Stanley Robinson s novel The Years of Rice and Salt starts at the point of divergence with Timur turning his army away from Europe and the Black Death has killed of Europe s population instead of only a third Robinson explores world history from that point in AD AH to about AD AH Rather than following the great man theory of history focusing on leaders wars and major events Robinson writes more about social history similar to the Annales School of history theory and Marxist historiography focusing on the lives of ordinary people living in their time and place br Philip Roth s novel The Plot Against America looks at an America where Franklin D Roosevelt is defeated in in his bid for a third term as President of the United States and Charles Lindbergh is elected leading to a US that features increasing fascism and anti Semitism br Michael Chabon occasionally an author of speculative fiction contributed to the genre with his novel The Yiddish Policemen s Union which explores a world in which the State of Israel was destroyed in its infancy and many of the world s Jews instead live in a small strip of Alaska set aside by the US government for Jewish settlement The story follows a Jewish detective solving a murder case in the Yiddish speaking semi autonomous city state of Sitka Stylistically Chabon borrows heavily from the noir and detective fiction genres while exploring social issues related to Jewish history and culture Apart from the alternate history of the Jews and Israel Chabon also plays with other common tropes of alternate history fiction in the book Germany actually loses the war even harder than they did in reality getting hit with a nuclear bomb instead of just simply losing a ground war subverting the common what if Germany won WWII trope br br The late s and the s saw a boom in popular fiction versions of alternate history fueled by the emergence of the prolific alternate history author Harry Turtledove as well as the development of the steampunk genre and two series of anthologies the What Might Have Been series edited by Gregory Benford and the Alternate series edited by Mike Resnick This period also saw alternate history works by S M Stirling Kim Stanley Robinson Harry Harrison Howard Waldrop Peter Tieryas and others br In a sixteen part epic comic book series called Captain Confederacy began examining a world where the Confederate States of America won the American Civil War In the series the Captain and others heroes are staged government propaganda events featuring the feats of these superheroes br Since the late s Harry Turtledove has been the most prolific practitioner of alternate history and has been given the title Master of Alternate History by some His books include those of Timeline a k a Southern Victory also known as TL in which while the Confederate States of America won the American Civil War the Union and Imperial Germany defeat the Entente Powers in the two Great War s of the s and s with a Nazi esque Confederate government attempting to exterminate its Black population and the Worldwar series in which aliens invaded Earth during World War II Other stories by Turtledove include A Different Flesh in which America was not colonized from Asia during the last ice age In the Presence of Mine Enemies in which the Nazis won World War II and Ruled Britannia in which the Spanish Armada succeeded in conquering England in the Elizabethan era with William Shakespeare being given the task of writing the play that will motivate the Britons to rise up against their Spanish conquerors He also co authored a book with actor Richard Dreyfuss The Two Georges in which the United Kingdom retained the American colonies with George Washington and King George III making peace He did a two volume series in which the Japanese not only bombed Pearl Harbor but also invaded and occupied the Hawaiian Islands br Perhaps the most incessantly explored theme in popular alternate history focuses on worlds in which the Nazis won World War Two In some versions the Nazis and or Axis Powers win or in others they conquer most of the world but a Fortress America exists under siege while in others there is a Nazi Japanese Cold War comparable to the US Soviet equivalent in our timeline Fatherland by Robert Harris is set in Europe following the Nazi victory The novel Dominion by C J Sansom is similar in concept but is set in England with Churchill the leader of an anti German Resistance and other historic persons in various fictional roles In the Mecha Samurai Empire series Peter Tieryas focuses on the Asian American side of the alternate history exploring an America ruled by the Japanese Empire while integrating elements of Asian pop culture like mechas and videogames br Several writers have posited points of departure for such a world but then have injected time splitters from the future For instance James P Hogan s The Proteus Operation Norman Spinrad wrote The Iron Dream in which is intended to be a science fiction novel written by Adolf Hitler after fleeing from Europe to North America in the s br In Jo Walton s Small Change series the United Kingdom made peace with Hitler before the involvement of the United States in World War II and slowly collapses due to severe economic depression Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and William R Forstchen have written a novel in which the US defeated Japan but not Germany in World War II resulting in a Cold War with Germany rather than the Soviet Union Gingrich and Forstchen neglected to write the promised sequel instead they wrote a trilogy about the American Civil War starting with Gettysburg A Novel of the Civil War in which the Confederates win a victory at the Battle of Gettysburg however after Lincoln responds by bringing Grant and his forces to the eastern theater the Army of Northern Virginia is soon trapped and destroyed in Maryland and the war ends within weeks br While World War II has been a common Point of Divergence in alternate history literature several works have been based on other points of divergence For example Martin Cruz Smith in his first novel posited an independent American Indian nation following the defeat of Custer in The Indians Won Beginning with The Probability Broach in L Neil Smith wrote several novels that postulated the disintegration of the US Federal Government after Albert Gallatin joins the Whiskey Rebellion in and eventually leads to the creation of a libertarian utopia In the novel Poutine and Gin by Steve Rhinelander the point of divergence is the Battle of the Plains of Abraham of the French and Indian War That novel is a mystery set in of that time line br A recent time traveling splitter variant involves entire communities being shifted elsewhere to become the unwitting creators of new time branches These communities are transported from the present or the near future to the past or to another timeline via a natural disaster the action of technologically advanced aliens or a human experiment gone wrong S M Stirling wrote the Island in the Sea of Time trilogy in which Nantucket Island and all its modern inhabitants are transported to Bronze Age times to become the world s first superpower In Eric Flint s series a small town in West Virginia is transported to th century central Europe and drastically changes the course of the Thirty Years War which was then underway John Birmingham s Axis of Time trilogy deals with the culture shock when a United Nations naval task force from finds itself back in helping the Allies against the Empire of Japan and the Germans and doing almost as much harm as good in spite of its advanced weapons The series also explores the cultural impacts of people with ideals interacting with s culture Similarly Robert Charles Wilson s Mysterium depicts a failed US government experiment which transports a small American town into an alternative version of the US run by believers in a form of Christianity known as Gnosticism who are engaged in a bitter war with the Spanish in Mexico the chief scientist at the laboratory where the experiment occurred is described as a Gnostic and references to Christian Gnosticism appear repeatedly in the book br Although not dealing in physical time travel in his alt history novel Marx Returns Jason Barker introduces anachronisms into the life and times of Karl Marx such as when his wife Jenny sings a verse from the Sex Pistols s song Anarchy in the U K or in the games of chess she plays with the Marxes housekeeper Helene Demuth which on one occasion involves a Caro Kann Defence In her review of the novel Nina Power writes of Jenny s utopian desire for an end to time an attitude which according to Power is inspired by her husband s co authored book The German Ideology However in keeping with the novel s anachronisms the latter was not published until By contrast the novel s timeline ends in br In the novel Hydrogen Wars Atomic Sunrise by R M Christianson a small change in post war Japanese history leads to the election of General Douglas MacArthur as President of the United States This minor change ultimately leads to all out atomic war between the major Cold War powers br Through crowdfunding on Kickstarter Alan Jenkins and Gan Golan produced a graphic novel series called depicting a dystopian alternate reality in which the January United States Capitol attack was successful What follows is the burning down of the Capitol building and the hanging of Vice President Mike Pence Under Donald Trump s second term as president a solid gold statue of him is erected and armed thugs patrol the streets of Washington DC suppressing civilian resistance with brutal violence under the banner of the Confederate flag br br Many works of straight fantasy and science fantasy take place in historical settings though with the addition of for example magic or mythological beasts Some present a secret history in which the modern day world no longer believes that these elements ever existed Many ambiguous alternate secret histories are set in Renaissance or pre Renaissance times and may explicitly include a retreat from the world which would explain the current absence of such phenomena Other stories make plan a divergence of some kind br In Poul Anderson s Three Hearts and Three Lions in which the Matter of France is history and the fairy folk are real and powerful The same author s A Midsummer Tempest occurs in a world in which the plays of William Shakespeare called here the Great Historian presented the literal truth in every instance The novel itself takes place in the era of Oliver Cromwell and Charles I Here the English Civil War had a different outcome and the Industrial Revolution has occurred early br Randall Garrett s Lord Darcy series presents a point of divergence a monk systemizes magic rather than science so the use of foxglove to treat heart disease is regarded as superstition Another point of divergence occurs in when Richard the Lionheart survives the Siege of Chaluz and returns to England and makes the Angevin Empire so strong that it survives into the th century br Jonathan Strange Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke takes place in an England where a separate Kingdom ruled by the Raven King and founded on magic existed in Northumbria for over years In Patricia Wrede s Regency fantasies Great Britain has a Royal Society of Wizards br The Tales of Alvin Maker series by Orson Scott Card a parallel to the life of Joseph Smith founder of the Latter Day Saint movement takes place in an alternate America beginning in the early th century Prior to that time a POD occurred England under the rule of Oliver Cromwell had banished makers or anyone else demonstrating knacks an ability to perform seemingly supernatural feats to the North American continent Thus the early American colonists embraced as perfectly ordinary these gifts and counted on them as a part of their daily lives The political division of the continent is considerably altered with two large English colonies bookending a smaller American nation one aligned with England and the other governed by exiled Cavaliers Actual historical figures are seen in a much different light Ben Franklin is revered as the continent s finest maker George Washington was executed after being captured and Tom Jefferson is the first president of Appalachia the result of a compromise between the Continentals and the British Crown br On the other hand when the Old Ones fairies still manifest themselves in England in Keith Roberts s Pavane which takes place in a technologically backward world after a Spanish assassination of Elizabeth I allowed the Spanish Armada to conquer England the possibility that the fairies were real but retreated from modern advances makes the POD possible the fairies really were present all along in a secret history br Again in the English Renaissance fantasy Armor of Light by Melissa Scott and Lisa A Barnett the magic used in the book by Dr John Dee and others actually was practiced in the Renaissance positing a secret history of effective magic makes this an alternate history with a point of departure Sir Philip Sidney survives the Battle of Zutphen in and shortly thereafter saving the life of Christopher Marlowe br When the magical version of our world s history is set in contemporary times the distinction becomes clear between alternate history on the one hand and contemporary fantasy using in effect a form of secret history as when Josepha Sherman s Son of Darkness has an elf living in New York City in disguise on the other In works such as Robert A Heinlein s Magic Incorporated where a construction company can use magic to rig up stands at a sporting event and Poul Anderson s Operation Chaos and its sequel Operation Luna where djinns are serious weapons of war with atomic bombs the use of magic throughout the United States and other modern countries makes it clear that this is not secret history although references in Operation Chaos to degaussing the effects of cold iron make it possible that it is the result of a POD The sequel clarifies this as the result of a collaboration of Einstein and Planck in resulting in the theory of rhea tics Henry Moseley applies this theory to degauss the effects of cold iron and release the goetic forces This results in the suppression of ferromagnetism and the re emergence of magic and magical creatures br Alternate history shades off into other fantasy subgenres when the use of actual though altered history and geography decreases although a culture may still be clearly the original source Barry Hughart s Bridge of Birds and its sequels take place in a fantasy world albeit one clearly based on China and with allusions to actual Chinese history such as the Empress Wu Richard Garfinkle s Celestial Matters incorporates ancient Chinese physics and Greek Aristotelian physics using them as if factual br Alternate history has long been a staple of Japanese speculative fiction with such authors as Futaro Yamada and Ry Hanmura writing novels set in recognizable historical settings with added supernatural or science fiction elements Ry Hanmura s Musubi no Yama Hiroku which recreated years of Japan s history from the perspective of a secret magical family with psychic abilities The novel has since come to be recognized as a masterpiece of Japanese speculative fiction Twelve years later author Hiroshi Aramata wrote the groundbreaking Teito Monogatari which reimagined the history of Tokyo across the th century in a world heavily influenced by the supernatural br br is set on a
