id: 2403435
Ents are a species of sentient beings in J R R Tolkien s fantasy world of Middle earth who closely resemble trees their leader is Treebeard of Fangorn forest Their name is derived from an Old English word for giant br The Ents appear in The Lord of the Rings as ancient shepherds of the forest and allies of the free peoples of Middle earth during the War of the Ring The Ent who figures most prominently in the book is Treebeard who is called the oldest creature in Middle earth At that time there are no young Ents Entings because the Entwives female Ents were lost Akin to Ents are Huorns whom Treebeard describes as a transitional form of trees which become animated or conversely as Ents who grow more treelike over time br Tolkien stated that he was disappointed by Shakespeare s handling of the coming of Great Birnam Wood to High Dunsinane hill he wanted a setting in which the trees would actually go to war Commentators have seen this as wish fulfilment as he disliked the damage being done to the English countryside in his lifetime Scholars have seen his tale of the Ents as a myth mostly without analysing it Corey Olsen interprets the song of the Ents and the Entwives as a myth which warns of the dangers of apathetically isolating oneself in nature whereas the Ents song In the willow meads of Tasarinan is a lament br Inspired by Tolkien and similar traditions animated or anthropomorphic tree creatures appear in a variety of media and works of fantasy br br br Internal history br Treebeard called by Gandalf the oldest living Ent and the oldest living thing that walks in Middle earth is described as being around feet m tall Man like almost Troll like and clad in something that might have been tree bark with seven toes a bushy almost twiggy beard and deep penetrating eyes Ents vary widely in personal traits height heft colouring even the number of toes having come to resemble somewhat the specific types of trees that they shepherded Quickbeam for example guarded rowan trees and bore some resemblance to rowans tall and slender smooth skinned with ruddy lips and grey green hair Some Ents such as Treebeard were like br br beech trees or oaks But there were other kinds Some recalled the chestnut brown skinned Ents with large splayfingered hands and short thick legs Some recalled the ash tall straight grey Ents with many fingered hands and long legs some the fir the tallest Ents and others the birch and the linden br br Ents are somewhat treelike with extraordinarily tough skin they can erode stone rapidly but are vulnerable to fire and axe strokes They are patient and cautious with a long sense of time they considered a three day deliberation hasty br Ents are tall and very strong capable of tearing apart rock and stone when roused Tolkien describes them as tossing great slabs of stone about and ripping down the walls of Isengard like bread crust Treebeard boasted of their strength to Merry and Pippin he said that Ents were much more powerful than Trolls which Morgoth made in the First Age in mockery of Ents as Orcs were of Elves br br br First Age br Tolkien wrote almost nothing of the early history of the Ents After the Dwarves were put to sleep by Eru to await the coming of the Elves the Vala Aul told his wife Yavanna the lover of all things that grow in the earth of the Dwarves She replied They will delve in the earth and the things that grow and live upon the earth they will not heed Many a tree shall feel the bite of their iron without pity She went to Manw and appealed to him to protect the trees and they realized that Ents too were part of the Song of Creation Yavanna then warned Aul Now let thy children beware For there shall walk a power in the forests whose wrath they will arouse at their peril The Ents are called the Shepherds of the Trees Much later when Beren and a force of Green Elves waylay the force of Dwarves returning from the sack of Doriath the Dwarves are routed and scatter into the wood where the Shepherds of the Trees ensure that none escape br Ents did not know how to speak until the Elves taught them Treebeard said that the Elves cured us of dumbness calling that a great gift that could not be forgotten At that time much of Eriador was forested Elrond stated that a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now the Shire to Dunland west of Isengard br br br Entwives br The Entwives began to move farther away from the Ents because they liked to plant and control things while the Ents preferred forests and liked to let things take their natural course The Entwives moved away to what became the Brown Lands across the Great River Anduin although the male Ents still visited them The Entwives interacted with Men and taught them the art of agriculture The gardens of the Entwives were destroyed by Sauron and the Entwives disappeared It was sung by the Elves that one day the Ents and Entwives would find each other Treebeard indeed implored the Hobbits to send word to him if they had news of the Entwives br Tolkien spent much time considering the fate of the Entwives stating in Letters I think that in fact the Entwives have disappeared for good being destroyed with their gardens in the War of the Last Alliance some may have fled east or even have become enslaved br After Aragorn is crowned king he promised Treebeard that the Ents could prosper again and spread to new lands with the threat of Mordor gone and renew their search for the Entwives Treebeard lamented that forests may spread but the Ents would not and he predicted that the few remaining Ents would remain in Fangorn forest and dwindle or become treeish br br br The Last March of the Ents br The Ents angry at Saruman for cutting down their trees convene an Entmoot They decide to march on Saruman s fortress at Isengard the last march of the Ents Led by Treebeard and accompanied by the hobbits Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took the Ents numbered about plus an army of Huorns They destroy Isengard tearing down the wall around it If the Great Sea had risen in wrath and fallen on the hills with storm it could have worked no greater ruin Saruman is trapped in the tower of Orthanc br br br Analysis br br br Etymology br br The word Ent is from the Old English ent or eoten meaning giant Tolkien borrowed the word from a phrase in the Anglo Saxon poems The Ruin and Maxims II or anc enta geweorc cunning work of giants which describes Roman ruins br In Sindarin one of Tolkien s invented Elvish languages the word for Ent is Onod plural Enyd The Sindarin word Onodrim means the Ents as a race br br br Improving on Shakespeare br br Tolkien noted in a letter that he had created Ents in response to his bitter disappointment and disgust from schooldays with the shabby use made in Shakespeare s Macbeth of the coming of Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane hill I longed to devise a setting in which the trees might really march to war The Ents ensured victory at the Battle of Helm s Deep by herding a forest of angry tree like Huorns there to destroy Saruman s army of Orcs br br br Other sources br br Nick Groom suggests some other possible sources besides Shakespeare The Gospel of Mark has the speech by a man cured of blindness I see men as trees walking Mark Algernon Blackwood s story The Man Whom the Trees Loved suggests that trees had once been moving things animal organisms of some sort that had stood so long feeding sleeping dreaming or something in the same place that they had lost the power to get away which Groom remarks sounds just like Treebeard s account of Ents going sleepy and tree ish He notes too Arthur Rackham s drawings with bristly twisted anthropomorphic trees that appear as the guises of Elves and other supernatural beings while Disney s episode of Silly Symphony features trees that walk br br br Wish fulfilment and environmentalism br br Commentators have observed that having the Ents march to war against the tree destroyers represented a wish fulfilment on Tolkien s part concerned as he was with the increasing damage to the English countryside in the th century In their book Ents Elves and Eriador The Environmental Vision of J R R Tolkien Matthew T Dickerson and Jonathan Evans see Treebeard as vocalizing a vital part of Tolkien s environmental ethic the need to preserve and look after every kind of wild place especially forests br Corey Olsen however criticises Dickerson and Evans s use of the Ents as mere symbols br br br Mythic value song of the Ents and the Entwives br C S Lewis described Tolkien s tale of the Ents as a myth a story which has a value in itself Ruth Noel likened the Ents to Germanic legends of huge wild hairy woodsprites br br Olsen sees in Tolkien s song of the Ents and the Entwives supposedly written by Elves compelling insights on the complexities and conflicts of life in a fallen world The song goes through the four seasons of the year each time with a stanza by the Ent and then one by the Entwife Olsen comments that the Ent is passive even languid and somnolent in summer the only active process being dreaming whereas the Entwife s summer season is simply bursting with activity These are perhaps Olsen reflects not in competition both contemplation and action are valuable ways of celebrating natural beauty He suggests that Treebeard s view of the song is however biased and that the Ent is not as humble as he claims to be especially with respect to the Entwives If the Ents and the Entwives were to be unified they would balance and complete each other but they face moral dangers without such balance in the case of the Ents the danger is of letting their life in nature lapse into mere lassitude He gives as examples the apathetic isolationism of Skinbark who refuses to come out of his hills and Leaflock s somnolent oblivion just standing in the long grass all summer doing nothing Olsen calls it a cautionary tale and tragic quite unlike Treebeard s In the willow meads of Tasarinan again covering the four seasons but which is a lament br Anne Petty comments that the song follows traditional gender stereotypes the Ents liking wild nature the Entwives preferring the more domestic realm of tamed nature and gardening br br br Adaptations br br br In other media br In Peter Jackson s films The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers and The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King Treebeard is a combination of a large animatronic model and a CGI construct he is voiced by John Rhys Davies who also portrays Gimli The Fall of Troy has a song entitled The Last March of the Ents on their self titled debut album released in Permission was granted for a statue of Treebeard by Tim Tolkien near his great uncle J R R Tolkien s former home in Moseley Birmingham br br br In popular culture br br Ents appeared in the earliest edition of the roleplaying game Dungeons Dragons in the white box set where they were described as tree like creatures able to command trees and lawful in nature In Elan Merchandising which owned the game licence to the Tolkien estate issued a cease and desist order regarding the use of the word ent so the Dungeons Dragons creatures were renamed treants Heroes of Might and Magic V includes Treants as a part of the Elven alliance however due to copyright infringement issues their look was changed between the beta phase and the retail version making them quadrupedal The TV series The Lord of the Rings The Rings of Power set in the Second Age features Ents br br br See also br List of tree deities br Sacred trees and
