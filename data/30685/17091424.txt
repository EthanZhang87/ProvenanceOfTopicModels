Love magic is a type of magic that has existed or currently exists in many cultures around the world as a part of folk beliefs both by clergy and laity of nearly every religion Historically it is attested on cuneiform tablets from Mesopotamia in ancient Egyptian texts and later Coptic texts in the Greco Roman world in Syriac texts in the European Middle Ages and early modern period and among all Jewish groups who co existed with these groups br The exact definition of what constitutes love magic can be difficult to establish and will vary from scholar to scholar but a common theme shared by many is the use of magic to start preserve or break up a relationship of some type whether for purely sexual or romantic purposes or both The tools and methods used in its practice do not significantly differ from the way other forms of magic are practiced and include spoken and written spells and incantations dolls talismans amulets potions and rituals br As most surviving sources concern love between men and women there is a strong heterosexual bias when discussing these sources though there are a few examples known to concern love between both two men and two women such as Greek curse tablets br Love magic motifs appear in literature and art and in the mythologies of many cultures It is less likely to occur in modern fiction except in fantasy fiction like Harry Potter though even then it is not common and may be portrayed as negative br br br Ancient love magic in cuneiform br Early examples of love magic can be found in the ancient Near East dating to ca BCE Cuneiform tablets preserving rituals of erotic magic have been uncovered at Tell Inghara and Isin present day Iraq Similar rituals are attested in Ancient Egypt for instance on an ostracon dated to the twentieth dynasty twelfth eleventh centuries BCE Love spells and rituals have been found among the Sumerians Akkadians and Babylonians and formulae used in them can be found in later time periods in the Near East among other peoples br br br Hellenistic love magic br Spells of erotic attraction and compulsion are found within the syncretic magic tradition of Hellenistic Greece which incorporated Egyptian and Hebraic elements as documented in texts such as the Greek Magical Papyri and archaeologically on amulets and other artifacts dating from the nd century BC and sometimes earlier to the late rd century A D These magical practices continued to influence private rituals in Gaul among Celtic peoples in Roman Britain and among Germanic peoples br Christopher A Faraone a University of Chicago Classics professor specializing in texts and practices pertaining to magic distinguishes between the magic of eros as practiced by men and the magic of philia practiced by women These two types of spells can be connected directly to the gender roles of men and women in Ancient Greece Women used philia spells because they were more dependent on their husbands In marriage women were powerless as men were legally permitted to divorce As a result many used any means necessary to maintain their marriages which meant more interest in affection producing spells Philia magic was used by women to keep their male companion at bay and faithful Eros spells were mainly practiced by men and a small selection of women like prostitutes and were used to imbue lust into the victim However Faraone himself also states that eros magic can be thought of as aggressive magic and philia as non aggressive br While some scholars use Faraone s model like Catherine Rider though she modifies it slightly it has been questioned by other scholars such as Irene Salvo who points out the exceptions to his classification and finds them to be more elucidating of how love magic in Hellenistic Greece actually worked She points out there were men who used philia spells and women who used eros spells who were not prostitutes or who generally appear to have lived like men br br br Love magic in the Renaissance br Magic was expensive and was believed to cause severe damage to the caster therefore it was not taken lightly Thus spells were not just cast upon just anyone in the Renaissance but on those unions that held special importance Men and women of status and favor were more often the targets of love magic Economic or social class restrictions would often inhibit a marriage and love magic was seen as a way to break those barriers leading to social advancement br While the spells were supposed to be kept secret very rarely were they successful in this However if the victim realized that a spell was being cast upon them believing in magic themselves they would often submit to the believed enchantment adding effectiveness to love magic br With the dominance of Christianity and Catholicism in Europe during the Renaissance elements of Christianity seeped its way into the magic rituals themselves Often clay dolls or written spell scrolls would be hidden in the altar at churches or holy candles would be lit in the rituals The Host from a Catholic Mass would sometimes be taken and used in rituals to gain the desired result Thus love magic within the Renaissance period was both Christian and pagan br br br Women in love magic br In historian Guido Ruggiero s opinion love magic is seen as drawing heavily upon what was perceived as quintessentially feminine fertility birth menstruation seen as closely related to both fertility and birth and a woman s nature or shameful parts that is genitals This feminine attribute is reflected within the literature such as the Malleus Maleficarum and in the trials of the Holy Office in which most of the cases brought before the council were women accused of bewitching men This illustrates the common stereotype that men did not perform magic According to historians Guido Ruggiero and Christopher A Faraone love magic was often associated with prostitutes and courtesans but this has been questioned by other scholars such as Catherine Rider who in a study of late medieval Western European pastoral manuals and exempla especially English argues this was a development that happened around the time of the early modern witch trials and may have been influenced by the fact that the women who were most often tried for love magic were women of ill repute in illicit relationships or both In the early Middle Ages it was married women who were solely portrayed as practicing love magic on their husbands br In the Early Middle Ages there is some evidence that women were considered more likely to be practitioners of love magic For instance in the works of Regino of Pr m Burchard of Worms and Hincmar the practitioners of love magic are usually gendered as female However in pastoral manuals and exempla from this same time period the practitioners are often not gendered at all or men are primarily singled out br How modern scholars interpret how medieval and early modern Europeans viewed women witches and magic has traditionally been heavily influenced by the misogynistic anti witchcraft treatise Malleus Maleficarum written by Heinrich Kramer In the opening section of this text it discusses the sexuality of women in relation to the devil Heinrich Kramer wrote within his book that All witchcraft comes from carnal lust which in women is insatiable But as Rider and others have noted this may reflect the opinions of one man in one region and was not widespread in Europe as a whole br Matthew W Dickie a prominent magic scholar argues that men were the main casters of love magic Demographically they suggest that the largest age group that practiced love magic were younger men targeting young unobtainable women There are a variety of explanations for why the literary world contrasted reality in this area but a common interpretation is that men were trying to subtract themselves from association br br br In literature and art br br In literature and art the motif of a genuine love spell used to create or break up a relationship typically for the benefit of one of the protagonists is somewhat common particularly in older literature and art and sometimes causes tragic setbacks and complications for said protagonists One of the earliest manifestations of the theme in the Western world is the myth of the hero Heracles death by his last wife Deianeira who was tricked by a centaur into killing him with a poisoned shirt he said would reignite his love for her again should she feel his love ever fade A famous treatment of the subject is in Richard Wagner s opera Tristan and Isolde which in turn goes back to the same epic by Gottfried von Strassburg Other examples of the use of love magic motif are Donizetti s opera The Elixir of Love L Elisir d amore and Manuel de Falla s ballet El amor brujo The Magic of Love Its use can also be found in modern fantasy fiction like the Harry Potter series though since the most prominent use of it is to force a man to love a woman he does not which births the main villain of the series because he cannot understand the concept of love due to his loveless conception it is not a positive use and love potions
