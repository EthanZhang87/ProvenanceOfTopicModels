A creation myth or cosmogonic myth is a type of cosmogony a symbolic narrative of how the world began and how people first came to inhabit it While in popular usage the term myth often refers to false or fanciful stories members of cultures often ascribe varying degrees of truth to their creation myths In the society in which it is told a creation myth is usually regarded as conveying profound truths metaphorically symbolically historically or literally They are commonly although not always considered cosmogonical myths that is they describe the ordering of the cosmos from a state of chaos or amorphousness br Creation myths often share several features They often are considered sacred accounts and can be found in nearly all known religious traditions They are all stories with a plot and characters who are either deities human like figures or animals who often speak and transform easily They are often set in a dim and nonspecific past that historian of religion Mircea Eliade termed in illo tempore at that time Creation myths address questions deeply meaningful to the society that shares them revealing their central worldview and the framework for the self identity of the culture and individual in a universal context br Creation myths develop in oral traditions and therefore typically have multiple versions found throughout human culture they are the most common form of myth br br br Definitions br br Creation myth definitions from modern references br br A symbolic narrative of the beginning of the world as understood in a particular tradition and community Creation myths are of central importance for the valuation of the world for the orientation of humans in the universe and for the basic patterns of life and culture br Creation myths tell us how things began All cultures have creation myths they are our primary myths the first stage in what might be called the psychic life of the species As cultures we identify ourselves through the collective dreams we call creation myths or cosmogonies Creation myths explain in metaphorical terms our sense of who we are in the context of the world and in so doing they reveal our real priorities as well as our real prejudices Our images of creation say a great deal about who we are br A philosophical and theological elaboration of the primal myth of creation within a religious community The term myth here refers to the imaginative expression in narrative form of what is experienced or apprehended as basic reality The term creation refers to the beginning of things whether by the will and act of a transcendent being by emanation from some ultimate source or in any other way br Religion professor Mircea Eliade defined the word myth in terms of creation br br Myth narrates a sacred history it relates an event that took place in primordial Time the fabled time of the beginnings In other words myth tells how through the deeds of Supernatural Beings a reality came into existence be it the whole of reality the Cosmos or only a fragment of reality an island a species of plant a particular kind of human behavior an institution br br br Meaning and function br br Creation myths have been around since ancient history and have served important societal roles Over distinct ones have been discovered All creation myths are in one sense etiological because they attempt to explain how the world formed and where humanity came from Myths attempt to explain the unknown and sometimes teach a lesson br Ethnologists and anthropologists who study origin myths say that in the modern context theologians try to discern humanity s meaning from revealed truths and scientists investigate cosmology with the tools of empiricism and rationality but creation myths define human reality in very different terms In the past historians of religion and other students of myth thought of such stories as forms of primitive or early stage science or religion and analyzed them in a literal or logical sense Today however they are seen as symbolic narratives which must be understood in terms of their own cultural context Charles Long writes The beings referred to in the myth gods animals plants are forms of power grasped existentially The myths should not be understood as attempts to work out a rational explanation of deity br While creation myths are not literal explications they do serve to define an orientation of humanity in the world in terms of a birth story They provide the basis of a worldview that reaffirms and guides how people relate to the natural world to any assumed spiritual world and to each other A creation myth acts as a cornerstone for distinguishing primary reality from relative reality the origin and nature of being from non being In this sense cosmogonic myths serve as a philosophy of life but one expressed and conveyed through symbol rather than through systematic reason And in this sense they go beyond etiological myths which explain specific features in religious rites natural phenomena or cultural life Creation myths also help to orient human beings in the world giving them a sense of their place in the world and the regard that they must have for humans and nature br Historian David Christian has summarised issues common to multiple creation myths br br How did everything begin This is the first question faced by any creation myth and answering it remains tricky Each beginning seems to presuppose an earlier beginning Instead of meeting a single starting point we encounter an infinity of them each of which poses the same problem There are no entirely satisfactory solutions to this dilemma What we have to find is not a solution but some way of dealing with the mystery And we have to do so using words The words we reach for from God to gravity are inadequate to the task So we have to use language poetically or symbolically and such language whether used by a scientist a poet or a shaman can easily be misunderstood br br br Classification br br Mythologists have applied various schemes to classify creation myths found throughout human cultures Eliade and his colleague Charles Long developed a classification based on some common motifs that reappear in stories the world over The classification identifies five basic types br br Creation ex nihilo in which the creation is through the thought word dream or bodily secretions of a divine being br Earth diver creation in which a diver usually a bird or amphibian sent by a creator plunges to the seabed through a primordial ocean to bring up sand or mud which develops into a terrestrial world br Emergence myths in which progenitors pass through a series of worlds and metamorphoses until reaching the present world br Creation by the dismemberment of a primordial being br Creation by the splitting or ordering of a primordial unity such as the cracking of a cosmic egg or a bringing order from chaos br Marta Weigle further developed and refined this typology to highlight nine themes adding elements such as deus faber a creation crafted by a deity creation from the work of two creators working together or against each other creation from sacrifice and creation from division conjugation accretion conjunction or secretion br An alternative system based on six recurring narrative themes was designed by Raymond Van Over br br Primeval abyss an infinite expanse of waters or space br Originator deity which is awakened or an eternal entity within the abyss br Originator deity poised above the abyss br Cosmic egg or embryo br Originator deity creating life through sound or word br Life generating from the corpse or dismembered parts of an originator deity br br br Ex nihilo br br The myth that God created the world out of nothing ex nihilo is central today to Judaism Christianity and Islam and the medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared Nonetheless the concept is not found in the entire Hebrew Bible The authors of Genesis were concerned not with the origins of matter the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos but with assigning roles so that the cosmos should function In the early nd century CE early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world formation and the omnipotence of God and by the beginning of the rd century creation ex nihilo had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology br Ex nihilo creation is found in creation stories from ancient Egypt the Rig Veda and many animistic cultures in Africa Asia Oceania and North America In most of these stories the world is brought into being by the speech dream breath or pure thought of a creator but creation ex nihilo may also take place through a creator s bodily secretions br The literal translation of the phrase ex nihilo is from nothing but in many creation myths the line is blurred whether the creative act would be better classified as a creation ex nihilo or creation from chaos In ex nihilo creation myths the potential and the substance of creation springs from within the creator Such a creator may or may not be existing in physical surroundings such as darkness or water but does not create the world from them whereas in creation from chaos the substance used for creation is pre existing within the unformed void br br br Creation from chaos br br In creation from chaos myths there is nothing initially but a formless shapeless expanse In these stories the word chaos means disorder and this formless expanse which is also sometimes called a void or an abyss contains the material with which the created world will be made Chaos may be described as having the consistency of vapor or water dimensionless and sometimes salty or muddy These myths associate chaos with evil and oblivion in contrast to order cosmos which is the good The act of creation is the bringing of order from disorder and in many of these cultures it is believed that at some point the forces preserving order and form will weaken and the world will once again be engulfed into the abyss One example is the Genesis creation narrative from the first chapter of the Book of Genesis br br br World parent br br There are two types of world parent myths both describing a separation or splitting of a primeval entity the world parent or parents One form describes the primeval state as an eternal union of two parents and the creation takes place when the two are pulled apart The two parents are commonly identified as Sky usually male and Earth usually female who were so tightly bound to each other in the primeval state that no offspring could emerge These myths often depict creation as the result of a sexual union and serve as genealogical record of the deities born from it br In the second form of world parent myths creation itself springs from dismembered parts of the body of the primeval being Often in these stories the limbs hair blood bones or organs of the primeval being are somehow severed or sacrificed to transform into sky earth animal or plant life and other worldly features These myths tend to emphasize creative forces as animistic in nature rather than sexual and depict the sacred as the elemental and integral component of the natural world One example of this is the Norse creation myth described in V lusp the first poem of Gylfaginning br br br Emergence br In emergence myths humanity emerges from another world into the one they currently inhabit The previous world is often considered the womb of the earth mother and the process of emergence is likened to the act of giving birth The role of midwife is usually played by a female deity like the spider woman of several mythologies of Indigenous peoples in the Americas Male characters rarely figure into these stories and scholars often consider them in counterpoint to male oriented creation myths like those of the ex nihilo variety br br Emergence myths commonly describe the creation of people and or supernatural beings as a staged ascent or metamorphosis from nascent forms through a series of subterranean worlds to arrive at their current place and form Often the passage from one world or stage to the next is impelled by inner forces a process of germination or gestation from earlier embryonic forms The genre is most commonly found in Native American cultures where the myths frequently link the final emergence of people from a hole opening to the underworld to stories about their subsequent migrations and eventual settlement in their current homelands br br br Earth diver br br The earth diver is a common character in various traditional creation myths In these stories a supreme being usually sends an animal most often a type of bird but also crustaceans insects and fish in some narratives into the primal waters to find bits of sand or mud with which to build habitable land Some scholars interpret these myths psychologically while others interpret them cosmogonically In both cases emphasis is placed on beginnings emanating from the depths br br br Motif distribution br According to Gudmund Hatt and Tristram P Coffin Earth diver myths are common in Native American folklore among the following populations Shoshone Meskwaki Blackfoot Chipewyan Newettee Yokuts of California Mandan Hidatsa Cheyenne Arapaho Ojibwe Yuchi and Cherokee br American anthropologist Gladys Reichard located the distribution of the motif across all parts of North America save for the extreme north northeast and southwest In a study anthropologist Victor Barnouw surmised that the earth diver motif appeared in hunting gathering societies mainly among northerly groups such as the Hare Dogrib Kaska Beaver Carrier Chipewyan Sarsi Cree and Montagnais br Similar tales are also found among the Chukchi and Yukaghir the Tatars and many Finno Ugric traditions as well as among the Buryat and the Samoyed In addition the earth diver motif also exists in narratives from Eastern Europe namely Romani Romanian Slavic namely Bulgarian Polish Ukrainian and Belarusian and Lithuanian mythological traditions br The pattern of distribution of these stories suggest they have a common origin in the eastern Asiatic coastal region spreading as peoples migrated west into Siberia and east to the North American continent However there are examples of this mytheme found well outside of this boreal distribution pattern for example the West African Yoruba creation myth of batala and Oduduwa br br br Native American narrative br Characteristic of many Native American myths earth diver creation stories begin as beings and potential forms linger asleep or suspended in the primordial realm The earth diver is among the first of them to awaken and lay the necessary groundwork by building suitable lands where the coming creation will be able to live In many cases these stories will describe a series of failed attempts to make land before the solution is found br Among the indigenous peoples of the Americas the earth diver cosmogony is attested in Iroquois mythology a female sky deity falls from the heavens and certain animals the beaver the otter the duck and the muskrat dive in the waters to fetch mud to construct an island br In a similar story from the Seneca people lived in a sky realm One day the chief s daughter was afflicted with a mysterious illness and the only cure recommended for her revealed in a dream was to lie beside a tree and to have it be dug up The people do so but a man complains that the tree was their livelihood and kicks the girl through the hole She ends up falling from the sky to a world of only water but is rescued by waterfowl A turtle offers to bear her on its shell but asked where would be a definitive dwelling place for her They decide to create land and the toad dives into the depths of the primal sea to get pieces of soil The toad puts it on the turtle s back which grows larger with every deposit of soil br In another version from the Wyandot the Wyandot lived in heaven The daughter of the Big Chief or Mighty Ruler was sick so the medicine man recommends that they dig up the wild apple tree that stands next to the Lodge of the Mighty Ruler because the remedy is to be found on its roots However as the tree has been dug out the ground begins to sink away and the treetops catch and carry down the sick daughter with it As the girl falls from the skies two swans rescue her on their backs The birds decide to summon all the Swimmers and the Water Tribes Many volunteer to dive into the Great Water to fetch bits of earth from the bottom of the sea but only the toad female in the story is the one successful br br br See also br br br br br br Bibliography br br br External
