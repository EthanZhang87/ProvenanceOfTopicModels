The Story of the Amulet is a novel for children written in by the English author Edith Nesbit br It is the final part of a trilogy of novels that also includes Five Children and It and The Phoenix and the Carpet In it the children re encounter the Psammead the it in Five Children and It As it no longer grants wishes to the children however its capacity is mainly advisory in relation to the children s other discovery the Amulet thus following a formula successfully established in The Phoenix and the Carpet br Gore Vidal writes It is a time machine story only the device is not a machine but an Egyptian amulet whose other half is lost in the past By saying certain powerful words the amulet becomes a gate through which the children are able to visit the past or future a story of considerable beauty br br br Plot summary br br At the beginning of this book the journalist father of Robert Anthea Cyril and Jane has gone overseas to cover the war in Manchuria Their mother has gone to Madeira to recuperate from an illness taking with her their younger brother the Lamb The children are living with an old Nurse Mrs Green who has set up a boarding house in central London Her only other boarder is a scholarly Egyptologist who has filled his bedsit with ancient artefacts During the course of the book the children get to know the poor learned gentleman and befriend him and call him Jimmy br Nurse s house is in Fitzrovia the district of London near the British Museum which Nesbit accurately conveys as having bookstalls and shops filled with unusual merchandise In one of these shops the children find the Psammead It had been captured by a trapper who failed to recognise it as a magical being The terrified creature cannot escape for it can only grant wishes to others not to itself Using a ruse the children persuade the shopkeeper to sell them the mangy old monkey and they free their old friend br Guided by the Psammead the children purchase an ancient amulet in the shape of an Egyptian Tyet a small amulet of very similar shape to the picture can be seen in the British Museum today which should be able to grant them their hearts desire the safe return of their parents and baby brother But this amulet is only half of an original whole By itself it cannot grant their hearts desire Yet it can serve as a portal enabling time travel to find the other half br In the course of the novel the Amulet transports the children and the Psammead to times and places where the Amulet has previously existed in the hope that at some point in time the children can find the Amulet s missing half Among the ancient realms they visit are Babylon Egypt the Phoenician city of Tyre a ship to the Tin Islands ancient Cornwall and Atlantis just before the flood In one chapter they meet Julius Caesar on the shores of Gaul just as he has decided that Britain is not worth invading Jane s childish prattling about the glories of England persuades Caesar to invade after all br In each of their time jaunts the children are magically able to speak and comprehend the contemporary language Nesbit acknowledges this in her narration without offering any explanation The children eventually bring Jimmy the Learned Gentleman along with them on some of their time trips For some reason Jimmy does not share the children s magical gift of fluency in the local language he can only understand for example Latin based on his own studies br In one chapter the children also come to the future visiting a British utopia in which H G Wells is venerated as a reformer Wells and Nesbit were both members of the Fabian political movement as was George Bernard Shaw and this chapter in The Story of the Amulet is essentially different from all the other trips in the narrative whereas all the other adventures in this novel contain scrupulously detailed accounts of past civilisations the children s trip into the future represents Nesbit s vision of Utopia This episode can be compared to many other visions of utopian socialist futures published in that era Nesbit s is notable in that it concentrates on how the life of children at school would be radically different with economic changes only appearing briefly in the background It seems somewhat akin to William Morris s News from Nowhere It also mentions a pressing danger of Edwardian England the number of children wounded burned and killed each year This concern was addressed in the Children Act Edw c and later in the Children s Charter br br br Literary significance and criticism br The Story of the Amulet profits greatly from Nesbit s deep research into ancient civilisations in general and that of ancient Egypt in particular The book is dedicated to Sir E A Wallis Budge the translator of the Egyptian Book of the Dead and Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities of the British Museum with whom she met to discuss the history of the ancient Near East while writing the book The Amulet is sentient and is named Ur Hekau Setcheh this is a genuine Ancient Egyptian name The hieroglyphics written on the back of the Amulet are also authentic br Amulet coincidentally appeared the same year as the first instalment of another story involving children viewing different periods of history Rudyard Kipling s Puck of Pook s Hill br During their adventure in Babylon the children attempt to summon a Babylonian deity named Nisroch but are temporarily unable to recall his name Cyril in an obvious in joke refers to the god as Nesbit Author E Nesbit was a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and was knowledgeable about ancient religions she may well have been aware that there was indeed an ancient deity named Nesbit this was the Egyptian god of the fifth hour of the day In F Gwynplaine MacIntyre s novel The Woman Between the Worlds taking place in E Nesbit briefly appears in the narrative dressed in costume as the Egyptian god Nesbit br The chapter The Queen in London contains broadly negative stereotypes of stockbrokers clearly intended to be Jewish they are described as having curved noses they have Jewish names such as Levinstein Rosenbaum Hirsh and Cohen and their dialogue is rendered in an exaggerated dialect of Yiddish inflected English They are depicted as shuddering at the thought of poor people eating good food and then they are massacred by the queen s guards Another character in the book the shopkeeper Jacob Absalom is hinted at being Jewish and is depicted negatively br br br Allusions and references in The Story of the Amulet br The chapter The Queen in London satirises contemporary occult belief A journalist mistakes the Queen of Babylon for the Theosophist Annie Besant like Nesbit a socialist and social reformer and mentions Theosophy in reference to to him inexplicable events taking place in the British Museum Thought transference telepathy also gets a mention as part of an elaborate and mistaken rationalisation by the Learned Gentleman of Anthea s stories of the Queen and ancient Babylon br The eponymously named ninth chapter which takes place in Atlantis though primarily inspired by Plato s dialogue Critias also borrows such details from C J Cutcliffe Hyne s novel The Lost Continent The Story of Atlantis such as the presence of mammoths dinosaurs and a volcanic mountain on the island br The final chapter in which the lonely Learned Gentleman and the quixotic ancient Egyptian priest fuse into a single being with the ritual being overseen by Anthea is one of the most stirring and unusual moments in the book It almost appears to represent a marriage not just of intellect and ancient knowledge but also of love br br br Influence on other works br Several elements in The Story of the Amulet were borrowed by C S Lewis for his Narnia series particularly The Horse and His Boy and The Magician s Nephew The Calormene god Tash closely resembles the deity Nisroch whose name may also have influenced the title of the Calormene king the Tisroc Lewis s Tisroc like Nesbit s King of Babylon must have his name followed by may he live forever and the appearance of Jadis Queen of Charn in London in The Magician s Nephew and the havoc she causes there closely parallel the Queen of Babylon s eventful journey to London br In the third canto of his poem Villon written published British modernist poet Basil Bunting stated he took the image of two drops of quicksilver mercury merging from Nesbit s The Story of the Amulet and described her work as the pleasantest reading of my childhood br br br br
