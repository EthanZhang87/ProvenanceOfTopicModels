fiction Space Trilogy The events of this novel follow those of Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra also titled Voyage to Venus and once again feature the philologist Elwin Ransom Yet unlike the principal events of those two novels the story takes place on Earth rather than elsewhere in the Solar System The story involves an ostensibly scientific institute the N I C E which is a front for sinister supernatural forces br The novel was heavily influenced by the writing of Lewis s friend and fellow Inkling Charles Williams and is markedly dystopian in style In the foreword Lewis states that the novel s point is the same as that of his non fiction work The Abolition of Man which argues that there are natural laws and objective values that education should teach children to recognise

ancient woodland believed to be the resting place of Merlin After the deal is struck a N I C E insider named Lord Feverstone proposes a possible post for Mark at the Institute It is gradually revealed that Feverstone is the new title of Richard Devine who accompanied Professor Weston on the trip to Mars in Out of the Silent Planet but not on the trip to Venus in Perelandra br Mark s wife Jane a PhD student at the university has suffered a peculiar nightmare involving a severed head She meets Mrs Dimble the wife of one of her former tutors who is being evicted due to sale of land to the N I C E

marriage is deteriorating br Lord Feverstone introduces Mark to the N I C E where he becomes acquainted with the top brass at their headquarters at Belbury near Edgestow Mark can never find out what his place in the organisation is he has no office is given no duties for some time and seems to be alternately in and out of favour A scientist named Bill Hingest who is resigning from the N I C E warns Mark to get out That night Hingest is mysteriously murdered br At the same time Jane works up the courage to visit Miss Ironwood at St Anne s Miss Ironwood who is dressed in black just as Jane had dreamed of her is convinced that Jane s dreams are visions of genuine events Later Jane is introduced to Dr Elwin Ransom the protagonist of the first two books in Lewis s space trilogy He has

the N I C E but after a conversation with an Italian scientist named Filostrato he is introduced to the Head of the Institute This turns out to be a literal head that of a recently guillotined French

man had left Ransom concludes that the N I C E is looking for the body of Merlin who truly is buried in Bragdon Wood not dead but rather in a timeless state Jane will guide members of the group to the place she dreamed of br The N I C E bosses now try to strengthen their hold over Mark by showing him trumped up evidence that he murdered Bill Hingest This backfires as the crisis finally gives Mark the courage to leave Belbury He returns to Edgestow in search of Jane only to find their apartment empty and the town under N I C E control Later he meets Cecil Dimble one of the St Anne s community

of St Anne s but rides away Members of the N I C E capture the tramp believing him to be Merlin br Mark while contemplating his upcoming trial and execution discovers that he has not been arrested by the real police but by officials of the N I C E who he now guesses are the true murderers of Hingest To his surprise he is told that he is to be initiated into the group s inner ring In preparation for this he begins a bizarre program led by Professor Frost of training intended to cultivate absolute objectivity by relegating emotion to the status of a chemical phenomenon He outwardly participates in these rituals knowing that he will otherwise be killed but inwardly begins to reject everything the N I C E stands for br Merlin arrives at St Anne s ahead of his pursuers where he and Ransom converse in Latin Ransom reveals that there are Satanic forces behind the N I C E and that Merlin is to be possessed by the Oy resu since the forces of darkness broke the lunar barrier in the earlier books the heavenly beings may also cross the barrier and intervene in human affairs br Jane has two mystical experiences the first with the earth bound counterpart of the Oyarsa of Venus and the second with God After discussions with Mrs Dimble and the Director she becomes a Christian br Merlin now possessed by the Oy resu disguises himself as a Basque priest and answers the N I C E s advertisement for an interpreter of ancient languages He hypnotises and interviews the tramp who the N I C E still believe may be the real Merlin and the two of them are brought to a banquet There Merlin pronounces the curse of Babel upon the assembled N I C E leaders causing all present to speak gibberish and also liberates the many animals on which the N I C E were experimenting The bigger animals kill most of the N I C E staff br As earthquakes destroy the building Lord Feverstone flees to Edgestow but is killed when that too is engulfed Others escape and wander to the Head where Filostrato is sacrificed Wither kills Straik and Wither is killed by a bear Meanwhile Frost angrily commits suicide in the Objectivity Room Merlin helps Mark escape and sends him to St Anne s The

place inside the University of Edgestow within the nearby town at the new N I C E headquarters and at St Anne s Manor br Elwin Ransom introduced in the novel in Chapter is the protagonist of the first two books in Lewis s space trilogy and his point of view dominates their narrative Lord Feverstone formerly Dick Devine was a villain in the first novel who along with Professor Weston had abducted Ransom to Mars in the mistaken belief that the Martians required a sacrifice When Feverstone speaks in That Hideous Strength of Weston having been murdered by the opposition he is speaking of Ransom having killed Weston who had become possessed by a devil on Venus as described in Perelandra The first two books fully explicate Lewis s mythology based on a combination of the Bible and medieval

from student days br Camilla Denniston The wife of Arthur Denniston br Mr Bultitude A large brown bear br br br Themes and philosophy br A significant element of the book Lewis rated it as second in importance is to illustrate the destructive folly of seeking power and prestige by belonging to a ruling clique or inner circle br Somewhat like the early Gnostics the main antagonists of That Hideous Strength despise the human body and all organic life as frail corrupted and unworthy of pure mind Like modern transhumanists they believe that humanity can be perfected by migrating out of flesh and blood Lewis portrays the consequences of these ideas as a dystopian nightmare by rejecting God and His creation the N I C E inevitably falls under the dominion of demons whom they imagine to have discovered under the guise of Macrobes Lewis had hinted at such themes before in The Screwtape Letters in which the senior demon Screwtape tells his nephew that their goal is to emotionalise and mythologise their science to such an extent that what is in effect a belief in demons though not under that name will creep in while the human mind remains closed to belief in God If once we can produce our perfect work the Materialist Magician the man not using but veritably worshipping what he vaguely calls Forces while denying the existence of spirits then the end of the war will be in sight Lewis s attack is not on science as such or scientific planning but rather the kind of totalitarian planned society idealised by Nazism and Bolshevism the disciplined cruelty of some ideological oligarchy br In contrast Lewis portrays reality as supporting Christian tenets such as the inherent sinfulness of humanity the impossibility of humans perfecting themselves apart from God the essential goodness of the physical body though currently corrupted by sin the omnipotence of God against the limited powers of evil and the existence of angels and demons Within this Christian framework Lewis incorporates elements of the Arthurian legend as well as Roman mythological figures In this way Lewis integrates Christian Roman and British mythological symbolism true to his identity as a British Christian student of antiquity br br br Development and influences br Lewis started writing That Hideous Strength during World War II finishing the first draft in During the War Lewis taught at Oxford University and among other writing projects worked on the last two books of his Space Trilogy Perelandra and That Hideous Strength br The novel makes reference to Numinor and the True West which Lewis credits as a then unpublished creation of J R R Tolkien they were friends and colleagues at Oxford University and fellow members of the Inklings The misspelling of N menor came from Lewis s only hearing Tolkien say the name in one of his readings br Charles Williams s treatments of the King Arthur legends were a significant influence on the Arthurian elements of the novel Brenton D G Dickieson writes Williams idea of Logres emerges in That Hideous Strength forming the speculative framework of a good evil dialectic in the apocalyptic narrative of this last Ransom chronicle br In the book s preface Lewis acknowledges science fiction writer Olaf Stapledon and his work Mr Stapledon is so rich in invention that he can well afford to lend and I admire his invention though not his philosophy so much that I should feel no shame to borrow br br br Reception br Some two years before writing Nineteen Eighty Four George Orwell reviewed That Hideous Strength for the Manchester Evening News commenting Plenty of people in our age do entertain the monstrous dreams of power that Mr Lewis attributes to his characters the N I C E scientists and we are within sight of the time when such dreams will be realizable The review was written shortly after the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki However Orwell argued that the book would have been stronger without the supernatural elements Particularly Orwell objected to the ending in which N I C E is overthrown by divine intervention Lewis is entitled to his beliefs but they weaken his story not only because they offend the average reader s sense of probability but because in effect they decide the issue in advance When one is told that God and the Devil are in conflict one always knows which side is going to win The whole drama of the struggle against evil lies in the fact that one does not have supernatural aid However Orwell still maintained that the book was worth reading br Leonard Bacon reviewing That Hideous Strength described the book as a ghastly but in many places a magnificent nightmare He criticised the character of Studdock as uninteresting noting that it is hard to get excited about the vagaries of a young insecure and ambitious academic figure whose main concern is to get into an inner circle any inner circle but praised the plotting of the book The hunt of Ransom s remnant for the real Merlin while the villains capture the false one is as vivid as a passage in Stevenson Although Bacon regarded the book as somewhat inferior to its two predecessors he concluded This is just the sort of thing that pleases Mr Lewis s admirers And they are right to admire him Win lose or draw and the reviewer doesn t think that this book is wholly victorious Mr Lewis adds energy to systems he comes in contact with br Floyd C Gale wrote that the book bears the authentic stamp of its creator s awesome imagination br J B S Haldane published two essays attacking Lewis s negative views on science and progress as he saw them the first was entitled Auld Hornie F R S Lewis s response remained unpublished in his lifetime br Alister McGrath says the novel shows C S Lewis to have been a prophetic voice offering a radical challenge to the accepted social wisdom of his own generation br br br Publication history br Lewis made minor alterations between the first British and American
