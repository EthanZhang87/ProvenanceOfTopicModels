title: Hero's journey
id: 908507
In narratology and comparative mythology the hero s journey also known as the monomyth is the common template of stories that involve a hero who goes on an adventure is victorious in a decisive crisis and comes home changed or transformed br Earlier figures had proposed similar concepts including psychoanalyst Otto Rank and amateur anthropologist Lord Raglan Eventually hero myth pattern studies were popularized by Joseph Campbell who was influenced by Carl Jung s analytical psychology Campbell used the monomyth to analyze and compare religions In his famous book The Hero with a Thousand Faces he describes the narrative pattern as follows br br A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man br Campbell s theories regarding the concept of a monomyth have been the subject of criticism from scholars particularly folklorists scholars active in folklore studies who have dismissed the concept as a non scholarly approach suffering from source selection bias among other criticisms More recently the hero s journey has been analyzed as an example of the sympathetic plot a universal narrative structure in which a goal directed protagonist confronts obstacles overcomes them and eventually reaps rewards br br br Background br br The study of hero myth narratives can be traced back to with anthropologist Edward Burnett Tylor s observations of common patterns in the plots of heroes journeys In narratology and comparative mythology others have proposed narrative patterns such as psychoanalyst Otto Rank in and amateur anthropologist Lord Raglan in Both Rank and Raglan have lists of cross cultural traits often found in the accounts of mythical heroes and discuss hero narrative patterns in terms of Freudian psychoanalysis and ritualism According to Robert Segal The theories of Rank Campbell and Raglan typify the array of analyses of hero myths br br br Terminology br Campbell borrowed the word monomyth from James Joyce s Finnegans Wake Campbell was a notable scholar of Joyce s work and in A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake co authored the seminal analysis of Joyce s final novel Campbell s singular the monomyth implies that the hero s journey is the ultimate narrative archetype but the term monomyth has occasionally been used more generally as a term for a mythological archetype or a supposed mytheme that re occurs throughout the world s cultures Omry Ronen referred to Vyacheslav Ivanov s treatment of Dionysus as an avatar of Christ as Ivanov s monomyth br The phrase the hero s journey used in reference to Campbell s monomyth first entered into popular discourse through two documentaries The first released in The Hero s Journey The World of Joseph Campbell was accompanied by a companion book The Hero s Journey Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work with Phil Cousineau and Stuart Brown eds The second was Bill Moyers s series of seminal interviews with Campbell released in as the documentary and companion book The Power of Myth Cousineau in the introduction to the revised edition of The Hero s Journey wrote the monomyth is in effect a meta myth a philosophical reading of the unity of mankind s spiritual history the Story behind the story br br br Summary br In his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces Campbell describes stages of the monomyth Not all monomyths necessarily contain all stages explicitly some myths may focus on only one of the stages while others may deal with the stages in a somewhat different order In the terminology of Claude L vi Strauss the stages are the individual mythemes which are bundled or assembled into the structure of the monomyth br The stages may be organized in a number of ways including division into three acts or sections br br In the departure part of the narrative the hero or protagonist lives in the ordinary world and receives a call to go on an adventure The hero is reluctant to follow the call but is helped by a mentor figure br The initiation section begins with the hero then traversing the threshold to an unknown or special world where he faces tasks or trials either alone or with the assistance of helpers br The hero eventually reaches the innermost cave or the central crisis of his adventure where he must undergo the ordeal where he overcomes the main obstacle or enemy undergoing apotheosis and gaining his reward a treasure or elixir br In the return section the hero must return to the ordinary world with his reward He may be pursued by the guardians of the special world or he may be reluctant to return and may be rescued or forced to return by intervention from the outside br The hero again traverses the threshold between the worlds returning to the ordinary world with the treasure or elixir he gained which he may now use for the benefit of his fellow man The hero himself is transformed by the adventure and gains wisdom or spiritual power over both worlds br br br Campbell s seventeen stages br br br Departure br br br The Call to Adventure br The hero begins in a situation of normality from which some information is received that acts as a call to head off into the unknown According to Campbell this region is represented bya distant land a forest a kingdom underground beneath the waves or above the sky a secret island lofty mountaintop or profound dream state but it is always a place of strangely fluid and polymorphous beings unimaginable torments superhuman deeds and impossible delight The hero can go forth of their own volition to accomplish the adventure as did Theseus when he arrived in his father s city Athens and heard the horrible history of the Minotaur or they may be carried or sent abroad by some benign or malignant agent as was Odysseus driven about the Mediterranean by the winds of the angered god Poseidon The adventure may begin as a mere blunder or still again one may be only casually strolling when some passing phenomenon catches the wandering eye and lures one away from the frequented paths of man Examples might be multiplied ad infinitum from every corner of the world br br br Refusal of the Call br Often when the call is given the future hero first refuses to heed it This may be from a sense of duty or obligation fear insecurity a sense of inadequacy or any of a range of reasons that work to hold the person in his current circumstances Campbell says thatRefusal of the summons converts the adventure into its negative Walled in boredom hard work or culture the subject loses the power of significant affirmative action and becomes a victim to be saved His flowering world becomes a wasteland of dry stones and his life feels meaningless even though like King Minos he may through titanic effort succeed in building an empire of renown Whatever house he builds it will be a house of death a labyrinth of cyclopean walls to hide from him his Minotaur All he can do is create new problems for himself and await the gradual approach of his disintegration br br br Supernatural Aid br Once the hero has committed to the quest consciously or unconsciously their guide and magical helper appears or becomes known More often than not this supernatural mentor will present the hero with one or more talismans or artifacts that will aid them later in their quest Campbell writes What such a figure represents is benign protecting power of destiny The fantasy is a reassurance promise that the peace of Paradise which was known first within the mother womb is not to be lost that it supports the present and stands in the future as well as in the past is omega as well as alpha that though omnipotence may seem to be endangered by the threshold of the world One has only to know and trust and the ageless guardians will appear Having responded to their own call and continuing to follow courageously as the consequences unfold the hero finds all the forces of the unconscious at their side Mother Nature herself supports the mighty task And in so far as the hero s act coincides with that for which their society itself is ready they seem to ride on the great rhythm of the historical process br br br The Crossing of the First Threshold br This is the point where the hero actually crosses into the field of adventure leaving the known limits of their world and venturing into an unknown and dangerous realm where the rules and limits are unknown Campbell tells us With the personifications of his destiny to guide and aid him the hero goes forward in his adventure until he comes to the threshold guardian at the entrance to the zone of magnified power Such custodians bound the world in four directions also up and down standing for the limits of the hero s present sphere or life horizon Beyond them is darkness the unknown and danger just as beyond the parental watch is a danger to the infant and beyond the protection of his society danger to the members of the tribe The usual person is more than content he is even proud to remain within the indicated bounds and popular belief gives him every reason to fear so much as the first step into the unexplored br br br The adventure is always and everywhere a passage beyond the veil of the known into the unknown the powers that watch at the boundary are dangerous to deal with them is risky yet for anyone with competence and courage the danger fades br br br Belly of the Whale br The belly of the whale represents the final separation from the hero s known world and self By entering this stage the person shows a willingness to undergo a metamorphosis When first entering the stage the hero may encounter a minor danger or setback According to Campbell The idea that the passage of the magical threshold is a transit into a sphere of rebirth is symbolized in the worldwide womb image of the belly of the whale The hero instead of conquering or conciliating the power of the threshold is swallowed into the unknown and would appear to have died br br br This popular motif gives emphasis to the lesson that the passage of the threshold is a form of self annihilation I nstead of passing outward beyond the confines of the visible world the hero goes inward to be born again The disappearance corresponds to the passing of a worshiper into the temple where he is to be quickened by the recollection of who and what he is namely dust and ashes unless immortal The temple interior the belly of the whale and the heavenly land beyond above and below the confines of the world are one and the same That is why the approaches of and entrances to temples are flanked and defended by colossal gargoyles equivalent to the two rows of teeth of the whale They illustrate the fact that the devotee at the moment of entry into a temple undergoes a metamorphosis Once inside he may be said to have died to time and returned to the World Womb the World Navel the Earthly Paradise Allegorically then the passage into a temple and the hero dive through the jaws of the whale are identical adventures both denoting in picture language the life centering life renewing act br In the exemplary Book of Jonah the eponymous Israelite refuses God s command to prophesy the destruction of Nineveh and attempts to flee by sailing to Tarshish A storm arises and the sailors cast lots to determine that Jonah is to blame He allows himself to be thrown overboard to calm the storm and is saved from drowning by being swallowed by a great fish Over three days Jonah commits to God s will and he is vomited safely onto the shore He subsequently goes to Nineveh and preaches to its inhabitants Jonah s passage through the belly of the whale can be viewed as a symbolic death and rebirth in Jungian analysis br In The Power of Myth Campbell agrees with Bill Moyers that the original Star Wars film s trash compactor scene on the Death Star is a strong example of this step of the journey br br br Initiation br br br The Road of Trials br The road of trials is a series of tests that the hero must undergo to begin the transformation Often the hero fails one or more of these tests which often occur in threes Eventually the hero will overcome these trials and move on to the next step Campbell explains thatOnce having traversed the threshold the hero moves in a dream landscape of curiously fluid ambiguous forms where he must survive a succession of trials This is a favorite phase of the myth adventure It has produced a world literature of miraculous tests and ordeals The hero is covertly aided by the advice amulets and secret agents of the supernatural helper whom he met before his entrance into this region Or it may be that he here discovers for the first time that there is a benign power everywhere supporting him in his superhuman passage br br br The original departure into the land of trials represented only the beginning of the long and really perilous path of initiatory conquests and moments of illumination Dragons have now to be slain and surprising barriers passed again again and again Meanwhile there will be a multitude of preliminary victories unsustainable ecstasies and momentary glimpses of the wonderful land br br br The Meeting with the Goddess br This is where the hero gains items given to him that will help him in the future Campbell proposes thatThe ultimate adventure when all the barriers and ogres have been overcome is commonly represented as a mystical marriage of the triumphant hero soul with the Queen Goddess of the World This is the crisis at the nadir the zenith or at the uttermost edge of the earth at the central point of the cosmos in the tabernacle of the temple or within the darkness of the deepest chamber of the heart br br The meeting with the goddess who is incarnate in every woman is the final test of the talent of the hero to win the boon of love charity amor fati which is life itself enjoyed as the encasement of eternity br br And when the adventurer in this context is not a youth but a maid she is the one who by her qualities her beauty or her yearning is fit to become the consort of an immortal Then the heavenly husband descends to her and conducts her to his bed whether she will or not And if she has shunned him the scales fall from her eyes if she has sought him her desire finds its peace br br br Woman as the Temptress br In this step the hero faces those temptations often of a physical or pleasurable nature that may lead them to abandon or stray from their quest which does not necessarily have to be represented by a woman A woman is a metaphor for the physical or material temptations of life since the hero knight was often tempted by lust from his spiritual journey Campbell relates thatThe crux of the curious difficulty lies in the fact that our conscious views of what life ought to be seldom correspond to what life really is Generally we refuse to admit within ourselves or within our friends the fullness of that pushing self protective malodorous carnivorous lecherous fever which is the very nature of the organic cell Rather we tend to perfume whitewash and reinterpret meanwhile imagining that all the flies in the ointment all the hairs in the soup are the faults of some unpleasant someone else br But when it suddenly dawns on us or is forced to our attention that everything we think or do is necessarily tainted with the odor of the flesh then not uncommonly there is experienced a moment of revulsion life the acts of life the organs of life a woman in particular as the great symbol of life become intolerable to the pure the pure pure soul The seeker of the life beyond life must press beyond the woman surpass the temptations of her call and soar to the immaculate ether beyond br br br Atonement with the Father Abyss br In this step the hero must confront and be initiated by whatever holds the ultimate power in their life In many myths and stories this is the father or a father figure who has life and death power This is the center point of the journey All the previous steps have been moving into this place all that follow will move out from it Although this step is most frequently symbolized by an encounter with a male entity it does not have to be a male just someone or something with incredible power Per Campbell Atonement consists in no more than the abandonment of that self generated double monster the dragon thought to be God superego and the dragon thought to be Sin repressed id But this requires an abandonment of the attachment to ego itself and that is what is difficult One must have faith that the father is merciful and then a reliance on that mercy Therewith the center of belief is transferred outside of the bedeviling god s tight scaly ring and the dreadful ogres dissolve br It is in this ordeal that the hero may derive hope and assurance from the helpful female figure by whose magic pollen charms or power of intercession they are protected through all the frightening experiences of the father s ego shattering initiation For if it is impossible to trust the terrifying father face then one s faith must be centered elsewhere Spider Woman Blessed Mother and with that reliance for support one endures the crisis only to find in the end that the father and mother reflect each other and are in essence the same Campbell later expounds The problem of the hero going to meet the father is to open his soul beyond terror to such a degree that he will be ripe to understand how the sickening and insane tragedies of this vast and ruthless cosmos are completely validated in the majesty of Being The hero transcends life with its peculiar blind spot and for a moment rises to a glimpse of the source They behold the face of the father understand and the two are atoned br br br Apotheosis br br This is the point of realization in which a greater understanding is achieved Armed with this new knowledge and perception the hero is resolved and ready for the more difficult part of the adventure Campbell discloses thatThose who know not only that the Everlasting lies in them but that what they and all things really are is the Everlasting dwell in the groves of the wish fulfilling trees drink the brew of immortality and listen everywhere to the unheard music of eternal concord br br br The Ultimate Boon br The ultimate boon is the achievement of the goal of the quest It is what the hero went on the journey to get All the previous steps serve to prepare and purify the hero for this step since in many myths the boon is something transcendent like the elixir of life itself or a plant that supplies immortality or the holy grail Campbell confers thatThe gods and goddesses then are to be understood as embodiments and custodians of the elixir of Imperishable Being but not themselves the Ultimate in its primary state What the hero seeks through his intercourse with them is therefore not finally themselves but their grace i e the power of their sustaining substance This miraculous energy substance and this alone is the Imperishable the names and forms of the deities who everywhere embody dispense and represent it come and go This is the miraculous energy of the thunderbolts of Zeus Yahweh and the Supreme Buddha the fertility of the rain of Viracocha the virtue announced by the bell rung in the Mass at the consecration and the light of the ultimate illumination of the saint and sage Its guardians dare release it only to the duly proven br br br Return br br br Refusal of the Return br Having found bliss and enlightenment in the other world the hero may not want to return to the ordinary world to bestow the boon onto their fellow beings Campbell continues When the hero quest has been accomplished through penetration to the source or through the grace of some male or female human or animal personification the adventurer still must return with his life transmuting trophy The full round the norm of the monomyth requires that the hero shall now begin the labor of bringing the runes of wisdom the Golden Fleece or his sleeping princess back into the kingdom of humanity where the boon may redound to the renewing of the community the nation the planet or the ten thousand worlds br But the responsibility has been frequently refused Even Gautama Buddha after his triumph doubted whether the message of realization could be communicated and saints are reported to have died while in the supernal ecstasy Numerous indeed are the heroes fabled to have taken up residence forever in the blessed isle of the unaging Goddess of Immortal Being br br br The Magic Flight br Sometimes the hero must escape with the boon if it is something that the gods have been jealously guarding It can be just as adventurous and dangerous returning from the journey as it was to go on it Campbell argues thatIf the hero in his triumph wins the blessing of the goddess or the god and is then explicitly commissioned to return to the world with some elixir for the restoration of society the final stage of his adventure is supported by all the powers of his supernatural patron On the other hand if the trophy has been attained against the opposition of its guardian or if the hero s wish to return to the world has been resented by the gods or demons then the last stage of the mythological round becomes a lively often comical pursuit This flight may be complicated by marvels of magical obstruction and evasion br br br Rescue from Without br Just as the hero may need guides and assistants to set out on the quest often they must have powerful guides and rescuers to bring them back to everyday life especially if the hero has been wounded or weakened by the experience Campbell elucidates The hero may have to be brought back from his supernatural adventure by assistance from without That is to say the world may have to come and get him For the bliss of the deep abode is not lightly abandoned in favor of the disorder of the wakened state Society is jealous of those who remain away from it and will come knocking at the door If the hero is unwilling the disturber suffers an ugly shock but on the other hand if the summoned one is only delayed sealed in by the deathlike rapture of a perfect being an apparent rescue is effected and the adventurer returns br br br The Crossing of the Return Threshold br Campbell says in The Hero with a Thousand Faces that The returning hero to complete his adventure must survive the impact of the world The goal of the return is to retain the wisdom gained on the quest and to integrate it into society Campbell writes Many failures attest to the difficulties of this life affirmative threshold The first problem of the returning hero is to accept as real after an experience of the soul satisfying vision of fulfillment the ups and downs of life Why re enter such a world Why share the experience of transcendental bliss As dreams that were momentous by night may seem simply silly in the light of day so the poet and the prophet can discover themselves playing the idiot before others The easy thing is to commit the whole community to the devil and retire again into bliss But if some spiritual obstetrician has drawn the shimenawa across the retreat then the work of distilling eternal truth cannot be avoided br br br Master of the Two Worlds br For a human hero it may mean achieving a balance between the material and spiritual The person has become comfortable and competent in both the inner and outer worlds Campbell demonstrates thatFreedom to pass back and forth across the world division from the perspective of the apparitions of time to that of the causal deep and back not contaminating the principles of the one with those of the other yet permitting the mind to know the one by virtue of the other is the talent of the master The Cosmic Dancer declares Nietzsche does not rest heavily in a single spot but gaily lightly turns and leaps from one position to another It is possible to speak from only one point at a time but that does not invalidate the insights of the rest br Discussing this stage Campbell cites the Apostles of Jesus who had become selfless in their devotion by the time of their master s transfiguration as well as the similar orthodoxy presented by Krishna who said He who does My work and regards Me as the Supreme Goal without hatred for any creature he comes to Me Campbell goes on to illustrate that br br The individual through prolonged psychological disciplines gives up completely all attachment to his personal limitations idiosyncrasies hopes and fears no longer resists the self annihilation that is prerequisite to rebirth in the realization of truth and so becomes ripe at last for the great at one ment His personal ambitions being totally dissolved he no longer tries to live but willingly relaxes to whatever may come to pass in him he becomes that is to say an anonymity br br br Freedom to Live br In this step mastery leads to freedom from the fear of death which in turn is the freedom to live This is sometimes referred to as living in the moment neither anticipating the future nor regretting the past Campbell declares The hero is the champion of things becoming not of things become because he is Before Abraham was I AM He does not mistake apparent changelessness in time for the permanence of Being nor is he fearful of the next moment or of the other thing as destroying the permanent with its change Quoting Ovid s Metamorphoses Nothing retains its own form but Nature the greater renewer ever makes up forms from forms Be sure that nothing perishes in the whole universe it does but vary and renew its form Thus the next moment is permitted to come to pass br br br In popular culture and literature br The monomyth concept has been popular in American literary studies and writing guides since at least the s Christopher Vogler a Hollywood film producer and writer created a page company memo A Practical Guide to The Hero with a Thousand Faces based on Campbell s work Vogler s memo was later developed into the book The Writer s Journey Mythic Structure for Writers br George Lucas s film Star Wars was classified as monomyth almost as soon as it came out In addition to the extensive discussion between Campbell and Bill Moyers broadcast in as The Power of Myth Lucas gave an extensive interview in which he states that after completing American Graffiti it came to me that there really was no modern use of mythology so that s when I started doing more strenuous research on fairy tales folklore and mythology and I started reading Joe s books It was very eerie because in reading The Hero with a Thousand Faces I began to realize that my first draft of Star Wars was following classical motifs Moyers and Lucas also met for a interview to further discuss the impact of Campbell s work on Lucas s films In addition the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution sponsored an exhibit during the late s called Star Wars The Magic of Myth which discussed the ways in which Campbell s work shaped the Star Wars saga br Numerous literary works of popular fiction have been identified by various authors as examples of the monomyth template including Spenser s The Faerie Queene Melville s Moby Dick Charlotte Bront s Jane Eyre works by Charles Dickens William Faulkner Somerset Maugham J D Salinger Ernest Hemingway Mark Twain W B Yeats C S Lewis J R R Tolkien Seamus Heaney and Stephen King Plato s allegory of the cave Homer s Odyssey L Frank Baum s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and Lewis Carroll s Alice s Adventures in Wonderland amongst many others br Stanley Kubrick introduced Arthur C Clarke to the book The Hero with a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell during the writing of A Space Odyssey Arthur C Clarke called Joseph Campbell s book very stimulating in his diary entry br br br Feminist literature and female heroines within the monomyth br br br Jane Eyre br Charlotte Bront s character Jane Eyre is an important figure in illustrating heroines and their place within the hero s journey Charlotte Bront sought to craft a unique female character that the term Heroine could fully encompass Jane Eyre is a Bildungsroman a coming of age story common in Victorian fiction also referred to as an apprenticeship novel that shows moral and psychological development of the protagonist as they grow into adults br Jane being a middle class Victorian woman would face entirely different obstacles and conflict than her male counterparts of this era such as Pip in Great Expectations This would change the course of the hero s journey because Bront was able to recognize the fundamental conflict that plagued women of this time one main source of this conflict being women s relationship with power and wealth and often being distant from obtaining both br Charlotte Bront takes Jane s character a step further by making her more passionate and outspoken than other Victorian women of this time The abuse and psychological trauma Jane receives from the Reeds as a child cause her to develop two central goals for her to complete her heroine journey a need to love and to be loved and her need for liberty Jane accomplishes part of attaining liberty when she castigates Mrs Reed for treating her poorly as a child obtaining the freedom of her mind br As Jane grows throughout the novel she also becomes unwilling to sacrifice one of her goals for the other When Rochester the temptress in her journey asks her to stay with him as his mistress she refuses as it would jeopardize the freedom she had struggled to obtain She instead returns after Rochester s wife passes away now free to marry him and able to achieve both of her goals and complete her role in the hero s journey br While the story ends with a marriage trope Bront has Jane return to Rochester after several chances to grow allowing her to return as close to equals as possible while also having fleshed out her growth within the heroine s journey Since Jane is able to marry Rochester as an equal and through her own means this makes Jane one of the most satisfying and fulfilling heroines in literature and in the heroine s journey br br br Cupid and Psyche br The tale of Cupid and Psyche is one of the thirteen stories of Metamorphoses by Apuleius in A D and involves a hero s journey The central heroine of the tale is Psyche who is cast into the hero s journey due to being a beautiful woman and the conflict that arises from it Psyche s beauty causes her to become ostracized from society because no male suitors will ask to marry her as they feel unworthy of her seemingly divine beauty and kind nature Psyche s call to adventure is involuntary her beauty causes men to worship her instead the goddess Venus which enrages the deity and results in Psyche being banished from her home She enters into a world of the unknown as she is instructed by an oracle to head up a rocky crag in funeral attire where she is taken to a seemingly divine location by the west wind Here the deity Cupid becomes her husband but he conceals his true identity When Psyche tries to find out who she is he flees and she sets out on a quest to regain her husband Psyche is given four seemingly impossible tasks by Venus to get him back sorting seeds fleecing the golden rams collecting a crystal jar full of the water of death and retrieving a beauty cream from Hades Despite the difficulty Psyche is able to achieve each task and complete her ultimate goal of becoming an immortal goddess and moving to Mount Olympus to be with her husband Cupid for all eternity br br br Self help movement and therapy br Poet Robert Bly Michael J Meade and others involved in the mythopoetic men s movement have also applied and expanded the concepts of the hero s journey and the monomyth as a metaphor for personal spiritual and psychological growth br Characteristic of the mythopoetic men s movement is a tendency to retell fairy tales and engage in their exegesis as a tool for personal insight Using frequent references to archetypes as drawn from Jungian analytical psychology the movement focuses on issues of gender role gender identity and wellness for modern men Advocates would often engage in storytelling with music these acts being seen as a modern extension to a form of new age shamanism popularized by Michael Harner at approximately the same time br Among its most famous advocates was the poet Robert Bly whose book Iron John A Book About Men was a best seller being an exegesis of the fairy tale Iron John by the Brothers Grimm br The mythopoetic men s movement spawned a variety of groups and workshops led by authors such as Bly and Robert L Moore Some serious academic work came out of this movement including the creation of various magazines and non profit organizations br Research published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in provided evidence that viewing one s life through the Hero s Journey narrative can significantly enhance a sense of life meaning and resilience This effect was consistently observed across various demographics and methodologies br br br Criticism br Campbell s approach to myth a genre of folklore has been the subject of criticism from folklorists academics who specialize in folklore studies American folklorist Barre Toelken notes that few psychologists have taken the time to become familiar with the complexities of folklore and that historically Jung influenced psychologists and authors have tended to build complex theories around single versions of a tale that supports a theory or a proposal To illustrate his point Toelken employs Clarissa Pinkola Est s s Women Who Run with the Wolves citing its inaccurate representation of the folklore record and Campbell s monomyth approach as another Regarding Campbell Toelken writes Campbell could construct a monomyth of the hero only by citing those stories that fit his preconceived mold and leaving out equally valid stories which did not fit the pattern Toelken traces the influence of Campbell s monomyth theory into other then contemporary popular works such as Robert Bly s Iron John A Book About Men which he says suffers from similar source selection bias br Similarly American folklorist Alan Dundes is highly critical of both Campbell s approach to folklore designating him as a non expert and outlining various examples of source bias in Campbell s theories as well as media representation of Campbell as an expert on the subject of myth in popular culture Dundes writes Folklorists have had some success in publicising the results of our efforts in the past two centuries such that members of other disciplines have after a minimum of reading believe they are qualified to speak authoritatively of folkloristic matters It seems that the world is full of self proclaimed experts in folklore and a few such as Campbell have been accepted as such by the general public and public television in the case of Campbell According to Dundes there is no single idea promulgated by amateurs that have done more harm to serious folklore study than the notion of archetype br According to Northup mainstream scholarship of comparative mythology since Campbell has moved away from highly general and universal categories in general This attitude is illustrated by Consentino who remarks It is just as important to stress differences as similarities to avoid creating a Joseph Campbell soup of myths that loses all local flavor Similarly Ellwood stated A tendency to think in generic terms of people races is undoubtedly the profoundest flaw in mythological thinking br Others have found the categories Campbell works with so vague as to be meaningless and lacking the support required of scholarly argument Crespi writing in response to Campbell s filmed presentation of his model characterized it as unsatisfying from a social science perspective Campbell s ethnocentrism will raise objections and his analytic level is so abstract and devoid of ethnographic context that myth loses the very meanings supposed to be embedded in the hero br In a similar vein American philosopher John Shelton Lawrence and American religious scholar Robert Jewett have discussed an American Monomyth in many of their books The American Monomyth The Myth of the American Superhero and Captain America and the Crusade Against Evil The Dilemma of Zealous Nationalism They present this as an American reaction to the Campbellian monomyth The American Monomyth storyline is A community in a harmonious paradise is threatened by evil normal institutions fail to contend with this threat a selfless superhero emerges to renounce temptations and carry out the redemptive task aided by fate his decisive victory restores the community to its paradisiacal condition the superhero then recedes into obscurity br The monomyth has also been criticized for focusing on the masculine journey The Heroine s Journey by Maureen Murdock and From Girl to Goddess The Heroine s Journey Through Myth and Legend by Valerie Estelle Frankel both set out what they consider the steps of the female hero s journey which is different from Campbell s monomyth Likewise The Virgin s Promise by Kim Hudson articulates an equivalent feminine journey to parallel the masculine hero s journey which concerns personal growth and creative spiritual and sexual awakening rather than an external quest br According to a interview between filmmaker Nicole L Franklin and artist and comic book illustrator Alice Meichi Li a hero s journey is the journey of someone who has privilege Regardless of the protagonist is male or female a heroine does not start out with privilege Being underprivileged to Li means that the heroine may not receive the same level of social support enjoyed by the hero in a traditional mythic cycle and rather than return from her quest as both hero and mentor the heroine instead returns to a world in which she or he is still part of an oppressed demographic Li adds They re not really bringing back an elixir They re navigating our patriarchal society with unequal pay and inequalities In the final chapter they may end up on equal footing But when you have oppressed groups all you can hope for is to get half as far by working twice as hard br In a Salon article science fiction author David Brin criticized the monomyth template as supportive of despotism and tyranny indicating that he thinks modern popular fiction should strive to depart from it to support more progressive values
