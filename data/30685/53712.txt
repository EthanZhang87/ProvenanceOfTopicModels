Digital audio is a representation of sound recorded in or converted into digital form In digital audio the sound wave of the audio signal is typically encoded as numerical samples in a continuous sequence For example in CD audio samples are taken times per second each with bit sample depth Digital audio is also the name for the entire technology of sound recording and reproduction using audio signals that have been encoded in digital form Following significant advances in digital audio technology during the s and s it gradually replaced analog audio technology in many areas of audio engineering record production and telecommunications in the s and s br In a digital audio system an analog electrical signal representing the sound is converted with an analog to digital converter ADC into a digital signal typically using pulse code modulation PCM This digital signal can then be recorded edited modified and copied using computers audio playback machines and other digital tools For playback a digital to analog converter DAC performs the reverse process converting a digital signal back into an analog signal which is then sent through an audio power amplifier and ultimately to a loudspeaker br Digital audio systems may include compression storage processing and transmission components Conversion to a digital format allows convenient manipulation storage transmission and retrieval of an audio signal Unlike analog audio in which making copies of a recording results in generation loss and degradation of signal quality digital audio allows an infinite number of copies to be made without any degradation of signal quality br br Digital audio technologies are used in the recording manipulation mass production and distribution of sound including recordings of songs instrumental pieces podcasts sound effects and other sounds Modern online music distribution depends on digital recording and data compression The availability of music as data files rather than as physical objects has significantly reduced the costs of distribution as well as made it easier to share copies Before digital audio the music industry distributed and sold music by selling physical copies in the form of records and cassette tapes With digital audio and online distribution systems such as iTunes companies sell digital sound files to consumers which the consumer receives over the Internet Popular streaming services such as Apple Music Spotify or YouTube offer temporary access to the digital file and are now the most common form of music consumption br An analog audio system converts physical waveforms of sound into electrical representations of those waveforms by use of a transducer such as a microphone The sounds are then stored on an analog medium such as magnetic tape or transmitted through an analog medium such as a telephone line or radio The process is reversed for reproduction the electrical audio signal is amplified and then converted back into physical waveforms via a loudspeaker Analog audio retains its fundamental wave like characteristics throughout its storage transformation duplication and amplification br Analog audio signals are susceptible to noise and distortion due to the innate characteristics of electronic circuits and associated devices Disturbances in a digital system do not result in error unless they are so large as to result in a symbol being misinterpreted as another symbol or disturb the sequence of symbols It is therefore generally possible to have an entirely error free digital audio system in which no noise or distortion is introduced between conversion to digital format and conversion back to analog br A digital audio signal may be encoded for correction of any errors that might occur in the storage or transmission of the signal This technique known as channel coding is essential for broadcast or recorded digital systems to maintain bit accuracy Eight to fourteen modulation is the channel code used for the audio compact disc CD br br If an audio signal is analog a digital audio system starts with an ADC that converts an analog signal to a digital signal The ADC runs at a specified sampling rate and converts at a known bit resolution CD audio for example has a sampling rate of kHz samples per second and has bit resolution for each stereo channel Analog signals that have not already been bandlimited must be passed through an anti aliasing filter before conversion to prevent the aliasing distortion that is caused by audio signals with frequencies higher than the Nyquist frequency half the sampling rate br A digital audio signal may be stored or transmitted Digital audio can be stored on a CD a digital audio player a hard drive a USB flash drive or any other digital data storage device The digital signal may be altered through digital signal processing where it may be filtered or have effects applied Sample rate conversion including upsampling and downsampling may be used to change signals that have been encoded with a different sampling rate to a common sampling rate prior to processing Audio data compression techniques such as MP Advanced Audio Coding Ogg Vorbis or FLAC are commonly employed to reduce the file size Digital audio can be carried over digital audio interfaces such as AES or MADI Digital audio can be carried over a network using audio over Ethernet audio over IP or other streaming media standards and systems br For playback digital audio must be converted back to an analog signal with a DAC According to the Nyquist Shannon sampling theorem with some practical and theoretical restrictions a band limited version of the original analog signal can be accurately reconstructed from the digital signal br During conversion audio data can be embedded with a digital watermark to prevent piracy and unauthorized use Watermarking is done using a direct sequence spread spectrum DSSS method The audio information is then modulated by a pseudo noise PN sequence then shaped within the frequency domain and put back in the original signal The strength of the embedding determines the strength of the watermark on the audio data br br Pulse code modulation PCM was invented by British scientist Alec Reeves in In C Chapin Cutler of Bell Labs filed the patent on differential pulse code modulation DPCM a data compression algorithm Adaptive DPCM ADPCM was introduced by P Cummiskey Nikil S Jayant and James L Flanagan at Bell Labs in br Perceptual coding was first used for speech coding compression with linear predictive coding LPC Initial concepts for LPC date back to the work of Fumitada Itakura Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in During the s Bishnu S Atal and Manfred R Schroeder at Bell Labs developed a form of LPC called adaptive predictive coding APC a perceptual coding algorithm that exploited the masking properties of the human ear followed in the early s with the code excited linear prediction CELP algorithm br Discrete cosine transform DCT coding a lossy compression method first proposed by Nasir Ahmed in provided the basis for the modified discrete cosine transform MDCT which was developed by J P Princen A W Johnson and A B Bradley in The MDCT is the basis for most audio coding standards such as Dolby Digital AC MP MPEG Layer III Advanced Audio Coding AAC Windows Media Audio WMA and Vorbis Ogg br br PCM was used in telecommunications applications long before its first use in commercial broadcast and recording Commercial digital recording was pioneered in Japan by NHK and Nippon Columbia and their Denon brand in the s The first commercial digital recordings were released in br The BBC also began to experiment with digital audio in the s By the early s it had developed a channel recorder and in it deployed a digital audio transmission system that linked their broadcast center to their remote transmitters br br The first bit PCM recording in the United States was made by Thomas Stockham at the Santa Fe Opera in on a Soundstream recorder An improved version of the Soundstream system was used to produce several classical recordings by Telarc in The M digital multitrack recorder in development at the time was based on BBC technology The first all digital album recorded on this machine was Ry Cooder s Bop till You Drop in British record label Decca began development of its own track digital audio recorders in and released the first European digital recording in br Popular professional digital multitrack recorders produced by Sony Studer DASH and Mitsubishi ProDigi in the early s helped to bring about digital recording s acceptance by the major record companies Machines for these formats had their own transports built in as well using reel to reel tape in either or widths with the audio data being recorded to the tape using a multi track stationary tape head PCM adaptors allowed for stereo digital audio recording on a conventional NTCS or PAL video tape recorder br The introduction of the CD by Philips and Sony popularized digital audio with consumers br ADAT became available in the early s which allowed eight track or kHz recording on S VHS cassettes and DTRS performed a similar function with Hi tapes br Formats like ProDigi and DASH were referred to as SDAT Stationary head Digital Audio Tape formats as opposed to formats like the PCM adaptor based systems and DAT which were referred to as RDAT Rotating head Digital Audio Tape formats due to their helical scan process of recording br Like the DAT cassette ProDigi and DASH machines also accommodated the obligatory kHz sampling rate but also kHz on all machines and eventually a kHz sampling rate They overcame the problems that made typical analog recorders unable to meet the bandwidth frequency range demands of digital recording by a combination of higher tape speeds narrower head gaps used in combination with metal formulation tapes and the spreading of data across multiple parallel tracks br Unlike analog systems modern digital audio workstations and audio interfaces allow as many channels in as many different sampling rates as the computer can effectively run at a single time Avid Audio and Steinberg released the first digital audio workstation software programs in Digital audio workstations make multitrack recording and mixing much easier for large projects which would otherwise be difficult with analog equipment br br The rapid development and wide adoption of PCM digital telephony was enabled by metal oxide semiconductor MOS switched capacitor SC circuit technology developed in the early s This led to the development of PCM codec filter chips in the late s The silicon gate CMOS complementary MOS PCM codec filter chip developed by David A Hodges and W C Black in has since been the industry standard for digital telephony By the s telecommunication networks such as the public switched telephone network PSTN had been largely digitized with VLSI very large scale integration CMOS PCM codec filters widely used in electronic switching systems for telephone exchanges user end modems and a range of digital transmission applications such as the integrated services digital network ISDN cordless telephones and cell phones br br Digital audio is used in broadcasting of audio Standard technologies include Digital audio broadcasting DAB
