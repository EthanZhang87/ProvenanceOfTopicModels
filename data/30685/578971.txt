Easterbrook argued that many environmental indicators with the notable exception of greenhouse gas production are positive He called the environmental movement among the most welcome social developments of the twentieth century but criticized environmentalists who promoted what he saw as overly pessimistic views that did not accept signs of improvement and progress br A Moment on the Earth proved to be very controversial especially among environmentalists Easterbrook was accused of mischaracterizing data concerning environmental health using faulty logic and being overly optimistic Other reviewers like Michael Specter in The New York Times had praise for the book s efforts to raise positive points in the debate over environmental policy br Norman Borlaug one of the most important figures in the Green Revolution was the subject of an admiring Easterbrook article in and again in marking Borlaug s passing Both articles said that Borlaug had disproved the earlier dire predictions of Paul R Ehrlich author of the book The Population Bomb Ehrlich has severely criticized Easterbrook s book A Moment on the Earth br Until Easterbrook was skeptical about whether global warming was a serious manmade problem pointing out several times that even the National Academy of Sciences had expressed doubt about whether global warming was caused by humans He publicly modified his position in as a result of scientific developments Easterbrook wrote br br T he science has changed from ambiguous to near unanimous As an environmental commentator I have a long record of opposing alarmism But based on the data I m now switching sides regarding global warming from skeptic to convert Once global warming science was too uncertain to form the basis of policy decisions and this was hardly just the contention of oil executives Clearly the question called for more research That research is now in and it shows a strong scientific consensus that an artificially warming world is a real phenomenon posing real danger br He says that greenhouse gas emissions must be curbed in order to win the fight against climate change Easterbrook anticipates that climate change could benefit some regions even while causing drastic problems elsewhere br br br Other books br Easterbrook has written three novels This Magic Moment The Here and Now and The Leading Indicators This Magic Moment is a love story as well as a philosophical work about the meaning of life The second novel The Here and Now was called moving by both the New York Times Book Review and the Los Angeles Times and tells a satisfying tale of disillusionment and redemption in the opinion of the San Francisco Chronicle According to Kirkus Reviews The Leading Indicators provides social commentary in the form of literary fiction filtering leveraged buyouts derivatives marketing and multimillion dollar CEO bonuses through the lens of one family br Among his nonfiction books Beside Still Waters is a work of Christian theology discussing whether religion matters as much as it did before we gained so much knowledge about ourselves and the world The book Tuesday Morning Quarterback not to be confused with his similar column of the same name uses haiku and humor to analyze pro football br Another of Easterbrook s books focusing on social science is The Progress Paradox How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse which explores people s perception of their own well being The book cites statistical data indicating that Americans are better off in terms of material goods and amount of free time but are not happier than before Easterbrook argues that this has occurred due to choice anxiety too many decisions to make and abundance denial not realizing how well we are doing His proposed remedy is to make our lives more meaningful by doing good while living well br His book Sonic Boom Globalization at Mach Speed asserts that globalization has only just begun and is a good thing to look forward to Another book The King of Sports Football s Impact on America says that American football in many ways reflects the cultural contradictions of the United States br br br Other activities and areas

uncrewed space probes and protecting Earth from asteroids br Easterbrook had a blog at The New Republic Online until mid In October he wrote a blog post critical of what he considered to be the senseless violence in the Quentin Tarantino film Kill Bill saying that Recent European history alone ought to cause Jewish movie executives to experience second thoughts about glorifying the killing of the helpless as a fun lifestyle choice This caused an uproar and Easterbrook wrote that he mangled his own ideas by his choice of words and apologized The New Republic accepted blame for the piece
