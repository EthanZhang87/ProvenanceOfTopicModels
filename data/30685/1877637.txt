Works br br br Religion and Rocketry Will We Lose God in Outer Space br What did Lewis think of the possibility of discovering life on other planets What implications might such a discovery have for Christian theology Originally published in the Christian Herald and entitled Will We Lose God in Outer Space Lewis s essay on the subject was first published in and later became titled Religion and Rocketry The essay was written in partial response to the writings of Professor Fred Hoyle the Cambridge astronomer and founder of the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge br In Hoyle was Plumian professor of astronomy at Cambridge and engaged in the study of the structure and evolution of the stars Even though he coined the phrase Big Bang Hoyle rejected the big bang theory of the origin of the universe in favor of the steady state theory which claimed that the universe has always looked as it does now Martin Ryle however held to the big bang theory for the creation of the universe in a moment the theory that eventually held sway Some of Hoyle s writings including science fiction and plays popularized astronomy Christopher H Derrick of Geoffrey Bles publishers presumably in and before Lewis s death wrote a proposal for a book that was to include Religion and Rocketry stating that This essay seems to have been written in rebuttal of an argument which is only likely to be brought forward by a rather silly minority though an academically distinguished one Hoyle would have been part of that academically distinguished but silly minority br Lewis also mentioned Professor Hoyle in his essay The Seeing Eye In The Seeing Eye Lewis challenged the conclusion of the Russian cosmonauts who concluded that there was no God since they did not find Him in outer space In that same essay Lewis claimed that Hoyle and many others were saying that life must have originated in many many times and places given the vast size of the universe He was referring to a series of broadcast talks that Hoyle had given in later published as The Nature of the Universe a series of talks that argued against a Christian view of origins and the uniqueness of the Christian faith Later in Hoyle championed the ancient theory of panspermia supported these days by Richard Dawkins that life on earth originated with the importation of living cells from space br The philosopher C E M Joad agreed with Lewis and concluded that the size of the universe and the span of time in which it formed did not have any necessary bearing upon our views as to the nature of the universe as a whole more particularly as regards its origin purpose destiny and end The enlargement of the scale of the universe did not reduce the importance of mankind Disagreeing with Hoyle Lewis thought it unlikely that life existed anywhere else in our solar system but that it was at least possible elsewhere in the galaxy He argued that those who do not find Him on earth are unlikely to find Him in space People with dogmatic preconceptions and scientists are not immune to such positions will find themselves looking for evidence to support their preconceived opinions Science is not equipped to do theology and evaluate the arguments for the existence of God and furthermore the discovery of life in other parts of the universe would have no effect upon Christianity br The essay itself starts with Lewis proclaiming two equal and opposite scientific proposals one that life only began on earth with the rarest of accidents and another proposed by Hoyle that life probably began in many places Both positions Lewis wrote claim to show the absurdity of the Christian belief in divine origins and the Incarnation of Christ There is nothing odd about arguments from two very different positions both being able to attack Christianity Since the world is full of many mutually inconsistent theories the combination of disagreements between them is multidimensional br The cogency of Hoyle s argument wrote Lewis was dependent upon five other questions which must be answered before we can give any credence to Hoyle br br Are there animals anywhere else besides earth br If yes do any of these animals have what we call rational souls That is are they spiritual beings br If there are such spiritual beings are any or all of them like us fallen br If any of them have fallen have they been denied Redemption by the Incarnation and Passion of Christ Christ could have come to those worlds also br Finally if all of the first four questions could be answered yes is it certain that this is the only possible mode of Redemption br In Paul s letter to the Romans Lewis argued God hints that the longing for redemption is cosmic and therefore not limited to this world Perhaps redemption has happened for all those who need it has happened through Christ s redemption and has somehow been extended to other creatures But we really don t know And to speculate about other creatures in other worlds takes us into the imaginative narrative that comprises Lewis s Ransom Trilogy especially Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra One paragraph of the essay in particular beginning with the words It is interesting to wonder imagines the scenario that Lewis spells out in Out of the Silent Planet We find Lewis speculating that the vast distances in the universe are God s quarantine precautions designed to prevent the rest of the universe from being contaminated by the corruption of our world The rest of the essay continues that speculation and I will leave it to the reader of this article to pursue the original article by Lewis and enjoy his speculation for itself br br br The World s Last Night Christian Hope Its Meaning for Today br The last essay was written by Lewis about the Second Coming using for its title and part of the original essay a phrase from the first line and title of a poem by seventeenth century poet John Donne That poem Holy Sonnet XIII What If This Present Were The World s Last Night raises the question of how we should live if the world were ending today Originally entitled Christian Hope Its Meaning for Today this essay was first printed in the periodical Religion in Life Winter Its purpose is stated in the first paragraph of the essay I shall endeavor to deal with some of the thoughts that may deter modern men from a firm belief in or a due attention to the return or Second Coming of the Saviour Dr Albert Schweitzer had overemphasized this doctrine but we should not compensate by underemphasizing it The essay especially focuses on the nature of Christ who was the God Man and it challenges the modern thought that history always produces progress He concludes by suggesting that we live our lives our vocations with the understanding that there is a judgment coming br br br External links br The World s Last Night and Other Essays at Faded Page Canada br Survey of C S Lewis s essays stories and other short pieces as
