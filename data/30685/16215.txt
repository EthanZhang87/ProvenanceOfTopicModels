John Milton December November was an English poet polemicist and civil servant His epic poem Paradise Lost written in blank verse and including twelve books was written in a time of immense religious flux and political upheaval It addressed the fall of man including the temptation of Adam and Eve by the fallen angel Satan and God s expulsion of them from the Garden of Eden Paradise Lost elevated Milton s reputation as one of history s greatest poets He also served as a civil servant for the Commonwealth of England under its Council of State and later under Oliver Cromwell br Milton achieved fame and recognition during his lifetime his celebrated Areopagitica written in condemnation of pre publication censorship is among history s most influential and impassioned defences of freedom of speech and freedom of the press His desire for freedom extended beyond his philosophy and was reflected in his style which included his introduction of new words coined from Latin and Ancient Greek to the English language He was the first modern writer to employ unrhymed verse outside of the theatre or translations br Milton is described as the greatest English author by his biographer William Hayley and he remains generally regarded as one of the preeminent writers in the English language though critical reception has oscillated in the centuries since his death often on account of his republicanism Samuel Johnson praised Paradise Lost as a poem which with respect to design may claim the first place and with respect to performance the second among the productions of the human mind though he a Tory described Milton s politics as those of an acrimonious and surly republican Milton was revered by poets such as William Blake William Wordsworth and Thomas Hardy br Phases of Milton s life parallel the major historical and political divisions in Stuart England at the time In his early years Milton studied at Christ s College Cambridge and then travelled wrote poetry mostly for private circulation and launched a career as pamphleteer and publicist under Charles I s increasingly autocratic rule and Britain s breakdown into constitutional confusion and ultimately civil war While once considered dangerously radical and heretical Milton contributed to a seismic shift in accepted public opinions during his life that ultimately elevated him to public office in England The Restoration of and his loss of vision later deprived Milton much of his public platform but he used the period to develop many of his major works br Milton s views developed from extensive reading travel and experience that began with his days as a student at Cambridge in the s and continued through the English Civil War which started in and continued until By the time of his death in Milton was impoverished and on the margins of English intellectual life but famous throughout Europe and unrepentant for political choices that placed him at odds with governing authorities br br John Milton was born in Bread Street London on December the son of composer John Milton and his wife Sarah Jeffrey The senior John Milton moved to London around after being disinherited by his devout Catholic father Richard the Ranger Milton for embracing Protestantism In London the senior John Milton married Sarah Jeffrey and found lasting financial success as a scrivener He lived in and worked from a house in Cheapside at Bread Street where the Mermaid Tavern was located The elder Milton was noted for his skill as a composer of music and this talent left his son with a lifelong appreciation for music and friendships with musicians such as Henry Lawes br The prosperity of Milton s father allowed his eldest son to obtain a private tutor Thomas Young a Scottish Presbyterian with an MA from the University of St Andrews Young s influence also served as the poet s introduction to religious radicalism After Young s tutorship Milton attended St Paul s School in London where he began the study of Latin and Greek the classical languages left an imprint on both his poetry and prose in English he also wrote in Latin and Italian br Milton s first datable compositions are two psalms written at age at Long Bennington One contemporary source is Brief Lives of John Aubrey an uneven compilation including first hand reports In the work Aubrey quotes Christopher Milton s younger brother When he was young he studied very hard and sat up very late commonly till twelve or one o clock at night Aubrey adds His complexion exceeding faire he was so faire that they called him the Lady of Christ s College br In Milton gained entry to Christ s College at the University of Cambridge where he graduated with a BA in ranking fourth of honours graduates that year in the University of Cambridge Preparing at that time to become an Anglican priest he stayed on at Cambridge where he received his MA on July br Milton may have been rusticated suspended in his first year at Cambridge for quarrelling with his tutor Bishop William Chappell He was certainly at home in London in the Lent Term there he wrote Elegia Prima his first Latin elegy to Charles Diodati a friend from St Paul s Based on remarks of John Aubrey Chappell whipt Milton This story is now disputed though certainly Milton disliked Chappell Historian Christopher Hill notes that Milton was apparently rusticated and that the differences between Chappell and Milton may have been either religious or personal It is also possible that like Isaac Newton four decades later Milton was sent home from Cambridge because of the plague which impacted Cambridge significantly in br At Cambridge Milton was on good terms with Edward King he later dedicated Lycidas to him Milton also befriended theologian Roger Williams tutoring Williams in Hebrew in exchange for lessons in Dutch Despite developing a reputation for poetic skill and general erudition Milton suffered from alienation among his peers during his time at Cambridge Having once watched his fellow students attempting comedy upon the college stage he later observed they thought themselves gallant men and I thought them fools br Milton also was disdainful of the university curriculum which consisted of stilted formal debates conducted in Latin on abstruse topics His own corpus is not devoid of humour notably his sixth prolusion and his epitaphs on the death of Thomas Hobson While at Cambridge he wrote a number of his well known shorter English poems including On the Morning of Christ s Nativity Epitaph on the admirable Dramaticke Poet W Shakespeare his first poem to appear in print L Allegro and Il Penseroso br br After receiving his MA Milton moved to Hammersmith his father s new home since the previous year He also lived at Horton Berkshire from and undertook six years of self directed private study Hill argues that this was not retreat into a rural idyll Hammersmith was then a suburban village falling into the orbit of London and even Horton was becoming deforested and suffered from the plague He read both ancient and modern works of theology philosophy history politics literature and science in preparation for a prospective poetical career Milton s intellectual development can be charted via entries in his commonplace book like a scrapbook now in the British Library As a result of such intensive study Milton is considered to be among the most learned of all English poets In addition to his years of private study Milton had command of Latin Greek Hebrew French Spanish and Italian from his school and undergraduate days he also added Old English to his linguistic repertoire in the s while researching his History of Britain and probably acquired proficiency in Dutch soon after br br Milton continued to write poetry during this period of study his Arcades and Comus were both commissioned for masques composed for noble patrons connections of the Egerton family and performed in and respectively Comus argues for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity He contributed his pastoral elegy Lycidas to a memorial collection for one of his fellow students at Cambridge Drafts of these poems are preserved in Milton s poetry notebook known as the Trinity Manuscript because it is now kept at Trinity College Cambridge br In May accompanied by a manservant Milton embarked upon a tour of France and Italy for months that lasted until July or August His travels supplemented his study with new and direct experience of artistic and religious traditions especially Roman Catholicism He met famous theorists and intellectuals of the time and was able to display his poetic skills For specific details of what happened within Milton s grand tour there appears to be just one primary source Milton s own Defensio Secunda There are other records including some letters and some references in his other prose tracts but the bulk of the information about the tour comes from a work that according to Barbara Lewalski was not intended as autobiography but as rhetoric designed to emphasise his sterling reputation with the learned of Europe br He first went to Calais and then on to Paris riding horseback with a letter from diplomat Henry Wotton to ambassador John Scudamore Through Scudamore Milton met Hugo Grotius a Dutch law philosopher playwright and poet Milton left France soon after this meeting He travelled south from Nice to Genoa and then to Livorno and Pisa He reached Florence in July While there Milton enjoyed many of the sites and structures of the city His candour of manner and erudite neo Latin poetry earned him friends in Florentine intellectual circles and he met the astronomer Galileo who was under house arrest at Arcetri as well as others Milton probably visited the Florentine Academy and the Accademia della Crusca along with smaller academies in the area including the Apatisti and the Svogliati br br He left Florence in September to continue to Rome With the connections from Florence Milton was able to have easy access to Rome s intellectual society His poetic abilities impressed those like Giovanni Salzilli who praised Milton within an epigram In late October Milton attended a dinner given by the English College Rome despite his dislike for the Society of Jesus meeting English Catholics who were also guests theologian Henry Holden and the poet Patrick Cary He also attended musical events including oratorios operas and melodramas Milton left for Naples toward the end of November where he stayed only for a month because of the Spanish control During that time he was introduced to Giovanni Battista Manso patron to both Torquato Tasso and to Giambattista Marino br Originally Milton wanted to leave Naples in order to travel to Sicily and then on to Greece but he returned to England during the summer of because of what he claimed in Defensio Secunda were sad tidings of civil war in England Matters became more complicated when Milton received word that his childhood friend Diodati had died Milton in fact stayed another seven months on the continent and spent time at Geneva with Diodati s uncle after he returned to Rome In Defensio Secunda Milton proclaimed that he was warned against a return to Rome because of his frankness about religion but he stayed in the city for two months and was able to experience Carnival and meet Lukas Holste a Vatican librarian who guided Milton through its collection He was introduced to Cardinal Francesco Barberini who invited Milton to an opera hosted by the Cardinal Around March Milton travelled once again to Florence staying there for two months attending further meetings of the academies and spending time with friends After leaving Florence he travelled through Lucca Bologna and Ferrara before coming to Venice In Venice Milton was exposed to a model of Republicanism later important in his political writings but he soon found another model when he travelled to Geneva From Switzerland Milton travelled to Paris and then to Calais before finally arriving back in England in either July or August br br On returning to England where the Bishops Wars presaged further armed conflict Milton began to write prose tracts against episcopacy in the service of the Puritan and Parliamentary cause Milton s first foray into polemics was Of Reformation touching Church Discipline in England followed by Of Prelatical Episcopacy the two defences of Smectymnuus a group of Presbyterian divines named from their initials the TY belonged to Milton s old tutor Thomas Young and The Reason of Church Government Urged against Prelaty He vigorously attacked the High church party of the Church of England and their leader William Laud Archbishop of Canterbury with frequent passages of real eloquence lighting up the rough controversial style of the period and deploying a wide knowledge of church history br He was supported by his father s investments but Milton became a private schoolmaster at this time educating his nephews and other children of the well to do This experience and discussions with educational reformer Samuel Hartlib led him to write his short tract Of Education in urging a reform of the national universities br In June Milton paid a visit to the manor house at Forest Hill Oxfordshire and aged married the year old Mary Powell The marriage got off to a poor start as Mary did not adapt to Milton s austere lifestyle or get along with his nephews Milton found her intellectually unsatisfying and disliked the royalist views she had absorbed from her family It is also speculated that she refused to consummate the marriage Mary soon returned home to her parents and did not come back until partly because of the outbreak of the Civil War br In the meantime her desertion prompted Milton to publish a series of pamphlets over the next three years arguing for the legality and morality of divorce beyond grounds of adultery Anna Beer author of a biography of Milton points to a lack of evidence and the dangers of cynicism in urging that it was not necessarily the case that the private life so animated the public polemicising In Milton had a brush with the authorities over these writings in parallel with Hezekiah Woodward who had more trouble It was the hostile response accorded the divorce tracts that spurred Milton to write Areopagitica A speech of Mr John Milton for the Liberty of Unlicenc d Printing to the Parlament of England his celebrated attack on pre printing censorship In Areopagitica Milton aligns himself with the parliamentary cause and he also begins to synthesize the ideal of neo Roman liberty with that of Christian liberty Milton also courted another woman during this time we know nothing of her except that her name was Davis and she turned him down However it was enough to induce Mary Powell into returning to him which she did unexpectedly by begging him to take her back They had two daughters in quick succession following their reconciliation br br With the Parliamentary victory in the Civil War Milton used his pen in defence of the republican principles represented by the Commonwealth The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates defended the right of the people to hold their rulers to account and implicitly sanctioned the regicide Milton s political reputation got him appointed Secretary for Foreign Tongues by the Council of State in March His main job description was to compose the English Republic s foreign correspondence in Latin and other languages but he also was called upon to produce propaganda for the regime and to serve as a censor br br In October he published Eikonoklastes an explicit defence of the regicide in response to the Eikon Basilike a phenomenal best seller popularly attributed to Charles I that portrayed the King as an innocent Christian martyr A month later the exiled Charles II and his party published the defence of monarchy Defensio Regia pro Carolo Primo written by leading humanist Claudius Salmasius By January of the following year Milton was ordered to write a defence of the English people by the Council of State Milton worked more slowly than usual given the European audience and the English Republic s desire to establish diplomatic and cultural legitimacy as he drew on the learning marshalled by his years of study to compose a riposte br On February Milton published his Latin defence of the English people Defensio pro Populo Anglicano also known as the First Defence Milton s pure Latin prose and evident learning exemplified in the First Defence quickly made him a European reputation and the work ran to numerous editions He addressed his Sonnet to The Lord Generall Cromwell in May beginning Cromwell our chief of men although it was not published until br In Milton completed the second defence of the English nation Defensio secunda in response to an anonymous Royalist tract Regii Sanguinis Clamor ad Coelum Adversus Parricidas Anglicanos The Cry of the Royal Blood to Heaven Against the English Parricides a work that made many personal attacks on Milton The second defence praised Oliver Cromwell now Lord Protector while exhorting him to remain true to the principles of the Revolution Alexander Morus to whom Milton wrongly attributed the Clamor in fact by Peter du Moulin published an attack on Milton in response to which Milton published the autobiographical Defensio pro se in Milton held the appointment of Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Commonwealth Council of State until although after he had become totally blind most of the work was done by his deputies Georg Rudolph Wecklein then Philip Meadows and from by the poet Andrew Marvell br By Milton had become totally blind the cause of his blindness is debated but bilateral retinal detachment or glaucoma are most likely His blindness forced him to dictate his verse and prose to amanuenses who copied them out for him one of these was Andrew Marvell One of his best known sonnets When I Consider How My Light is Spent titled by a later editor John Newton On His Blindness is presumed to date from this period br br Cromwell s death in caused the English Republic to collapse into feuding military and political factions Milton however stubbornly clung to the beliefs that had originally inspired him to write for the Commonwealth In he published A Treatise of Civil Power attacking the concept of a state dominated church the position known as Erastianism as well as Considerations touching the likeliest means to remove hirelings denouncing corrupt practises in church governance As the Republic disintegrated Milton wrote several proposals to retain a non monarchical government against the wishes of parliament soldiers and the people br br A Letter to a Friend Concerning the Ruptures of the Commonwealth written in October was a response to General Lambert s recent dissolution of the Rump Parliament br Proposals of certain expedients for the preventing of a civil war now feared written in November br The Ready and Easy Way to Establishing a Free Commonwealth in two editions responded to General Monck s march towards London to restore the Long Parliament which led to the restoration of the monarchy The work is an impassioned bitter and futile jeremiad damning the English people for backsliding from the cause of liberty and advocating the establishment of an authoritarian rule by an oligarchy set up by an unelected parliament br Upon the Restoration in May Milton fearing for his life went into hiding while a warrant was issued for his arrest and his writings were burnt He re emerged after a general pardon was issued but was nevertheless arrested and briefly imprisoned before influential friends intervened such as Marvell now an MP Milton married for a third and final time on February marrying Elizabeth Betty Minshull aged a native of Wistaston Cheshire He spent the remaining decade of his life living quietly in London only retiring to a cottage during the Great Plague of London Milton s Cottage in Chalfont St Giles his only extant home br During this period Milton published several minor prose works such as the grammar textbook Art of Logic and a History of Britain His only explicitly political tracts were the Of True Religion arguing for toleration except for Catholics and a translation of a Polish tract advocating an elective monarchy Both these works were referred to in the Exclusion debate the attempt to exclude the heir presumptive from the throne of England James Duke of York because he was Roman Catholic That debate preoccupied politics in the s and s and precipitated the formation of the Whig party and the Glorious Revolution br br Milton died on November just a month before his th birthday He was buried in the church of St Giles without Cripplegate Fore Street London However sources differ as to whether the cause of death was consumption or gout According to an early biographer his funeral was attended by his learned and great Friends in London not without a friendly concourse of the Vulgar A monument was added in sculpted by John Bacon the Elder br br Milton and his first wife Mary Powell had four children br br Anne born July br Mary born October br John March June br Deborah May August br Mary Powell died on May from complications following Deborah s birth Milton s daughters survived to adulthood but he always had a strained relationship with them br On November Milton was married to Katherine Woodcock at St Margaret s Westminster She died on February less than four months after giving birth to her daughter Katherine who also died br Milton married for a third time on February to Elizabeth Mynshull or Minshull the niece of Thomas Mynshull a wealthy apothecary and philanthropist in Manchester The marriage took place at St Mary Aldermary in the City of London Despite a year age gap the marriage seemed happy according to John Aubrey and lasted more than years until Milton s death A plaque on the wall of Mynshull s House in Manchester describes Elizabeth as Milton s rd and Best wife Samuel Johnson however claims that Mynshull was a domestic companion and attendant and Milton s nephew Edward Phillips relates that Mynshull oppressed his children in his lifetime and cheated them at his death br His nephews Edward and John Phillips sons of Milton s sister Anne were educated by Milton and became writers themselves John acted as a secretary and Edward was Milton s first biographer br br Milton s poetry was slow to see the light of day at least under his name His first published poem was On Shakespeare anonymously included in the Second Folio edition of William Shakespeare s plays in An annotated copy of the First Folio has been suggested to contain marginal notes by Milton Milton collected his work in Poems in the midst of the excitement attending the possibility of establishing a new English government The anonymous edition of Comus was published in and the publication of Lycidas in in Justa Edouardo King Naufrago was signed J M Otherwise The collection was the only poetry of his to see print until Paradise Lost appeared in br br Milton s magnum opus the blank verse epic poem Paradise Lost was composed by the blind and impoverished Milton from to first edition with small but significant revisions published in second edition As a blind poet Milton dictated his verse to a series of aides in his employ It has been argued that the poem reflects his personal despair at the failure of the Revolution yet affirms an ultimate optimism in human potential Some literary critics have argued that Milton encoded many references to his unyielding support for the Good Old Cause br On April Milton sold the publication rights for Paradise Lost to publisher Samuel Simmons for equivalent to approximately in purchasing power with a further to be paid if and when each print run sold out of between and copies The first run was a quarto edition priced at three shillings per copy about in purchasing power equivalent published in August and it sold out in eighteen months br Milton followed up the publication Paradise Lost with its sequel Paradise Regained which was published alongside the tragedy Samson Agonistes in Both of these works also reflect Milton s post Restoration political situation Just before his death in Milton supervised a second edition of Paradise Lost accompanied by an explanation of why the poem rhymes not and prefatory verses by Andrew Marvell In Milton republished his Poems as well as a collection of his letters and the Latin prolusions from his Cambridge days br br An unfinished religious manifesto De doctrina christiana probably written by Milton lays out many of his heterodox theological views and was not discovered and published until Milton s key beliefs were idiosyncratic not those of an identifiable group or faction and often they go well beyond the orthodoxy of the time Their tone however stemmed from the Puritan emphasis on the centrality and inviolability of conscience He was his own man but he was anticipated by Henry Robinson in Areopagitica br br While Milton s beliefs are generally considered to be consistent with Protestant Christianity Stephen Fallon argues that by the late s Milton may have at least toyed with the idea of monism or animist materialism the notion that a single material substance which is animate self active and free composes everything in the universe from stones and trees and bodies to minds souls angels and God Fallon claims that Milton devised this position to avoid the mind body dualism of Plato and Descartes as well as the mechanistic determinism of Hobbes According to Fallon Milton s monism is most notably reflected in Paradise Lost when he has angels eat and apparently engage in sexual intercourse and the De Doctrina where he denies the dual natures of man and argues for a theory of Creation ex Deo br br Milton was a passionately individual Christian Humanist poet He appears on the pages of seventeenth century English Puritanism an age characterized as the world turned upside down He was a Puritan and yet was unwilling to surrender conscience to party positions on public policy Thus Milton s political thought driven by competing convictions a Reformed faith and a Humanist spirit led to enigmatic outcomes Milton s apparently contradictory stance on the vital problems of his age arose from religious contestations to the questions of the divine rights of kings In both the cases he seems in control taking stock of the situation arising from the polarization of the English society on religious and political lines He fought with the Puritans against the Cavaliers i e the King s party and helped win the day But the very same constitutional and republican polity when tried to curtail freedom of speech Milton given his humanistic zeal wrote Areopagitica sic some of humanity s first scriptures on freedom of speech Allow honest arguments to ignore attacks It is foolish to doubt the power of education and leave others waiting Letting it become impossible to cope I have seen cases where people can refuse to show up and make themselves known in public competitions Areopagitica was written in response to the Licensing Order in November br Milton s political thought may be best categorized according to respective periods in his life and times The years were dedicated to church politics and the struggle against episcopacy After his divorce writings Areopagitica and a gap he wrote in in the aftermath of the execution of Charles I and in polemic justification of the regicide and the existing Parliamentarian regime Then in he foresaw the Restoration and wrote to head it off br Milton s own beliefs were in some cases unpopular particularly his commitment to republicanism In coming centuries Milton would be claimed as an early apostle of liberalism According to James Tully br br with Locke as with Milton republican and contraction conceptions of political freedom join hands in common opposition to the disengaged and passive subjection offered by absolutists such as Hobbes and Robert Filmer br A friend and ally in the pamphlet wars was Marchamont Nedham Austin Woolrych considers that although they were quite close there is little real affinity beyond a broad republicanism between their approaches Blair Worden remarks that both Milton and Nedham with others such as Andrew Marvell and James Harrington would have taken their problem with the Rump Parliament to be not the republic itself but the fact that it was not a proper republic Woolrych speaks of the gulf between Milton s vision of the Commonwealth s future and the reality In the early version of his History of Britain begun in Milton was already writing off the members of the Long Parliament as incorrigible br He praised Oliver Cromwell as the Protectorate was set up though subsequently he had major reservations When Cromwell seemed to be backsliding as a revolutionary after a couple of years in power Milton moved closer to the position of Sir Henry Vane to whom he wrote a sonnet in The group of disaffected republicans included besides Vane John Bradshaw John Hutchinson Edmund Ludlow Henry Marten Robert Overton Edward Sexby and John Streater but not Marvell who remained with Cromwell s party Milton had already commended Overton along with Edmund Whalley and Bulstrode Whitelocke in Defensio Secunda Nigel Smith writes that br br John Streater and the form of republicanism he stood for was a fulfilment of Milton s most optimistic ideas of free speech and of public heroism br As Richard Cromwell fell from power he envisaged a step towards a freer republic or free commonwealth writing in the hope of this outcome in early Milton had argued for an awkward position in the Ready and Easy Way because he wanted to invoke the Good Old Cause and gain the support of the republicans but without offering a democratic solution of any kind His proposal backed by reference amongst other reasons to the oligarchical Dutch and Venetian constitutions was for a council with perpetual membership This attitude cut right across the grain of popular opinion of the time which swung decisively behind the restoration of the Stuart monarchy that took place later in the year Milton an associate of and advocate on behalf of the regicides was silenced on political matters as Charles II returned br br John Milton was neither a clergyman nor a theologian however theology and particularly English Calvinism formed the palette on which he created his greatest thoughts Milton wrestled with the great doctrines of the Church amidst the theological crosswinds of his age The great poet was undoubtedly Reformed though his grandfather Richard the Ranger Milton had been Roman Catholic However Milton s Calvinism had to find expression in a broad spirited Humanism Like many Renaissance artists before him Milton attempted to integrate Christian theology with classical modes In his early poems the poet narrator expresses a tension between vice and virtue the latter invariably related to Protestantism In Comus Milton may make ironic use of the Caroline court masque by elevating notions of purity and virtue over the conventions of court revelry and superstition In his later poems Milton s theological concerns become more explicit br His use of biblical citation was wide ranging Harris Fletcher standing at the beginning of the intensification of the study of the use of scripture in Milton s work poetry and prose in all languages Milton mastered notes that typically Milton clipped and adapted biblical quotations to suit the purpose giving precise chapter and verse only in texts for a more specialized readership As for the plenitude of Milton s quotations from scripture Fletcher comments For this work I have in all actually collated about twenty five hundred of the five to ten thousand direct Biblical quotations which appear therein Milton s customary English Bible was the Authorized King James When citing and writing in other languages he usually employed the Latin translation by Immanuel Tremellius though he was equipped to read the Bible in Latin in Greek and in Hebrew including the Targumim or Aramaic paraphrases of the Old Testament and the Syriac version of the New together with the available commentaries of those several versions br Milton embraced many heterodox Christian theological views He has been accused of rejecting the Trinity believing instead that the Son was subordinate to the Father a position known as Arianism and his sympathy or curiosity was probably engaged by Socinianism in August he licensed for publication by William Dugard the Racovian Catechism based on a non trinitarian creed Milton s alleged Arianism like much of his theology is still subject of debate and controversy Rufus Wilmot Griswold argued that In none of his great works is there a passage from which it can be inferred that he was an Arian and in the very last of his writings he declares that the doctrine of the Trinity is a plain doctrine in Scripture In Areopagitica Milton classified Arians and Socinians as errorists and schismatics alongside Arminians and Anabaptists A source has interpreted him as broadly Protestant if not always easy to locate in a more precise religious category In John Rogers stated Heretics both John Milton and Isaac Newton were as most scholars now agree Arians br In his treatise Of Reformation Milton expressed his dislike for Catholicism and episcopacy presenting Rome as a modern Babylon and bishops as Egyptian taskmasters These analogies conform to Milton s puritanical preference for Old Testament imagery He knew at least four commentaries on Genesis those of John Calvin Paulus Fagius David Pareus and Andreus Rivetus br Through the Interregnum Milton often presents England rescued from the trappings of a worldly monarchy as an elect nation akin to the Old Testament Israel and shows its leader Oliver Cromwell as a latter day Moses These views were bound up in Protestant views of the Millennium which some sects such as the Fifth Monarchists predicted would arrive in England Milton however would later criticise the worldly millenarian views of these and others and expressed orthodox ideas on the prophecy of the Four Empires br The Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in began a new phase in Milton s work In Paradise Lost Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes Milton mourns the end of the godly Commonwealth The Garden of Eden may allegorically reflect Milton s view of England s recent Fall from Grace while Samson s blindness and captivity mirroring Milton s own lost sight may be a metaphor for England s blind acceptance of Charles II as king Illustrated by Paradise Lost is mortalism the belief that the soul lies dormant after the body dies br Despite the Restoration of the monarchy Milton did not lose his personal faith Samson shows how the loss of national salvation did not necessarily preclude the salvation of the individual while Paradise Regained expresses Milton s continuing belief in the promise of Christian salvation through Jesus Christ br Though he maintained his personal faith in spite of the defeats suffered by his cause the Dictionary of National Biography recounted how he had been alienated from the Church of England by Archbishop William Laud and then moved similarly from the Dissenters by their denunciation of religious tolerance in England br br Milton had come to stand apart from all sects though apparently finding the Quakers most congenial He never went to any religious services in his later years When a servant brought back accounts of sermons from nonconformist meetings Milton became so sarcastic that the man at last gave up his place Writing of the enigmatic and often conflicting views of Milton in the Puritan age David Daiches wrote Christian and Humanist Protestant patriot and heir of the golden ages of Greece and Rome he faced what appeared to him to be the birth pangs of a new and regenerate England with high excitement and idealistic optimism A fair theological summary may be that John Milton was a Puritan though his tendency to press further for liberty of conscience sometimes out of conviction and often out of mere intellectual curiosity made the great man at least a vital if not uncomfortable ally in the broader Puritan movement br br Milton called in the Areopagitica for the liberty to know to utter and to argue freely according to conscience above all liberties to the conflicting Protestant denominations According to American historian William Hunter Milton argued for disestablishment as the only effective way of achieving broad toleration Rather than force a man s conscience government should recognise the persuasive force of the gospel br br Milton wrote The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce in at the beginning of the English Civil War In August of that year he presented his thoughts to the Westminster Assembly of Divines which had been created by the Long Parliament to bring greater reform to the Church of England The Assembly convened on July against the will of King Charles I br Milton s thinking on divorce caused him considerable trouble with the authorities An orthodox Presbyterian view of the time was that Milton s views on divorce constituted a one man heresy br br The fervently Presbyterian Edwards had included Milton s divorce tracts in his list in Gangraena of heretical publications that threatened the religious and moral fabric of the nation Milton responded by mocking him as shallow Edwards in the satirical sonnet On the New Forcers of Conscience under the Long Parliament usually dated to the latter half of br Even here though his originality is qualified Thomas Gataker had already identified mutual solace as a principal goal in marriage Milton abandoned his campaign to legitimise divorce after but he expressed support for polygamy in the De Doctrina Christiana the theological treatise that provides the clearest evidence for his views br Milton wrote during a period when thoughts about divorce were anything but simplistic rather there was active debate among thinkers and intellectuals at the time However Milton s basic approval of divorce within strict parameters set by the biblical witness was typical of many influential Christian intellectuals particularly the Westminster divines Milton addressed the Assembly on the matter of divorce in August at a moment when the Assembly was beginning to form its opinion on the matter In the Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce Milton argued that divorce was a private matter not a legal or ecclesiastical one Neither the Assembly nor Parliament condemned Milton or his ideas In fact when the Westminster Assembly wrote the Westminster Confession of Faith they allowed for divorce Of Marriage and Divorce Chapter Section in cases of infidelity or abandonment Thus the Christian community at least a majority within the Puritan sub set approved of Milton s views br Nevertheless reaction among Puritans to Milton s views on divorce was mixed Herbert Palmer a member of the Westminster Assembly condemned Milton in the strongest possible language br br If any plead Conscience for divorce for other causes than Christ and His Apostles mention Of which a wicked booke is abroad and uncensured though deserving to be burnt whose Author hath been so impudent as to set his Name to it and dedicate it to your selves will you grant a Toleration for all this br Palmer expressed his disapproval in a sermon addressed to the Westminster Assembly The Scottish commissioner Robert Baillie described Palmer s sermon as one of the most Scottish and free sermons that ever I heard any where br br History was particularly important for the political class of the period and Lewalski considers that Milton more than most illustrates a remark of Thomas Hobbes on the weight placed at the time on the classical Latin historical writers Tacitus Livy Sallust and Cicero and their republican attitudes Milton himself wrote that Worthy deeds are not often destitute of worthy relaters in Book II of his History of Britain A sense of history mattered greatly to him br br The course of human history the immediate impact of the civil disorders and his own traumatic personal life are all regarded by Milton as typical of the predicament he describes as the misery that has bin since Adam br br Once Paradise Lost was published Milton s stature as epic poet was immediately recognised He cast a formidable shadow over English poetry in the th and th centuries he was often judged equal or superior to all other English poets including Shakespeare Very early on though he was championed by Whigs and decried by Tories with the regicide Edmund Ludlow he was claimed as an early Whig while the High Tory Anglican minister Luke Milbourne lumped Milton in with other Agents of Darkness such as John Knox George Buchanan Richard Baxter Algernon Sidney and John Locke The political ideas of Milton Locke Sidney and James Harrington strongly influenced the Radical Whigs whose ideology in turn was central to the American Revolution Modern scholars of Milton s life politics and work are known as Miltonists his work is the subject of a very large amount of academic scholarship br In John Milton Passage a short passage by Bread Street into St Mary le Bow Churchyard in London was unveiled br br John Dryden an early enthusiast in began the trend of describing Milton as the poet of the sublime Dryden s The State of Innocence and the Fall of Man an Opera is evidence of an immediate cultural influence In Patrick Hume became the first editor of Paradise Lost providing an extensive apparatus of annotation and commentary particularly chasing down allusions br In the classical scholar Richard Bentley offered a corrected version of Paradise Lost Bentley was considered presumptuous and was attacked in the following year by Zachary Pearce Christopher Ricks judges that as critic Bentley was both acute and wrong headed and incorrigibly eccentric William Empson also finds Pearce to be more sympathetic to Bentley s underlying line of thought than is warranted br There was an early partial translation of Paradise Lost into German by Theodore Haak and based on that a standard verse translation by Ernest Gottlieb von Berge A subsequent prose translation by Johann Jakob Bodmer was very popular it influenced Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock The German language Milton tradition returned to England in the person of the artist Henry Fuseli br Many Enlightenment thinkers of the th century revered and commented on Milton s poetry and non poetical works In addition to John Dryden among them were Alexander Pope Joseph Addison Thomas Newton and Samuel Johnson For example in The Spectator Joseph Addison wrote extensive notes annotations and interpretations of certain passages of Paradise Lost Jonathan Richardson senior and Jonathan Richardson the younger co wrote a book of criticism In Thomas Newton published an extensive edition of Milton s poetical works with annotations provided by himself Dryden Pope Addison the Richardsons father and son and others Newton s edition of Milton was a culmination of the honour bestowed upon Milton by early Enlightenment thinkers it may also have been prompted by Richard Bentley s infamous edition described above Samuel Johnson wrote numerous essays on Paradise Lost and Milton was included in his Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets In The Age of Louis XIV Voltaire said Milton remains the glory and the wonder l admiration of England br br William Blake considered Milton the major English poet Blake placed Edmund Spenser as Milton s precursor and saw himself as Milton s poetical son In his Milton A Poem in Two Books Blake uses Milton as a spiritual guide and a symbol of poetic inspiration br br Edmund Burke was a theorist of the sublime and he regarded Milton s description of Hell as exemplary of sublimity as an aesthetic concept For Burke it was to set alongside mountain tops a storm at sea and infinity In The Beautiful and the Sublime he wrote No person seems better to have understood the secret of heightening or of setting terrible things if I may use the expression in their strongest light by the force of a judicious obscurity than Milton br The Romantic poets valued his exploration of blank verse but for the most part rejected his religiosity William Wordsworth began his sonnet London with Milton thou should st be living at this hour and modelled The Prelude his own blank verse epic on Paradise Lost John Keats found the yoke of Milton s style uncongenial he exclaimed that Miltonic verse cannot be written but in an artful or rather artist s humour Keats felt that Paradise Lost was a beautiful and grand curiosity but his own unfinished attempt at epic poetry Hyperion was unsatisfactory to the author because amongst other things it had too many Miltonic inversions In The Madwoman in the Attic Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar note that Mary Shelley s novel Frankenstein is in the view of many critics one of the key Romantic readings of Paradise Lost br br The Victorian age witnessed a continuation of Milton s influence Thomas Carlyle declared him the moral king of English literature while George Eliot and Thomas Hardy were particularly inspired by Milton s poetry and biography Hostile th century criticism by T S Eliot and Ezra Pound did not reduce Milton s stature F R Leavis in The Common Pursuit responded to the points made by Eliot in particular the claim that the study of Milton could be of no help it was only a hindrance by arguing As if it were a matter of deciding not to study Milton The problem rather was to escape from an influence that was so difficult to escape from because it was unrecognized belonging as it did to the climate of the habitual and natural Harold Bloom in The Anxiety of Influence wrote that Milton is the central problem in any theory and history of poetic influence in English br Milton s Areopagitica is still cited as relevant to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution A quotation from Areopagitica A good book is the precious lifeblood of a master spirit embalmed and treasured up on purpose to a life beyond life is displayed in many public libraries including the New York Public Library br The title of Philip Pullman s His Dark Materials trilogy is derived from a quotation His dark materials to create more worlds line of Book II in Paradise Lost Pullman was concerned to produce a version of Milton s poem accessible to teenagers and has spoken of Milton as our greatest public poet br Titles of a number of other well known literary works are also derived from Milton s writings Examples include Thomas Wolfe s Look Homeward Angel Aldous Huxley s Eyeless in Gaza Arthur Koestler s Darkness at Noon and William Golding s Darkness Visible br T S Eliot believed that of no other poet is it so difficult to consider the poetry simply as poetry without our theological and political dispositions making unlawful entry br br Milton s use of blank verse in addition to his stylistic innovations such as grandiloquence of voice and vision peculiar diction and phraseology influenced later poets At the time poetic blank verse was considered distinct from its use in verse drama and Paradise Lost was taken as a unique exemplar Said Isaac Watts in Mr Milton is esteemed the parent and author of blank verse among us Miltonic verse might be synonymous for a century with blank verse as poetry a new poetic terrain independent from both the drama and the heroic couplet br Lack of rhyme was sometimes taken as Milton s defining innovation He himself considered the rhymeless quality of Paradise Lost to be an extension of his own personal liberty br br This neglect then of Rhime is to be esteem d an example set the first in English of ancient liberty recover d to heroic Poem from the troublesom and modern bondage of Rimeing br This pursuit of freedom was largely a reaction against conservative values entrenched within the rigid heroic couplet Within a dominant culture that stressed elegance and finish he granted primacy to freedom breadth and imaginative suggestiveness eventually developed into the romantic vision of sublime terror Reaction to Milton s poetic worldview included grudgingly acknowledgement of the poet s resemblance to classical writers Greek and Roman poetry being unrhymed Blank verse came to be a recognised medium for religious works and for translations of the classics Unrhymed lyrics like Collins Ode to Evening in the meter of Milton s translation of Horace s Ode to Pyrrha were not uncommon after br A second aspect of Milton s blank verse was the use of unconventional rhythm br br His blank verse paragraph and his audacious and victorious attempt to combine blank and rhymed verse with paragraphic effect in Lycidas lay down indestructible models and patterns of English verse rhythm as distinguished from the narrower and more strait laced forms of English metre br Before Milton the sense of regular rhythm had been knocked into the English head so securely that it was part of their nature The Heroick measure according to Samuel Johnson is pure when the accent rests upon every second syllable through the whole line The repetition of this sound or percussion at equal times is the most complete harmony of which a single verse is capable Caesural pauses most agreed were best placed at the middle and the end of the line In order to support this symmetry lines were most often octo or deca syllabic with no enjambed endings To this schema Milton introduced modifications which included hypermetrical syllables trisyllabic feet inversion or slighting of stresses and the shifting of pauses to all parts of the line Milton deemed these features to be reflective of the transcendental union of order and freedom Admirers remained hesitant to adopt such departures from traditional metrical schemes The English had been writing separate lines for so long that they could not rid themselves of the habit Isaac Watts preferred his lines distinct from each other as did Oliver Goldsmith Henry Pemberton and Scott of Amwell whose general opinion it was that Milton s frequent omission of the initial unaccented foot was displeasing to a nice ear It was not until the late th century that poets beginning with Gray began to appreciate the composition of Milton s harmony how he loved to vary his pauses his measures and his feet which gives that enchanting air of freedom and wilderness to his versification By the th century American poet and critic John Hollander would go so far as to say that Milton was able by plying that most remarkable instrument of English meter to invent a new mode of image making in English poetry br Milton s pursuit of liberty extended into his vocabulary as well It included many Latinate neologisms as well as obsolete words already dropped from popular usage so completely that their meanings were no longer understood In Francis Peck identified some examples of Milton s old words now popular The Miltonian dialect as it was called was emulated by later poets Pope used the diction of Paradise Lost in his Homer translation while the lyric poetry of Gray and Collins was frequently criticised for their use of obsolete words out of Spenser and Milton The language of Thomson s finest poems e g The Seasons The Castle of Indolence was self consciously modelled after the Miltonian dialect with the same tone and sensibilities as Paradise Lost Following to Milton English poetry from Pope to John Keats exhibited a steadily increasing attention to the connotative the imaginative and poetic value of words br br Milton s ode At a solemn Musick was set for choir and orchestra as Blest Pair of Sirens by Hubert Parry and Milton s poem
