Pistacia terebinthus also called the terebinth and the turpentine tree is a deciduous shrub species of the genus Pistacia native to the Mediterranean region from the western regions of Morocco and Portugal to Greece and western and southeastern Turkey At one time terebinths growing on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea in Syria Lebanon and Palestine were regarded as a separate species Pistacia palaestina but these are now considered to be a synonym of P terebinthus br br br Description br The terebinth is a deciduous flowering plant belonging to the cashew family Anacardiaceae a small tree or large shrub it grows to m ft tall The leaves are compound cm in long odd pinnate with five to eleven opposite glossy oval leaflets the leaflets cm in long and cm in broad The flowers are reddish purple appearing with the new leaves in early spring The fruit consists of small globular drupes mm in long red to black when ripe All parts of the plant have a strong resinous smell br The terebinth is a dioecious tree i e it exists as male and female specimens For a viable population both sexes must be present The oblong leaf is bright green leathery with cm in long or more with three to nine leaflets Leaves alternate leathery and compound paripinnate no terminal leaflet with three or six deep green leaflets They are generally larger and rounder than the leaves of the mastic reminiscent of the leaves of carob tree The flowers range from purple to green the fruit is the size of a pea and turns from red to brown depending on the degree of maturation The whole plant emits a strong smell bitter resinous or medicinal In the vegetative period they develop galls shaped like a goat s horn from which the plant gets the name cornicabra the common name in Spanish that occur on the leaves and leaflets which have been bitten by insects br The species propagates by seeds and shoots Although marred by the presence of galls it is a very strong and resistant tree which survives in degraded areas where other species have been eliminated Pistacia terebinthus is related to Pistacia lentiscus with which it hybridizes frequently in contact zones Pistacia terebinthus is more abundant in the mountains and inland and the mastic is usually found more frequently in areas where the Mediterranean influence of the sea moderates the climate The mastic tree does not reach the size of the Pistacia terebinthus but the hybrids are very difficult to distinguish The mastic has winged stalks to its leaflets i e the stalks are flattened and with side fins whereas these stems in Pistacia terebinthus are simple On the west coast of the Mediterranean Canary Islands and Middle East P terebinthus can be confused with P atlantica br br br Habitat br br The terebinth prefers relatively moist areas up to m ft in elevation It tolerates more intense frost and summer drought than mastic can The plant is common in the garrigue and maquis It appears in deciduous oak wood It has a gray trunk that is very aromatic and may have multiple trunks or stems when grown as a shrub Usually reaching m ft in height although in rare cases can reach m ft P terebinthus is one of the European species of Anacardiaceae a family of about mostly tropical species It can be found to m ft above sea level P terebinthus is more moisture demanding than the mastic and more resistant to cold It requires a sunny exposure and average soils tolerating lime and some salt often grows near the sea deep ravines and near salt lakes and streams br br br History br Historian of Mycenae John Chadwick believes that the terebinth is the plant called ki ta no in some of the Linear B tablets He cites the work of a Spanish scholar J L Melena who had found an ancient lexicon which showed that kritanos was another name for the turpentine tree and that the Mycenaean spelling could represent a variant form of this word br The Latin name is underlain by the Ancient Greek name which in turn is underlain by a pre Greek Pelasgian word marked by the characteristic consonant complex br Terebinth from Oricum is referred to in Virgil s Aeneid Book line where Ascanius in battle is compared to ivory skilfully inlaid in Orician terebinth inclusum Oricia terebintho ebur br Terebinth is referred to by Robin Lane Fox in Alexander the Great When a Persian king took the throne he attended Pasargadae site of King Cyrus s tomb and dressed in a rough leather uniform to eat a ritual meal of figs sour milk and leaves of terebinth br The terebinth is mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures or Old Testament where the Hebrew word elah plural elot is used although the word is sometimes translated as oak It is clear that the translators are uncertain which translation is correct yet the two are very different trees to any but the most superficial observation The Hebrew word alon means oak and the words may be related br The word terebinth is found in three successive chapters of Genesis in reference to the places where Abram later Abraham camped called Terebinths of Mam re the Amorite Here the traditional rendering in English is oaks of Mamre br It is also found in Genesis chapter where Jacob commands his family to remove idols that were taken as booty from the battle in Shechem before travelling to Bethel br Terebinths are also found in Isaiah in possible reference to idolatry associated with the trees although in the Septuagint and Vulgate the word is translated idols as the plural of el br br For you will be ashamed of the terebinths that you have taken pleasure in br The best known clear reference to a terebinth elah in the Hebrew Scriptures is that of the Valley of Elah or Valley of the Terebinth where David fought Goliath Samuel br Later in Samuel David s rebellious son Absalom is caught in the terebinth tree and is killed by Joab and his men who were part of David s army Samuel br At least a few references occur in Judges chapter in reference to Heber the Kenite of the children of Hobab chapter in reference to an angel of the Lord who came to visit Gideon most versions use oak and Ch in reference to the crowning of Abimelech by the terebinth of the pillar that was in Shechem again most versions use oak This reference of Abimelech s crowning by an oak is actually referring to the Palestine oak closely related to the Kermes oak Quercus coccifera The Hebrew distinguishes the Palestine oak and the terebinth It is also mentioned in Hosea when Hosea is talking about Israel s spiritual adultery by sacrificing to false gods and how to repent and be forgiven in Hosea br br br Uses br The word turpentine was originally used for the exudate of terebinth trees P terebinthus and related species such as P atlantica now called Chian Chios or Cyprian turpentine and it was later transferred to the crude turpentine oleoresin and the oil of turpentine essential oil of conifer trees The word turpentine derives via Old French and Latin from the Greek word terebinth n the feminine form to go with the feminine Greek word for resin of an adjective tereb nthinos derived from the Greek noun ter binthos the name for the terebinth tree However the main source of the terebinth turpentine is P atlantica which produces abundant resin instead of P terebinthus of which the amount of resin is limited br The fruits are used in Cyprus for baking of a specialty village bread In Crete where the plant is called tsikoudia it is used to flavor the local variety of pomace brandy also called tsikoudia In the Northern Sporades the shoots are used as a vegetable called tsits ravla The plant is rich in tannins and resinous substances and was used for its aromatic and medicinal properties in classical Greece A mild sweet scented gum can be produced from the bark and galls often found on the plant are used for tanning leather A triterpene has been extracted from these galls In Turkey it is known as menengi or b tt m A coffee like beverage Kurdish coffee or menengi kahvesi is made from the roasted fruit and a soap is made from the oil Terebinth resin was used as a wine preservative in the entire ancient Near East as proven by many findings in areas such as the foot of the Zagros Mountains and Middle Bronze Age Galilee br br br Gallery br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br See also br Pistacia lentiscus br
