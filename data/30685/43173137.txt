title: Alcohol (drug)
id: 43173137
Alcohol sometimes referred to by the chemical name ethanol is one of the most widely used and abused psychoactive drugs in the world and falls under the depressant category The term Alcohol and Other Drugs AOD emphasizes this inclusion by grouping alcohol with other substances that alter mood and behavior Alcohol is classified by the World Health Organization WHO as a toxic psychoactive dependence producing and carcinogenic substance br While the terms drug and medicine are sometimes used interchangeably drug can have a negative connotation often associated with illegal substances like cocaine or heroin which is why the alcohol industry may argue that alcohol is not a drug Room et al br The normalization of alcohol consumption along with past misconceptions about its health benefits also promoted by the industry further reinforces the mistaken idea that it is not a drug Even within the realm of scientific inquiry the common phrase drugs and alcohol persists However this phrasing implies that alcohol is somehow separate from other drugs br Paradoxically despite being legal alcohol scientifically classified as a drug has demonstrably been linked to greater social harm than most illegal drugs This contradicts the perception some hold of alcohol being a harmless substance br Alcohol is found in fermented beverages such as beer wine and distilled spirit in particular rectified spirit and serves various purposes it is used as a recreational drug for example by college students for self medication and in warfare It is also frequently involved in alcohol related crimes such as drunk driving public intoxication and underage drinking Some esoteric religions and schools incorporate the use of alcohol for spiritual purposes br For roughly two decades the International Agency for Research on Cancer IARC a World Health Organization WHO agency has classified alcohol as a Group Carcinogen In the WHO declared that there is no safe amount of alcohol consumption without health risks This reflects a global shift in public health messaging aligning with the long standing views of the temperance movement which advocates against the consumption of alcoholic beverages This shift aligns with the global scientific consensus against alcohol for pregnant women due to the known risks of miscarriage fetal alcohol spectrum disorders FASDs and sudden infant death syndrome SIDS as well as for individuals under the legal drinking age br WHO also highlighted a statistic nearly half of all alcohol attributable cancers in the WHO European Region are linked to alcohol consumption even from light or moderate drinking less than litres of wine or less than litres of beer or less than millilitres of spirits per week This new information suggests that these consumption levels should now be considered high risk Many countries exceed these levels by a significant margin Echoing the WHO s view a growing number of national public health agencies are prioritizing complete abstinence teetotalism and stricter drinking guidelines in their alcohol consumption recommendations br Alcohol has a variety of short term and long term adverse effects on health br Short term effects from moderate consumption include relaxation decreased social inhibition and happiness while binge drinking may result in generalized impairment of neurocognitive function blackout and hangover Excessive alcohol intake causes alcohol intoxication characterized by unconsciousness or in severe cases death in excessive alcohol use was responsible for million deaths worldwide br Long term effects are considered to be a major global public health issue and includes alcoholism abuse withdrawal fetal alcohol spectrum disorder FASD liver disease hepatitis cardiovascular disease such as cardiomyopathy polyneuropathy hallucinosis long term impact on the brain such as brain damage and dementia and cancers such as breast cancer and head and neck cancer especially laryngeal cancer br Despite being a widespread issue social stigma around problematic alcohol use or alcoholism discourages over from seeking help br Alcohol works in the brain primarily by increasing the effects of Aminobutyric acid GABA the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain by facilitating GABA s actions alcohol suppresses the activity of the CNS br br br Uses br br br Dutch courage br Dutch courage also known as pot valiance or liquid courage refers to courage gained from intoxication with alcohol br Alcohol use among college students is often used as liquid courage in the hookup culture for them to make a sexual advance in the first place However a recent trend called dry dating is gaining popularity to replace liquid courage which involves going on dates without consuming alcohol br Consuming alcohol prior to visiting female sex workers is a common practice among some men Sex workers often resort to using drugs and alcohol to cope with stress Female sex workers in low and middle income countries have high rates of harmful alcohol use which is associated with increased risk of risky sexual behavior br Alcohol when consumed in high doses is considered to be an anaphrodisiac br br br Criminal br br Albeit not a valid intoxication defense weakening the inhibitions by drunkenness is occasionally used as a tool to commit planned offenses such as property crimes including theft and robbery and violent crimes including assault murder or rape which sometimes but not always occurs in alcohol facilitated sexual assaults where the victim is also drugged br br br Warfare br br Alcohol has a long association of military use and has been called liquid courage for its role in preparing troops for battle anaesthetize injured soldiers and celebrate military victories It has also served as a coping mechanism for combat stress reactions and a means of decompression from combat to everyday life However this reliance on alcohol can have negative consequences for physical and mental health Military and veteran populations face significant challenges in addressing the co occurrence of PTSD and alcohol use disorder Military personnel who show symptoms of PTSD major depressive disorder alcohol use disorder and generalized anxiety disorder show higher levels of suicidal ideation br Alcohol consumption in the US Military is higher than any other profession according to CDC data from The Department of Defense Survey of Health Related Behaviors among Active Duty Military Personnel published that of active duty members engage in binge drinking with another engaging in heavy drinking in the past days br Reports from the Russian invasion of Ukraine in and since suggested that Russian soldiers are drinking significant amount of alcohol as well as consuming harder drugs which increases their losses Some reports suggest that on occasion alcohol and drugs have been provided to the lower quality troops by their commanders in order to facilitate their use as expendable cannon fodder br br br Food energy br br The use of alcohol as a staple food source is considered inconvenient due to the fact that it increases the blood alcohol content BAC However alcohol is a significant source of food energy for individuals with alcoholism and those who engage in binge drinking For example individuals with drunkorexia engage in the combination of self imposed malnutrition and binge drinking to avoid weight gain from alcohol to save money for purchasing alcohol and to facilitate alcohol intoxication Also in alcoholics who get most of their daily calories from alcohol a deficiency of thiamine can produce Korsakoff s syndrome which is associated with serious brain damage br The USDA uses a figure of kilocalories kJ per gram of alcohol kcal or kJ per ml for calculating food energy For distilled spirits a standard serving in the United States is ml US fl oz which at ethanol proof would be grams and calories br Alcoholic drinks are considered empty calorie foods because other than food energy they contribute no essential nutrients Alcohol increases insulin response to glucose promoting fat storage and hindering carb fat burning oxidation This excess processing in the liver acetyl CoA can lead to fatty liver disease and eventually alcoholic liver disease br br br Medical br br Spiritus fortis is a medical term for ethanol solutions with ABV br When taken by mouth or injected into a vein ethanol is used to treat methanol or ethylene glycol toxicity when fomepizole is not available br Ethanol when used to treat or prevent methanol and or ethylene glycol toxicity competes with other alcohols for the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme lessening metabolism into toxic aldehyde and carboxylic acid derivatives and reducing the more serious toxic effects of the glycols when crystallized in the kidneys br br br Recreational br br Drinking culture is the set of traditions and social behaviors that surround the consumption of alcoholic beverages as a recreational drug and social lubricant Although alcoholic beverages and social attitudes toward drinking vary around the world nearly every civilization has independently discovered the processes of brewing beer fermenting wine and distilling spirits br Common drinking styles include moderate drinking social drinking and binge drinking br br br Drinking styles br br In today s society there is a growing awareness of this reflected in the variety of approaches to alcohol use each emphasizing responsible choices Sober curious describes a mindset or approach where someone is consciously choosing to reduce or eliminate alcohol consumption not drinking and driving being aware of your surroundings not pressuring others to drink and being able to quit anytime However they are not necessarily committed to complete sobriety br br br Binge drinking br Binge drinking or heavy episodic drinking is drinking alcoholic beverages with an intention of becoming intoxicated by heavy consumption of alcohol over a short period of time but definitions see here vary considerably Binge drinking is a style of drinking that is popular in several countries worldwide and overlaps somewhat with social drinking since it is often done in groups br Drinking games involve consuming alcohol as part of the gameplay They can be risky because they can encourage people to drink more than they intended to Recent studies link binge drinking habits to a decline in quality of life and a shortened lifespan by years br br br Moderate responsible and social drinking br Moderate drinking responsible drinking and social drinking are often used interchangeably but with slightly different connotations br br Moderate drinking strictly focuses on the amount of alcohol consumed following alcohol consumption recommendations typically drinks per day This is called drinking in moderation br According to the WHO nearly half of all alcohol attributable cancers in the WHO European Region are linked to alcohol consumption even from light or moderate drinking less than litres of wine or less than litres of beer or less than millilitres of spirits per week Light alcohol consumption showed no connection to most cancers but a slight rise in the likelihood of melanoma breast cancer in females and prostate cancer in males was observed However moderate drinking is associated with a further slight increase in cancer risk Also moderate drinking may disrupt normal brain functioning br Responsible drinking as defined by alcohol industry standards often emphasizes personal choice and risk management unlike terms like social drinking or moderate drinking br Critics argue that the alcohol industry s definition does not always align with official recommendations for safe drinking limits br Social drinking refers to casual drinking of alcoholic beverages in a social setting for example bars nightclubs or parties without an intent to become intoxicated A social drinker is also defined as a person who only drinks alcohol during social events such as parties and does not drink while alone e g at home br While social drinking often involves moderation it does not strictly emphasize safety or specific quantities unlike moderate drinking Social settings can involve peer pressure to drink more than intended which can be a risk factor for excessive alcohol consumption Regularly socializing over drinks can lead to a higher tolerance for alcohol and potentially dependence especially in groups where drinking is a central activity Social drinking does not preclude the development of alcohol dependence High functioning alcoholism describes individuals who appear to function normally in daily life despite struggling with alcohol dependence br br br Self medication br br The therapeutic index for ethanol is br Alcohol can have analgesic pain relieving effects which is why some people with chronic pain turn to alcohol to self medicate and try to alleviate their physical discomfort br People with social anxiety disorder commonly self medicate with alcohol to overcome their highly set inhibitions However self medicating excessively for prolonged periods of time with alcohol often makes the symptoms of anxiety or depression worse This is believed to occur as a result of the changes in brain chemistry from long term use A systematic review highlights the non addictive use of alcohol for managing developmental issues personality traits and psychiatric symptoms emphasizing the need for informed harm controlled approaches to alcohol consumption within a personalized health policy framework br A study suggests that people who drink for both recreational enjoyment and therapeutic reasons like relieving pain and anxiety depression stress have a higher demand for alcohol compared to those who drink solely for recreation or self medication This finding raises concerns as this group may be more likely to develop alcohol use disorder and experience negative consequences related to their drinking A significant proportion of patients attending mental health services for conditions including anxiety disorders such as panic disorder or social phobia have developed these conditions as a result of recreational alcohol or sedative use br Self medication or mental disorders may make people not decline their drinking despite negative consequences This can create a cycle of dependence that is difficult to break without addressing the underlying mental health issue br br br Unscientific br br The American Heart Association warn that We ve all seen the headlines about studies associating light or moderate drinking with health benefits and reduced mortality Some researchers have suggested there are health benefits from wine especially red wine and that a glass a day can be good for the heart But there s more to the story No research has proved a cause and effect link between drinking alcohol and better heart health br In folk medicine consuming a nightcap is for the purpose of inducing sleep However alcohol is not recommended by many doctors as a sleep aid because it interferes with sleep quality br Hair of the dog short for hair of the dog that bit you is a colloquial expression in the English language predominantly used to refer to alcohol that is consumed as a hangover remedy with the aim of lessening the effects of a hangover Many other languages have their own phrase to describe the same concept The idea may have some basis in science in the difference between ethanol and methanol metabolism Instead of alcohol rehydration before going to bed or during hangover may relieve dehydration associated symptoms such as thirst dizziness dry mouth and headache br Drinking alcohol may cause subclinical immunosuppression br br br Spiritual br br Spiritual use of moderate alcohol consumption is found in some religions and schools with esoteric influences including the Hindu tantra sect Aghori in the Sufi Bektashi Order and Alevi Jem ceremonies in the Rar muri religion in the Japanese religion Shinto by the new religious movement Thelema in Vajrayana Buddhism and in Vodou faith of Haiti br br br Contraindication br br br Pregnancy br br In the US alcohol is subject to the FDA drug labeling Pregnancy Category X Contraindicated in pregnancy br Minnesota North Dakota Oklahoma South Dakota and Wisconsin have laws that allow the state to involuntarily commit pregnant women to treatment if they abuse alcohol during pregnancy br br br Risks br br br Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder br br Ethanol is classified as a teratogen a substance known to cause birth defects according to the U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC alcohol consumption by women who are not using birth control increases the risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders FASDs This group of conditions encompasses fetal alcohol syndrome partial fetal alcohol syndrome alcohol related neurodevelopmental disorder static encephalopathy and alcohol related birth defects The CDC currently recommends complete abstinence from alcoholic beverages for women of child bearing age who are pregnant trying to become pregnant or are sexually active and not using birth control br br br Miscarriage br Miscarriage also known in medical terms as a spontaneous abortion is the death and expulsion of an embryo or fetus before it can survive independently br Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for miscarriage br br br Sudden infant death syndrome br br Drinking of alcohol by parents is linked to sudden infant death syndrome SISD One study found a positive correlation between the two during New Years celebrations and weekends Another found that alcohol use disorder was linked to a more than doubling of risk br br br Adverse effects br br Alcohol has a variety of short term and long term adverse effects Alcohol has both short term and long term effects on the memory and sleep It also has reinforcement related adverse effects including alcoholism dependence and withdrawal The most severe withdrawal symptoms associated with physical dependence can include seizures and delirium tremens which in rare cases can be fatal Alcohol use is directly related to considerable morbidity and mortality for instance due to intoxication and alcohol related health problems The World Health Organization advises that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption br A study in found that alcohol and tobacco use combined resulted in a significant health burden costing over a quarter of a billion disability adjusted life years Illicit drug use caused tens of millions more disability adjusted life years br Drunkorexia is a colloquialism for anorexia or bulimia combined with an alcohol use disorder br Alcohol is a common cause of substance induced psychosis or episodes which may occur through acute intoxication chronic alcoholism withdrawal exacerbation of existing disorders or acute idiosyncratic reactions Research has shown that excessive alcohol use causes an fold increased risk of psychotic disorders in men and a fold increased risk of psychotic disorders in women While the vast majority of cases are acute and resolve fairly quickly upon treatment and or abstinence they can occasionally become chronic and persistent Alcoholic psychosis is sometimes misdiagnosed as another mental illness such as schizophrenia br An inability to process or exhibit emotions in a proper manner has been shown to exist in people who consume excessive amounts of alcohol and those who were exposed to alcohol while fetuses FAexp Also a significant portion of alcoholics experience emotional blindness br br br Short term effects br br The amount of ethanol in the body is typically quantified by blood alcohol content BAC weight of ethanol per unit volume of blood Small doses of ethanol in general are stimulant like and produce euphoria and relaxation people experiencing these symptoms tend to become talkative and less inhibited and may exhibit poor judgement At higher dosages BAC gram liter ethanol acts as a central nervous system CNS depressant producing at progressively higher dosages impaired sensory and motor function slowed cognition stupefaction unconsciousness and possible death Ethanol is commonly consumed as a recreational substance especially while socializing due to its psychoactive effects br br br Central nervous system impairment br br Alcohol causes generalized CNS depression is a positive allosteric GABAA modulator and is associated and related with decreased anxiety decreased social inhibition sedation impairment of cognitive memory and sensory function cognitive memory motor and sensory impairment It slows and impairs cognition and reaction time and the cognitive skills impairs judgement interferes with motor function resulting in motor incoordination numbness impairs memory formation and causes sensory impairment br Binge drinking can cause generalized impairment of neurocognitive function dizziness analgesia amnesia ataxia loss of balance confusion sedation slurred speech general anaesthesia decreased libido nausea vomiting blackout spins stupor unconsciousness and hangover br At very high concentrations alcohol can cause anterograde amnesia markedly decreased heart rate pulmonary aspiration positional alcohol nystagmus respiratory depression shock coma and death can result due to profound suppression of CNS function alcohol overdose and can finish in consequent dysautonomia br br br Gastrointestinal effects br br Alcohol can cause nausea and vomiting in sufficiently high amounts varying by person br Alcohol stimulates gastric juice production even when food is not present and as a result its consumption stimulates acidic secretions normally intended to digest protein molecules Consequently the excess acidity may harm the inner lining of the stomach The stomach lining is normally protected by a mucosal layer that prevents the stomach from essentially digesting itself br Ingestion of alcohol can initiate systemic pro inflammatory changes through two intestinal routes altering intestinal microbiota composition dysbiosis which increases lipopolysaccharide LPS release and degrading intestinal mucosal barrier integrity thus allowing LPS to enter the circulatory system The major portion of the blood supply to the liver is provided by the portal vein Therefore while the liver is continuously fed nutrients from the intestine it is also exposed to any bacteria and or bacterial derivatives that breach the intestinal mucosal barrier Consequently LPS levels increase in the portal vein liver and systemic circulation after alcohol intake Immune cells in the liver respond to LPS with the production of reactive oxygen species leukotrienes chemokines and cytokines These factors promote tissue inflammation and contribute to organ pathology br br br Hangover br br A hangover is the experience of various unpleasant physiological and psychological effects usually following the consumption of alcohol such as wine beer and liquor Hangovers can last for several hours or for more than hours Typical symptoms of a hangover may include headache drowsiness concentration problems dry mouth dizziness fatigue gastrointestinal distress e g nausea vomiting diarrhea absence of hunger light sensitivity depression sweating hyper excitability irritability and anxiety br Though many possible remedies and folk cures have been suggested there is no compelling evidence to suggest that any are effective for preventing or treating hangovers Avoiding alcohol or drinking in moderation are the most effective ways to avoid a hangover The socioeconomic consequences of hangovers include workplace absenteeism impaired job performance reduced productivity and poor academic achievement A hangover may also impair performance during potentially dangerous daily activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery br br br Holiday heart syndrome br br Holiday heart syndrome also known as alcohol induced atrial arrhythmias is a syndrome defined by an irregular heartbeat and palpitations associated with high levels of ethanol consumption Holiday heart syndrome was discovered in when Philip Ettinger discovered the connection between arrhythmia and alcohol consumption It received its common name as it is associated with the binge drinking common during the holidays It is unclear how common this syndrome is of cases of atrial fibrillation may be related to this condition but it could be as high br br br Positional alcohol nystagmus br br Positional alcohol nystagmus PAN is nystagmus visible jerkiness in eye movement produced when the head is placed in a sideways position PAN occurs when the specific gravity of the membrane space of the semicircular canals in the ear differs from the specific gravity of the fluid in the canals because of the presence of alcohol br br br Allergic like reactions br br Ethanol containing beverages can cause alcohol flush reactions exacerbations of rhinitis and more seriously and commonly bronchoconstriction in patients with a history of asthma and in some cases urticarial skin eruptions and systemic dermatitis Such reactions can occur within minutes of ethanol ingestion and may be caused by br br genetic abnormalities in the metabolism of ethanol which can cause the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde to accumulate in tissues and trigger the release of histamine or br true allergy reactions to allergens occurring naturally in or contaminating alcoholic beverages particularly wine and beer and br other unknown causes br Alcohol flush reaction has also been associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer in those who do drink br br br Long term effects br br Due to the long term effects of alcohol abuse binge drinking is considered to be a major public health issue br The impact of alcohol on aging is multifaceted The relationship between alcohol consumption and body weight is the subject of inconclusive studies Alcoholic lung disease is disease of the lungs caused by excessive alcohol However the term alcoholic lung disease is not a generally accepted medical diagnosis br Alcohol s overall effect on health is uncertain While some studies suggest moderate consumption might have some benefit others find any amount increases health risks This uncertainty is due to conflicting research methods and potential biases including counting former drinkers as abstainers and the possibility of alcohol industry influence Because of these issues experts advise against using alcohol for health reasons For example in the World Health Organization WHO stated that there is currently no conclusive evidence from studies that the potential benefits of moderate alcohol consumption for cardiovascular disease and type diabetes outweigh the increased cancer risk associated with these drinking levels for individual consumers br According to The Lancet four industries tobacco unhealthy food fossil fuel and alcohol are responsible for at least a third of global deaths per year In the World Health Organization published a report including these figures br br br Alcoholism br br Alcoholism or its medical diagnosis alcohol use disorder refers to alcohol addiction alcohol dependence dipsomania and or alcohol abuse It is a major problem and many health problems as well as death can result from excessive alcohol use Alcohol dependence is linked to a lifespan that is reduced by about years relative to the average person In it was estimated that of deaths worldwide were attributable to alcohol use Deaths from alcohol are split about evenly between acute causes e g overdose accidents and chronic conditions The leading chronic alcohol related condition associated with death is alcoholic liver disease Alcohol dependence is also associated with cognitive impairment and organic brain damage Some researchers have found that even one alcoholic drink a day increases an individual s risk of health problems by br Stigma surrounding alcohol use disorder is particularly strong and different from the stigma attached to other mental illnesses not caused by substances People with this condition are seen less as truly ill face greater blame and social rejection and experience higher structural discrimination risks br Two or more consecutive alcohol free days a week have been recommended to improve health and break dependence br Dry drunk is an expression coined by the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous that describes an alcoholic who no longer drinks but otherwise maintains the same behavior patterns of an alcoholic br A high functioning alcoholic HFA is a person who maintains jobs and relationships while exhibiting alcoholism br Many Native Americans in the United States have been harmed by or become addicted to drinking alcohol br br br Brain damage br br While many people associate alcohol s effects with intoxication the long term impact of alcohol on the brain can be severe Binge drinking or heavy episodic drinking can lead to alcohol related brain damage that occurs after a relatively short period of time This brain damage increases the risk of alcohol related dementia and abnormalities in mood and cognitive abilities br Alcohol can cause Wernicke s encephalopathy and Alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome which frequently occur simultaneously known as Wernicke Korsakoff syndrome Lesions or brain abnormalities are typically located in the diencephalon which result in anterograde and retrograde amnesia or memory loss br br br Dementia br br Alcohol related dementia ARD is a form of dementia caused by long term excessive consumption of alcohol resulting in neurological damage and impaired cognitive function br br br Liver damage br br Consuming more than grams of pure alcohol per day over an extended period can significantly increase the risk of developing alcoholic liver disease During the metabolism of alcohol via the respective dehydrogenases nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD is converted into reduced NAD Normally NAD is used to metabolize fats in the liver and as such alcohol competes with these fats for the use of NAD Prolonged exposure to alcohol means that fats accumulate in the liver leading to the term fatty liver Continued consumption such as in alcohol use disorder then leads to cell death in the hepatocytes as the fat stores reduce the function of the cell to the point of death These cells are then replaced with scar tissue leading to the condition called cirrhosis br br br Cancer br br Alcoholic beverages have been classified as carcinogenic by leading health organizations for more than two decades including the WHO s IARC Group carcinogens and the U S NTP raising concerns about the potential cancer risk associated with alcohol consumption br Drinking alcohol increases the risk for breast cancer Alcohol is also a major cause for head and neck cancer especially laryngeal cancer This risk is even higher when alcohol is used together with tobacco br Qualitative analysis reveals that the alcohol industry likely misinforms the public about the alcohol cancer link similar to the tobacco industry The alcohol industry influences alcohol policy and health messages including those for schoolchildren br br br Cardiovascular disease br br Excessive daily alcohol consumption and binge drinking can cause a higher risk of stroke coronary artery disease heart failure fatal hypertensive disease and fatal aortic aneurysm br A study reviewed a bunch of research on alcohol and heart disease They found that moderate drinking did not seem to worsen things for people who already had heart problems But importantly the researchers did not say that people who do not drink should start in order to improve their heart health Thus the safety and potential positive effect of light drinking on the cardiovascular system has not yet been proven Still alcohol is a major health risk and even if moderate drinking lowers the risk of some cardiovascular diseases it might increase the risk of others Therefore starting to drink alcohol in the hope of any benefit is not recommended br The World Heart Federation recommends against any alcohol intake for optimal heart health br It has also been pointed out that the studies suggesting a positive link between red wine consumption and heart health had flawed methodology in the form of comparing two sets of people which were not actually appropriately paired br br br Cardiomyopathy br br Alcoholic cardiomyopathy ACM is a disease in which the long term consumption of alcohol leads to heart failure ACM is a type of dilated cardiomyopathy The heart is unable to pump blood efficiently leading to heart failure It can affect other parts of the body if the heart failure is severe It is most common in males between the ages of and br br br Hearing loss br Alcohol classified as an ototoxin ear toxin can contribute to hearing loss sometimes referred to as cocktail deafness after exposure to loud noises in drinking environments br Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder FASD are at an increased risk of having hearing difficulties br br br Withdrawal syndrome br br Discontinuation of alcohol after extended heavy use and associated tolerance development resulting in dependence can result in withdrawal Alcohol withdrawal can cause confusion paranoia anxiety insomnia agitation tremors fever nausea vomiting autonomic dysfunction seizures and hallucinations In severe cases death can result br Delirium tremens is a condition that requires people with a long history of heavy drinking to undertake an alcohol detoxification regimen br Alcohol is one of the more dangerous drugs to withdraw from Drugs which help to re stabilize the glutamate system such as N acetylcysteine have been proposed for the treatment of addiction to cocaine nicotine and alcohol br Cohort studies have demonstrated that the combination of anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines is more effective than other treatments in reducing alcohol withdrawal scores and shortening the duration of intensive care unit stays br Nitrous oxide has been shown to be an effective and safe treatment for alcohol withdrawal The gas therapy reduces the use of highly addictive sedative medications like benzodiazepines and barbiturates br br br Cortisol br br Research has looked into the effects of alcohol on the amount of cortisol that is produced in the human body Continuous consumption of alcohol over an extended period of time has been shown to raise cortisol levels in the body Cortisol is released during periods of high stress and can result in the temporary shut down of other physical processes causing physical damage to the body br br br Gout br br There is a strong association between gout the consumption of alcohol and sugar sweetened beverages with wine presenting somewhat less of a risk than beer or spirits br br br Ketoacidosis br br Alcoholic ketoacidosis AKA is a specific group of symptoms and metabolic state related to alcohol use Symptoms often include abdominal pain vomiting agitation a fast respiratory rate and a specific fruity smell Consciousness is generally normal Complications may include sudden death br br br Mental disorders br Alcohol is a cause of mental disorders Alcohol may play a role in depression with up to of male depression cases in some European countries linked to alcohol use br Alcohol misuse often coincides with mental health conditions Many individuals struggling with psychiatric disorders also experience problematic drinking behaviors br br br Austrian syndrome br br Austrian syndrome also known as Osler s triad is a medical condition that was named after Robert Austrian in The presentation of the condition consists of pneumonia endocarditis and meningitis all caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae It is associated with alcoholism due to hyposplenism reduced splenic functioning and can be seen in males between the ages of and years old Robert Austrian was not the first one to describe the condition but Richard Heschl around s or William Osler were not able to link the signs to the bacteria because microbiology was not yet developed br The leading cause of Osler s triad Austrian syndrome is Streptococcus pneumoniae which is usually associated with heavy alcohol use br br br Polyneuropathy br br Alcoholic polyneuropathy is a neurological disorder in which peripheral nerves throughout the body malfunction simultaneously It is defined by axonal degeneration in neurons of both the sensory and motor systems and initially occurs at the distal ends of the longest axons in the body This nerve damage causes an individual to experience pain and motor weakness first in the feet and hands and then progressing centrally Alcoholic polyneuropathy is caused primarily by chronic alcoholism however vitamin deficiencies are also known to contribute to its development br br br Specific population br br br Pregnant women br Babies exposed to alcohol benzodiazepines barbiturates and some antidepressants SSRIs during pregnancy may experience neonatal withdrawal br The onset of clinical presentation typically appears within to hours of birth but may take up to days br br br Other effects br br Alcohol consumption is associated with lower sperm concentration percentage of normal morphology and semen volume but not sperm motility br Alcohol consumption may increase the risk of sleep disorders including insomnia restless legs syndrome and sleep apnea br Frequent drinking of alcoholic beverages is a major contributing factor in cases of hypertriglyceridemia br Excess alcohol use is frequently associated with porphyria cutanea tarda PTC br Alcohol consumption is a risk factor for Dupuytren s contracture br The majority of those with aspirin exacerbated respiratory disease experience respiratory reactions to alcohol br br br Social issues br br br Alcohol related crimes br br Alcohol use is stereotypically associated with crime both violent and non violent Some crimes are uniquely tied to alcohol such as public intoxication or underage drinking while others are simply more likely to occur together with alcohol consumption Crime perpetrators are much more likely to be intoxicated than crime victims Many alcohol laws have been passed to criminalize various alcohol related activities Underage drinking and drunk driving are the most prevalent alcohol specific offenses in the United States and a major problem in many countries worldwide About one third of arrests in the United States involve alcohol misuse and arrests for alcohol related crimes constitute a high proportion of all arrests made by police in the U S and elsewhere In general programs aimed at reducing society s consumption of alcohol including education in schools are seen as an effective long term solution Strategies aiming to reduce alcohol consumption among adult offenders have various estimates of effectiveness Policing alcohol related street disorder and enforcing compliance checks of alcohol dispensing businesses has proven successful in reducing public perception of and fear of criminal activities br In the early s the monetary cost of alcohol related crime in the United States alone has been estimated at over billion twice the economic cost of all other drug related crimes In a similar period in the United Kingdom the cost of crime and its antisocial effects was estimated at billion Another estimate for the UK for yearly cost of alcohol related crime suggested double that estimate at between and billion Risky patterns of drinking are particularly problematic in and around Russia Mexico and some parts of Africa Alcohol is more commonly associated with both violent and non violent crime than are drugs like marijuana br Passive drinking like passive smoking refers to the damage done to others as a result of drinking alcoholic beverages These include the unborn fetus and children of parents who drink excessively drunk drivers accidents domestic violence and alcohol related sexual assaults br br br Public order crimes br br Public order crimes caused by drinking include drunk driving domestic violence and alcohol related sexual assaults br br br Automobile accidents br br A study found of people fatally injured in traffic accidents were in alcohol related crashes Misuse of alcohol is associated with more than of deaths that occur in automobile accidents every year The risk of a fatal car accident increases exponentially with the level of alcohol in the driver s blood br Most countries have passed laws prohibiting driving a motor vehicle while impaired by alcohol In the U S these crimes are generally referred to as driving under the influence DUI although there are many naming variations among jurisdictions such as driving while intoxicated DWI With alcohol consumption a drunk driver s level of intoxication is typically determined by a measurement of blood alcohol content or BAC but this can also be expressed as a breath test measurement often referred to as a BrAC A BAC or BrAC measurement in excess of the specific threshold level such as in the U S defines the criminal offense with no need to prove impairment In some jurisdictions there is an aggravated category of the offense at a higher BAC level such as or In many jurisdictions police officers can conduct field tests of suspects to look for signs of intoxication br br br Negligence br br Negligence in alcohol consumption can have a ripple effect on environmentally responsible behavior Examples br br Consuming alcoholic beverages which increases urine production and reduces social inhibitions can lead to public urination Public urination is illegal in most areas br Improper disposal of alcohol bottles is a common problem Many are not recycled or left behind in public spaces Discarded alcoholic beverage containers especially broken glass shards that are difficult to remove does not only create an eyesore but may also cause flat tires for cyclists injure wildlife or kids br Alcohol consumption can contribute to nighttime noise pollution especially through loud music played by intoxicated individuals This disrupts sleep and relaxation for nearby residents impacting health and productivity Municipal noise ordinances often establish quiet hours and penalties for violations br People under the influence may forget to extinguish outdoor fireplaces which may create a fire hazard since unchecked fires can escalate into wildfires br Drunk cyclists can only be charged if they ride dangerously cause a crash or behave disruptively However cycling under the influence increases the risk of severe injury hospital resource use and even death according to a study highlighting the importance of safe cycling practices br br br Public drunkenness br br Public drunkenness or intoxication is a common problem in many jurisdictions Public intoxication laws vary widely by jurisdiction but include public nuisance laws open container laws and prohibitions on drinking alcohol in public or certain areas The offenders are often lower class individuals and this crime has a very high recidivism rate with numerous instances of repeated instances of the arrest jail release without treatment cycle The high number of arrests for public drunkenness often reflects rearrests of the same offenders br br br Sexual assaults br br Rape is any sexual activity that occurs without the freely given consent of one of the parties involved This includes alcohol facilitated sexual assault which is considered rape in most if not all jurisdictions or non consensual condom removal which is criminalized in some countries see the map below br A study found that rapists typically consumed relatively high amounts of alcohol and infrequently used condoms during assaults which was linked to a significant increase in STI transmission This also increase the risk of pregnancy from rape for female victims Some people turn to drugs or alcohol to cope with emotional trauma after a rape use of these during pregnancy can harm the fetus br br br Alcohol facilitated sexual assault br br One of the most common date rape drugs is alcohol administered either surreptitiously or consumed voluntarily rendering the victim unable to make informed decisions or give consent The perpetrator then facilitates sexual assault or rape a crime known as alcohol or drug facilitated sexual assault DFSA However sex with an unconscious victim is considered rape in most if not all jurisdictions and some assailants have committed rapes of convenience whereby they have assaulted a victim after he or she had become unconscious from drinking too much The risk of individuals either experiencing or perpetrating sexual violence and risky sexual behavior increases with alcohol abuse and by the consumption of caffeinated alcoholic drinks br br br Non consensual condom removal br br Non consensual condom removal or stealthing is the practice of a person removing a condom during sexual intercourse without consent when their sex partner has only consented to condom protected sex Purposefully damaging a condom before or during intercourse may also be referred to as stealthing regardless of who damaged the condom br Consuming alcohol can be risky in sexual situations It can impair judgment and make it difficult for both people to give or receive informed sexual consent However a history of sexual aggression and alcohol intoxication are factors associated with an increased risk of men employing non consensual condom removal and engaging in sexually aggressive behavior with female partners br br br Wartime sexual violence br The use of alcohol is a documented factor in wartime sexual violence br For example rape during the liberation of Serbia was committed by Soviet Red Army soldiers against women during their advance to Berlin in late and early during World War II Serbian journalist Vuk Peri i said about the rapes The rapes were extremely brutal under the influence of alcohol and usually by a group of soldiers The Soviet soldiers did not pay attention to the fact that Serbia was their ally and there is no doubt that the Soviet high command tacitly approved the rape br While there was not a codified international law specifically prohibiting rape during World War II customary international law principles already existed that condemned violence against civilians These principles formed the basis for the development of more explicit laws after the war including the Nuremberg Principles established in br br br Violent crime br br The World Health Organization has noted that out of social problems created by the harmful use of alcohol crime and violence related to alcohol consumption are likely the most significant issue In the United States of robberies of intimate partner violence incidents of sexual assaults of physical assaults and of homicides murders involved use of alcohol A study for the United States found that of violent crime perpetrators arrested in that country had been consuming alcohol before their offenses In it was estimated that million violent crimes in the U S were related to alcohol use More than of violent encounters with police involve alcohol Alcohol is implicated in more than two thirds of cases of intimate partner violence Studies also suggest there may be links between alcohol abuse and child abuse In the United Kingdom in of those involved in violent crimes were under alcohol influence A significant portion of homicide victims tested positive for alcohol in the US International studies are similar with an estimate that of violent crimes worldwide involves the use of alcohol br The relation between alcohol and violence is not yet fully understood as its impact on different individuals varies Studies and theories of alcohol abuse suggest among others that use of alcohol likely reduces the offender s perception and awareness of consequences of their actions Heavy drinking is associated with vulnerability to injury marital discord and domestic violence Moderate drinkers are more frequently engaged in intimate violence than are light drinkers and abstainers however generally it is heavy and or binge drinkers who are involved in the most chronic and serious forms of aggression Research found that factors that increase the likelihood of alcohol related violence include difficult temperament hyperactivity hostile beliefs history of family violence poor school performance delinquent peers criminogenic beliefs about alcohol s effects impulsivity and antisocial personality disorder The odds frequency and severity of physical attacks are all positively correlated with alcohol use In turn violence decreases after behavioral marital alcoholism treatment br br br Methanol laced alcohol br br Outbreaks of methanol poisoning have occurred when methanol is used to lace moonshine bootleg liquor This is commonly done to bulk up the original product to gain profit Because of its similarities in both appearance and odor to ethanol the alcohol in beverages it is difficult to differentiate between the two br Methanol is a toxic alcohol If as little as mL of pure methanol is ingested for example it can break down into formic acid which can cause permanent blindness by destruction of the optic nerve and mL is potentially fatal although the median lethal dose is typically mL fl oz i e mL kg body weight of pure methanol Reference dose for methanol is mg kg day Toxic effects take hours to start and effective antidotes can often prevent permanent damage br India has a thriving moonshine industry and methanol tainted batches have killed over people in the last decades br br br Alternative routes of administration br Alternative methods of alcohol administration like alcohol enema alcohol inhalation vodka eyeballing or using alcohol powder which can be added to water to make an alcoholic beverage or inhaled with a nebulizer all carry significant health risks br br br Binge drinking br br Binge drinking is a style of drinking that is popular in several countries worldwide and overlaps somewhat with social drinking since it is often done in groups The degree of intoxication however varies between and within various cultures that engage in this practice A binge on alcohol can occur over hours last up to several days or in the event of extended abuse even weeks Due to the long term effects of alcohol abuse binge drinking is considered to be a major public health issue br Binge drinking is more common in males during adolescence and young adulthood Heavy regular binge drinking is associated with adverse effects on neurologic cardiac gastrointestinal hematologic immune and musculoskeletal organ systems as well as increasing the risk of alcohol induced psychiatric disorders A US based review of the literature found that up to one third of adolescents binge drink with reaching the threshold of having an alcohol related substance use disorder Approximately one in women binge drinks during pregnancy which can lead to fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders Binge drinking during adolescence is associated with traffic accidents and other types of accidents violent behavior as well as suicide The more often a child or adolescent binge drinks and the younger they are the more likely that they will develop an alcohol use disorder including alcoholism A large number of adolescents who binge drink also consume other psychotropic substances br br br Emotional issues br In emotional self regulation some people turn to drugs such as alcohol Drug use an example of response modulation can be used to alter emotion associated physiological responses For example alcohol can produce sedative and anxiolytic effects A study found that immature defense mechanisms are linked to placing a higher value on junk food alcohol and television br There is a two way street between loneliness and drinking People who drink more than once a week tend to feel lonelier according to a study on Japanese workers during the COVID pandemic On the other hand feelings of loneliness can also lead people to drink more as shown in a separate study Loneliness is a major risk factor for depression and alcoholism br br br Hurtful communication br Alcohol may cause hurtful communication br br br Drunk dialing br br Drunk dialing refers to an intoxicated person making phone calls that they would not likely make if sober often a lonely individual calling former or current love interests br A study that examined the relationship between drunk texting and emotional dysregulation found a positive correlation The findings suggest that interventions targeting emotional regulation skills may be beneficial br br br In vino veritas br br In vino veritas is a Latin phrase that means in wine there is truth suggesting a person under the influence of alcohol is more likely to speak their hidden thoughts and desires br br br Risky sexual behavior br br Some studies have made a connection between hookup culture and substance use Most students said that their hookups occurred after drinking alcohol Frietas stated that in her study the relationships between drinking and the party scene and between alcohol and hookup culture were impossible to miss br Studies suggest that the degree of alcoholic intoxication in young people directly correlates with the level of risky behavior such as engaging in multiple sex partners br In the first study of its kind found that alcohol and caffeinated energy drinks is linked with casual risky sex among college age adults br br br Sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancy br br Alcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk that people will become involved in risky sexual behaviors such as unprotected sex Both men and women reported higher intentions to avoid using a condom when they were intoxicated by alcohol br Coitus interruptus also known as withdrawal pulling out or the pull out method is a method of birth control during penetrative sexual intercourse whereby the penis is withdrawn from a vagina or anus prior to ejaculation so that the ejaculate semen may be directed away in an effort to avoid insemination Coitus interruptus carries a risk of STIs and unintended pregnancy This risk is especially high during alcohol intoxication because lowered sexual inhibition can make it difficult to withdraw in time br Women with unintended pregnancies are more likely to smoke tobacco drink alcohol during pregnancy and binge drink during pregnancy which results in poorer health outcomes See also fetal alcohol spectrum disorder br br br Societal damage br br Alcohol causes a plethora of detrimental effects in society A systematic review estimated the societal costs of alcohol use to be around of the GDP Many emergency room visits involve alcohol use Alcohol availability and consumption rates and alcohol rates are positively associated with nuisance loitering panhandling and disorderly conduct in public space br A study challenged the perception of heroin as the more dangerous substance The research suggests when considering the wider social physical and financial costs alcohol may be more harmful br Individuals who engage with or share alcohol related content on social networking services tend to exhibit higher levels of alcohol use and related issues Overwork is linked to an increased risk of unhealthy alcohol consumption Also unemployment can heighten the risk of alcohol consumption and smoking As many as of employees show problematic alcohol related behaviors in the workplace such as drinking before going to work or even drinking on the job br br br College br br Many students attending colleges universities and other higher education institutions consume alcoholic beverages The laws and social culture around this practice vary by country and institution type and within an institution some students may drink heavily whereas others may not drink at all In the United States drinking tends to be particularly associated with fraternities br Alcohol abuse among college students refers to unhealthy alcohol drinking behaviors by college and university students While the legal drinking age varies by country the high amount of underage students that consume alcohol has presented many problems and consequences for universities The causes of alcohol abuse tend to be peer pressure fraternity or sorority involvement and stress College students who abuse alcohol can suffer from health concerns poor academic performance or legal consequences Prevention and treatment include campus counseling stronger enforcement of underage drinking or changing the campus culture br Recent research indicates that the abundance of alcohol retailers and the availability of inexpensive alcoholic beverages are linked to heavy alcohol consumption among college students br br br Poverty br Alcohol consumption can contribute to secondary poverty where people fall back into poverty after escaping it The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the average American consumer dedicates percent of all their spending to alcohol br br br Unsustainable tourism br Some popular tourist destinations are cracking down on the impacts of tourism from excessive drinking In an effort to promote a more sustainable tourism industry these locations are implementing new regulations to curb binge drinking This includes Llucmajor Palma Calvia Magaluf in Majorca and Sant Antoni in Ibiza where late night sales of alcohol will be banned This comes after years of issues with rowdy tourists and the negative impacts it has on local residents br br br Suicide br Most people are under the influence of sedative hypnotic drugs such as alcohol or benzodiazepines when they die by suicide with alcoholism present in between and of cases Countries that have higher rates of alcohol use and a greater density of bars generally also have higher rates of suicide About of those who have been treated for alcoholism at some point in their life die by suicide Alcoholics who attempt suicide are usually male older and have tried to take their own lives in the past In adolescents who misuse alcohol neurological and psychological dysfunctions may contribute to the increased risk of suicide br br br Interactions br br br Disorders br br br Covid br A study suggests a link between alcohol consumption and worse COVID outcomes Researchers analyzed data from over million people and found that any level of alcohol consumption increased the risk of severe illness intensive care unit admission and needing ventilation compared to non drinkers Even a history of drinking was associated with a higher risk of severe COVID These findings suggest that avoiding alcohol altogether might be beneficial during the pandemic br br br Diabetes br See the insulin section br br br Heptatitis br Alcohol consumption can be especially dangerous for those with pre existing liver damage from hepatitis B or C Even relatively low amounts of alcohol can be life threatening in these cases so a strict adherence to abstinence is highly recommended br br br Hitamine intolerance br Alcohol may release histamine in individuals with histamine intolerance br br br Mental disorders br br Mental disorders can be a significant risk factor for alcohol abuse br Alcohol abuse alcohol dependence and alcoholism are comorbid with anxiety disorders With dual diagnosis the initial symptoms of mental illness tend to appear before those of substance abuse Individuals with common mental health conditions such as depression anxiety or phobias are twice as likely to also report having an alcohol use disorder compared to those without these mental health challenges Alcohol is a major risk factor for self harm Individuals with anxiety disorders who self medicate with drugs or alcohol may also have an increased likelihood of suicidal ideation br br br Peptic ulcer disease br In patients who have a peptic ulcer disease PUD the mucosal layer is broken down by ethanol PUD is commonly associated with the bacteria Helicobacter pylori which secretes a toxin that weakens the mucosal wall allowing acid and protein enzymes to penetrate the weakened barrier Because alcohol stimulates the stomach to secrete acid a person with PUD should avoid drinking alcohol on an empty stomach Drinking alcohol causes more acid release which further damages the already weakened stomach wall Complications of this disease could include a burning pain in the abdomen bloating and in severe cases the presence of dark black stools indicate internal bleeding A person who drinks alcohol regularly is strongly advised to reduce their intake to prevent PUD aggravation br br br Dosage forms br br br Alcohol induced dose dumping AIDD br br Alcohol induced dose dumping AIDD is by definition an unintended rapid release of large amounts of a given drug when administered through a modified release dosage while co ingesting ethanol This is considered a pharmaceutical disadvantage due to the high risk of causing drug induced toxicity by increasing the absorption and serum concentration above the therapeutic window of the drug The best way to prevent this interaction is by avoiding the co ingestion of both substances or using specific controlled release formulations that are resistant to AIDD br br br Drugs br br Alcohol can intensify the sedation caused by antipsychotics and certain antidepressants br Alcohol combined with cannabis not to be confused with tincture of cannabis which contains minute quantities of alcohol known as cross fading and may easily cause spins in people who are drunk and smoke potent cannabis Ethanol increases plasma tetrahydrocannabinol levels which suggests that ethanol may increase the absorption of tetrahydrocannabinol br TOMSO is a lesser known psychedelic drug and a substituted amphetamine TOMSO was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin According to Shulgin s book PiHKAL TOMSO is inactive on its own and requires consumption of alcohol to become active br br br Hypnotics sedatives br br Alcohol can intensify the sedation caused by hypnotics sedatives such as barbiturates benzodiazepines sedative antihistamines opioids nonbenzodiazepines Z drugs such as zolpidem and zopiclone br br br Disulfiram like drugs br br br Disulfiram br Disulfiram inhibits the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase which in turn results in buildup of acetaldehyde a toxic metabolite of ethanol with unpleasant effects The medication or drug is commonly used to treat alcohol use disorder and results in immediate hangover like symptoms upon consumption of alcohol this effect is widely known as disulfiram effect br br br Metronidazole br Metronidazole is an antibacterial agent that kills bacteria by damaging cellular DNA and hence cellular function Metronidazole is usually given to people who have diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile bacteria Patients who are taking metronidazole are sometimes advised to avoid alcohol even after hour following the last dose Although older data suggested a possible disulfiram like effect of metronidazole newer data has challenged this and suggests it does not actually have this effect br br br Insulin br Alcohol consumption can cause hypoglycemia in diabetics on certain medications such as insulin or sulfonylurea by blocking gluconeogenesis br br br NSAIDs br The concomitant use of NSAIDs with alcohol and or tobacco products significantly increases the already elevated risk of peptic ulcers during NSAID therapy br The risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin br br br Stimulants br br Controlled animal and human studies showed that caffeine energy drinks in combination with alcohol increased the craving for more alcohol more strongly than alcohol alone These findings correspond to epidemiological data that people who consume energy drinks generally showed an increased tendency to take alcohol and other substances br Ethanol interacts with cocaine in vivo to produce cocaethylene another psychoactive substance which may be substantially more cardiotoxic than either cocaine or alcohol by themselves br Ethylphenidate formation appears to be more common when large quantities of methylphenidate and alcohol are consumed at the same time such as in non medical use or overdose scenarios However only a small percent of the consumed methylphenidate is converted to ethylphenidate br While nicotinis mimic the name of classic cocktails like the appletini their name deriving from martini combining nicotine with alcohol is a bad idea Tobacco and nicotine actually heighten cravings for alcohol making this a risky mix br br br Methanol and ethylene glycol br br The rate limiting steps for the elimination of ethanol are in common with certain other substances As a result the blood alcohol concentration can be used to modify the rate of metabolism of toxic alcohols such as methanol and ethylene glycol Methanol itself is not highly toxic but its metabolites formaldehyde and formic acid are therefore to reduce the rate of production and concentration of these harmful metabolites ethanol can be ingested Ethylene glycol poisoning can be treated in the same way br br br Warfarin br br Excessive use of alcohol is also known to affect the metabolism of warfarin and can elevate the INR and thus increase the risk of bleeding The U S Food and Drug Administration FDA product insert on warfarin states that alcohol should be avoided The Cleveland Clinic suggests that when taking warfarin one should not drink more than one beer oz of wine or one shot of alcohol per day br br br Special population br br br Isoniazid br br Levels of liver enzymes in the bloodstream should be frequently checked in daily alcohol drinkers pregnant women IV drug users people over and those who have chronic liver disease severe kidney dysfunction peripheral neuropathy or HIV infection since they are more likely to develop hepatitis from INH br br br Pharmacology br br The pharmacology of ethanol involves both pharmacodynamics how it affects the body and pharmacokinetics how the body processes it In the body ethanol primarily affects the central nervous system acting as a depressant and causing sedation relaxation and decreased anxiety The exact mechanism remains elusive but ethanol has been shown to affect ligand gated ion channels particularly the GABAA receptor br After oral ingestion ethanol is absorbed via the stomach and intestines into the bloodstream Ethanol is highly water soluble and diffuses passively throughout the entire body including the brain Soon after ingestion it begins to be metabolized or more by the liver One standard drink is sufficient to almost completely saturate the liver s capacity to metabolize alcohol The main metabolite is acetaldehyde a toxic carcinogen Acetaldehyde is then further metabolized into ionic acetate by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH Acetate is not carcinogenic and has low toxicity but has been implicated in causing hangovers Acetate is further broken down into carbon dioxide and water and eventually eliminated from the body through urine and breath to of ethanol is excreted unchanged in the breath urine and sweat br Alcohol also direct affects a number of other neurotransmitter systems including those of glutamate glycine acetylcholine and serotonin The pleasurable effects of alcohol ingestion are the result of increased levels of dopamine and endogenous opioids in the reward pathways of the brain br br br Safety br br Symptoms of ethanol overdose may include nausea vomiting CNS depression coma acute respiratory failure or death Levels of even less than can cause intoxication with unconsciousness often occurring at Death from ethanol consumption is possible when blood alcohol levels reach A blood level of or more is commonly fatal The oral median lethal dose LD of ethanol in rats is mg kg Directly translated to human beings this would mean that if a person who weighs kg lb drank a mL US fl oz glass of pure ethanol they would theoretically have a risk of dying The highest blood alcohol level ever recorded in which the subject survived is br The DEA has claimed illegal drugs are more deadly than alcohol citing CDC data from showing similar death counts despite alcohol s wider use However this comparison is disputed a JAMA article reported alcohol related deaths in as significantly higher than the DEA s figure of br br br Toxicity br br Ethanol is classified as a hepatotoxin neurotoxin and ototoxin which has acute toxic effects on the liver the nervous system and the ears respectively However ethanol s acute effects on these organs are usually reversible This means that even with a single episode of heavy drinking the body can typically repair itself from the initial damage Methanol laced alcohol on the other hand can cause blindness even in small quantities br br br Chemistry br br Ethanol is also known chemically as alcohol ethyl alcohol or drinking alcohol It is a simple alcohol with a molecular formula of C H O and a molecular weight of g mol The molecular formula of ethanol may also be written as CH CH OH or as C H OH The latter can also be thought of as an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl alcohol group and can be abbreviated as EtOH Ethanol is a volatile flammable colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor Aside from its use as a psychoactive and recreational substance ethanol is also commonly used as an antiseptic and disinfectant a chemical and medicinal solvent and a fuel br br br Production br Ethanol is produced naturally as a byproduct of the metabolic processes of yeast and hence is present in any yeast habitat including even endogenously in humans but it does not cause raised blood alcohol content as seen in the rare medical condition auto brewery syndrome ABS It is manufactured through hydration of ethylene or by brewing via fermentation of sugars with yeast most commonly Saccharomyces cerevisiae The sugars are commonly obtained from sources like steeped cereal grains e g barley grape juice and sugarcane products e g molasses sugarcane juice Ethanol water mixture which can be further purified via distillation br br br Home made alcoholic beverages br br br Homebrewing br br Homebrewing is the brewing of beer or other alcoholic beverages on a small scale for personal non commercial purposes Supplies such as kits and fermentation tanks can be purchased locally at specialty stores or online Beer was brewed domestically for thousands of years before its commercial production although its legality has varied according to local regulation Homebrewing is closely related to the hobby of home distillation the production of alcoholic spirits for personal consumption however home distillation is generally more tightly regulated br br br Moonshine br br Although methanol is not produced in toxic amounts by fermentation of sugars from grain starches it is a major occurrence in fruit spirits However in modern times reducing methanol with the absorption of a molecular sieve is a practical method for production br br br Analogues br br Ethanol has a variety of analogues many of which have similar actions and effects In chemistry alcohol can encompass other mind altering alcohols besides the kind we drink Some examples include synthetic drugs like ethchlorvynol and methylpentynol once used in medicine Also ethanol is colloquially referred to as alcohol because it is the most prevalent alcohol in alcoholic beverages But technically all alcoholic beverages contain several types of psychoactive alcohols that are categorized as primary secondary or tertiary Primary and secondary alcohols are oxidized to aldehydes and ketones respectively while tertiary alcohols are generally resistant to oxidation Ethanol is a primary alcohol that has unpleasant actions in the body many of which are mediated by its toxic metabolite acetaldehyde Less prevalent alcohols found in alcoholic beverages are secondary and tertiary alcohols For example the tertiary alcohol M B which is up to times more potent than ethanol and found in trace quantities in alcoholic beverages has been synthesized and used as a designer drug Alcoholic beverages are sometimes laced with toxic alcohols such as methanol the simplest alcohol and isopropyl alcohol A mild brief exposure to isopropyl alcohol which is only moderately more toxic than ethanol is unlikely to cause any serious harm But many methanol poisoning incidents have occurred through history since methanol is lethal even in small quantities as little as milliliters teaspoons Ethanol is used to treat methanol and ethylene glycol toxicity br The Lucas test differentiates between primary secondary and tertiary alcohols br br br Society and culture br br br Usage br br br Consumption recommendations br br The recommended maximum intake or safe limits of alcohol varies from no intake to daily weekly or daily weekly guidelines provided by health agencies of governments The World Health Organization published a statement in The Lancet Public Health in April that there is no safe amount that does not affect health br According to the U S Department of Agriculture based on NHANES surveys women in the US ages and up consume on average grams day and men consume on average grams day A March review found light moderate daily drinking not significantly associated with increased mortality rate but higher intake raises risk with women affected at lower levels than men However according to a systematic review and meta analysis even at g day large beer the risk of developing an alcohol use disorder AUD is nearly times higher than non drinkers and the risk of dying from an AUD is about times higher than non drinkers br br br Drinking culture br br Ethanol is typically consumed as a recreational substance by mouth in the form of alcoholic beverages such as beer wine and spirits It is commonly used in social settings due to its capacity to enhance sociability br Drinking alcohol is generally socially acceptable and is legal in most countries unlike with many other recreational substances Many students attending colleges universities and other higher education institutions consume alcoholic beverages However there are often restrictions on alcohol sale and use for instance a minimum age for drinking and laws against public drinking and drinking and driving A meta analysis found that alcohol consumption increased on average each year with the most significant rise occurring between the ages of and Drinking peaked around years old then began to decline at br Alcohol holds considerable societal and cultural significance playing a role in social interactions across much of the world Drinking establishments such as bars and nightclubs revolve primarily around the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages and parties festivals and social gatherings commonly involve alcohol consumption Alcohol is related to various societal problems including drunk driving accidental injuries sexual assaults domestic abuse and violent crime Alcohol remains illegal for sale and consumption in a number of countries mainly in the Middle East br Research on the societal benefits of alcohol is rare but a study suggested there it was beneficial Alcohol is often used as a social lubricant it increases occurrences of Duchenne smiling talking and social bonding even when participants are unaware of their alcohol consumption or lack thereof In a study of the UK regular drinking was correlated with happiness feeling that life was worthwhile and life satisfaction According to a causal path analysis the cause was vice versa alcohol consumption was not the cause but rather that the life satisfaction resulted in greater happiness and an inclination to visit pubs and develop a regular drinking venue City centre bars were distinguished by their focus on maximizing alcohol sales Community pubs had less variation in visible group sizes and longer more focused conversations than those in city centre bars Drinking regularly at a community pub led to higher trust in others and better networking with the local community compared to non drinkers and city centre bar drinkers br br br Religion br br The relationship between religion and alcohol exhibits variations across cultures geographical areas and religious denominations Some religions emphasize moderation and responsible use as a means of honoring the divine gift of life while others impose outright bans on alcohol as a means of honoring the divine gift of life Moreover within the same religious tradition there are many adherents that may interpret and practice their faith s teachings on alcohol in diverse ways Hence a wide range of factors such as religious affiliation levels of religiosity cultural traditions family influences and peer networks collectively influence the dynamics of this relationship br The levels of alcohol use in spiritual context can be broken down into br br Prohibition Some religions including Islam prohibit alcohol consumption br Symbolic use In some Christian denominations the sacramental wine is alcoholic however only a sip is taken and it does not raise the blood alcohol content and other denominations are using nonalcoholic wine See also Libation br Discourage consumption Hinduism does not have a central authority which is followed by all Hindus though religious texts generally discourage the use or consumption of alcohol br Inebriating spiritual use See the spiritual section br Recreational use Recreational drug use of alcohol in moderation to celebrate joy is allowed in some religions br Christian views on alcohol are varied For example in the mid th century some Protestant Christians moved from a position of allowing moderate use of alcohol sometimes called moderationism to either deciding that not imbibing was wisest in the present circumstances abstentionism or prohibiting all ordinary consumption of alcohol because it was believed to be a sin prohibitionism br During the Jewish holiday of Purim Jews are obligated to drink especially Kosher wine until their judgmental abilities become impaired according to the Book of Esther However Purim has more of a national than a religious character br br br Law br br br Legal status br br Alcohol consumption is fully legal and available in most countries of the world Home made alcoholic beverages with low alcohol content like wine and beer is also legal in most countries but distilling moonshine outside of a registered distillery remains illegal in most of them br Some majority Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia Kuwait Pakistan Iran and Libya prohibit the production sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages because they are forbidden by Islam Laws banning alcohol consumption are found in some Indian states as well as some Native American reservations in the U S br In addition there are regulations on alcohol sales and use in many countries throughout the world For instance the majority of countries have a minimum legal drinking age to purchase or consume alcoholic beverages although there are often exceptions such as underage consumption of small amounts of alcohol with parental supervision Also some countries have bans on public intoxication Drinking while driving or intoxicated driving is frequently outlawed and it may be illegal to have an open container of alcohol or liquor bottle in an automobile bus or aircraft br In Iran consumption of alcohol one glass is punished by lashes but repeated offences may lead to death penalty although rarely exercised In two men were sentenced to death after a third offense in Khorasan br br br Alcohol packaging warning messages br br Alcohol packaging warning messages alcohol warning labels AWLs are warning messages that appear on the packaging of alcoholic drinks concerning their health effects br A World Health Organization report published in stated br br Alcohol product labelling could be considered as a component of a comprehensive public health strategy to reduce alcohol related harm Adding health labels to alcohol containers is an important first step in raising awareness and has a longer term utility in helping to establish a social understanding of the harmful use of alcohol br br br Criticism of the alcohol industry br br A survey conducted by the American Institute for Cancer Research AICR showed that only of Americans were aware of the associated risk of cancer due to alcohol consumption up from in The AICR believes that alcohol related advertisements about the healthy cardiovascular benefits of modest alcohol overshadow messages about the increased cancer risks br Drinking alcoholic beverages increase the risk for breast cancer Several studies indicate that the use of marketing by the alcohol industry to associate their products with breast cancer awareness campaigns known as pinkwashing is misleading and potentially harmful br The alcohol industries have marketed products directly to the LGBT community In of the sampled parades that listed sponsors of the prides were sponsored by the alcohol industry A study found that alcohol consumption within LGBTQ communities presents a challenge for health promotion efforts The positive association with alcohol within these communities makes it harder to reduce alcohol related health issues br br br Standard drink br br A standard drink is a measure of alcohol consumption representing a fixed amount of pure ethanol used in relation to recommendations about alcohol consumption and its relative risks to health The size of a standard drink varies from g to g across countries but g alcohol millilitres is used in the World Health

a cultural movement and lifestyle of consuming no or limited alcohol that started in the late s It differs from traditional abstinence in that it is not founded on asceticism religious condemnation of alcohol or previous alcohol abuse but motivated by a curiosity of a sober lifestyle Markets have reacted by offering a wider selection of non alcoholic beverages br Sober curiosity is often defined as having the option to question or change one s drinking habits for mental or physical health reasons It may be practised in many ways ranging from complete abstinence to more thought about when and how much is consumed br Since the onset of the COVID pandemic more people in Europe have reduced their alcohol consumption br br br History br br The consumption of alcohol has a long human history Beginning with the Gin Craze excessive drinking and drunkenness developed into a major problem for public health Prohibition marked a turning point as alcohol transitioned from widely accepted to strictly controlled recognized as a dangerous drug After its repeal societal views softened dramatically Alcohol consumption became normalized and for many years the public remained largely unaware of
