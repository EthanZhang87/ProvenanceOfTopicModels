The compact disc CD is a digital optical disc data storage format that was codeveloped by Philips and Sony to store and play digital audio recordings It uses the Compact Disc Digital Audio format which typically provides minutes of audio on a disc In later years the compact disc was adapted for non audio computer data storage purposes as CD ROM and its derivatives First released in Japan in October the CD was the second optical disc technology to be invented after the much larger LaserDisc LD By billion CDs including audio CDs CD ROMs and CD Rs had been sold worldwide br Standard CDs have a diameter of mm in and are designed to hold up to minutes of uncompressed stereo digital audio or about MiB bytes of data Capacity is routinely extended to minutes and MiB bytes by arranging data more closely on the same sized disc The Mini CD has various diameters ranging from to millimetres to in they have been used for CD singles or delivering device drivers br The CD gained rapid popularity in the s quickly outselling all other audio formats in the United States by ending the market dominance of the phonograph record and the cassette tape By the CD accounted for of the entire market share in regard to US music sales The CD is considered the last dominant audio format of the album era as the rise of MP iTunes cellular ringtones and other downloadable music formats in the mid s ended the decade long dominance of the CD br The Digital Audio format was later adapted as CD ROM for general purpose data storage and initially could hold much more data than a personal computer hard disk drive Several other formats were further derived both pre pressed and blank user writable including write once audio and data storage CD R rewritable media CD RW Video CD VCD Super Video CD SVCD Photo CD Picture CD Compact Disc Interactive CD i Enhanced Music CD and Super Audio CD SACD which may have a CD DA layer br br A CD is made from millimetre in thick polycarbonate plastic and weighs grams From the center outward components are the center spindle hole mm the first transition area clamping ring the clamping area stacking ring the second transition area mirror band the program data area and the rim The inner program area occupies a radius from to mm br A thin layer of aluminum or more rarely gold is applied to the surface making it reflective The metal is protected by a film of lacquer normally spin coated directly on the reflective layer The label is printed on the lacquer layer usually by screen printing or offset printing br br CD data is represented as tiny indentations known as pits encoded in a spiral track molded into the top of the polycarbonate layer The areas between pits are known as lands Each pit is approximately nm deep by nm wide and varies from nm to m in length The distance between the windings the pitch is m measured center to center not between the edges br When playing an audio CD a motor within the CD player spins the disc to a scanning velocity of m s constant linear velocity CLV equivalent to approximately RPM at the inside of the disc and approximately RPM at the outside edge The track on the CD begins at the inside and spirals outward so a disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback br br The program area is cm and the length of the recordable spiral is cm m km With a scanning speed of m s the playing time is minutes or MiB of data on a CD ROM A disc with data packed slightly more densely is tolerated by most players though some old ones fail Using a linear velocity of m s and a narrower track pitch of m increases the playing time to minutes and data capacity to MiB Even denser tracks are possible with semi standard minute MiB discs having m and minute MiB having m but compatibility suffers as density increases br br A CD is read by focusing a nm wavelength near infrared semiconductor laser through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected Because the pits are indented into the top layer of the disc and are read through the transparent polycarbonate base the pits form bumps when read The laser hits the disc casting a circle of light wider than the modulated spiral track reflecting partially from the lands and partially from the top of any bumps where they are present As the laser passes over a pit bump its height means that the round trip path of the light reflected from its peak is wavelength out of phase with the light reflected from the land around it This is because the height of a bump is around of the wavelength of the light used so the light falls out of phase before reflection and another wavelength out of phase after reflection This causes partial cancellation of the laser s reflection from the surface By measuring the reflected intensity change with a photodiode a modulated signal is read back from the disc br To accommodate the spiral pattern of data the laser is placed on a mobile mechanism within the disc tray of any CD player This mechanism typically takes the form of a sled that moves along a rail The sled can be driven by a worm gear or linear motor Where a worm gear is used a second shorter throw linear motor in the form of a coil and magnet makes fine position adjustments to track eccentricities in the disk at high speed Some CD drives particularly those manufactured by Philips during the s and early s use a swing arm similar to that seen on a gramophone br br The pits and lands do not directly represent the s and s of binary data Instead non return to zero inverted encoding is used a change from either pit to land or land to pit indicates a while no change indicates a series of s There must be at least two and no more than ten s between each which is defined by the length of the pit This in turn is decoded by reversing the eight to fourteen modulation used in mastering the disc and then reversing the cross interleaved Reed Solomon coding finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc These encoding techniques defined in the Red Book were originally designed for CD Digital Audio but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats such as CD ROM br br CDs are susceptible to damage during handling and from environmental exposure Pits are much closer to the label side of a disc enabling defects and contaminants on the clear side to be out of focus during playback Consequently CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disc Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed allowing gases and liquids to enter the CD and corrode the metal reflective layer and or interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits a condition known as disc rot The fungus Geotrichum candidum has been found under conditions of high heat and humidity to consume the polycarbonate plastic and aluminium found in CDs br The data integrity of compact discs can be measured using surface error scanning which can measure the rates of different types of data errors known as C C CU and extended finer grain error measurements known as E E E E E and E of which higher rates indicate a possibly damaged or unclean data surface low media quality deteriorating media and recordable media written to by a malfunctioning CD writer br Error scanning can reliably predict data losses caused by media deterioration Support of error scanning differs between vendors and models of optical disc drives and extended error scanning known as advanced error scanning in Nero DiscSpeed has only been available on Plextor and some BenQ optical drives so far as of br br The digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge which allows adaptation to the different sizes available Standard CDs are available in two sizes By far the most common is millimetres in in diameter with a or minute audio capacity and a or MiB byte data capacity Discs are millimetres in thick with a millimetres in center hole The size of the hole was chosen by Joop Sinjou and based on a Dutch cent coin a dubbeltje Philips Sony patented the physical dimensions br The official Philips history says the capacity was specified by Sony executive Norio Ohga to be able to contain the entirety of Beethoven s Ninth Symphony on one disc br This is a myth according to Kees Immink as the EFM code format had not yet been decided in December when the mm size was adopted The adoption of EFM in June allowed percent more playing time that would have resulted in minutes for mm diameter or minutes for a disc as small as millimetres in Instead the information density was lowered by percent to keep the playing time at minutes The mm diameter has been adopted by subsequent formats including Super Audio CD DVD HD DVD and Blu ray Disc The millimetre in diameter discs Mini CDs can hold up to minutes of music or MiB br br The logical format of an audio CD officially Compact Disc Digital Audio or CD DA is described in a document produced in by the format s joint creators Sony and Philips The document is known colloquially as the Red Book CD DA after the color of its cover The format is a two channel bit PCM encoding at a kHz sampling rate per channel Four channel sound was to be an allowable option within the Red Book format but has never been implemented Monaural audio has no existing standard on a Red Book CD thus the mono source material is usually presented as two identical channels in a standard Red Book stereo track i e mirrored mono an MP CD can have audio file formats with mono sound br CD Text is an extension of the Red Book specification for an audio CD that allows for the storage of additional text information e g album name song name artist on a standards compliant audio CD The information is stored either in the lead in area of the CD where there are roughly five kilobytes of space available or in the subcode channels R to W on the disc which can store about megabytes br Compact Disc Graphics is a special audio compact disc that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player but when played on a special CD G player it can output a graphics signal typically the CD G player is hooked up to a television set or a computer monitor these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for karaoke performers to sing along with The CD G format takes advantage of the channels R through W These six bits store the graphics information br CD Extended Graphics CD EG also known as CD XG is an improved variant of the Compact Disc Graphics CD G format Like CD G CD EG uses basic CD ROM features to display text and video information in addition to the music being played This extra data is stored in subcode channels R W Very few if any CD EG discs have been published br br Super Audio CD SACD is a high resolution read only optical audio disc format that was designed to provide higher fidelity digital audio reproduction than the Red Book Introduced in it was developed by Sony and Philips the same companies that created the Red Book SACD was in a format war with DVD Audio but neither has replaced audio CDs The SACD standard is referred to as the Scarlet Book standard br Titles in the SACD format can be issued as hybrid discs these discs contain the SACD audio stream as well as a standard audio CD layer which is playable in standard CD players thus making them backward compatible br br CD MIDI is a format used to store music performance data which upon playback is performed by electronic instruments that synthesize the audio Hence unlike the original Red Book CD DA these recordings are not digitally sampled audio recordings The CD MIDI format is defined as an extension of the original Red Book br br For the first few years of its existence the CD was a medium used purely for audio In the Yellow Book CD ROM standard was established by Sony and Philips which defined a non volatile optical data computer data storage medium using the same physical format as audio compact discs readable by a computer with a CD ROM drive br br Video CD VCD View CD and Compact Disc digital video is a standard digital format for storing video media on a CD VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players most modern DVD Video players personal computers and some video game consoles The VCD standard was created in by Sony Philips Matsushita and JVC and is referred to as the White Book standard br Overall picture quality is intended to be comparable to VHS video Poorly compressed VCD video can sometimes be of lower quality than VHS video but VCD exhibits block artifacts rather than analog noise and does not deteriorate further with each use or SIF resolution was chosen because it is half the vertical and half the horizontal resolution of the NTSC video is a similarly one quarter PAL SECAM resolution This approximates the overall resolution of an analog VHS tape which although it has double the number of vertical scan lines has a much lower horizontal resolution br br Super Video CD Super Video Compact Disc or SVCD is a format used for storing video media on standard compact discs SVCD was intended as a successor to VCD and an alternative to DVD Video and falls somewhere between both in terms of technical capability and picture quality br SVCD has two thirds the resolution of DVD and over times the resolution of VCD One CD R disc can hold up to minutes of standard quality SVCD format video While no specific limit on SVCD video length is mandated by the specification one must lower the video bit rate and therefore quality to accommodate very long videos It is usually difficult to fit much more than minutes of video onto one SVCD without incurring a significant quality loss and many hardware players are unable to play a video with an instantaneous bit rate lower than to kilobits per second br br Photo CD is a system designed by Kodak for digitizing and storing photos on a CD Launched in the discs were designed to hold nearly high quality images scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding Photo CDs are defined in the Beige Book and conform to the CD ROM XA and CD i Bridge specifications as well They are intended to play on CD i players Photo CD players and any computer with suitable software irrespective of operating system The images can also be printed out on photographic paper with a special Kodak machine This format is not to be confused with Kodak Picture CD which is a consumer product in CD ROM format br br The Philips Green Book specifies a standard for interactive multimedia compact discs designed for CD i players CD i discs can contain audio tracks that can be played on regular CD players but CD i discs are not compatible with most CD ROM drives and software The CD i Ready specification was later created to improve compatibility with audio CD players and the CD i Bridge specification was added to create CD i compatible discs that can be accessed by regular CD ROM drives br br Philips defined a format similar to CD i called CD i Ready which puts CD i software and data into the pregap of track This format was supposed to be more compatible with older audio CD players br br Enhanced Music CD also known as CD Extra or CD Plus is a format that combines audio tracks and data tracks on the same disc by putting audio tracks in a first session and data in a second session It was developed by Philips and Sony and it is defined in the Blue Book br br VinylDisc is the hybrid of a standard audio CD and the vinyl record The vinyl layer on the disc s label side can hold approximately three minutes of music br br In material costs were cents for the jewel case and to cents for the CD The wholesale cost of CDs was to while the typical retail price of a prerecorded music CD was On average the store received percent of the retail price the record company percent the artist percent the manufacturer percent and the distributor percent When track cartridges compact cassettes and CDs were introduced each was marketed at a higher price than the format they succeeded even though the cost to produce the media was reduced This was done because the perceived value increased This continued from phonograph records to CDs but was broken when Apple marketed MP s for and albums for The incremental cost though to produce an MP is negligible br br Recordable Compact Discs CD Rs are injection molded with a blank data spiral A photosensitive dye is then applied after which the discs are metalized and lacquer coated The write laser of the CD recorder changes the color of the dye to allow the read laser of a standard CD player to see the data just as it would with a standard stamped disc The resulting discs can be read by most CD ROM drives and played in most audio CD players CD Rs follow the Orange Book standard br CD R recordings are designed to be permanent Over time the dye s physical characteristics may change causing read errors and data loss until the reading device cannot recover with error correction methods Errors can be predicted using surface error scanning The design life is from to years depending on the quality of the discs the quality of the writing drive and storage conditions Testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as months under normal storage conditions This failure is known as disc rot for which there are several mostly environmental reasons br The recordable audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder These consumer audio CD recorders use SCMS Serial Copy Management System an early form of digital rights management DRM to conform to the AHRA Audio Home Recording Act The Recordable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD R due to lower production volume and a percent AHRA royalty used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy br High capacity recordable CD is a higher density recording format that can hold more data than conventional discs The higher capacity is incompatible with some recorders and recording software br br CD RW is a re recordable medium that uses a metallic alloy instead of a dye The write laser in this case is used to heat and alter the properties amorphous vs crystalline of the alloy and hence change its reflectivity A CD RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD R and so many earlier CD audio players cannot read CD RW discs although most later CD audio players and stand alone DVD players can CD RWs follow the Orange Book standard br The ReWritable Audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder which will not without modification accept standard CD RW discs These consumer audio CD recorders use the Serial Copy Management System SCMS an early form of digital rights management DRM to conform to the United States Audio Home Recording Act AHRA The ReWritable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD R due to a lower volume and b a percent AHRA royalty used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy br br The Red Book audio specification except for a simple anti copy statement in the subcode does not include any copy protection mechanism Known at least as early as attempts were made by record companies to market copy protected non standard compact discs which cannot be ripped or copied to hard drives or easily converted to other formats like FLAC MP or Vorbis One major drawback to these copy protected discs is that most will not play on either computer CD ROM drives or some standalone CD players that use CD ROM mechanisms Philips has stated that such discs are not permitted to bear the trademarked Compact Disc Digital Audio logo because they violate the Red Book specifications Numerous copy protection systems have been countered by readily available often free software or even by simply turning off automatic AutoPlay to prevent the running of the DRM executable program br br Ecma International Standard ECMA Data Interchange on Read only mm Optical Data Disks CD ROM nd edition June br Pohlmann
