parody contemporary American culture and politics are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest who usually delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast with featured performances by a musical guest An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that was usually based on political events and ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming Live from New York it s Saturday Night properly beginning the show br In Michaels left the show to explore other opportunities He was replaced by Jean Doumanian who was then replaced by Ebersol after a season of bad reviews Ebersol ran the show until when Michaels returned Since then Michaels has held the job of showrunner Many SNL cast members have found national stardom while appearing on the show and achieved success in film and television both in front of and behind the camera Others associated with the show such as writers have gone on to successful careers creating writing and starring in television and film br Broadcast from Studio H at NBC s headquarters in the Comcast Building at Rockefeller Plaza SNL has aired episodes since its debut and began its th season on October making it one of the longest running network television programs in the United States The show format has been developed and recreated in several countries meeting with different levels of success Successful sketches have seen life outside the show as feature films including The Blues Brothers and Wayne s World The show has been marketed in other ways including home media releases of best of and whole seasons and books and documentaries about behind the scenes activities of running and developing the show br Throughout five decades on air Saturday Night Live has received a vast number of awards including Primetime Emmy Awards six Writers Guild of America Awards and three Peabody Awards In it was inducted into the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame It was ranked tenth in TV Guide s Greatest TV Shows of All Time list and in it was listed as one of Time s Best TV Shows of All TIME As of the show had received over Primetime Emmy Award nominations the most received by any television program The live aspect of the show has resulted in several controversies and acts of censorship with mistakes and intentional acts of sabotage by performers as well as guests br br br Development br From until NBC affiliates broadcast The Best of Carson reruns of The Tonight Show originally known as The Saturday Sunday Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson on Saturday or Sunday nights In Johnny Carson announced that he wanted the weekend shows pulled and saved so they could be aired during weeknights allowing him to take time off br In NBC president Herbert Schlosser approached his vice president of late night programming Dick Ebersol and asked him to create a show to fill the Saturday night time slot At the suggestion of Paramount Pictures executive Barry Diller Schlosser and Ebersol then approached Lorne Michaels Over the next three weeks Ebersol and Michaels developed the latter s idea for a variety show featuring high concept comedy sketches political satire and music performances that would attract to year old viewers By Michaels had assembled a talented cast including Dan Aykroyd John Belushi Chevy Chase Jane Curtin Garrett Morris Laraine Newman Michael O Donoghue Gilda Radner and George Coe br Belushi Chase Radner and O Donoghue were all alumni of the comedy productions National Lampoon Lemmings The National Lampoon Radio Hour and The National Lampoon Show which had achieved notoriety in Other National Lampoon veterans like Bill Murray and Brian Doyle Murray later became SNL regulars In fact National Lampoon publisher Matty Simmons had earlier been approached by NBC to work on its planned Saturday night comedy show and turned them down This of course became Saturday Night Live br The show was originally called NBC s Saturday Night because Saturday Night Live was in use by Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell on the rival network ABC After the cancellation of Cosell s show NBC purchased the rights to the name in and officially adopted the new title as of the th episode of the second season the episode hosted by Jack Burns on March However the name change was not finalized until the premiere episode of the show s third season The show was originally conceived with three rotating permanent hosts Lily Tomlin Richard Pryor and George Carlin According to Ebersol consideration was given to Steve Martin and singer Linda Ronstadt also being included as a duo When Pryor dropped out because his brand of comedy was not censor friendly the concept was dropped br br Debuting on October the show quickly developed a cult following eventually becoming a mainstream hit and spawning in Best of Saturday Night Live compilations that reached viewers who could not stay awake for the live broadcasts But during the first season in and some NBC executives were not satisfied with the show s Nielsen ratings and shares Lorne Michaels pointed out to them that Nielsen s measurement of demographics indicated that baby boomers constituted a large majority of the viewers who did commit to watching the show and many of them watched little else on television In and they were the most desirable demographic for television advertisers even though Generation X was the right age for commercials for toys and other children s products Baby boomers far outnumbered Generation X in reality but not in television viewership with the exception of Michaels s new show and major league sports and advertisers had long been concerned about baby boomers distaste for the powerful medium NBC executives eventually understood Michaels s explanation of the desirable demographics and decided to keep the show on the air despite many angry letters and phone calls the network received from viewers who were offended by certain sketches br They included a Weekend Update segment on April that ridiculed Colorado murder suspect Claudine Longet and warranted an on air apology by announcer Don Pardo during the following episode Herminio Traviesas a censor who was vice president of the network s Standards and Practices department objected to cast member Laraine Newman s use of the term pissed off in the March episode with host Anthony Perkins he was in the process of placing the show on a permanent delay of several seconds instead of live but he changed his mind after Newman personally apologized to him In December British singer songwriter Elvis Costello appeared as a last minute replacement after Sex Pistols canceled Within seconds of starting to play the agreed song Less than Zero Costello stopped his band and launched into Radio Radio a song about corporate controlled broadcasting Off camera an enraged Michaels reportedly showed Costello his middle finger throughout the song and Costello was banned from SNL for years br Chase left the show in November of the second season and was replaced a few months later by the relatively unknown comic actor Bill Murray Aykroyd and Belushi left the show in after the end of season four In May after season five Michaels emotionally and physically exhausted requested to place the show on hiatus for a year to allow him time to pursue other projects Concerned that the show would be canceled without him Michaels suggested writers Al Franken Tom Davis and Jim Downey as his replacements NBC president Fred Silverman disliked Franken and was infuriated by Franken s Weekend Update routine on May called A Limo for a Lame O a scathing critique of Silverman s job performance and his insistence on traveling by limousine at the network s expense Silverman blamed Michaels for approving this Weekend Update segment Unable to secure the deal that he wanted Michaels chose to leave NBC for Paramount Pictures intending to bring associate producer Jean Doumanian along with him Michaels later learned that Doumanian had been given his position at SNL after being recommended by her friend NBC Vice President Barbara Gallagher Michaels s departure prompted most of the cast and writing staff to leave the show br The reputation of the show as a springboard to fame meant that many aspiring stars were eager to join the new series Jean Doumanian was tasked with hiring a full cast and writing staff in less than three months and NBC immediately cut the show s budget from the previous million per episode down to just Doumanian faced resentment and sabotage from the remaining Michaels staff The season was a disaster ratings plummeted and audiences failed to connect to the original cast s replacements such as Charles Rocket and Ann Risley Doumanian s fate was sealed when during a sketch Rocket said fuck on live television After only ten months Doumanian was dismissed Although executives suggested SNL be left to die Brandon Tartikoff who succeeded Silverman as network chief in mid wanted to keep the show on the air believing the concept was more important to the network than money Tartikoff turned to Ebersol as his choice for the new producer Ebersol previously had been fired by Silverman Ebersol gained Michaels s approval in an attempt to avoid the same staff sabotage that had blighted Doumanian s tenure br Ebersol s tenure saw commercial success but was considered lackluster compared to the Michaels era except for the breakout of new cast member Eddie Murphy during the sixth season Murphy the main draw of the cast left in to pursue his already successful film career and Ebersol decided to again rebuild the cast He broke with history by hiring established comedians such as Billy Crystal and Martin Short who could bring their already successful material to the show Ebersol s final year with this new cast is considered one of the series funniest but had strayed far from the precedent shattering show Michaels had created After that season Ebersol wanted a more significant revamp including departing from the show s established live format Following unsuccessful forays into film and television in need of money and eager not to see Tartikoff cancel the show Michaels finally returned in after Ebersol opted out The show was again recast with Michaels borrowing Ebersol s idea to seek out established actors such as Joan Cusack and Robert Downey Jr The cast and writers struggled creatively and in April Tartikoff made the decision to cancel the show until he was convinced by producer Bernie Brillstein to give it one more year The show was renewed but for the first time in its history for only thirteen episodes instead of the usual twenty two Michaels again fired most of the cast and learning his lesson from the previous seasons sought out unknown talent such as Dana Carvey and Phil Hartman instead of known names br The show ran successfully again until it lost Carvey and Hartman two of its biggest stars between and Wanting to increase SNL s ratings and profitability then NBC West Coast president Don Ohlmeyer and other executives began to actively interfere in the show recommending that new stars such as Chris Farley and Adam Sandler be fired because Ohlmeyer did not get them and critiquing the costly nature of performing the show live The show faced increasing criticism from the press and cast in part encouraged by the NBC executives hoping to weaken Michaels s position Michaels received a lucrative offer to develop a Saturday night project for CBS during this time but remained loyal to SNL In the mid s the show focused on performers and writers were forced to supply material for the cast s existing characters before they could write original sketches By Ohlmeyer renewed his focus on limiting Michaels s independence forcing the removal of writer Jim Downey and cast member Norm Macdonald br In Lorne Michaels speculated that season of SNL may be his last while Kenan Thompson speculated in that Saturday Night Live may come to an end altogether after its th season in Michaels said in an interview on CBS Mornings that he is committed to doing the show until its th anniversary I d like to see that through and I have a feeling that would be a really good time to leave Thompson has stated that it would make sense financially for NBC to end the show after Michaels s retirement In an interview with Charlamagne tha God Thompson said NBC might slash the budget and then at that point you can t really do the same kind of show So that s unfair to watch it just really go down kind of in flames for real because of those restrictions Capping it at might not be a bad idea Despite these speculations no official announcement has been made regarding the future of SNL br Due to the Writers Guild of America strike the th season was delayed until October br br br Cast and crew br br br Cast br Those selected to join the cast of SNL are normally already accomplished performers recruited from improvisational comedy groups such as The Groundlings Newman Hartman Will Ferrell Jon Lovitz Kristen Wiig and The Second City Aykroyd Farley Tina Fey Tim Meadows or established stand up comedians Carvey Sandler Macdonald Chris Rock who already possess the training or experience necessary for SNL The cast is divided into two tiers the more established group of repertory players and newer unproven cast members known as featured players who may eventually be promoted to the repertory stable Of the many roles available in the show one of the longest running and most coveted is being the host of Weekend Update a segment featuring one or two hosts who get substantial screen time performing as themselves Many of the Weekend Update hosts have gone on to find greater success outside the show including Chase Curtin Murray Fey Macdonald Dennis Miller Jimmy Fallon and Amy Poehler br The original cast of SNL titled The Not Ready For Prime Time Players a term coined by the writer Herb Sargent included Laraine Newman John Belushi Jane Curtin Gilda Radner Dan Aykroyd Garrett Morris and Chevy Chase Radner was the first person hired after Michaels himself Although Chase became a performer he was hired on a one year writer contract and refused to sign the performer contract that was repeatedly given to him allowing him to leave the show after the first season in Newman was brought aboard after having a prior working relationship with Michaels Morris was initially brought in as a writer but attempts to have him fired by another writer led Michaels to have Morris audition for the cast where he turned in a successful performance Curtin and Belushi were the last two cast members hired Belushi had a disdain for television and had repeatedly turned down offers to appear on other shows but decided to work with the show because of the involvement of Radner and writers Anne Beatts and Michael O Donoghue Michaels was still reluctant to hire Belushi believing he would be a source of trouble for the show but Beatts O Donoghue and Ebersol successfully argued for his inclusion br After Chase left the show he was replaced by Bill Murray whom Michaels had intended to hire for the first season cast but was unable to because of budget restrictions When Chase returned to host the episode that aired live on the night of February he found the remaining cast particularly Belushi resentful of his departure and his having been cast as the male lead in Foul Play Murray goaded by other cast members had a physical altercation with Chase while musical guest Billy Joel was performing during the live telecast according to testimony by Laraine Newman and testimony by Lorne Michaels in an oral history of the series published in br Chase s departure for film made Michaels possessive of his talent he threatened to fire Aykroyd if he accepted the role of D Day in the comedy Animal House and later refused to allow SNL musician Paul Shaffer to participate in The Blues Brothers with Aykroyd and Belushi after they left in to pursue film careers Animal House was already a major box office success when Michaels and the cast returned for the fourth season in October Michaels began to struggle to hold the remaining cast together while everyone knew about the independent success of Belushi still with the series Though Chase did not return to the show at all during the fourth season his episodes from the first season and early second season were repeated on Saturday nights when the live show was on hiatus The reruns were seen by Generation X viewers who had missed them when they had aired live Generation X viewers were familiar with Chase from the movie Foul Play whose PG rating allowed children and teens to watch it without permission from parents Animal House had an R rating Chase s ongoing visibility in SNL reruns and cinemas contributed to Michaels concern that other cast members and their Generation X fans considered SNL a launching pad for movies and popular music Aykroyd already had made his movie debut as a leading man in Love at First Sight and though the movie had not been widely seen in the United States Lorne Michaels became concerned that Aykroyd s major success as a musical artist as one of the Blues Brothers could compromise his commitment to performing and writing for their TV series Michaels burden became heavier in when Gilda Radner had a successful one woman Broadway show produced by Michaels himself During the Broadway run of her show cinemas screened the popular comedy Meatballs which launched Murray s movie career The PG rating allowed kids of all ages to watch it This resulted in new SNL viewers who were not familiar with what writers Anne Beatts and Michael O Donoghue considered to be the unorthodox style of the first two seasons The rapidly changing viewer demographics caused Michaels to become even more concerned about the possible departures of cast members and writers In he chose to leave the series to pursue other interests and was replaced by Jean Doumanian who wanted to give the show a fresh start with a new cast and writing staff Michaels was followed out the door by the remaining original cast Curtin Newman Radner Morris Murray and additional cast members br The Doumanian era cast faced immediate comparisons to the beloved former cast and was not received favorably Ebersol fired the majority of her hires except for two unknown comedians Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo Talent coordinator Neil Levy claimed Murphy contacted and pleaded with him for a role on the show and after seeing him audition Levy fought with Doumanian to cast him instead of Robert Townsend Doumanian wanted only one black cast member and favored Townsend but Levy convinced her to choose Murphy Doumanian also claimed credit for discovering Murphy and fighting with NBC executives to bring him onto the show Even so Murphy would languish as a background character until Ebersol took charge after which Murphy was credited with much of that era s success Murphy s star exploded and he quickly appeared in films such as Hrs and Trading Places before leaving for his film career in early br Much of the Ebersol cast departed after the season and were replaced with established comedians who could supply their own material but at an inflated cost Billy Crystal and Martin Short were paid and per episode respectively far more than earlier salaries Michaels s return in saw a cast reset that featured talent such as Robert Downey Jr Jon Lovitz and Dennis Miller The season was poorly received and another reset followed in Michaels kept Lovitz Miller and Nora Dunn and brought in new untested talent such as Conan O Brien Robert Smigel Greg Daniels Bob Odenkirk Kevin Nealon Dana Carvey Phil Hartman and Jan Hooks who together would define a new era on the show into the early s br In and new talent such as Mike Myers Adam Sandler and Chris Farley were added Afraid of cast members leaving for film careers Michaels had overcrowded the cast causing a divide between the veteran members and the new younger talent increasing competition for limited screen time By Carvey and Hartman had left taking with them a large number of characters Myers quit for his movie career and increasing network pressure forced Michaels to fire Sandler and Farley The show saw its next major overhaul bringing in a largely new cast including Will Ferrell Molly Shannon Cheri Oteri and Darrell Hammond Within a few years Jimmy Fallon and Tina Fey also joined the cast br Kenan Thompson is the show s longest serving cast member Thompson first joined the series in and has been on the show for twenty years The show saw a big transition of cast members in with the addition of six cast members to compensate for the departure of several longtime cast members like Bill Hader Jason Sudeikis and Fred Armisen In Sasheer Zamata was added as a cast member mid season after criticism of the show s lack of an African American woman From Seth Meyers was the solo host of Weekend Update before being partnered with Cecily Strong in After Meyers left for Late Night with Seth Meyers in February Strong was paired with head writer Colin Jost However later that year she was replaced by writer Michael Che The next biggest transition happened in when the show hired four new cast members in the wake of the departures of cast members including Kate McKinnon Pete Davidson and Aidy Bryant br As of Season SNL has featured cast members including besides the above mentioned players Rachel Dratch Amy Poehler Chris Rock David Spade Will Forte Julia Louis Dreyfus Tracy Morgan Chris Parnell Maya Rudolph Andy Samberg Molly Shannon Kristen Wiig and many others Currently the cast consists of members with repertory players and featured players br br The cast were often contracted from anywhere between five and six years to the show but starting with the season new hires were tied to a rewritten contract that allowed NBC to take a cast member in at least their second year and put them in an NBC sitcom Cast members are given the option of rejecting the first two sitcom offers but must accept the third offer with the sitcom contract length dictated by NBC and potentially lasting up to six years The move drew criticism from talent agents and managers who believed a cast member could be locked into a contract with NBC for twelve years six on SNL and then six on a sitcom The contract also optioned the cast member for three feature films produced by SNL Films a company owned by NBC Paramount Pictures and Michaels The new contracts were reportedly developed after many previously unknown cast such as Mike Myers and Adam Sandler gained fame on SNL only to leave and make money for other studios In a interview Wiig was reported to be contracted to SNL for a total of seven years The contracts also contain a network option that allows NBC to remove a cast member at any time In the first season of the show the cast was paid per episode rising to by season two and by season four By the late s new cast members received a salary between and per episode increasing to in the second year and up to for a cast member in their fifth year Performers could earn an additional per episode for writing a sketch that made it to air In Ferrell became the highest paid cast member being paid per season approximately per episode br br br Writers br br As of the season Kent Sublette Alison Gates and Streeter Seidell are the show s co head writers br Seth Meyers became a co head writer in became the single head writer from to and then left in The Weekend Update segment has its own dedicated team of writers led by head writer and producer Alex Baze as of the season Scenes on Weekend Update that involve members of the cast acting in character alongside the host are often written by staff writers outside the dedicated Weekend Update team who know those characters better br Colin Jost has been a writer since and was one of the head writers from to before being renamed head writer from until Michael Che has been a writer since He temporarily left the show in the summer of but came back that fall to anchor Update and reclaimed his status as a writer then serving as a co head writer alongside Jost for five years br SNL writers are often also performers or experienced in writing and improvisational comedy Many are hired from similar backgrounds such as The Groundlings Second City Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre and ImprovOlympic Comedian Jim Downey was head writer for nine years beginning in Experienced writers with backgrounds in television shows are also sometimes brought into the SNL writing room Like the SNL cast who appear on camera many of the writers have been able to find their own success outside the show such as Conan O Brien who was brought into SNL from The Groundlings in went on to write for The Simpsons and eventually began hosting his own show Former head writer Adam McKay along with performer Ferrell founded the successful comedy website Funny or Die In Tina Fey became the first woman SNL head writer and successfully made the transition to starring on the show as well as writing and starring in feature films ultimately creating and starring in her own show Rock which was partly based on her SNL experiences In Fey was paid million per season for her dual role as head writer and performer Writer John Mulaney has also found success outside of SNL through well received stand up specials his Broadway act The Oh Hello Show and the special John Mulaney the Sack Lunch Bunch br br br Announcers br Don Pardo served as the announcer for the series when it began and continued in the role for all but season seven between and when Michaels had left and Mel Brandt and Bill Hanrahan filled the announcing role In Pardo announced that he would step down from his position but then continued in the role until when he again announced his retirement but then continued into the season br In the year old Pardo was reported to be again considering his retirement but continued to serve as announcer until his death at age on August following the th season Apart from a brief period in in which Pardo pre recorded his announcements at his home in Arizona he flew to New York City to perform his announcing duties live until when he began recording permanently from Arizona Former cast members Joe Piscopo and Darrell Hammond have also impersonated Pardo and fulfilled his announcing duties during times Pardo was unavailable Hammond took over as full time announcer starting with season br br br Hosts and musical guests br br A typical episode of SNL will feature a single host chosen for their popularity or novelty or because they have a film album or other work being released near the time of their appearance on the show The host delivers the opening monologue and goodnights introduces the musical guest and performs in sketches with the cast Traditionally the host of the show ends the opening monologue by mentioning the musical guest for the night and saying We got a great show for you tonight musical guest is are here So stick around we ll be right back Comedian George Carlin was the first to host SNL in the debut October episode three episodes later Candice Bergen became the first woman to host and subsequently the first host to return Guests who have hosted five or more times are sometimes referred to as belonging to the Five Timers Club a term that originated on a sketch performed on Tom Hanks s fifth episode As of February actor Alec Baldwin holds the record for most times hosting having performed the duty on seventeen different occasions since Baldwin took the record from actor Steve Martin who has hosted fifteen times since Occasionally former SNL cast members also host br Each episode also features a musical guest a solo act or a band who performs two or three musical numbers Occasionally the musical guest simultaneously serves as the host and may also appear in comedy sketches As of October Dave Grohl is the most frequent musical guest performing on fourteen shows since Michaels strongly opposes the use of pre recorded vocals during musical performances br Michaels does not allow musical guests to perform using lip synching tracks believing it diminishes the live aspect of the show Exceptions are made only when the musical act is focused on intense dance routines instead of vocals where it is difficult to be both heavily physically active and sing A performance by pop group ABBA was the first and only act to feature lip synching until the controversial performance of Ashlee Simpson br The December episode hosted by Paul Rudd became the first episode to not feature any musical performances since the first episode of season as well as the third episode in the show s duration to not have a musical guest due to the rise of the Omicron variant in New York City during the COVID pandemic Charli XCX was planned as the musical guest but her performance was cancelled due to the new restrictions as the show had a limited cast and crew and no audience She was due to perform Good Ones and New Shapes on this episode with Christine and the Queens and Caroline Polachek scheduled to guest on the latter performance XCX s only appearance in the episode however was in the pre recorded music video spoof called The Christmas Socks where she played a parrot named T J Rocks To make up for time and the lack of cast members classic Christmas sketches are shown with some sketches introduced by Tina Fey Tom Hanks and Kenan Thompson br br br The Band br br The Saturday Night Live Band also known as The Live Band is the house band for SNL Academy Award winning composer Howard Shore served as the first musical director from to appearing in many musical sketches including Howard Shore and His All Nurse Band and backing a U S Coast Guard chorus Howard Shore and the Shore Patrol Over the years the band has featured several New York studio musicians including Paul Shaffer Lou Marini David Sanborn Michael Brecker the early s Ray Chew Alan Rubin Georg Wadenius Steve Ferrone David Johansen performing as Buster Poindexter Tom Malone who took over as musical director from to and G E Smith musical director from to As of the band is under the leadership of Tower of Power alumnus Lenny Pickett keyboardist Leon Pendarvis and Eli Brueggemann who does not play in the band on the live show The band plays instrumentals leading in and out of station breaks affiliates who run no advertising during these interludes hear the band play complete songs behind a Saturday Night Live bumper graphic until the program resumes The band plays Closing Theme Waltz in A written by Shore at the end of the show br br br Production br br br The studio br br Since the show s inception SNL has aired from Studio H located on floors eight and nine of the Comcast Building formerly the RCA Building and GE Building now Rockefeller Plaza or Rock The studio had originally been used as a radio soundstage for Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra Michaels was dumbfounded when he originally inspected Studio H in and found it technically limited outdated in need of repair and lacking the capacity to host a live show Michaels demanded that NBC executives rebuild the studio and improve the acoustics to accommodate the intended musical acts at a cost of approximately Three of the shows of the season were shot at the former NBC Studios in Brooklyn due to NBC News using Studio H for presidential election coverage br During the summer shooting hiatus crews began renovations on Studio H With its thirty first season premiere in October the show began broadcasting in high definition television appearing letterboxed on conventional television screens The offices of SNL writers producers and other staff can be found on the th floor of Rock br br br Creating an episode br Production on an SNL episode will normally start on a Monday with a free form pitch meeting between the cast writers producers including Michaels and the guest host in Michaels s office over two hours The host is invited to pitch ideas during this meeting Although some sketchwriting may occur on the day the bulk of the work revolves around pitching ideas Tuesday is the only day dedicated purely to writing the scripts a process that usually extends through the night into the following morning Writing may not begin until p m on Tuesday At p m on Wednesday the sketches are read by the cast during a round table meeting in the writers room attended by the writers and producers present during the pitch meeting technical experts such as make up artists who may be required to realize certain sketch ideas such as those using prosthetics and other producers resulting in attendance of approximately fifty people At this point there may be at least forty sketch ideas that are read through in turn lasting upwards of three hours br After completion of the read through Michaels the head writer the guest host and some of the show producers will move to Michaels office to decide the layout of the show and decide which of the sketches will be developed for air Once complete the writers and cast are allowed into Michaels s office to view the show breakdown and learn whether or not their sketch has survived Sketches may be rewritten starting the same day but will certainly commence on Thursday Work focuses on developing and rewriting the remaining sketches and possibly rehearsals If a sketch is still scheduled beyond Thursday it is rehearsed on Friday or Saturday before moving to a rehearsal before a live audience at p m again on Saturday before the live show After the rehearsal Michaels will review the show lineup to ensure it meets a minute length and sketches that have made it as far as the live rehearsal may be removed This often results in less than two days of rehearsal for the eight to twelve sketches that have made it to the stage that then may appear on the live broadcast The opening monologue spoken by the guest host is given low priority and can be written as late as Saturday afternoon br According to an interview with Tina Fey in the three to four member dedicated Weekend Update writing team will write jokes throughout the week The host s of Weekend Update will normally not work with or read the scripts from the team until Thursday evening after the main show sketches have been finalized The host s will then work on contributing to the script where necessary As of late Weekend Update now has its own separate writing staff dedicated to writing news jokes br br br Post production br With onsite facilities housed on floors eight and seventeen of Rockefeller Plaza post production duties on live broadcasts of Saturday Night Live include the mixing of audio and video elements by the Senior Audio Mixer coupled with additional audio feeds consisting of music sound effects music scoring and pre recorded voiceovers All sources are stored digitally with shows captured and segregated into individual elements to reorganize for future repeats and syndication The production tracking system was migrated from primarily analog to digital in with live shows typically requiring terabytes of storage consisting of audio elements and five cameras worth of visual elements Elements of Saturday Night Live that are pre recorded such as certain commercial parodies SNL Digital Shorts and show graphics are processed off site in the post production facilities of Broadway Video br br br Filming and photography br Studio H production facilities are maintained by NBC Production Services As of the show uses five Sony HDC cameras primarily mounted on Vinten pedestals although one is mounted on a Chapman Leonard Electra crane br As of a Grass Valley GVG digital component production switcher and GVG digital component routing switcher are used to route visual feeds to the control room with multiple digital and analog video recorders used to store footage Graphics are provided by a Chyron Lyric Pro character generator and an Avid Deko character generator Audio facilities consist of a Calrec T Series digitally controlled analog mixing console and a Yamaha digital mixing console used for tape playback support and utility audio work While exact budgets for other seasons are not known the th season had a budget of over million for which it received a subsidy from New York State in the amount of million br As of the opening title sequence and opening montage are shot using the Canon EOS D Mark II and Canon EOS D digital SLR cameras Typical elements are recorded at thirty frames per second fps with slow motion sequences shot at sixty fps both in full p high definition br Edie Baskin was the original SNL photographer She was hired after Michaels saw her photographs of Las Vegas and other work Baskin helped create the opening title sequence for the show by taking photos of New York City at night The first episode used publicity photos of host George Carlin as transitional bumpers between the show and commercial breaks the second episode used photos Baskin had already taken of host Paul Simon It was then that Michaels suggested that Baskin photograph the hosts for the bumpers instead of using publicity photos beginning a tradition that continues today br Since Mary Ellen Matthews has been the official photographer of SNL responsible for devising distinctive photo layouts and aesthetics for still imagery used on the show Matthews creates photo portraits of the hosts and musical guests of each episode which are used as commercial bumpers The limited time frame between the host s involvement in the production process and the Live show requires Matthews to create makeshift photo studios on site at Rock with Matthews attempting to shoot the host on Tuesday and the musical guest on Thursday although the availability of either can mean the photoshoot for both occurs as late as Thursday Matthews employs flattering portrait lighting with hard lights to achieve a Hollywood style On the lighting Matthews commented I think it just helps the image pop off the screen If you use soft or flat lighting it becomes not as dimensional The classic Hollywood lighting gives a little more contrast and if I use edge lights and then light the background it goes farther and farther back I try to achieve that depth as much as I can Matthews is also responsible for taking cast photos behind the scenes images documenting rehearsals and promotional photos As of she has also been involved in directing videos including the show title sequence br br br Broadcast br br The show begins at p m Eastern Time and is scheduled for a minute timeslot ending at a m br For most of SNL s history it aired live only to
