Puddleglum is a fictional character in the children s fantasy series The Chronicles of Narnia by C S Lewis Puddleglum appears as a principal character in The Silver Chair and is mentioned briefly at the end of The Last Battle Puddleglum is a Marsh wiggle a species invented by Lewis which appears only in this book and the only Marsh wiggle given a name or any lines of dialogue He is gloomy and pessimistic and described by other characters as a wet blanket although by his account other Marsh wiggles are gloomier still br Lewis said that his gardener Fred Paxford served as a model for Puddleglum br br The name Puddleglum can be viewed as a concatenation of Puddle for Puddleglum s association with water and wetlands and glum which describes his outlook on life It likely derives from the translator John Studley whose comical choices of words Lewis criticized br br Studley uses more often than his fellows that diction which cannot now be read without a smile frostyface topsy turvy and for Tacitae Stygis Stygian puddle glum The association is further strengthened by the fact that Stygian refers to the River Styx which was said to flow through the classical Underworld and the three adventurers in The Silver Chair descend to the Narnian Underworld br br Puddleglum first appears in chapter of The Silver Chair as the companion of Eustace and Jill as they search for Prince Rilian heir to the Narnian throne who disappeared years earlier He is a caricature of pessimism and a bastion of gloomy fortitude I see you re making the best of a bad job That s right You ve been well brought up you have You ve learned to put a good face on things But in the end Lewis gives readers a small sign that maybe spending time with Eustace and Jill has had an effect on him After Jill surprises him with a farewell hug and kiss Puddleglum remarks Well I wouldn t have dreamt of her doing that Even though I am a good looking chap br While the children initially and not entirely without merit consider him a wet blanket who removes the good from any situation he proves to be a strong and steadfast companion especially in Underland where he is all they have to cling to It is Puddleglum who often spots the best course of action and ultimately Puddleglum who wins the debate with the Lady of the Green Kirtle breaking her spell and releasing the Prince by stamping out her magical fire badly injuring his foot in the process though not as much as a normal human would since his feet are webbed She reacts furiously and turns into a serpent only to be killed by Rilian Puddleglum then joins Rilian and the two children on their escape from the Underworld to Narnia br br Lewis himself an expert on allegory did not consider The Chronicles of Narnia allegory He saw them as suppositional answering the question What might Christ become like if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours This is not allegory at all While not allegorical Narnia does present significant parallels with elements from Christianity br Lewis is perhaps using Puddleglum to give a somewhat existential statement of faith when he writes Suppose we have only dreamed or made up all of those things trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself Suppose we have Then all I can say is that in that case the made up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones We re just babies making up a game if you re right But four babies playing a game can make a play world which licks your real world hollow That s why I m going to stand by the play world I m on Aslan s side even if there isn t any Aslan to lead it I m going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn t any Narnia and that s a small loss if the world s as dull as you say Lewis himself said of this passage br br I suppose your philosopher son means the chapter in which Puddleglum puts out the fire with his foot He must thank Anselm and Descartes for it not me I have simply put the Ontological Proof in a form suitable for children And even that is not so remarkable a feat as you might think You can get into children s heads a good deal which is quite beyond the Bishop of Woolwich br Lewis has in sending the protagonists underground to a world which claims to be the only true one also presented children with an inversion of Plato s allegory of the cave Puddleglum with Plato recognizes the difference between the world of shadows and the world with the sun br br In the television serial produced by the BBC The Silver Chair Puddleglum was portrayed by Tom Baker br The voice of Puddleglum was provided by Ron Moody on Focus on the Family Radio Theatre s dramatization of The Silver Chair and by Bernard Cribbins in the BBC Radio adaptation of the same story br br The Christian rock band The Swift were formerly known as Puddleglum br A character from the children s book Kendra Kandlestar and the Box of Whispers by Lee Edward F di is named Pugglemud as a homage to Puddleglum br American singer songwriter Sarah Sparks sings Puddleglum s Anthem on her album Into the Lantern
