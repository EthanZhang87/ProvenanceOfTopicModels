Rome Italian and Latin Roma pronounced ro ma is the capital city of Italy It is also the capital of the Lazio region the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome Capital and a special comune municipality named Comune di Roma Capitale With residents in km sq mi Rome is the country s most populated comune and the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits The Metropolitan City of Rome with a population of residents is the most populous metropolitan city in Italy Its metropolitan area is the third most populous within Italy Rome is located in the central western portion of the Italian Peninsula within Lazio Latium along the shores of the Tiber Vatican City the smallest country in the world is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome the only existing example of a country within a city Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location and also as the Eternal City Rome is generally considered to be the cradle of Western civilization and Western Christian culture and the centre of the Catholic Church br Rome s history spans centuries While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around BC the site has been inhabited for much longer making it a major human settlement for over three millennia and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe The city s early population originated from a mix of Latins Etruscans and Sabines Eventually the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire and is regarded by many as the first ever Imperial city and metropolis It was first called The Eternal City Latin Urbs Aeterna Italian La Citt Eterna by the Roman poet Tibullus in the st century BC and the expression was also taken up by Ovid Virgil and Livy Rome is also called Caput Mundi Capital of the World br After the fall of the Empire in the west which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy and in the th century it became the capital of the Papal States which lasted until Beginning with the Renaissance almost all popes since Nicholas V pursued a coherent architectural and urban programme over four hundred years aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural centre of the world In this way Rome first became one of the major centres of the Renaissance and then became the birthplace of both the Baroque style and Neoclassicism Famous artists painters sculptors and architects made Rome the centre of their activity creating masterpieces throughout the city In Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy which in became the Italian Republic br In Rome was the th most visited city in the world with million tourists the third most visited city in the European Union and the most popular tourist destination in Italy Its historic centre is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site The host city for the Summer Olympics Rome is also the seat of several specialised agencies of the United Nations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization FAO the World Food Programme WFP and the International Fund for Agricultural Development IFAD The city also hosts the Secretariat of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean UfM as well as the headquarters of many multinational companies such as Eni Enel TIM Leonardo and banks such as BNL Numerous companies are based within Rome s EUR business district such as the luxury fashion house Fendi located in the Palazzo della Civilt Italiana The presence of renowned international brands in the city has made Rome an important centre of fashion and design and the Cinecitt Studios have been the set of many Academy Award winning movies br br br Name and symbol br br br Etymology br According to the Ancient Romans founding myth the name Roma came from the city s founder and first king Romulus br However it is possible that the name Romulus was actually derived from Rome itself As early as the th century there have been alternative theories proposed on the origin of the name Roma Several hypotheses have been advanced focusing on its linguistic roots which however remain uncertain br br From Rumon or Rumen archaic name of the Tiber which in turn is supposedly related to the Greek verb rh to flow stream and the Latin verb ru to hurry rush br From the Etruscan word ruma whose root is rum teat with possible reference either to the totem wolf that adopted and suckled the cognately named twins Romulus and Remus or to the shape of the Palatine and Aventine Hills br From the Greek word rh m which means strength br br br Other names and symbols br Rome has also been called in ancient times simply Urbs central city from urbs roma or identified with its ancient Roman initialism of SPQR the symbol of Rome s constituted republican government Furthermore Rome has been called Urbs Aeterna The Eternal City Caput Mundi The Capital of the world Throne of St Peter and Roma Capitale br br br History br br br Earliest history br br While there have been discoveries of archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from approximately years ago the dense layer of much younger debris obscures Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites Evidence of stone tools pottery and stone weapons attest to about years of human presence Several excavations support the view that Rome grew from pastoral settlements on the Palatine Hill built above the area of the future Roman Forum Between the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age each hill between the sea and the Capitoline Hill was topped by a village on the Capitoline a village is attested since the end of the th century BC However none of them yet had an urban quality Nowadays there is a wide consensus that the city developed gradually through the aggregation synoecism of several villages around the largest one placed above the Palatine This aggregation was facilitated by the increase of agricultural productivity above the subsistence level which also allowed the establishment of secondary and tertiary activities These in turn boosted the development of trade with the Greek colonies of southern Italy mainly Ischia and Cumae These developments which according to archaeological evidence took place during the mid eighth century BC can be considered as the birth of the city Despite recent excavations at the Palatine hill the view that Rome was founded deliberately in the middle of the eighth century BC as the legend of Romulus suggests remains a fringe hypothesis br br br Legend of the founding of Rome br br Traditional stories handed down by the ancient Romans themselves explain the earliest history of their city in terms of legend and myth The most familiar of these myths and perhaps the most famous of all Roman myths is the story of Romulus and Remus the twins who were suckled by a she wolf They decided to build a city but after an argument Romulus killed his brother and the city took his name According to the Roman annalists this happened on April BC This legend had to be reconciled with a dual tradition set earlier in time that had the Trojan refugee Aeneas escape to Italy and found the line of Romans through his son Iulus the namesake of the Julio Claudian dynasty This was accomplished by the Roman poet Virgil in the first century BC In addition Strabo mentions an older story that the city was an Arcadian colony founded by Evander Strabo also writes that Lucius Coelius Antipater believed that Rome was founded by Greeks br br br Monarchy and republic br br After the foundation by Romulus according to a legend Rome was ruled for a period of years by a monarchical system initially with sovereigns of Latin and Sabine origin later by Etruscan kings The tradition handed down seven kings Romulus Numa Pompilius Tullus Hostilius Ancus Marcius Tarquinius Priscus Servius Tullius and Lucius Tarquinius Superbus br In BC the Romans expelled the last king from their city and established an oligarchic republic Rome then began a period characterised by internal struggles between patricians aristocrats and plebeians small landowners and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy Etruscans Latins Volsci Aequi and Marsi After becoming master of Latium Rome led several wars against the Gauls Osci Samnites and the Greek colony of Taranto allied with Pyrrhus king of Epirus whose result was the conquest of the Italian peninsula from the central area up to Magna Graecia br The third and second century BC saw the establishment of Roman hegemony over the Mediterranean and the Balkans through the three Punic Wars BC fought against the city of Carthage and the three Macedonian Wars BC against Macedonia The first Roman provinces were established at this time Sicily Sardinia and Corsica Hispania Macedonia Achaea and Africa br From the beginning of the nd century BC power was contested between two groups of aristocrats the optimates representing the conservative part of the Senate and the populares which relied on the help of the plebs urban lower class to gain power In the same period the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates caused large scale migration to the city The continuous warfare led to the establishment of a professional army which turned out to be more loyal to its generals than to the republic Because of this in the second half of the second century and during the first century BC there were conflicts both abroad and internally after the failed attempt of social reform of the populares Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus and the war against Jugurtha there was a civil war from which the general Sulla emerged victorious A major slave revolt under Spartacus followed and then the establishment of the first Triumvirate with Caesar Pompey and Crassus br The conquest of Gaul made Caesar immensely powerful and popular which led to a second civil war against the Senate and Pompey After his victory Caesar established himself as dictator for life His assassination led to a second Triumvirate among Octavian Caesar s grandnephew and heir Mark Antony and Lepidus and to another civil war between Octavian and Antony br br br Empire br br In BC Octavian became princeps civitatis and took the title of Augustus founding the principate a diarchy between the princeps and the senate During the reign of Nero two thirds of the city was ruined after the Great Fire of Rome and the persecution of Christians commenced Rome was established as a de facto empire which reached its greatest expansion in the second century under the Emperor Trajan Rome was confirmed as caput Mundi i e the capital of the known world an expression which had already been used in the Republican period During its first two centuries the empire was ruled by emperors of the Julio Claudian Flavian who also built an eponymous amphitheatre known as the Colosseum and Antonine dynasties This time was also characterised by the spread of the Christian religion preached by Jesus Christ in Judea in the first half of the first century under Tiberius and popularised by his apostles through the empire and beyond The Antonine age is considered the zenith of the Empire whose territory ranged from the Atlantic Ocean to the Euphrates and from Britain to Egypt br br After the end of the Severan Dynasty in the Empire entered into a year period known as the Crisis of the Third Century during which there were numerous putsches by generals who sought to secure the region of the empire they were entrusted with due to the weakness of central authority in Rome There was the so called Gallic Empire from to and the revolts of Zenobia and her father from the mid s which sought to fend off Persian incursions Some regions Britain Spain and North Africa were hardly affected Instability caused economic deterioration and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses The Germanic tribes along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious uncoordinated incursions from the s s that were more like giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle The Persian Empire invaded from the east several times during the s to s but were eventually defeated Emperor Diocletian undertook the restoration of the State He ended the Principate and introduced the Tetrarchy which sought to increase state power The most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the State down to the city level whereas the State had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges from his reign the State did this down to the village level In a vain attempt to control inflation he imposed price controls which did not last He or Constantine regionalised the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses the consensus seems to have shifted from to as the date of creation due to the argument of Constantin Zuckerman in Sur la liste de V rone et la province de Grande Arm nie M langes Gilber Dagron The existence of regional fiscal units from served as the model for this unprecedented innovation The emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors Henceforth civilian administration and military command would be separate He gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control Diocletian ruled the eastern half residing in Nicomedia In he elevated Maximian to Augustus of the western half where he ruled mostly from Mediolanum when not on the move In he created two junior emperors the Caesars one for each Augustus Constantius for Britain Gaul and Spain whose seat of power was in Trier and Galerius in Sirmium in the Balkans The appointment of a Caesar was not unknown Diocletian tried to turn into a system of non dynastic succession Upon abdication in the Caesars succeeded and they in turn appointed two colleagues for themselves br After the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in and a series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power during the years the Tetrarchy was abandoned Constantine the Great undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy not by changing the structure but by rationalising the competencies of the several ministries during the years after he defeated Licinius emperor in the East at the end of The so called Edict of Milan of actually a fragment of a letter from Licinius to the governors of the eastern provinces granted freedom of worship to everyone including Christians and ordered the restoration of confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses He funded the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored in part much later He transformed the town of Byzantium into his new residence which however was not officially anything more than an imperial residence like Milan or Trier or Nicomedia until given a city prefect in May by Constantius II Constantinople br Christianity in the form of the Nicene Creed became the official religion of the empire in via the Edict of Thessalonica issued in the name of three emperors Gratian Valentinian II and Theodosius I with Theodosius clearly the driving force behind it He was the last emperor of a unified empire after his death in his sons Arcadius and Honorius divided the empire into a western and an eastern part The seat of government in the Western Roman Empire was transferred to Ravenna in but from the emperors mostly resided in the capital city Rome br br Rome which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire was sacked in by the Visigoths led by Alaric I but very little physical damage was done most of which was repaired What could not be so easily replaced were portable items such as artwork in precious metals and items for domestic use loot The popes embellished the city with large basilicas such as Santa Maria Maggiore with the collaboration of the emperors The population of the city had fallen from to by the time the city was sacked in by Genseric king of the Vandals The weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay leading to the deposition of Romulus Augustus on August which marked the end of the Western Roman Empire and for many historians the beginning of the Middle Ages br The decline of the city s population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from North Africa from onward and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations to support a population that was too large for the resources available Even so strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental centre the palatine and the largest baths which continued to function until the Gothic siege of The large baths of Constantine on the Quirinale were even repaired in and the extent of the damage exaggerated and dramatised br However the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay because of the large abandoned areas due to population decline The population declined to by and by AD perhaps larger though no certain figure can be known After the Gothic siege of the population dropped to but had risen to by the papacy of Gregory the Great The population decline coincided with the general collapse of urban life in the West in the fifth and sixth centuries with few exceptions Subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members of society continued right through the sixth century and probably prevented the population from falling further The figure of is based on the amount of pork lbs distributed to poorer Romans during five winter months at the rate of five Roman lbs per person per month enough for persons or or of the total population Grain distribution to ticket holders at the same time suggests Augustus set the number at or one fifth of the population br br br Middle Ages br br After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in AD Rome was first under the control of Odoacer and then became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom before returning to East Roman control after the Gothic War which devastated the city in and Its population declined from more than a million in AD to in to after the Gothic War reducing the sprawling city to groups of inhabited buildings interspersed among large areas of ruins vegetation vineyards and market gardens It is generally thought the population of the city until AD was million estimates range from million to declining to in AD in AD and down to in AD though it may have been twice this br The Bishop of Rome called the Pope was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles Peter and Paul there The Bishops of Rome were also seen and still are seen by Catholics as the successors of Peter who is considered the first Bishop of Rome The city thus became of increasing importance as the centre of the Catholic Church br After the Lombard invasion of Italy the city remained nominally Byzantine but in reality the popes pursued a policy of equilibrium between the Byzantines the Franks and the Lombards In the Lombard king Liutprand donated the north Latium town of Sutri to the Church starting its temporal power In Pepin the Short after having defeated the Lombards gave the Pope temporal jurisdiction over the Roman Duchy and the Exarchate of Ravenna thus creating the Papal States Since this period three powers tried to rule the city the pope the nobility together with the chiefs of militias the judges the Senate and the populace and the Frankish king as king of the Lombards patricius and Emperor These three parties theocratic republican and imperial were a characteristic of Roman life during the entire Middle Ages On Christmas night of Charlemagne was crowned in Rome as emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by Pope Leo III on that occasion the city hosted for the first time the two powers whose struggle for control was to be a constant of the Middle Ages br br In Muslim Arabs unsuccessfully stormed the city s walls but managed to loot St Peter s and St Paul s basilica both outside the city wall After the decay of Carolingian power Rome fell prey to feudal chaos several noble families fought against the pope the emperor and each other These were the times of Theodora and her daughter Marozia concubines and mothers of several popes and of Crescentius a powerful feudal lord who fought against the Emperors Otto II and Otto III The scandals of this period forced the papacy to reform itself the election of the pope was reserved to the cardinals and reform of the clergy was attempted The driving force behind this renewal was the monk Ildebrando da Soana who once elected pope under the name of Gregory VII became involved into the Investiture Controversy against Emperor Henry IV Subsequently Rome was sacked and burned by the Normans under Robert Guiscard who had entered the city in support of the Pope then besieged in Castel Sant Angelo br During this period the city was autonomously ruled by a senatore or patrizio In the th century this administration like other European cities evolved into the commune a new form of social organisation controlled by the new wealthy classes Pope Lucius II fought against the Roman commune and the struggle was continued by his successor Pope Eugenius III by this stage the commune allied with the aristocracy was supported by Arnaldo da Brescia a monk who was a religious and social reformer After the pope s death Arnaldo was taken prisoner by Adrianus IV which marked the end of the commune s autonomy Under Pope Innocent III whose reign marked the apogee of the papacy the commune liquidated the senate and replaced it with a Senatore who was subject to the pope br In this period the papacy played a role of secular importance in Western Europe often acting as arbitrators between Christian monarchs and exercising additional political powers br In Charles of Anjou who was heading south to fight the Hohenstaufen on behalf of the pope was appointed Senator Charles founded the Sapienza the university of Rome In that period the pope died and the cardinals summoned in Viterbo could not agree on his successor This angered the people of the city who then unroofed the building where they met and imprisoned them until they had nominated the new pope this marked the birth of the conclave In this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights between the aristocratic families Annibaldi Caetani Colonna Orsini Conti nested in their fortresses built above ancient Roman edifices fought each other to control the papacy br br Pope Boniface VIII born Caetani was the last pope to fight for the church s universal domain he proclaimed a crusade against the Colonna family and in called for the first Jubilee of Christianity which brought millions of pilgrims to Rome However his hopes were crushed by the French king Philip the Fair who took him prisoner and held him hostage for three days at Anagni The Pope was able to return to Rome but died a month later it was said of shock and grief Afterwards a new pope faithful to the French was elected and the papacy was briefly relocated to Avignon During this period Rome was neglected until a plebeian man Cola di Rienzo came to power An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome Cola dreamed about a rebirth of the Roman Empire after assuming power with the title of Tribuno his reforms were rejected by the populace Forced to flee Cola returned as part of the entourage of Cardinal Albornoz who was charged with restoring the Church s power in Italy Back in power for a short time Cola was soon lynched by the populace and Albornoz took possession of the city In Rome became the seat of the papacy again under Gregory XI The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the Western Schism and for the next forty years the city was affected by the divisions which rocked the Church br br br Early modern history br br In the Council of Constance settled the Western Schism and a Roman pope Martin V was elected This brought to Rome a century of internal peace which marked the beginning of the Renaissance The ruling popes until the first half of the th century from Nicholas V founder of the Vatican Library to Pius II humanist and literate from Sixtus IV a warrior pope to Alexander VI immoral and nepotist from Julius II soldier and patron to Leo X who gave his name to this period the century of Leo X all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City and to the patronage of the arts br During those years the centre of the Italian Renaissance moved to Rome from Florence Majestic works as the new Saint Peter s Basilica the Sistine Chapel and Ponte Sisto the first bridge to be built across the Tiber since antiquity although on Roman foundations were created To accomplish that the Popes engaged the best artists of the time including Michelangelo Perugino Raphael Ghirlandaio Luca Signorelli Botticelli and Cosimo Rosselli br The period was also infamous for papal corruption with many Popes fathering children and engaging in nepotism and simony The corruption of the Popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led in part to the Reformation and in turn the Counter Reformation Under extravagant and rich popes Rome was transformed into a centre of art poetry music literature education and culture Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth grandeur the arts learning and architecture br The Renaissance period changed the face of Rome dramatically with works like the Piet by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the Borgia Apartments Rome reached the highest point of splendour under Pope Julius II and his successors Leo X and Clement VII both members of the Medici family br br In this twenty year period Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world The old St Peter s Basilica built by Emperor Constantine the Great which by then was in a dilapidated state was demolished and a new one begun The city hosted artists like Ghirlandaio Perugino Botticelli and Bramante who built the temple of San Pietro in Montorio and planned a great project to renovate the Vatican Raphael who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy created frescoes in the Villa Farnesina the Raphael s Rooms plus many other famous paintings Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the famous statue of the Moses for the tomb of Julius II br Its economy was rich with the presence of several Tuscan bankers including Agostino Chigi who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts Before his early death Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins The War of the League of Cognac caused the first plunder of the city in more than five hundred years since the previous sack in the Landsknechts of Emperor Charles V sacked the city bringing an abrupt end to the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome br Beginning with the Council of Trent in the Church began the Counter Reformation in response to the Reformation a large scale questioning of the Church s authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs This loss of confidence led to major shifts of power away from the Church Under the popes from Pius IV to Sixtus V Rome became the centre of a reformed Catholicism and saw the building of new monuments which celebrated the papacy The popes and cardinals of the th and early th centuries continued the movement by having the city s landscape enriched with baroque buildings br This was another nepotistic age the new aristocratic families Barberini Pamphili Chigi Rospigliosi Altieri Odescalchi were protected by their respective popes who built huge baroque buildings for their relatives During the Age of Enlightenment new ideas reached the Eternal City where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people s welfare But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter Reformation There were setbacks in the attempts to assert the Church s power a notable example being in when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the Jesuit order suppressed br br br Late modern and contemporary br br The rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short lived Roman Republic which was established under the influence of the French Revolution The Papal States were restored in June but during Napoleon s reign Rome was annexed as a D partement of the French Empire first as D partement du Tibre and then as D partement Rome After the fall of Napoleon the Papal States were reconstituted by a decision of the Congress of Vienna of br In a second Roman Republic was proclaimed during a year of revolutions in Two of the most influential figures of the Italian unification Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi fought for the short lived republic br Rome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification after the rest of Italy was united as the Kingdom of Italy in with the temporary capital in Florence That year Rome was declared the capital of Italy even though it was still under the Pope s control During the s the last vestiges of the Papal States were under French protection thanks to the foreign policy of Napoleon III French troops were stationed in the region under Papal control In the French troops were withdrawn due to the outbreak of the Franco Prussian War Italian troops were able to capture Rome entering the city through a breach near Porta Pia Pope Pius IX declared himself a prisoner in the Vatican In the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome In the population of the city was all of whom lived with the area circumscribed by the ancient city and in the population was A significant portion lived outside the walls in the north and across the Tiber in the Vatican area br br Soon after World War I in late Rome witnessed the rise of Italian Fascism led by Benito Mussolini who led a march on the city He did away with democracy by eventually declaring a new Italian Empire and allying Italy with Nazi Germany in Mussolini demolished fairly large parts of the city centre in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence and glorification of classical Rome The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city s population which surpassed one million inhabitants soon after During World War II due to the art treasuries and the presence of the Vatican Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other European cities However on July the San Lorenzo district was subject to Allied bombing raids resulting in about fatalities and injuries of whom another died Mussolini was arrested on July On the date of the Italian Armistice September the city was occupied by the Germans Allied bombing raids continued throughout and extended into Rome was liberated on June br Rome developed greatly after the war as part of the Italian economic miracle of post war reconstruction and modernisation in the s and early s During this period the years of la dolce vita the sweet life Rome became a fashionable city with popular classic films such as Ben Hur Quo Vadis Roman Holiday and La Dolce Vita filmed in the city s iconic Cinecitt Studios The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid s when the comune had more than million residents After this the population declined slowly as people began to move to nearby suburbs br br br Geography br br br Location br br Rome is in the Lazio region of central Italy on the Tiber Italian Tevere river The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the Tiber Island the only natural ford of the river in this area The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills the Aventine Hill the Caelian Hill the Capitoline Hill the Esquiline Hill the Palatine Hill the Quirinal Hill and the Viminal Hill Modern Rome is also crossed by another river the Aniene which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre br Although the city centre is about km mi inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea the city territory extends to the shore where the south western district of Ostia is located The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from m ft above sea level at the base of the Pantheon to m ft above sea level the peak of Monte Mario The Comune of Rome covers an overall area of about km sq mi including many green areas br br br Parks and gardens br br Public parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among European capitals The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy While most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late th century some of them remain The most notable of these are the Villa Borghese Villa Ada and Villa Doria Pamphili Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill comprising some km sq mi The Villa Sciarra is on the hill with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas In the nearby area of Trastevere the Orto Botanico Botanical Garden is a cool and shady green space The old Roman hippodrome Circus Maximus is another large green space it has few trees but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden roseto comunale Nearby is the lush Villa Celimontana close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome with famous art galleries among its shaded walks Overlooking Piazza del Popolo and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of Pincio and Villa Medici There is also a notable pine wood at Castelfusano near Ostia Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin including the Pineto Regional Park and the Appian Way Regional Park There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano br br br Climate br br Rome has a Mediterranean climate K ppen climate classification Csa with hot dry summers and mild humid winters br Its average annual temperature is above C F

modern Taranto on the Salento Peninsula It had an area of about ha acres and an estimated population of Other sources suggest the population was just under from to BC When the Republic was founded in BC the census recorded a population of The republic included the city itself and the immediate surroundings Other sources suggest a population of in BC It surpassed by BC br The size of the city at the time of the Emperor Augustus is a matter of speculation with estimates based on grain distribution grain imports aqueduct capacity city limits population density census reports and assumptions about the number of unreported women children and slaves providing a very wide range Glenn Storey estimates people Whitney Oates estimates million Neville Morely provides a rough estimate of and excludes earlier suggestions of million Estimates of the city s population towards and after the end of the Roman empire also vary A H M Jones estimated the population at in the mid fifth century The damage caused by the sackings may have been overestimated The population had already started to decline from the late fourth century onward although around the middle of the fifth century it seems that Rome continued to be the most populous city of the two parts of the Empire According to Krautheimer it was still close to in AD had declined to by and dwindled to perhaps in AD After the Gothic Wars the population may have dwindled temporarily to During the pontificate of Pope Gregory I it may have reached augmented by refugees Lancon estimates based on the number of incisi enrolled as eligible to receive bread oil and wine rations the number fell to in the reform of Neil Christie citing free rations for the poorest estimated in the mid fifth century and still a quarter of a million at the end of the century Novel of Emperor Valentinian III records million pounds of pork to be distributed to the needy at lbs per month for the five winter months sufficient for recipients This has been used to suggest a population of just under Supplies of grain remained steady until the seizure of the remaining provinces of North Africa in by the Vandals and may have continued to some degree afterwards for a while The city s population declined to less than people in the Early Middle Ages from AD onward It continued to stagnate or shrink until the Renaissance br When the Kingdom of Italy annexed Rome in the city had a population of about Less than half the city within the walls was built up in when the population recorded was This increased to by the eve of World War I The Fascist regime of Mussolini tried to block an excessive demographic rise of the city but failed to prevent it from reaching one million people by the early s Population growth continued after the Second World War helped by a post war economic boom A construction boom also created many suburbs during the s and s br In mid there were residents in the city proper while some million people lived in the greater Rome area which can be approximately identified with its administrative metropolitan city with a population density of about inhabitants km stretching over more than km sq mi Minors children ages and

chiefly Romanian Polish Ukrainian and Albanian numbering a combined total of or of the population The remaining are those with non European origins chiefly Filipinos Bangladeshis and Chinese br The Esquilino rione off Termini Railway Station has evolved into a largely immigrant neighbourhood It is perceived as Rome s Chinatown Immigrants from more than a hundred different countries reside there A commercial district Esquilino contains restaurants featuring many kinds of international cuisine There are wholesale clothes shops Of the or so commercial premises operating in the district are Chinese owned around are run by immigrants from other countries around the world are owned by Italians br br Summary table br br br Language br br Rome s historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is extensive Through the process of Romanization the peoples of Italy Gallia the Iberian Peninsula and Dacia developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world all through cultural influence colonisation and migration Moreover also modern English because of the Norman Conquest borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin language The Roman or Latin alphabet is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages br The medieval Roman dialect belonged to the southern family of Italian dialects and was thus much closer to the Neapolitan language than to the Florentine A typical example of Romanesco of that period is Vita di Cola di Rienzo Life of Cola di Rienzo written by an anonymous Roman during the th century Starting with the th century the Roman dialect underwent a stronger and stronger influence from the Tuscan dialect from which modern Italian derives starting with the reigns of the two Medici popes Leo X and Clement VII and with the Sack of Rome in two events which provoked a large immigration from Tuscany Therefore current Romanesco has grammar and roots that are rather different from other dialects in Central Italy br br br Religion br br Much like the rest of Italy Rome is predominantly Christian and the city has been an important centre of religion and

street pattern making it difficult for Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring road These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome s metro system when compared to other cities of similar size Rome has only taxis for every inhabitants far below other major European cities Chronic congestion
