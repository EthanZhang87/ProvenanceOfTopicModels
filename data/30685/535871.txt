An oni OH nee is a kind of y kai demon orc ogre or troll in Japanese folklore They are believed to live in caves or deep in the mountains Oni are known for their superhuman strength and have been associated with powers like thunder and lightning along with their evil nature manifesting in their propensity for murder and cannibalism They are typically portrayed as hulking figures with one or more horns growing out of their heads massive teeth and occasionally a third eye in the center of the forehead They are typically depicted with red blue black or yellow colored skin wearing loincloths of tiger pelt and carrying iron kanab clubs They also have three to six digits on each hand and foot tipped with claw like nails Oni are able to change their looks to fool their victims into trusting them Oni can be male or female but have been predominantly male throughout history Female oni are sometimes referred to by the name Yamauba When in disguise oni are capable of appearing as a man or woman regardless of their gender As monstrous as oni are they have been linked to bringing good fortune and wealth br During the Heian period oni were often depicted in Japanese literature such as setsuwa as terrifying monsters that ate people A prominent depiction of oni is that they eat people in one mouthful which is called onihitokuchi In Nihon Ry iki The Tales of Ise and Konjaku Monogatarish for example a woman is shown being eaten in one mouthful by a oni There is the theory that the reason why stories of onihitokuchi were common is that wars disasters and famines where people lose their lives or go missing were interpreted as oni from another world appearing in the present world who take away humans br It was not until the legend of Shuten d ji was created that the oni began to be depicted in paintings and the th century eyama ekotoba is the oldest surviving emakimono picture scroll depicting Shuten d ji Shuten d ji has been regarded as the most famous and strongest oni in Japan The legend of Shuten d ji has been described since the th century in various arts traditional performing arts and literature such as emakimono j ruri noh kabuki bunraku and ukiyo e The tachi Japanese long sword D jigiri with which Minamoto no Yorimitsu decapitated Shuten d ji in the legend is now designated as a National Treasure and one of the Tenka Goken Five Greatest Swords Under Heaven br They are popular characters in Japanese art literature and theater and appear as stock villains in the well known fairytales of Momotar Peach Boy Issun b shi and Kobutori J san Although oni have been described as frightening creatures they have become tamer in modern culture as people tell less frightening stories about them like Oni Mask and Red Oni Who Cried br br br Etymology change of meaning br br Oni written in kanji as is read in China as gu pinyin meaning something invisible formless or unworldly in other words a ghost or the soul of the dead On the other hand the Japanese dictionary Wamy Ruijush written in Japan in the th century explained the origin of the word oni as a corruption of on onu meaning to hide The dictionary explained that oni is hidden and does not want to reveal itself When the character for was first introduced to Japan it was pronounced as ki in the on yomi reading br The character has changed over time in Japan to become its own entity and there are significant differences between the Japanese oni and the Chinese gu The Chinese gu generally refers to the disembodied spirits of the dead and are not necessarily evil They usually reside in the underworld but those with a grudge sometimes appear in the human world to haunt and Taoist priests and others have used their supernatural powers to exterminate them Japanese oni on the other hand are evil beings that have substance live in certain places in the human world such as mountains have red or blue bodies with horns and fangs are armed with kanab metal clubs and can be physically killed by cutting with Japanese swords br The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki and Nihon Shoki are the earliest written examples of oni as entities rather than soul of the dead The Izumo no Kuni Fudoki whose compilation began in tells the story of a one eyed oni who ate a man Nihon Shoki completed in tells of a hat kasa wearing oni watching the funeral of Emperor Saimei from the top of Mount Asakura The character for is believed to have been read as oni when the Nihon Shoki was completed and was also read as kami mono and shiko in the Heian period In Konjaku Monogatarish the character for is read as mono It was not until the end of the Heian period that the reading of oni for the character became almost universal br Particularly powerful oni may be described as kishin or kijin literally oni god the ki is an alternate character reading of oni a term used in Japanese Buddhism to refer to Wrathful Deities br The oni was syncretized with Hindu Buddhist creatures such as the man devouring yaksha and the rakshasa and became the oni who tormented sinners as wardens of Hell Jigoku administering sentences passed down by Hell s magistrate King Yama Enma Dai The hungry ghosts called gaki have also been sometimes considered a type of oni the Kanji for ki is also read oni Accordingly a wicked soul beyond rehabilitation transforms into an oni after death Only the very worst people turn into oni while alive and these are the oni causing troubles among humans as presented in folk tales br Some scholars have even argued that the oni was entirely a concept of Buddhist mythology br Oni bring calamities to the land bringing about war plague illness earthquakes and eclipses They have the destructive power of lightning and thunder which terrifies people through their auditory and visual effects br br br Origins br br Most Japanese folklore come from the Kojiki Records of Ancient Matters or An Account of Ancient Matters and Nihongi Japanese Chronicles These stories are the history and development of Japan in ancient times At the beginning of time and space Takamagahara Plane of High Heaven or High Plane of Heaven came into being along with the three divine beings Amenominakanushi The Central Master or Lord of the August Center of Heaven Takamimusubi High Creator and Kamimusubi The Divine Creator These three divine beings were known as Kami and the three together are sometimes referred to as Kotoamatsukami literally distinguishing heavenly kami They manifested the entire universe They were later joined by two more Kami Umashiashikabihikoji Energy and Amenotokotachi Heaven br Finally two lesser Kami were made to establish earth Izanagi meaning He who invites or the Male who invites and Izanami meaning She who invites or the Female who invites These two were brother and sister They also are married and had many children one of them being Kagutsuchi Fire Upon birth Kagutsuchi mortally wounded Izanami who went to Yomi World of Darkness on her death and was transformed into a Kami of death Izanami who gave life in the physical world continued to do so in the underworld ultimately creating the very first oni br br br Demon gate br br According to Chinese Taoism and esoteric Onmy d the ways of yin and yang the northeasterly direction is termed the kimon demon gate and considered an unlucky direction through which evil spirits passed Based on the assignment of the twelve zodiac animals to the cardinal directions the kimon was also known as the ushitora or Ox Tiger direction One hypothesis is that the oni s bovine horns and tiger skin loincloth developed as a visual depiction of this term br Temples are often built facing that direction for example Enryaku ji was deliberately built on Mount Hiei which was in the kimon northeasterly direction from Kyoto in order to guard the capital and similarly Kan ei ji was built towards that direction from Edo Castle br However skeptics doubt this could have been the initial design of Enryaku ji temple since the temple was founded in six years before Kyoto even existed as a capital and if the ruling class were so feng shui minded the subsequent northeasterly move of the capital from Nagaoka ky to Kyoto would have certainly been taboo br Japanese buildings may sometimes have L shaped indentations at the northeast to ward against oni For example the walls surrounding the Kyoto Imperial Palace have notched corners in that direction br br br Traditional culture br The traditional bean throwing custom to drive out oni is practiced during Setsubun festival in February It involves people casting roasted soybeans indoors or out of their homes and shouting Oni wa soto Fuku wa uchi Oni go out Blessings come in preferably by a strong wrestler br This custom began with the aristocratic and samurai classes in the Muromachi period According to the Ain sh a dictionary compiled in the Muromachi period the origin of this custom is a legend from the th century during the reign of Emperor Uda According to the legend a monk on Mount Kurama threw roasted beans into the eyes of oni to make them flinch and flee Another theory is that the origin of this custom lies in the word mame which means bean The explanation is that in Japanese mame can also be written as mame meaning the devil s eye or mametsu meaning to destroy the devil During the Edo period the custom spread to Shinto shrines Buddhist temples and the general public br Regionally around Tottori Prefecture during this season a charm made of holly leaves and dried sardine heads are used as a guard against oni br There is also a well known game in Japan called oni gokko which is the same as the game of tag that children in the Western world play The player who is it is instead called the oni br Oni are featured in Japanese children s stories such as Momotar Peach Boy Issun b shi and Kobutori J san br br br Modern times br In more recent times oni have lost some of their original wickedness and sometimes take on a more protective function Men in oni costumes often lead Japanese parades to dispel any bad luck for example br br Japanese buildings sometimes include oni faced roof tiles called onigawara which are thought to ward away bad luck much like gargoyles in Western tradition br Many Japanese idioms and proverbs also make reference to oni For example the expression Oya ni ninu ko wa oni no ko Translation A child that does not resemble its parents is the child of an oni may be used by a parent to chastise a misbehaving child br They can be used in stories to frighten children into obeying because of their grotesque appearance savage demeanor as well as how they can eat people in a single gulp br br br Stories br Momotaro the Peach Boy is a well known story about an elderly

distinctive features which mark a character as an oni such as horns or a distinctive skin colour although the character may otherwise appear human lacking the oni s traditionally fearsome or grotesque features The context of oni in popular culture is similarly varied with instances such as appearances in animated cartoons video games and use as commercial mascots br br The game series Touhou
