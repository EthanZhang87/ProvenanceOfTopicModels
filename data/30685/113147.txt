title: Barbarian
id: 113147
A barbarian is a person or tribe of people that is perceived to be primitive savage and warlike Many cultures have referred to other cultures as barbarians sometimes out of misunderstanding and sometimes out of prejudice br A barbarian may also be an individual reference to a brutal cruel warlike and insensitive person particularly one who is also dim witted br The term originates from the Ancient Greek barbaros pl barbaroi In Ancient Greece the Greeks used the term not only towards those who did not speak Greek and follow classical Greek customs but also towards Greek populations on the fringe of the Greek world with peculiar dialects In Ancient Rome the Romans adapted and used the term towards tribal non Romans such as the Germanics Celts Iberians Helvetii Thracians Illyrians and Sarmatians In the early modern period and sometimes later the Byzantine Greeks used it for the Turks in a clearly pejorative manner br The Greek word was borrowed into Arabic as well under the form barbar and used as an exonym by the Arab conquerors to refer to the indigenous peoples of North Africa known in English as Amazigh or Berbers with the latter thereby being a cognate of the word barbarian br br br Etymology br br The Ancient Greek name b rbaros barbarian was an antonym for polit s citizen from polis city The earliest attested form of the word is the Mycenaean Greek pa pa ro written in Linear B syllabic script br The Greeks used the term barbarian for all non Greek speaking people including the Egyptians Persians Medes and Phoenicians emphasizing their otherness According to Greek writers this was because the language they spoke sounded to Greeks like gibberish represented by the sounds bar bar the alleged root of the word b rbaros which is an echomimetic or onomatopoeic word In various occasions the term was also used by Greeks especially the Athenians to deride other Greek tribes and states such as Epirotes Eleans Boeotians and Aeolic speakers and also fellow Athenians in a pejorative and politically motivated manner The term also carried a cultural dimension to its dual meaning The verb barbar z in ancient Greek meant to behave or talk like a barbarian or to hold with the barbarians br Plato Statesman de rejected the Greek barbarian dichotomy as a logical absurdity on just such grounds dividing the world into Greeks and non Greeks told one nothing about the second group Yet Plato used the term barbarian frequently in his seventh letter In Homer s works the term appeared only once Iliad in the form barbarophonos of incomprehensible speech used of the Carians fighting for Troy during the Trojan War In general the concept of barbaros did not figure largely in archaic literature before the th century BC It has been suggested that the barbarophonoi in the Iliad signifies not those who spoke a non Greek language but simply those who spoke Greek badly br A change occurred in the connotations of the word after the Greco Persian Wars in the first half of the th century BC Here a hasty coalition of Greeks defeated the vast Persian Empire Indeed in the Greek of this period barbarian is often used expressly to refer to Persians who were enemies of the Greeks in this war br br The Romans used the term barbarus for uncivilised people opposite to Greek or Roman and in fact it became a common term to refer to all foreigners among Romans after Augustus age as among the Greeks after the Persian wars the Persians including the Germanic peoples Persians Gauls Phoenicians and Carthaginians br The Greek term barbaros was the etymological source for many words meaning barbarian including English barbarian which was first recorded in th century Middle English br A word barbara is also found in the Sanskrit of ancient India with the primary meaning of cruel and also stammering implying someone with an unfamiliar language The Greek word barbaros is related to Sanskrit barbaras stammering This Indo European root is also found in Latin balbutire balbus for stammer stammering leading to Italian balbettare Spanish balbucear and French balbutier and Czech blblati to stammer The verb ba ba n in both contemporary Hindi as well as Urdu means to babble to speak gibberish to rave incoherently br In Aramaic Old Persian and Arabic context the root refers to babble confusedly It appears as barbary or in Old French barbarie itself derived from the Arabic Barbar Berber which is an ancient Arabic term for the North African inhabitants west of Egypt The Arabic word might be ultimately from Greek barbaria br br br Semantics br br The Oxford English Dictionary gives five definitions of the noun barbarian including an obsolete Barbary usage br br Etymologically A foreigner one whose language and customs differ from the speaker s br Hist a One not a Greek b One living outside the pale of the Roman Empire and its civilization applied especially to the northern nations that overthrew them c One outside the pale of Christian civilization d With the Italians of the Renaissance One of a nation outside of Italy br A rude wild uncivilized person b Sometimes distinguished from savage perh with a glance at c Applied by the Chinese contemptuously to foreigners br An uncultured person or one who has no sympathy with literary culture br A native of Barbary See Barbary Coast Obs b Barbary pirates A Barbary horse Obs br The OED barbarous entry summarizes the semantic history The sense development in ancient times was with the Greeks foreign non Hellenic later outlandish rude brutal with the Romans not Latin nor Greek then pertaining to those outside the Roman Empire hence uncivilized uncultured and later non Christian whence Saracen heathen and generally savage rude savagely cruel inhuman br br br In classical Greco Roman contexts br br br Historical developments br br Greek attitudes towards barbarians developed in parallel with the growth of chattel slavery especially in Athens Although the enslavement of Greeks for non payment of debts continued in most Greek states Athens banned this practice under Solon in the early th century BC Under the Athenian democracy established ca BC slavery came into use on a scale never before seen among the Greeks Massive concentrations of slaves worked under especially brutal conditions in the silver mines at Laureion in south eastern Attica after the discovery of a major vein of silver bearing ore there in BC while the phenomenon of skilled slave craftsmen producing manufactured goods in small factories and workshops became increasingly common br Furthermore slave ownership no longer became the preserve of the rich all but the poorest of Athenian households came to have slaves in order to supplement the work of their free members The slaves of Athens that had barbarian origins were coming especially from lands around the Black Sea such as Thrace and Taurica Crimea while Lydians Phrygians and Carians came from Asia Minor Aristotle Politics characterises barbarians as slaves by nature br From this period words like barbarophonos cited above from Homer came into use not only for the sound of a foreign language but also for foreigners who spoke Greek improperly In the Greek language the word logos expressed both the notions of language and reason so Greek speakers readily conflated speaking poorly with stupidity br br Further changes occurred in the connotations of barbari barbaroi in Late Antiquity when bishops and catholikoi were appointed to sees connected to cities among the civilized gentes barbaricae such as in Armenia or Persia whereas bishops were appointed to supervise entire peoples among the less settled br Eventually the term found a hidden meaning through the folk etymology of Cassiodorus c c He stated that the word barbarian was made up of barba beard and rus flat land for barbarians did not live in cities making their abodes in the fields like wild animals br br br Hellenic stereotypes br From classical origins the Hellenic stereotype of barbarism evolved barbarians are like children unable to speak or reason properly cowardly effeminate luxurious cruel unable to control their appetites and desires politically unable to govern themselves Writers voiced these stereotypes with much shrillness Isocrates in the th century B C for example called for a war of conquest against Persia as a panacea for Greek problems br However the disparaging Hellenic stereotype of barbarians did not totally dominate Hellenic attitudes Xenophon died B C for example wrote the Cyropaedia a laudatory fictionalised account of Cyrus the Great the founder of the Persian Empire effectively a utopian text In his Anabasis Xenophon s accounts of the Persians and other non Greeks who he knew or encountered show few traces of the stereotypes br In Plato s Protagoras Prodicus of Ceos calls barbarian the Aeolian dialect that Pittacus of Mytilene spoke br Aristotle makes the difference between Greeks and barbarians one of the central themes of his book on Politics and quotes Euripides approvingly Tis meet that Greeks should rule barbarians br The renowned orator Demosthenes B C made derogatory comments in his speeches using the word barbarian br In the Bible s New Testament St Paul from Tarsus lived about A D to about A D uses the word barbarian in its Hellenic sense to refer to non Greeks Romans and he also uses it to characterise one who merely speaks a different language Corinthians In the book of Acts the natives of Malta who were kind to Paul and the others who were shipwrecked with him are called barbarians Acts br About a hundred years after Paul s time Lucian a native of Samosata in the former kingdom of Commagene which had been absorbed by the Roman Empire and made part of the province of Syria used the term barbarian to describe himself Because he was a noted satirist this could have indicated self deprecating irony It might also have suggested descent from Samosata s original Semitic speaking population who were likely called barbarians by later Hellenistic Greek speaking settlers and might have eventually taken up this appellation themselves br The term retained its standard usage in the Greek language throughout the Middle Ages Byzantine Greeks used it widely until the fall of the Eastern Roman Empire later named the Byzantine Empire in the th century with the fall of capital city Constantinople br Cicero BC described the mountain area of inner Sardinia as a land of barbarians with these inhabitants also known by the manifestly pejorative term latrones mastrucati thieves with a rough garment in wool br The region still known as Barbagia in Sardinian Barb gia or Barb za preserves this old barbarian designation in its name but it no longer consciously retains barbarian associations the inhabitants of the area themselves use the name naturally and unaffectedly br br br The Dying Galatian statue br br The statue of the Dying Galatian provides some insight into the Hellenistic perception of and attitude towards Barbarians Attalus I of Pergamon ruled BC commissioned s BC a statue to celebrate his victory ca BC over the Celtic Galatians in Anatolia the bronze original is lost but a Roman marble copy was found in the th century The statue depicts with remarkable realism a dying Celt warrior with a typically Celtic hairstyle and moustache He sits on his fallen shield while a sword and other objects lie beside him He appears to be fighting against death refusing to accept his fate br The statue serves both as a reminder of the Celts defeat thus demonstrating the might of the people who defeated them and a memorial to their bravery as worthy adversaries As H W Janson comments the sculpture conveys the message that they knew how to die barbarians that they were br br br Utter barbarism civilization and the noble savage br The Greeks admired Scythians and Galatians as heroic individuals and even as in the case of Anacharsis as philosophers but they regarded their culture as barbaric The Romans indiscriminately characterised the various Germanic tribes the settled Gauls and the raiding Huns as barbarians and subsequent classically oriented historical narratives depicted the migrations associated with the end of the Western Roman Empire as the barbarian invasions br The Romans adapted the term in order to refer to anything that was non Roman The German cultural historian Silvio Vietta points out that the meaning of the word barbarous has undergone a semantic change in modern times after Michel de Montaigne used it to characterize the activities of the Spaniards in the New World representatives of the more technologically advanced higher European culture as barbarous in a satirical essay published in the year It was not the supposedly uncivilized Indian tribes who were barbarous but the conquering Spaniards Montaigne argued that Europeans noted the barbarism of other cultures but not the crueler and more brutal actions of their own societies particularly in his time during the so called religious wars In Montaigne s view his own people the Europeans were the real barbarians In this way the argument was turned around and applied to the European invaders With this shift in meaning a whole literature arose in Europe that characterized the indigenous Indian peoples as innocent and the militarily superior Europeans as barbarous intruders invading a paradisical world br br br In non Western historical contexts br Historically the term barbarian has seen widespread use in English Many peoples have dismissed alien cultures and even rival civilizations because they were unrecognizably strange For instance the nomadic Turkic peoples north of the Black Sea including the Pechenegs and the Kipchaks were called barbarians by the Byzantines br br br Middle East and North Africa br br The native Berbers of North Africa were among the many peoples called Barbarian by the early Romans The term continued to be used by medieval Arabs see Berber etymology before being replaced by Amazigh In English the term Berber continues to be used as an exonym The geographical term Barbary or Barbary Coast and the name of the Barbary pirates based on that coast and who were not necessarily Berbers were also derived from it br The term has also been used to refer to people from Barbary a region encompassing most of North Africa The name of the region Barbary comes from the Arabic word Barbar possibly from the Latin word barbaricum meaning land of the barbarians br Many languages define the Other as those who do not speak one s language Greek barbaroi was paralleled by Arabic ajam non Arabic speakers non Arabs especially Persians br br br India br br In the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata the Sanskrit onomatopoeic word barbara referred to the incomprehensible unfamiliar speech perceived as babbling incoherent stammering of non Vedic peoples wretch foreigner sinful people low and barbarous br br br East Asia br br br China br br The term Barbarian in traditional Chinese culture had several aspects For one thing Chinese has more than one historical barbarian exonym Several historical Chinese characters for non Chinese peoples were graphic pejoratives The character for the Yao people for instance was changed from yao jackal to yao precious jade in the modern period The original Hua Yi distinction between Hua Chinese and Yi commonly translated as barbarian was based on culture and power but not on race br Historically the Chinese used various words for foreign ethnic groups They include terms like Yi which is often translated as barbarians Despite this conventional translation there are also other ways of translating Yi into English Some of the examples include foreigners ordinary others wild tribes uncivilized tribes and so forth br br br History and terminology br Chinese historical records mention what may now perhaps be termed barbarian peoples for over four millennia although this considerably predates the Greek language origin of the term barbarian at least as is known from the thirty four centuries of written records in the Greek language The sinologist Herrlee Glessner Creel said Throughout Chinese history the barbarians have been a constant motif sometimes minor sometimes very major indeed They figure prominently in the Shang oracle inscriptions and the dynasty that came to an end only in was from the Chinese point of view barbarian br Shang dynasty BC oracles and bronze inscriptions first recorded specific Chinese exonyms for foreigners often in contexts of warfare or tribute King Wu Ding r BC for instance fought with the Guifang Di and Qiang barbarians br During the Spring and Autumn period BC the meanings of four exonyms were expanded These included Rong Yi Man and Di all general designations referring to the barbarian tribes These Siyi Four Barbarians most probably the names of ethnic groups originally were the Yi or Dongyi eastern barbarians Man or Nanman southern barbarians Rong or Xirong western barbarians and Di or Beidi northern barbarians The Russian anthropologist Mikhail Kryukov concluded br br Evidently the barbarian tribes at first had individual names but during about the middle of the first millennium B C they were classified schematically according to the four cardinal points of the compass This would in the final analysis mean that once again territory had become the primary criterion of the we group whereas the consciousness of common origin remained secondary What continued to be important were the factors of language the acceptance of certain forms of material culture the adherence to certain rituals and above all the economy and the way of life Agriculture was the only appropriate way of life for the Hua Hsia br br The Chinese classics use compounds of these four generic names in localized barbarian tribes exonyms such as west and north Rongdi south and east Manyi Nanyibeidi barbarian tribes in the south and the north and Manyirongdi all kinds of barbarians Creel says the Chinese evidently came to use Rongdi and Manyi as generalized terms denoting non Chinese foreigners barbarians and a statement such as the Rong and Di are wolves Zuozhuan Min is very much like the assertion that many people in many lands will make today that no foreigner can be trusted br br The Chinese had at least two reasons for vilifying and depreciating the non Chinese groups On the one hand many of them harassed and pillaged the Chinese which gave them a genuine grievance On the other it is quite clear that the Chinese were increasingly encroaching upon the territory of these peoples getting the better of them by trickery and putting many of them under subjection By vilifying them and depicting them as somewhat less than human the Chinese could justify their conduct and still any qualms of conscience br This word Yi has both specific references such as to Huaiyi peoples in the Huai River region and generalized references to barbarian foreigner non Chinese Lin Yutang s Chinese English Dictionary of Modern Usage translates Yi as Anc ient barbarian tribe on east border any border or foreign tribe The sinologist Edwin G Pulleyblank says the name Yi furnished the primary Chinese term for barbarian but Paradoxically the Yi were considered the most civilized of the non Chinese peoples br br br Idealization br Some Chinese classics romanticize or idealize barbarians comparable to the western noble savage construct For instance the Confucian Analects records br br The Master said The barbarians of the East and North have retained their princes They are not in such a state of decay as we in China br The Master said The Way makes no progress I shall get upon a raft and float out to sea br The Master wanted to settle among the Nine Wild Tribes of the East Someone said I am afraid you would find it hard to put up with their lack of refinement The Master said Were a true gentleman to settle among them there would soon be no trouble about lack of refinement br The translator Arthur Waley noted that A certain idealization of the noble savage is to be found fairly often in early Chinese literature citing the Zuo Zhuan maxim When the Emperor no longer functions learning must be sought among the Four Barbarians north west east and south Professor Creel said br br From ancient to modern times the Chinese attitude toward people not Chinese in culture barbarians has commonly been one of contempt sometimes tinged with fear It must be noted that while the Chinese have disparaged barbarians they have been singularly hospitable both to individuals and to groups that have adopted Chinese culture And at times they seem to have had a certain admiration perhaps unwilling for the rude force of these peoples or simpler customs br In a somewhat related example Mencius believed that Confucian practices were universal and timeless and thus followed by both Hua and Yi Shun was an Eastern barbarian he was born in Chu Feng moved to Fu Hsia and died in Ming T iao King Wen was a Western barbarian he was born in Ch i Chou and died in Pi Ying Their native places were over a thousand li apart and there were a thousand years between them Yet when they had their way in the Central Kingdoms their actions matched like the two halves of a tally The standards of the two sages one earlier and one later were identical br The prominent CE Shuowen Jiezi character dictionary defines yi as men of the east The dictionary also informs that Yi is not dissimilar from the Xia which means Chinese Elsewhere in the Shuowen Jiezi under the entry of qiang the term yi is associated with benevolence and human longevity Yi countries are therefore virtuous places where people live long lives This is why Confucius wanted to go to yi countries when the dao could not be realized in the central states br br br Pejorative Chinese characters br br Some Chinese characters used to transcribe non Chinese peoples were graphically pejorative ethnic slurs in which the insult derived not from the Chinese word but from the character used to write it For instance the Written Chinese transcription of Yao the Yao people who primarily live in the mountains of southwest China and Vietnam When th century Song dynasty authors first transcribed the exonym Yao they insultingly chose yao jackal from a lexical selection of over characters pronounced yao e g waist distant shake During a series of th century Chinese language reforms this graphic pejorative written with the dog beast radical jackal the Yao was replaced twice first with the invented character yao human radical the Yao then with yao jade radical precious jade the Yao Chinese orthography symbols used to write a language can provide unique opportunities to write ethnic insults logographically that do not exist alphabetically For the Yao ethnic group there is a difference between the transcriptions Yao jackal and Yao jade but none between the romanizations Yao and Yau br br br Cultural and racial barbarianism br br According to the archeologist William Meacham it was only by the time of the late Shang dynasty that one can speak of Chinese Chinese culture or Chinese civilization There is a sense in which the traditional view of ancient Chinese history is correct and perhaps it originated ultimately in the first appearance of dynastic civilization those on the fringes and outside this esoteric event were barbarians in that they did not enjoy or suffer from the fruit of civilization until they were brought into close contact with it by an imperial expansion of the civilization itself br In a similar vein Creel explained the significance of Confucian li ritual rites propriety br br The fundamental criterion of Chinese ness anciently and throughout history has been cultural The Chinese have had a particular way of life a particular complex of usages sometimes characterized as li Groups that conformed to this way of life were generally speaking considered Chinese Those that turned away from it were considered to cease to be Chinese It was the process of acculturation transforming barbarians into Chinese that created the great bulk of the Chinese people The barbarians of Western Chou times were for the most part future Chinese or the ancestors of future Chinese This is a fact of great importance It is significant however that we almost never find any references in the early literature to physical differences between Chinese and barbarians Insofar as we can tell the distinction was purely cultural br Dik tter says br br Thought in ancient China was oriented towards the world or tianxia all under heaven The world was perceived as one homogenous unity named great community datong The Middle Kingdom China dominated by the assumption of its cultural superiority measured outgroups according to a yardstick by which those who did not follow the Chinese ways were considered barbarians A Theory of using the Chinese ways to transform the barbarian as strongly advocated It was believed that the barbarian could be culturally assimilated In the Age of Great Peace the barbarians would flow in and be transformed the world would be one br According to the Pakistani academic M Shahid Alam The centrality of culture rather than race in the Chinese world view had an important corollary Nearly always this translated into a civilizing mission rooted in the premise that the barbarians could be culturally assimilated namely laihua come and be transformed or Hanhua become Chinese be sinicized br Two millennia before the French anthropologist Claude L vi Strauss wrote The Raw and the Cooked the Chinese differentiated raw and cooked categories of barbarian peoples who lived in China The shufan cooked food eating barbarians are sometimes interpreted as Sinicized and the shengfan raw food eating barbarians as not Sinicized br The Liji gives this description br br The people of those five regions the Middle states and the Rong Yi and other wild tribes around them had all their several natures which they could not be made to alter The tribes on the east were called Yi They had their hair unbound and tattooed their bodies Some of them ate their food without its being cooked with fire Those on the south were called Man They tattooed their foreheads and had their feet turned toward each other Some of them ate their food without its being cooked with fire Those on the west were called Rong They had their hair unbound and wore skins Some of them did not eat grain food Those on the north were called Di They wore skins of animals and birds and dwelt in caves Some of them did not eat grain food br Dik tter explains the close association between nature and nurture The shengfan literally raw barbarians were considered savage and resisting The shufan or cooked barbarians were tame and submissive The consumption of raw food was regarded as an infallible sign of savagery that affected the physiological state of the barbarian br Some Warring States period texts record a belief that the respective natures of the Chinese and the barbarian were incompatible Mencius for instance once stated I have heard of the Chinese converting barbarians to their ways but not of their being converted to barbarian ways Dik tter says The nature of the Chinese was regarded as impermeable to the evil influences of the barbarian no retrogression was possible Only the barbarian might eventually change by adopting Chinese ways br However different thinkers and texts convey different opinions on this issue The prominent Tang Confucian Han Yu for example wrote in his essay Yuan Dao the following When Confucius wrote the Chunqiu he said that if the feudal lords use Yi ritual then they should be called Yi If they use Chinese rituals then they should be called Chinese Han Yu went on to lament in the same essay that the Chinese of his time might all become Yi because the Tang court wanted to put Yi laws above the teachings of the former kings Therefore Han Yu s essay shows the possibility that the Chinese can lose their culture and become the uncivilized outsiders and that the uncivilized outsiders have the potential to become Chinese br After the Song dynasty many of China s rulers in the north were of Inner Asia ethnicities such as the Khitans Juchens and Mongols of the Liao Jin and Yuan dynasties the latter ended up ruling over the entire China Hence the historian John King Fairbank wrote the influence on China of the great fact of alien conquest under the Liao Jin Yuan dynasties is just beginning to be explored During the Qing dynasty the rulers of China adopted Confucian philosophy and Han Chinese institutions to show that the Manchu rulers had received the Mandate of Heaven to rule China At the same time they also tried to retain their own indigenous culture Due to the Manchus adoption of Han Chinese culture most Han Chinese though not all did accept the Manchus as the legitimate rulers of China Similarly according to Fudan University historian Yao Dali even the supposedly patriotic hero Wen Tianxiang of the late Song and early Yuan period did not believe the Mongol rule to be illegitimate In fact Wen was willing to live under Mongol rule as long as he was not forced to be a Yuan dynasty official out of his loyalty to the Song dynasty Yao explains that Wen chose to die in the end because he was forced to become a Yuan official So Wen chose death due to his loyalty to his dynasty not because he viewed the Yuan court as a non Chinese illegitimate regime and therefore refused to live under their rule Yao also says that many Chinese who were living in the Yuan Ming transition period also shared Wen s beliefs of identifying with and putting loyalty towards one s dynasty above racial ethnic differences Many Han Chinese writers did not celebrate the collapse of the Mongols and the return of the Han Chinese rule in the form of the Ming dynasty government at that time Many Han Chinese actually chose not to serve in the new Ming court at all due to their loyalty to the Yuan Some Han Chinese also committed suicide on behalf of the Mongols as a proof of their loyalty The founder of the Ming dynasty Zhu Yuanzhang also indicated that he was happy to be born in the Yuan period and that the Yuan did legitimately receive the Mandate of Heaven to rule over China On a side note one of his key advisors Liu Ji generally supported the idea that while the Chinese and the non Chinese are different they are actually equal Liu was therefore arguing against the idea that the Chinese were and are superior to the Yi br These things show that many times pre modern Chinese did view culture and sometimes politics rather than race and ethnicity as the dividing line between the Chinese and the non Chinese In many cases the non Chinese could and did become the Chinese and vice versa especially when there was a change in culture br br br Modern reinterpretations br According to the historian Frank Dik tter The delusive myth of a Chinese antiquity that abandoned racial standards in favour of a concept of cultural universalism in which all barbarians could ultimately participate has understandably attracted some modern scholars Living in an unequal and often hostile world it is tempting to project the utopian image of a racially harmonious world into a distant and obscure past br The politician historian and diplomat K C Wu analyzes the origin of the characters for the Yi Man Rong Di and Xia peoples and concludes that the ancients formed these characters with only one purpose in mind to describe the different ways of living each of these people pursued Despite the well known examples of pejorative exonymic characters such as the dog radical in Di he claims there is no hidden racial bias in the meanings of the characters used to describe these different peoples but rather the differences were in occupation or in custom not in race or origin K C Wu says the modern character designating the historical Yi peoples composed of the characters for big person and bow implies a big person carrying a bow someone to perhaps be feared or respected but not to be despised However differing from K C Wu the scholar Wu Qichang believes that the earliest oracle bone script for yi was used interchangeably with shi corpse The historian John Hill explains that Yi was used rather loosely for non Chinese populations of the east It carried the connotation of people ignorant of Chinese culture and therefore barbarians br Christopher I Beckwith makes the extraordinary claim that the name barbarian should only be used for Greek historical contexts and is inapplicable for all other peoples to whom it has been applied either historically or in modern times Beckwith notes that most specialists in East Asian history including him have translated Chinese exonyms as English barbarian He believes that after academics read his published explanation of the problems except for direct quotations of earlier scholars who use the word it should no longer be used as a term by any writer br The first problem is that it is impossible to translate the word barbarian into Chinese because the concept does not exist in Chinese meaning a single completely generic loanword from Greek barbar Until the Chinese borrow the word barbarian or one of its relatives or make up a new word that explicitly includes the same basic ideas they cannot express the idea of the barbarian in Chinese The usual Standard Chinese translation of English barbarian is yemanren traditional Chinese simplified Chinese pinyin y m nr n which Beckwith claims actually means wild man savage That is very definitely not the same thing as barbarian Despite this semantic hypothesis Chinese English dictionaries regularly translate yemanren as barbarian or barbarians Beckwith concedes that the early Chinese apparently disliked foreigners in general and looked down on them as having an inferior culture and pejoratively wrote some exonyms However he purports The fact that the Chinese did not like foreigner Y and occasionally picked a transcriptional character with negative meaning in Chinese to write the sound of his ethnonym is irrelevant br Beckwith s second problem is with linguists and lexicographers of Chinese If one looks up in a Chinese English dictionary the two dozen or so partly generic words used for various foreign peoples throughout Chinese history one will find most of them defined in English as in effect a kind of barbarian Even the works of well known lexicographers such as Karlgren do this br Although Beckwith does not cite any examples the Swedish sinologist Bernhard Karlgren edited two dictionaries Analytic Dictionary of Chinese and Sino Japanese and Grammata Serica Recensa Compare Karlgrlen s translations of the siyi four barbarians br br yi barbarian

Project includes Karlgren s GSR definitions Searching the STEDT Database finds various a kind of definitions for plant and animal names e g you a kind of monkey but not one a kind of barbarian definition Besides faulting Chinese for lacking a general barbarian term Beckwith also faults English which has no words for the many foreign peoples referred to by one or another Classical Chinese word such as h y m n and so on br The third problem involves Tang dynasty usages of fan foreigner and lu prisoner neither of which meant barbarian Beckwith says Tang texts used fan or foreigner see shengfan and shufan above as perhaps the only true generic at any time in Chinese literature was practically the opposite of the word barbarian It meant simply foreign foreigner without any pejorative meaning In modern usage fan means foreigner barbarian aborigine The linguist Robert Ramsey illustrates the pejorative connotations of fan br br The word F n was formerly used by the Chinese almost innocently in the sense of aborigines to refer to ethnic groups in South China and Mao Zedong himself once used it in in a speech advocating equal rights for the various minority peoples But that term has now been so systematically purged from the language that it is not to be found at least in that meaning even in large dictionaries and all references to Mao s speech have excised the offending word and replaced it with a more elaborate locution Yao Yi and Yu br The Tang dynasty Chinese also had a derogatory term for foreigners lu traditional Chinese simplified Chinese pinyin l prisoner slave captive Beckwith says it means something like those miscreants who should be locked up therefore The word does not even mean foreigner at all let alone barbarian br Christopher I Beckwith s The Barbarians epilogue provides many references but overlooks H G Creel s The Barbarians chapter Creel descriptively wrote Who in fact were the barbarians The Chinese have no single term for them But they were all the non Chinese just as for the Greeks the barbarians were all the non Greeks Beckwith prescriptively wrote The Chinese however have still not yet borrowed Greek barbar There is also no single native Chinese word for foreigner no matter how pejorative which meets his strict definition of barbarian br br br Barbarian puppet drinking game br In the Tang dynasty houses of pleasure where drinking games were common small puppets in the aspect of Westerners in a ridiculous state of drunkenness were used in one popular permutation of the drinking game so in the form of blue eyed pointy nosed and peak capped barbarians these puppets were manipulated in such a way as to occasionally fall down then whichever guest to whom the puppet pointed after falling was then obliged by honor to empty his cup of Chinese wine br br br Japan br When Europeans came to Japan they were called nanban literally Barbarians from the South because the Portuguese ships appeared to sail from the South The Dutch who arrived later were also called either nanban or k m literally meaning Red Hair br br br Pre Columbian Americas br In Mesoamerica the Aztec civilization used the word Chichimeca to denominate a group of nomadic hunter gatherer tribes that lived on the outskirts of the Triple Alliance s Empire in the north of Modern Mexico and whom the Aztec people saw as primitive and uncivilized One of the meanings attributed to the word Chichimeca is dog people br The Incas of South America used the term purum awqa for all peoples living outside the rule of their empire see Promaucaes br European and American colonists frequently referred to Native Americans as savages br br br Barbarian mercenaries br The entry of barbarians into mercenary service in a metropole repeatedly occurred in history as a standard way in which peripheral peoples from and beyond frontier regions interact with imperial powers as part of a semi foreign militarised proletariat br Examples include br br nomadic frontier tribes serving in pre modern China br mainly Germanic soldiery in the armies of the declining Roman Empire br Viking Varangian guards in imperial Byzantium br Turkic mercenaries in the Abbasid Caliphate br Widespread use of ethnic mercenary forces in pre historic Mesoamerica br Cossack units in the armies of for example Poland Lithuania and of pre Soviet Russia br Gurkhas in the colonial and postcolonial Indian military br br br Early Modern period br br Italians in the Renaissance often called anyone who lived outside of their country a barbarian As an example there is the last chapter of The Prince by Niccol Machiavelli Exhortatio ad Capesendam Italiam in Libertatemque a Barbaris Vinsicandam in English Exhortation to take Italy and free her from the barbarians in which he appeals to Lorenzo de Medici Duke of Urbino to unite Italy and stop the barbarian invasions led by other European rulers such as Charles VIII and Louis XII both of France and Ferdinand II of Aragon br Spanish sea captain Francisco de Cuellar who sailed with the Spanish Armada in used the term savage salvaje to describe the Irish people br br br Marxist use of term br In her anti war pamphlet The Crisis of German Social Democracy the Marxist theorist Rosa Luxemburg writes Bourgeois society stands at the crossroads either transition to Socialism or regression into Barbarism Luxemburg attributed it to Friedrich Engels but as was shown by Michael L wy Engels had used not the term Barbarism but a less resounding formulation If the whole of modern society is not to perish a revolution in the mode of production and distribution must take place The case has been made that Luxemburg had remembered a passage from the Erfurt Program written in by Karl Kautsky and mistakenly attributed it to Engels As things stand today capitalist civilization cannot continue we must either move forward into socialism or fall back into barbarism Luxemburg went on to explain what she meant by Regression into Barbarism A look around us at this moment i e Europe shows what the regression of bourgeois society into Barbarism means This World War is a regression into Barbarism The triumph of Imperialism leads to the annihilation of civilization At first this happens sporadically for the duration of a modern war but then when the period of unlimited wars begins it progresses toward its inevitable consequences Today we face the choice exactly as Friedrich Engels foresaw it a generation ago either the triumph of Imperialism and the collapse of all civilization as in ancient Rome depopulation desolation degeneration a great cemetery Or the victory of Socialism that means the conscious active struggle of the International Proletariat against Imperialism and its method of war br br br Modern popular culture br Modern popular culture contains such fantasy barbarians as Conan the Barbarian In such fantasy the negative connotations traditionally associated with Barbarian are often inverted For example The Phoenix on the Sword the first of Robert E Howard s Conan series is set soon after the Barbarian protagonist had forcibly seized the turbulent kingdom of Aquilonia from King Numedides whom he strangled upon his throne The story is clearly slanted to imply that the kingdom greatly benefited by power passing from a decadent and tyrannical hereditary monarch to a
