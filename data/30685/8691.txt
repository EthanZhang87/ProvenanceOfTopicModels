Divination from Latin divinare to foresee foretell predict prophesy etc is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic ritual or practice Using various methods throughout history diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a querent should proceed by reading signs events or omens or through alleged contact or interaction with supernatural agencies such as spirits gods god like beings or the will of the universe br br Divination can be seen as an attempt to organize what appears to be random so that it provides insight into a problem or issue at hand Some instruments or practices of divination include Tarot card reading rune casting tea leaf reading automatic writing water scrying and psychedelics like psilocybin mushrooms and DMT If a distinction is made between divination and fortune telling divination has a more formal or ritualistic element and often contains a more social character usually in a religious context as seen in traditional African medicine Fortune telling on the other hand is a more everyday practice for personal purposes Particular divination methods vary by culture and religion br In its functional relation to magic in general divination can have a preliminary and investigative role br br the diagnosis or prognosis achieved through divination is both temporarily and logically related to the manipulative protective or alleviative function of magic rituals In divination one finds the cause of an ailment or a potential danger in magic one subsequently acts upon this knowledge br br Divination has long attracted criticism In the modern era it has been dismissed by the scientific community and by skeptics as being superstitious experiments do not support the idea that divination techniques can actually predict the future more reliably or precisely than would be possible without it In antiquity divination came under attack from philosophers such as the Academic skeptic Cicero in De Divinatione st century BCE and the Pyrrhonist Sextus Empiricus in Against the Astrologers nd century CE The satirist Lucian c after devoted an essay to Alexander the false prophet br br br History br br br Antiquity br The Oracle of Amun at the Siwa Oasis was made famous when Alexander the Great visited it after conquering Egypt from Persia in BC br Deuteronomy or Leviticus can be interpreted as categorically forbidding divination But some biblical practices such as Urim and Thummim casting lots and prayer are considered to be divination Trevan G Hatch disputes these comparisons because divination did not consult the one true God and manipulated the divine for the diviner s self interest One of the earliest known divination artifacts a book called the Sortes Sanctorum is believed to be of Christian roots and utilizes dice to provide insight into the future br Uri Gabbay states that divination was associated with sacrificial rituals in the ancient Near East including Mesopotamia and Israel Extispicy was a common example where diviners would pray to their god s before vivisecting a sacrificial animal Their abominal organs would reveal a divine message which aligned with cardiocentric views of the mind br br br Oracles and Greek divination br br Both oracles and seers in ancient Greece practiced divination Oracles were the conduits for the gods on earth their prophecies were understood to be the will of the gods verbatim Because of the high demand for oracle consultations and the oracles limited work schedule they were not the main source of divination for the ancient Greeks That role fell to the seers Greek br Seers were not in direct contact with the gods instead they were interpreters of signs provided by the gods Seers used many methods to explicate the will of the gods including extispicy ornithomancy etc They were more numerous than the oracles and did not keep a limited schedule thus they were highly valued by all Greeks not just those with the capacity to travel to Delphi or other such distant sites br The disadvantage of seers was that only direct yes or no questions could be answered Oracles could answer more generalized questions and seers often had to perform several sacrifices in order to get the most consistent answer For example if a general wanted to know if the omens were proper for him to advance on the enemy he would ask his seer both that question and if it were better for him to remain on the defensive If the seer gave consistent answers the advice was considered valid br During battle generals would frequently ask seers at both the campground a process called the hiera and at the battlefield called the sphagia The hiera entailed the seer slaughtering a sheep and examining its liver for answers regarding a more generic question the sphagia involved killing a young female goat by slitting its throat and noting the animal s last movements and blood flow The battlefield sacrifice only occurred when two armies prepared for battle against each other Neither force would advance until the seer revealed appropriate omens br Because the seers had such power over influential individuals in ancient Greece many were skeptical of the accuracy and honesty of the seers The degree to which seers were honest depends entirely on the individual seers Despite the doubt surrounding individual seers the craft as a whole was well regarded and trusted by the Greeks and the Stoics accounted for the validity of divination in their physics br br br Middle Ages and Early Modern period br br The divination method of casting lots Cleromancy was used by the remaining eleven disciples of Jesus in Acts to select a replacement for Judas Iscariot Therefore divination was arguably an accepted practice in the early church However divination became viewed as a pagan practice by Christian emperors during ancient Rome br In the Quinisext Council also known as the Council in Trullo in the Eastern Orthodox Church passed canons to eliminate pagan and divination practices Fortune telling and other forms of divination were widespread through the Middle Ages In the constitution of and public regulations of of the Electorate of Saxony capital punishment was used on those predicting the future Laws forbidding divination practice continue to this day The Waldensians sect were accused of practicing divination br Sm land is famous for rsg ng a practice which occurred until the early th century in some parts of Sm land Generally occurring on Christmas and New Year s Eve it is a practice in which one would fast and keep themselves away from light in a room until midnight to then complete a set of complex events to interpret symbols encountered throughout the journey to foresee the coming year br In Islam astrology ilm ahkam al nujum the most widespread divinatory science is the study of how celestial entities could be applied to the daily lives of people on earth It is important to emphasize the practical nature of divinatory sciences because people from all socioeconomic levels and pedigrees sought the advice of astrologers to make important decisions in their lives Astronomy was made a distinct science by intellectuals who did not agree with the former although distinction may not have been made in daily practice where astrology was technically outlawed and only tolerated if it was employed in public Astrologers trained as scientists and astronomers were able to interpret the celestial forces that ruled the sub lunar to predict a variety of information from lunar phases and drought to times of prayer and the foundation of cities The courtly sanction and elite patronage of Muslim rulers benefited astrologers intellectual statures br br The science of the sand ilm al raml otherwise translated as geomancy is based on the interpretation of figures traced on sand or other surface known as geomantic figures It is a good example of Islamic divination at a popular level The core principle that meaning derives from a unique occupied position is identical to the core principle of astrology br Like astronomy geomancy used deduction and computation to uncover significant prophecies as opposed to omens ilm al fa l which were process of reading visible random events to decipher the invisible realities from which they originated It was upheld by prophetic tradition and relied almost exclusively on text specifically the Qur an which carried a table for guidance and poetry as a development of bibliomancy The practice culminated in the appearance of the illustrated Books of Omens Falnama in the early th century an embodiment of the apocalyptic fears as the end of the millennium in the Islamic calendar approached br Dream interpretation or oneiromancy ilm ta bir al ru ya is more specific to Islam than other divinatory science largely because of the Qur an s emphasis on the predictive dreams of Abraham Yusuf and Muhammad The important delineation within the practice lies between incoherent dreams and sound dreams which were a part of prophecy or heavenly message Dream interpretation was always tied to Islamic religious texts providing a moral compass to those seeking advice The practitioner needed to be skilled enough to apply the individual dream to general precedent while appraising the singular circumstances br The power of text held significant weight in the science of letters ilm al huruf the foundational principle being God created the world through His speech The science began with the concept of language specifically Arabic as the expression of the essence of what it signifies Once the believer understood this while remaining obedient to God s will they could uncover the essence and divine truth of the objects inscribed with Arabic like amulets and talismans through the study of the letters of the Qur an with alphanumeric computations br In Islamic practice in Senegal and Gambia just like many other West African countries diviners and religious leaders and healers were interchangeable because Islam was closely related with esoteric practices like divination which were responsible for the regional spread of Islam As scholars learned esoteric sciences they joined local non Islamic aristocratic courts who quickly aligned divination and amulets with the proof of the power of Islamic religion So strong was the idea of esoteric knowledge in West African Islam diviners and magicians uneducated in Islamic texts and Arabic bore the same titles as those who did br From the beginning of Islam there was and is still a vigorous debate about whether or not such divinatory practices were actually permissible under Islam with some scholars like Abu Hamid al Ghazili d objecting to the science of divination because he believed it bore too much similarity to pagan practices of invoking spiritual entities that were not God Other scholars justified esoteric sciences by comparing a practitioner to a physician trying to heal the sick with the help of the same natural principles br br br Mesoamerica br br Divination was a central component of ancient Mesoamerican religious life Many Aztec gods including central creator gods were described as diviners and were closely associated with sorcery Tezcatlipoca is the patron of sorcerers and practitioners of magic His name means smoking mirror a reference to a device used for divinatory scrying In the Mayan Popol Vuh the creator gods Xmucane and Xpiacoc perform divinatory hand casting during the creation of people The Aztec Codex Borbonicus shows the original human couple Oxomoco and Cipactonal engaged in divining with kernels of maize This primordial pair is associated with the ritual calendar and the Aztecs considered them to be the first diviners br Every civilization that developed in pre Columbian Mexico from the Olmecs to the Aztecs practiced divination in daily life both public and private Scrying through the use of reflective water surfaces mirrors or the casting of lots were among the most widespread forms of divinatory practice Visions derived from hallucinogens were another important form of divination and are still widely used among contemporary diviners of Mexico Among the more common hallucinogenic plants used in divination are morning glory jimson weed and peyote br br br Contemporary divination in Asia br br br India and Nepal br Theyyam or theiyam in Malayalam is the process by which a devotee invites a Hindu god or goddess to use his or her body as a medium or channel and answer other devotees questions The same is called arulvaakku or arulvaak in Tamil another south Indian language Adhiparasakthi Siddhar Peetam is famous for arulvakku in Tamil Nadu The people in and around Mangalore in Karnataka call the same Buta Kola paathri or darshin in other parts of Karnataka it is known by various names such as prashnaavali vaagdaana asei aashirvachana and so on In Nepal it is known as Devta ka dhaamee or jhaakri br In English the closest translation for these is oracle The Dalai Lama who lives in exile in northern India still consults an oracle known as the Nechung Oracle which is considered the official state oracle of the government of Tibet The Dalai Lama has according to centuries old custom consulted the Nechung Oracle during the new year festivities of Losar br br br Japan br Although Japan retains a history of traditional and local methods of divination such as onmy d contemporary divination in Japan called uranai derives from outside sources Contemporary methods of divination in Japan include both Western and Chinese astrology geomancy or feng shui tarot cards I Ching Book of Changes divination and physiognomy methods of reading the body to identify traits br In Japan

divining personality type Each attempt to reveal glimpses of an individual s destiny productive and inhibiting traits future parenting techniques and compatibility in marriage Personality type is increasingly important for young Japanese who consider personality the driving factor of compatibility given the ongoing marriage drought and birth rate decline in Japan br An import to Japan Chinese zodiac signs based on the birth year in year cycles rat ox tiger hare dragon snake horse sheep monkey cock dog and boar are frequently combined with other forms of divination such as so called celestial types based on the planets Saturn Venus Mars Jupiter Mercury or Uranus Personality can also be divined using cardinal directions the four elements water earth fire air and yin yang Names can

methods of divining birth numbers from significant numbers such as birth date may also reveal character traits of individuals br Individuals can also assess their own and others personalities according to physical characteristics Blood type remains a popular form of divination from physiology Stemming from Western influences body reading or ninsou determines personality traits based on body measurements The face is the most commonly analyzed feature with eye size pupil shape mouth shape and eyebrow shape representing the most important traits An upturned mouth may be cheerful and a triangle eyebrow may indicate that someone is strong willed br Methods of assessment in daily life may include self taken measurements or quizzes As such magazines targeted at women in their early to mid twenties feature the highest concentration of personality assessment guides There are approximately different women s magazines known as nihon zashi koukoku kyoukai published in Japan aimed at this audience br br br Japanese tarot br The adaptation of the Western divination method of tarot cards into Japanese culture presents a particularly unique example of contemporary divination as this adaptation mingles with Japan s robust visual culture Japanese tarot cards are created by professional artists advertisers and fans of tarot One tarot card collector claimed to have accumulated more than Japan made decks of tarot cards br Japanese tarot cards fall into diverse categories such as br br Inspiration Tarot reikan tarotto br I Ching Tarot ekisen tarotto br Spiritual Tarot supirichuaru tarotto br Western Tarot seiy tarotto and br Eastern Tarot t y tarotto br The images on tarot cards may come from images from Japanese popular culture such as characters from manga and anime including Hello Kitty or may feature cultural symbols Tarot cards may adapt the images of Japanese historical figures such as high priestess Himiko CE or imperial court wizard Abe no Seimei CE Still others may feature images of cultural displacement such as English knights pentagrams the Jewish Torah or invented glyphs The introduction of such cards began by the s and reached prominence s Japanese tarot cards were originally created by men often based on the Rider Waite Smith tarot published by the Rider Company in London in Since the practice of Japanese tarot has become overwhelmingly feminine and intertwined with kawaii culture Referring to the cuteness of tarot cards Japanese model Kuromiya Niina was quoted as saying because the images are cute even holding them is enjoyable While these differences exist Japanese tarot cards function similarly to their Western counterparts Cards are shuffled and cut into piles then used to forecast the future for spiritual reflection or as a tool for self understanding br br br Taiwan br A common act of divination in Taiwan is called the Poe The Poe translated to English means moon boards It consists of two wood or bamboo blocks cut into the shape of a crescent moon The one edge is rounded while the other is flat the two are mirror images Both crescents are held out in one s palms and while kneeling they are raised to the forehead level Once in this position the blocks are dropped and the future can be understood depending on their landing If both fall flat side up or both fall rounded side up that can be taken as a failure of the deity to agree If the blocks land one rounded and one flat the deity indicates Yes or positive Laughing poe is when rounded sides land down and they rock before coming to a standstill Negative poe is when the flat sides fall downward and abruptly stop this indicates No When there is a positive fall it is called Sacred poe although the negative falls are not usually taken seriously As the blocks are being dropped the question is said in a murmur and if the answer is yes the blocks are dropped again To make sure the answer is definitely a yes the blocks must fall in a yes position three times in a row br A more serious type of divination is the Ki There is a small wooden chair and around the sides of the chair are small pieces of wood that can move up and down in their sockets this causes a clicking sounds when the chair is moved in any way Two men hold this chair by its legs before an altar while the incense is being burned and the deity is invited to descend onto the chair It is seen that it is in the chair by an onset of motion Eventually the chair crashes onto a table prepared with wood chips and burlap The characters on the table are then traced and these are said to be written by the deity who possessed the chair these characters are then interpreted for the devotees br br br Contemporary divination in Africa br br Divination is widespread throughout Africa Among many examples it is one of the central tenets of Serer religion in Senegal Only those who have been initiated as Saltigues the Serer high priests and priestesses can divine the future These are the
