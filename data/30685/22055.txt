Scientologist and that like Judaism Scientology is his family s religion About his personal views Gaiman has stated I think we can say that God exists in the DC Universe I would not stand up and beat the drum for the existence of God in this universe I don t know I think there s probably a chance It doesn t really matter to me br Gaiman was able to read at the age of four He said I was a reader I loved reading Reading things gave me pleasure I was very good at most subjects in school not because I had any particular aptitude in them but because normally on the first day of school they d hand out schoolbooks and I d read them which would mean that I d know what was coming up because I d read it When he was about ten years old he read his way through the works of Dennis Wheatley The Ka of Gifford Hillary and The Haunting of Toby Jugg made a special impact on him br Another work that made a particular impression was J R R Tolkien s The Lord of the Rings which he got from his school library Although they only had the first two of the novel s three volumes Gaiman consistently checked them out and read them He later won the school English prize and the school reading prize enabling him to finally acquire the third volume For his seventh birthday Gaiman received C S Lewis s The Chronicles of Narnia He later recalled that I admired his use of parenthetical statements to the reader where he would just talk to you I d think Oh my gosh that is so cool I want to do that When I become an author I want to be able to do things in parentheses I liked the power of putting things in brackets Narnia also introduced him to literary awards specifically the Carnegie Medal won by the concluding volume in When Gaiman won the Medal himself he said it had to be the most important literary award there ever was and if you can make yourself aged seven happy you re really doing well it s like writing a letter to yourself aged seven Lewis Carroll s Alice s Adventures in Wonderland was another childhood favourite and a favourite forever Alice was default reading to the point where I knew it by heart He also enjoyed Batman comics br br Gaiman was educated at several Church of England schools including Fonthill School in East Grinstead Ardingly College and Whitgift School in Croydon His father s position as a public relations official of the Church of Scientology was the

While waiting for a train at London s Victoria Station in Gaiman noticed a copy of Swamp Thing by Alan Moore and carefully read it Moore s fresh and vigorous approach to comics had such an impact on

by Tori Amos Clive Barker Gene Wolfe Tad Williams and others br br Asked why he likes comics more than other forms of storytelling Gaiman said One of the joys of comics has always been the knowledge that it was in many ways untouched ground It was virgin territory When I was working on Sandman I felt a lot of the time that I was actually picking up a machete and heading out into the jungle I got to write in places and do things that nobody had ever done before When I m writing novels I m painfully aware that I m working in a medium that people have been writing absolutely jaw droppingly brilliant things for you know three four thousand years now You know you can go back We have things like The Golden Ass And you go well I don t know that I m as good as that and that s two and a half thousand years old But with comics I felt like I can do stuff nobody has ever done I can do stuff nobody has ever thought of And I could and it was enormously fun br Gaiman wrote two series for Marvel

collaborative effort and most of the ideas could be credited to both of them Pratchett did a larger portion of writing and editing if for no other reason than Gaiman s scheduled involvement with

government and came back as a reluctant agent of Hell but had no real direction in his actions In Angela a cruel and malicious angel Gaiman introduced a character who threatened Spawn s existence as well as providing a moral opposite Cogliostro was introduced as a mentor character for exposition and instruction providing guidance Medieval Spawn introduced a history and precedent that not all Spawns were self serving or evil giving additional character development to Malebolgia the demon that creates Hellspawn br As intended all three characters were used repeatedly throughout the next decade by Todd McFarlane within the wider Spawn universe In papers filed by Gaiman in early however he claimed that the characters were jointly owned by their scripter himself and artist McFarlane not merely by McFarlane in his role as the creator of the series Disagreement over who owned the rights to a character was the primary motivation for McFarlane and other artists to form Image Comics although that argument related more towards disagreements between writers and artists as character creators As McFarlane used the characters without Gaiman s permission or royalty payments Gaiman believed his copyrighted work was being infringed upon which violated their original oral agreement McFarlane initially agreed that Gaiman had not signed away any rights to the characters and negotiated with Gaiman to effectively swap McFarlane s interest in the character Marvelman McFarlane had purchased an interest in the character when Eclipse Comics was liquidated while Gaiman was interested in being able to continue his aborted run of the Marvelman title McFarlane later changed his initial position claiming that Gaiman s work had only been work for hire and that McFarlane owned all of Gaiman s creations entirely The presiding judge however ruled against their agreement being work for hire based in large part on the legal requirement that copyright assignments must be in writing br The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court ruling in February granting joint ownership of the characters to Gaiman and McFarlane On the specific issue of Cogliostro presiding Judge John C Shabaz proclaimed The expressive work that is the comic book character Count Nicholas Cogliostro was the joint work of Gaiman and McFarlane their contributions strike us as quite equal and both are entitled to ownership of the copyright Similar analysis led to similar results for the other two characters Angela and Medieval Spawn br This legal battle was brought by Gaiman and the specifically formed Marvels and Miracles LLC which Gaiman had previously created to help sort out the legal rights surrounding Marvelman Gaiman had written Marvel in to help fund this project and all of Gaiman s profits for the original issues of the series were donated to Marvels and Miracles The rights to Marvelman were subsequently purchased from original creator Mick Anglo by Marvel Comics in br Gaiman returned to court again over the Spawn characters Dark Ages Spawn Domina and Tiffany claiming that they were derivative of the three he co created with McFarlane The judge ruled that Gaiman was right in these claims as well and gave McFarlane until the beginning of September to settle the matter br br Gaiman has lived near Menomonie Wisconsin since Gaiman moved there to

also encouraged donations to Ukrainian refugees br In Gaiman signed an open letter addressed to Russian president Vladimir Putin alongside over other public figures calling for the release of Russian prisoner Alexei Navalny br br Gaiman s work is known for its allusiveness Dr Meredith Collins for instance has commented upon the degree to which his novel Stardust depends on allusions to Victorian fairy tales and culture In The Sandman literary figures and characters appear often the character of Fiddler s Green is modeled on G K Chesterton and both William Shakespeare and Geoffrey Chaucer appear as characters as do several characters from A Midsummer Night s Dream and The Tempest The comic also draws from numerous mythologies br Analyzing Gaiman s The Graveyard Book bibliographer and librarian Richard Bleiler detects patterns of and allusions to the Gothic novel from Horace Walpole s The Castle of Otranto to Shirley Jackson s The Haunting of Hill House He concludes that Gaiman is utilizing works characters themes and settings that generations of scholars have identified and classified as Gothic yet subverts them and develops the novel by focusing on the positive aspects of maturation concentrating on the values of learning friendship and sacrifice Regarding another work s assumed connection and allusions to this form Gaiman himself quipped I ve never been able to figure out whether Sandman is a gothic br Clay Smith has argued that this sort of allusiveness serves to situate Gaiman as a strong authorial presence in his own works often to the exclusion of his collaborators However Smith s viewpoint is in the minority to many if there is a problem with Gaiman s scholarship and intertextuality it is that his literary merit and vast popularity have propelled him into the nascent comics canon so quickly that there is not yet a basis of critical scholarship about his work br David Rudd takes a more generous view in his study of the novel Coraline where he argues that the work plays and riffs productively on Sigmund Freud s notion of the Uncanny or the Unheimlich br Though Gaiman s work is frequently seen as exemplifying the monomyth structure laid out in Joseph Campbell s The Hero with a Thousand Faces Gaiman says that he started reading The Hero with a Thousand Faces but refused to finish it I think I got about halfway through The Hero with a Thousand Faces and found myself thinking if this is true I don t want to know I really would rather not know this stuff I d rather do it because it s true and because I accidentally wind up creating something that falls into this pattern than be told what the pattern is br br Official website br Works by Neil Gaiman at Open Library br Neil Gaiman in conversation with Tom Chatfield in Prospect
