A dragonslayer is a person or being that slays dragons Dragonslayers and the creatures they hunt have been popular in traditional stories from around the world they are a type of story classified as type in the Aarne Thompson classification system They continue to be popular in modern books films video games and other forms of entertainment Dragonslayer themed stories are also sometimes seen as having a chaoskampf theme in which a heroic figure struggles against a monster that epitomises chaos br br br Description br br A dragonslayer is often the hero in a Princess and dragon tale In this type of story the dragonslayer kills the dragon in order to rescue a high class female character often a princess from being devoured by it This female character often then becomes the love interest of the account One notable example of this kind of legend is the story of Ragnar Lo br k who slays a giant serpent thereby rescuing the maiden ra borgarhj rtr whom he later marries br There are however several notable exceptions to this common motif In the legend of Saint George and the Dragon for example Saint George overcomes the dragon as part of a plot which ends with the conversion of the dragon s grateful victims to Christianity rather than Saint George being married to the rescued princess character br In a Norse legend from the V lsunga saga the dragonslayer Sigurd kills F fnir a dwarf who has been turned into a dragon as a result of guarding the cursed ring that had once belonged to the dwarf Andvari After slaying the dragon Sigurd drinks some of the dragon s blood and thereby gains the ability to understand the speech of birds He also bathes in the dragon s blood causing his skin to become invulnerable Sigurd overhears two nearby birds discussing the heinous treachery being planned by his companion Regin In response to the plot Sigurd kills Regin thereby averting the treachery br Mythologists such as Joseph Campbell have argued that dragonslayer myths can be seen as a psychological metaphor br br But as Siegfried Sigurd learned he must then taste the dragon blood in order to take to himself something of that dragon power When Siegfried has killed the dragon and tasted the blood he hears the song of nature he has transcended his humanity and re associated himself with the powers of nature which are powers of our life and from which our minds remove us br Psychologically the dragon is one s own binding of oneself to one s own ego br br br Dragonslayer characters br br br Antiquity br Enki br Ninurta br Inanna br Marduk br Ra br Teshub br Indra br Garuda br Janamejaya br Uttanka br Baal br El deity br Yahweh br Michael br Daniel br Apollo br Zeus br Jupiter br Perseus br Heracles br Heros br Saint George br Vahagn br Tar unz br Cadmus br Rostam br Fereydun br Garshasp br Yu the Great br Erlang Shen br Li Ji br Eurybarus br Mwindo br br br Medieval and early Modern legend br Guy of Warwick br Baldr br Beowulf br Sigurd or Siegfried br Dietrich von Bern br Tristan br Margaret the Virgin br Heinrich von Winkelried br Gawain br Dobrynya Nikitich br Skuba Dratewka Krakus br Drangue br Susanoo br Nezha br Lancelot br F t Frumos br Fr ech br Bayajidda br Bahr m G r br Iovan Iorgovan br Pr slea the Brave br Greuceanu br Haymon br Wada Heita Tanenaga br John Lambton br Mamadi Sefe Dekote Africa br Benzaiten aka Saraswati br Teodosio de Go i br Piers Shonks br Dieudonn de Gozon br br br Tolkien s legendarium br T rin Turambar br E rendil br Fram br Bard the Bowman br br br br br br Further reading br br br External links br Media related to Dragonslayers at Wikimedia Commons
