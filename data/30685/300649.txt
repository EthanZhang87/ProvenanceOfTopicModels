Science fantasy is a hybrid genre within speculative fiction that simultaneously draws upon or combines tropes and elements from both science fiction and fantasy In a conventional science fiction story the world is presented as being scientifically logical while a conventional fantasy story contains mostly supernatural and artistic elements that disregard the scientific laws of the real world The world of science fantasy however is laid out to be scientifically logical and often supplied with hard science like explanations of any supernatural elements br During the Golden Age of Science Fiction science fantasy stories were seen in sharp contrast to the terse scientifically plausible material that came to dominate mainstream science fiction typified by the magazine Astounding Science Fiction Although science fantasy stories at that time were often relegated to the status of children s entertainment their freedom of imagination and romance proved to be an early major influence on the New Wave writers of the s who became exasperated by the limitations of Hard Science Fiction br br The term science fantasy was coined in by critic Forrest J Ackerman as a synonym for science fiction In the s the British journalist Walter Gillings considered science fantasy as a part of science fiction that was not plausible from the point of view of the science of the time for example the

In writer Marion Zimmer later known as Zimmer Bradley called science fantasy a mixture of science fiction and fantasy in Startling Stories magazine Critic Judith Murry considered science fantasy as works of fantasy in which magic has a natural scientific basis Science fiction critic John Clute chose the narrower term technological fantasy from the broader concept of science fiction br The label first came into wide use after many science fantasy stories were published in the American pulp magazines such as Robert A Heinlein s Magic Inc L Ron Hubbard s Slaves of Sleep and Fletcher Pratt and L Sprague de Camp s Harold Shea series All were relatively rationalistic stories published in John W Campbell Jr s Unknown magazine These were a deliberate attempt to apply the techniques and attitudes of science fiction to traditional fantasy subjects br Distinguishing between pure science fiction and pure fantasy Rod Serling argued that the former was the improbable made possible while the latter was the impossible made probable As a combination of the two science fantasy gives a scientific veneer of realism to things that simply could not happen in the real world under any circumstances Where science fiction does not permit the existence of fantastical or supernatural elements science fantasy explicitly relies upon them to complement the scientific elements br In explaining the intrigue of
