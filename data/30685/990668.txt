id: 990668
The works of J R R Tolkien have served as the inspiration to painters musicians film makers and writers to such an extent that he is sometimes seen as the father of the entire genre of high fantasy br br Do not laugh But once upon a time my crest has long since fallen I had a mind to make a body of more or less connected legend ranging from the large and cosmogonic to the level of romantic fairy story The cycles should be linked to a majestic whole and yet leave scope for other minds and hands wielding paint and music and drama Absurd br br br Art and illustration br br The earliest illustrations of Tolkien s works were drawn by the author himself The American edition of The Hobbit was illustrated by professional draughtsmen Tolkien was very critical of this work and in he rejected illustrations by Horus Engels for the German edition of the Hobbit as too Disnified for my taste Bilbo with a dribbling nose and Gandalf as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the Odinic wanderer that I think of br In Milein Cosman was invited by Tolkien s publishers to submit illustrations for Farmer Giles of Ham Tolkien felt her impressionistic style did not suit the story and she was replaced by Pauline Baynes who later also supplied the illustrations for The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Smith of Wootton Major In Tolkien was sent a number of a suite of illustrations of The Lord of the Rings mostly in coloured ink by the English artist Mary Fairburn Tolkien said of her pictures They show far more attention to the text than any that have yet been submitted to me I am beginning to think that an illustrated edition might be a good thing For various reasons the project went no further and Fairburn s illustrations were unknown until Crown Princess Margrethe now Queen Margrethe II of Denmark an accomplished and critically acclaimed painter was inspired to create illustrations to The Lord of the Rings in the early s In Queen Margrethe s drawings were published in the Danish translation of the book redrawn by the British artist Eric Fraser br br Tim and Greg Hildebrandt usually called the Brothers Hildebrandt were Tolkien illustrators in the s and s known

of The Lord of the Rings George R R Martin acknowledged Tolkien influenced his Game of Thrones TV series and novels about medieval fantasy while speaking about a movie about Tolkien s life br An early draft for George Lucas s Star Wars film is said to have included an exchange of dialogue between Obi Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker taken directly from the conversation between Gandalf and Bilbo in Chapter of The Hobbit where Gandalf Kenobi says Good morning and Bilbo Luke replies asking whether he means he s having a good morning or is wishing him one or that all mornings are good Gandalf Kenobi answers All of them at once The plagiarised dialogue was dropped but Lucas modelled the monk like Kenobi on Gandalf the film author Chris Taylor identifies several further elements of Star Wars that in his view could have been modelled on Middle earth br br While working on a Star Wars animated series Dave Filoni noted that Peter Jackson visited him and his mentor George Lucas to discuss Tolkien s works and to ask for advice According to the Star Wars website Darth Vader is compared by Filoni to the Balrog rather than Sauron and the Prancing Pony bar may have inspired the Mos Eisley

Jackson s influenced the volcanic planet Mustafar br br br Literature br br br Fantasy br br As early as Diana Paxson argued in Mythlore that Tolkien had founded a new literary tradition Since then
