Fantastic Adventures was an American pulp fantasy and science fiction magazine published from to by Ziff Davis It was initially edited by Raymond A Palmer who was also the editor of Amazing Stories Ziff Davis s other science fiction title The first nine issues were in bedsheet format but in June the magazine switched to a standard pulp size It was almost cancelled at the end of but the October issue enjoyed unexpectedly good sales helped by a strong cover by J Allen St John for Robert Moore Williams Jongor of Lost Land By May the magazine was on a regular monthly schedule Historians of science fiction consider that Palmer was unable to maintain a consistently high standard of fiction but Fantastic Adventures soon developed a reputation for light hearted and whimsical stories Much of the material was written by a small group of writers under both their own names and house names The cover art like those of many other pulps of the era focused on beautiful women in melodramatic action scenes One regular cover artist was H W McCauley whose glamorous MacGirl covers were popular with the readers though the emphasis on depictions of attractive and often partly clothed women did draw some objections br In Palmer left Ziff Davis and was replaced by Howard Browne who was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about fantasy fiction Browne briefly managed to improve the quality of the fiction in Fantastic Adventures and the period around has been described as the magazine s heyday Browne lost interest when his plan to take Amazing Stories upmarket collapsed and the magazine fell back into predictability In Ziff Davis launched another fantasy magazine titled Fantastic in a digest format it was successful and within a few months the decision was taken to end Fantastic Adventures in favor of Fantastic The March issue of Fantastic Adventures was the last br br br Publication history br Although science fiction sf had been published before the s it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in of Amazing Stories a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback By the end of the s the field was undergoing its first boom Gernsback lost control of Amazing Stories in it was sold to Teck Publications and then in it was acquired by Ziff Davis The following year Ziff Davis launched Fantastic Adventures as a companion to Amazing the first issue was dated May and the editor of Amazing Ray Palmer took on responsibility for the new magazine as well br Fantastic Adventures was initially published in bedsheet format the same size as the early sf magazines such as Amazing perhaps in order to attract fans who were nostalgic for the larger format It started as a bimonthly but in January began a monthly schedule Sales were weaker than for Amazing however and with the June issue the schedule reverted to bimonthly The size was also reduced to a standard pulp format since that was cheaper to produce Sales did not improve and Ziff Davis planned to make the October issue the last one That issue carried Robert Moore Williams Jongor of Lost Land and had a cover by J Allen St John the combination proved to be so popular that October sales were twice the August figures This convinced Ziff Davis that the magazine was viable and it was restarted in January as a bimonthly at first but switching to monthly again in May of that year br Howard Browne took over as editor of both Amazing Stories and Fantastic Adventures in Browne preferred fantasy to science fiction and enjoyed editing Fantastic Adventures but when his plans for taking Amazing upmarket were derailed by the Korean War he lost interest in both magazines for a while He let William Hamling take responsibility for both titles and the quality declined At the end of Ziff Davis moved its offices from Chicago to New York Browne relocated to New York but Hamling decided to stay in Chicago so Browne became more involved once again and sf historians such as Brian Stableford and Mike Ashley consider the result to have been a definite improvement in quality Browne s interest in fantasy led him to start a new digest sized magazine Fantastic in the summer of it was an immediate success and led Ziff Davis to convert Amazing Stories to digest format as well The move from the pulp format to digests was well under way in the early s and with Fantastic s success there was little reason to keep Fantastic Adventures going It was merged with Fantastic the last issue was dated March and the May June issue of Fantastic added a mention of Fantastic Adventures to the masthead though this disappeared with the following issue br br br Contents and reception br br br Palmer br Palmer s goal for Fantastic Adventures was to create a magazine that published fantasy fiction but was the literary equal of the quality magazines the slicks such as The Saturday Evening Post Although mixing science fiction with fantasy was not popular with sf fans of the era Palmer consciously promoted the magazine as containing the best of both worlds the slogan on the cover read The Best in Science Fiction but Palmer also wrote blurbs in Amazing Stories for Fantastic Adventures in which he extolled the value to a reader of getting both genres in a single magazine Fantastic Adventures competition included Unknown which had been launched just a couple of months earlier in March and Weird Tales which was first published in but instead of attempting to emulate either one Fantastic Adventures focused on adventure stories in the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs Palmer probably acquired some fantasy oriented material that had been submitted to Amazing Stories which gave him an immediate stream of submissions to work with However according to Ashley the first issue was quite weak The cover story was The Invisible Robinhood by Eando Binder and other contributors included Harl Vincent Ross Rocklynne and A Hyatt Verrill Features included a quiz an author profile and a comic strip titled Ray Holmes Scientific Detective the reader was supposed to solve the mystery based on the clues given in the strip It was a failure and disappeared after the first issue The back cover The Man from Mars by Frank R Paul was more successful and illustrated back covers became a regular feature of the magazine br The next issue contained The Scientists Revolt by Edgar Rice Burroughs a name guaranteed to help sales Ashley comments that the story was unimpressive it had been written as a palace intrigue set in contemporary Europe but Burroughs had been unable to find a buyer Palmer eventually acquired it and rewrote it setting it in the future Despite the weakness of the lead story the second issue was a marked improvement over the first with well received stories by Nelson S Bond and John Russell Fearn as Thornton Ayre Burroughs returned to Fantastic Adventures in with a series of novelettes in his Carson of Venus series there were four in all between March and March each with cover art by J Allen St John and the result was a significant boost to Fantastic Adventures circulation br br A majority of the stories in Fantastic Adventures came from a small group of writers who often wrote under house names The main members of the group were William P McGivern David Wright O Brien Don Wilcox Chester S Geier Rog Phillips Leroy Yerxa Robert Moore Williams Robert Bloch and Berkeley Livingston Most of this material was of little lasting value in Ashley s opinion but Palmer was often able to get good stories from outside this group August Derleth sold several stories to Palmer for example Ray Bradbury also sold a story to Fantastic Adventures Tomorrow and Tomorrow which appeared in was his only appearance in the magazine but Ashley regards it as among the best stories Fantastic Adventures published in the s An early contributor was Nelson S Bond whose story The Judging of the Priestess appeared in the April issue This was the second in a highly regarded series of three stories about a priestess in the future after civilization has collapsed the first and third in the series appeared in Amazing Stories and Astounding Stories respectively Bond also wrote a humorous short story called The Amazing Invention of Wilberforce Weems which appeared in the September issue and described the consequences of a potion that allowed the instant absorption of knowledge from any book Palmer encouraged his stable of writers to follow up with more whimsical ideas and the resulting offbeat stories gave Fantastic Adventures a reputation for light hearted and entertaining fantasy These stories often had absurd names early examples include The Quandary of Quantus Quaggle Sidney the Screwloose Robot both by McGivern and The Weird Doom of Floyd Scrilch by Robert Bloch one of his series of stories about Lefty Feep almost all of which appeared in Fantastic Adventures between and Robert Moore Williams contributed two sequels to his successful Jongor of Lost Land The Return of Jongor appeared in and Jongor Fights Back in br Palmer enjoyed hoaxes such as printing a photograph of a writer when in fact the name in question was a pseudonym In the February issue of Fantastic Adventures he printed a letter in which the writer claimed to be a time traveling scientist born in whose time machine was inspired by a story in the magazine Palmer pretended to take the letter seriously and printed an appeal to readers to find the scientist Palmer s most successful hoax was the Shaver Mystery a series of stories in which the author Richard Shaver explained all the wrecks and accidents on Earth as the result of interference by ancient machinery hidden underground The series was enormously popular all the Shaver Mystery stories were published in Fantastic Adventures companion magazine Amazing Stories which led Ashley to describe Fantastic Adventures as a haven from the Shaver stories but Shaver did also publish some competent fantasies in Fantastic Adventures The increased circulation enabled both Amazing and Fantastic Adventures to return to monthly publication in the late s br br br Browne br When Browne took over at the start of William Hamling was doing most of the editorial work Browne did not fully take control of the magazine until the end of the year when Hamling and Palmer both left Ziff Davis the quality of the fiction promptly improved at that point and the first year or two of Browne s tenure are regarded as the high point of Fantastic Adventures run Theodore Sturgeon s novel The Dreaming Jewels appeared in February and Lester del Rey William Tenn and Walter M Miller all published notable material In April Mack Reynolds first story Isolationist appeared in Fantastic Adventures Reynolds became more strongly associated with Astounding Science Fiction than with the Ziff Davis magazines but some of the radical political themes of his later work are evident in Isolationist The story describes helpful alien visitors abandoning Earth to atomic war because of the hostility of the first Earthman they encounter John Jakes also debuted in Fantastic Adventures that year with The Dreaming Trees in November br Overall the quality was low but according to sf historian Brian Stableford sf writers given carte blanche to write pure fantasy for Fantastic Adventures did often produce readable fiction with a distinctive whimsical and ironic flavour Critic John Clute s assessment was that it was inconsistent but there were some terrific tales in it Not enough but some Notable stories from the post war era include Theodore Sturgeon s Largo and Raymond F Jones The Children s Room The artwork was generally of higher quality than the stories Ashley describes Fantastic Adventures as one of the best illustrated magazines around Regular artists included Virgil Finlay Henry Sharp Rod Ruth and Malcolm Smith In Palmer s words It has been our experience that covers sell magazines simply because they attract attention For the first year the cover art while dramatic was more likely to show an action scene with a male hero than a damsel in distress but in August H W McCauley s cover showed a glamorous woman in a sparkling dress Similar covers followed with increasing frequency with readers and editors giving the various heroines the name of MacGirl Science fiction historian Paul Carter commenting on the change from action scenes to alluring women on the covers suggests that surely the war had something to do with this Science fiction art often included spaceships as phallic symbols author and critic Brian Aldiss remarked on a Fantastic Adventures cover from March that included a submarine as a phallic symbol instead Readers letters often objected to the attractive women and the implied sexual content but the stories themselves were quite tame br br br Bibliographic details br The editorial succession at Fantastic Adventures is usually given as follows br Ray Palmer May December br Howard Browne January April br However the editorial responsibility did not always reside with the named editor on the masthead The editor in chief was senior to the managing editor but at some points in the magazine s history it was the managing editor who was primarily responsible for the magazine The following table shows who held which title at which point

schedule beginning with the October issue in October it became bimonthly again though there was a gap between February and May From September to the end of the run the magazine was monthly The volume numeration was regular with a new volume starting at the beginning of each calendar year the result was a variable number of issues in each volume from a low of four in to a full twelve when the magazine was monthly as it was for the last few years of its life The last issue was volume number br There were two British reprint editions The first consisted of two numbered and undated issues
