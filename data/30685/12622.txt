Gothic fiction sometimes called Gothic horror primarily in the th century is a loose literary aesthetic of fear and haunting The name refers to Gothic architecture of the European Middle Ages which was characteristic of the settings of early Gothic novels br The first work to call itself Gothic was Horace Walpole s novel The Castle of Otranto later subtitled A Gothic Story Subsequent th century contributors included Clara Reeve Ann Radcliffe William Thomas Beckford and Matthew Lewis The Gothic influence continued into the early th century works by the Romantic poets like Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Lord Byron and novelists such as Mary Shelley Charles Maturin Walter Scott and E T A Hoffmann frequently drew upon gothic motifs in their works br The early Victorian period continued the use of gothic aesthetic in novels by Charles Dickens and the Bront sisters as well as works by the American writers Edgar Allan Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne Later well known works were Dracula by Bram Stoker Richard Marsh s The Beetle and Robert Louis Stevenson s Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde Twentieth century contributors include Daphne du Maurier Stephen King Shirley Jackson Anne Rice and Toni Morrison br br Gothic fiction is characterized by an environment of fear the threat of supernatural events and the intrusion of the past upon the present The setting typically includes physical reminders of the past especially through ruined buildings which stand as proof of a previously thriving world which is decaying in the present Characteristic settings in the th and th centuries include castles religious buildings such as monasteries and convents and crypts The atmosphere is typically claustrophobic and common plot elements include vengeful persecution imprisonment and murder The depiction of horrible events in Gothic fiction often serves as a metaphorical expression of psychological or social conflicts The form of a Gothic story is usually discontinuous and convoluted often incorporating tales within tales changing narrators and framing devices such as discovered manuscripts or interpolated histories Other characteristics regardless of relevance to the main plot can include sleeplike and deathlike states live burials doubles unnatural echoes or silences the discovery of obscured family ties unintelligible writings nocturnal landscapes remote locations and dreams Especially in the late th century Gothic fiction often involved demons and demonic possession ghosts and other kinds of evil spirits br Gothic fiction often moves between high culture and low or popular culture br br Gothic literature is strongly associated with the Gothic Revival architecture of the same era English Gothic writers often associated medieval buildings with what they saw as a dark and terrifying period marked by harsh laws enforced by torture and with mysterious fantastic and superstitious rituals Similar to the Gothic Revivalists rejection of the clarity and rationalism of the Neoclassical style of the Enlightened Establishment the literary Gothic embodies an appreciation of the joys of extreme emotion the thrills of fearfulness and awe inherent in the sublime and a quest for atmosphere Gothic ruins invoke multiple linked emotions by representing inevitable decay and the collapse of human creations hence the urge to add fake ruins as eyecatchers in English landscape parks br Placing a story in a Gothic building serves several purposes It inspires feelings of awe implies that the story is set in the past gives an impression of isolation or dissociation from the rest of the world and conveys religious associations Setting the novel in a Gothic castle was meant to imply a story set in the past and shrouded in darkness The architecture often served as a mirror for the characters and events of the story The buildings in The Castle of Otranto for example are riddled with tunnels that characters use to move back and forth in secret This movement mirrors the secrets surrounding Manfred s possession of the castle and how it came into his family br br From the castles dungeons forests and hidden passages of the Gothic novel genre emerged female Gothic Guided by the works of authors such as Ann Radcliffe Mary Shelley and Charlotte Bront the female Gothic allowed women s societal and sexual desires to be introduced In many respects the novel s intended reader of the time was the woman who even as she enjoyed such novels felt she had to lay down her book with affected indifference or momentary shame according to Jane Austen The Gothic novel shaped its form for woman readers to turn to Gothic romances to find support for their own mixed feelings br Female Gothic narratives focus on such topics as a persecuted heroine fleeing from a villainous father and searching for an absent mother At the same time male writers tend towards the masculine transgression of social taboos The emergence of the ghost story gave women writers something to write about besides the common marriage plot allowing them to present a more radical critique of male power violence and predatory sexuality Authors such as Mary Robinson and Charlotte Dacre however present a counter to the naive and persecuted heroines usually featured in female Gothic of the time and instead feature more sexually assertive heroines in their works br When the female Gothic coincides with the explained supernatural the natural cause of terror is not the supernatural but female disability and societal horrors rape incest and the threatening control of a male antagonist Female Gothic novels also address women s discontent with patriarchal society their difficult and unsatisfying maternal position and their role within that society Women s fears of entrapment in the domestic their bodies marriage childbirth or domestic abuse commonly appear in the genre br After the characteristic Gothic Bildungsroman like plot sequence female Gothic allowed readers to grow from adolescence to maturity in the face of the realized impossibilities of the supernatural As protagonists such as Adeline in The Romance of the Forest learn that their superstitious fantasies and terrors are replaced by natural cause and reasonable doubt the reader may grasp the heroine s true position The heroine possesses the romantic temperament that perceives strangeness where others see none Her sensibility therefore prevents her from knowing that her true plight is her condition the disability of being female br br The components that would eventually combine into Gothic literature had a rich history by the time Walpole presented a fictitious medieval manuscript in The Castle of Otranto in br The plays of William Shakespeare in particular were a crucial reference point for early Gothic writers in both an effort to bring credibility to their works and to legitimize the emerging genre as serious literature to the public Tragedies such as Hamlet Macbeth King Lear Romeo and Juliet and Richard III with plots revolving around the supernatural revenge murder ghosts witchcraft and omens written in dramatic pathos and set in medieval castles were a huge influence upon early Gothic authors who frequently quote and make allusions to Shakespeare s works br John Milton s Paradise Lost was also very influential among Gothic writers who were especially drawn to the tragic anti hero character Satan who became a model for many charismatic Gothic villains and Byronic heroes Milton s version of the myth of the fall and redemption creation and decreation is as Frankenstein again reveals an important model for Gothic plots br Alexander Pope who had a considerable influence on Walpole was the first significant poet of the th century to write a poem in an authentic Gothic manner Eloisa to Abelard a tale of star crossed lovers one doomed to a life of seclusion in a convent and the other in a monastery abounds in gloomy imagery religious terror and suppressed passion The influence of Pope s poem is found throughout th century Gothic literature including the novels of Walpole Radcliffe and Lewis br Gothic literature is often described with words such as wonder and terror This sense of wonder and terror that provides the suspension of disbelief so important to the Gothic which except for when it is parodied even for all its occasional melodrama is typically played straight in a self serious manner requires the imagination of the reader to be willing to accept the idea that there might be something beyond that which is immediately in front of us The mysterious imagination necessary for Gothic literature to have gained any traction had been growing for some time before the advent of the Gothic The need for this came as the known world was becoming more explored reducing the geographical mysteries of the world The edges of the map were filling in and no dragons were to be found The human mind required a replacement Clive Bloom theorizes that this void in the collective imagination was critical in developing the cultural possibility for the rise of the Gothic tradition br The setting of most early Gothic works was medieval but this was a common theme long before Walpole In Britain especially there was a desire to reclaim a shared past This obsession frequently led to extravagant architectural displays such as Fonthill Abbey and sometimes mock tournaments were held It was not merely in literature that a medieval revival made itself felt and this too contributed to a culture ready to accept a perceived medieval work in br The Gothic often uses scenery of decay death and morbidity to achieve its effects especially in the Italian Horror school of Gothic However Gothic literature was not the origin of this tradition it was far older The corpses skeletons and churchyards so commonly associated with early Gothic works were popularized by the Graveyard poets They were also present in novels such as Daniel Defoe s A Journal of the Plague Year which contains comical scenes of plague carts and piles of corpses Even earlier poets like Edmund Spenser evoked a dreary and sorrowful mood in such poems as Epithalamion br All aspects of pre Gothic literature occur to some degree in the Gothic but even taken together they still fall short of true Gothic What needed to be added was an aesthetic to tie the elements together Bloom notes that this aesthetic must take the form of a theoretical or philosophical core which is necessary to sav e the best tales from becoming mere anecdote or incoherent sensationalism In this case the aesthetic needed to be emotional and was finally provided by Edmund Burke s work A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful which finally codif ied the gothic emotional experience Specifically Burke s thoughts on the Sublime Terror and Obscurity were most applicable These sections can be summarized thus the Sublime is that which is or produces the strongest emotion which the mind is capable of feeling Terror most often evoked the Sublime and to cause Terror we need some amount of Obscurity we can t know everything about that which is inducing Terror or else a great deal of the apprehension vanishes Obscurity is necessary to experience the Terror of the unknown Bloom asserts that Burke s descriptive vocabulary was essential to the Romantic works that eventually informed the Gothic br The birth of Gothic literature was thought to have been influenced by political upheaval Researchers linked its birth with the English Civil War culminating in a Jacobite rebellion more recent to the first Gothic novel The collective political memory and any deep cultural fears associated with it likely contributed to early Gothic villains as literary representatives of defeated Tory barons or Royalists rising from their political graves in the pages of early Gothic novels to terrorize the bourgeois reader of late eighteenth century England br br The first work to call itself Gothic was Horace Walpole s The Castle of Otranto The first edition presented the story as a translation of a sixteenth century manuscript and was widely popular Walpole in the second edition revealed himself as the author which adding the subtitle A Gothic Story The revelation prompted a backlash from readers who considered it inappropriate for a modern author to write a supernatural story in a rational age Walpole did not initially prompt many imitators Beginning with Clara Reeve s The Old English Baron the s saw more writers attempting his combination of supernatural plots with emotionally realistic characters Examples include Sophia Lee s The Recess and William Beckford s Vathek br br At the height of the Gothic novel s popularity in the s the genre was almost synonymous with Ann Radcliffe whose works were highly anticipated and widely imitated The Romance of the Forest and The Mysteries of Udolpho were particularly popular In an essay on Radcliffe Walter Scott writes of the popularity of Udolpho at the time The very name was fascinating and the public who rushed upon it with all the eagerness of curiosity rose from it with unsated appetite When a family was numerous the volumes flew and were sometimes torn from hand to hand Radcliffe s novels were often seen as the feminine and rational opposite of a more violently horrifying male Gothic associated with Matthew Lewis Radcliffe s final novel The Italian responded to Lewis s The Monk Radcliffe and Lewis have been called the two most significant Gothic novelists of the s br The popularity and influence of The Mysteries of Udolpho and The Monk saw the rise of shorter and cheaper versions of Gothic literature in the forms of Gothic bluebooks and chapbooks which in many cases were plagiarized and abridgments of well known Gothic novels The Monk in particular with its immoral and sensational content saw many plagiarized copies and was notably drawn from in the cheaper pamphlets br Other notable Gothic novels of the s include William Godwin s Caleb Williams Regina Maria Roche s Clermont and Charles Brockden Brown s Wieland as well as large numbers of anonymous works published by the Minerva Press In continental Europe Romantic literary movements led to related Gothic genres such as the German Schauerroman and the French Roman noir Eighteenth century Gothic novels were typically set in a distant past and for English novels a distant European country but without specific dates or historical figures that characterized the later development of historical fiction br br The saturation of Gothic inspired literature during the s was referred to in a letter by Samuel Taylor Coleridge writing on March indeed I am almost weary of the Terrible having been a hireling in the Critical Review for the last six or eight months I have been reviewing the Monk the Italian Hubert de Sevrac c c c in all of which dungeons and old castles solitary Houses by the Sea Side Caverns Woods extraordinary characters all the tribe of Horror Mystery have crowded on me even to surfeiting br The excesses stereotypes and frequent absurdities of the Gothic genre made it rich territory for satire Historian Rictor Norton notes that satire of Gothic literature was common from until the s including early satirical works such as The New Monk More Ghosts and Rosella or Modern Occurrences Gothic novels themselves according to Norton also possess elements of self satire By having profane comic characters as well as sacred serious characters the Gothic novelist could puncture the balloon of the supernatural while at the same time affirming the power of the imagination After there was a period in which Gothic parodies outnumbered forthcoming Gothic novels In The Heroine by Eaton Stannard Barrett Gothic tropes are exaggerated for comic effect In Jane Austen s novel Northanger Abbey the naive protagonist a female named Catherine conceives herself as a heroine of a Radcliffean romance and imagines murder and villainy on every side However the truth turns out to be much more prosaic This novel is also noted for including a list of early Gothic works known as the Northanger Horrid Novels br br The poetry romantic adventures and character of Lord Byron characterized by his spurned lover Lady Caroline Lamb as mad bad and dangerous to know were another inspiration for the Gothic novel providing the archetype of the Byronic hero For example Byron is the title character in Lady Caroline s Gothic novel Glenarvon br br Byron was also the host of the celebrated ghost story competition involving himself Percy Bysshe Shelley Mary Shelley and John William Polidori at the Villa Diodati on the banks of Lake Geneva in the summer of This occasion was productive of both Mary Shelley s Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus and Polidori s The Vampyre featuring the Byronic Lord Ruthven The Vampyre has been accounted by cultural critic Christopher Frayling as one of the most influential works of fiction ever written and spawned a craze for vampire fiction and theatre and latterly film that has not ceased to this day Although clearly influenced by the Gothic tradition Mary Shelley s novel is often considered the first science fiction novel despite the novel s lack of any scientific explanation for the monster s animation and the focus instead on the moral dilemmas and consequences of such a creation br John Keats La Belle Dame sans Merci and Isabella or the Pot of Basil feature mysteriously fey ladies In the latter poem the names of the characters the dream visions and the macabre physical details are influenced by the novels of premiere Gothicist Ann Radcliffe br Although ushering in the historical novel and turning popularity away from Gothic fiction Walter Scott frequently employed Gothic elements in his novels and poetry Scott drew upon oral folklore fireside tales and ancient superstitions often juxtaposing rationality and the supernatural Novels such as The Bride of Lammermoor in which the characters fates are decided by superstition and prophecy or the poem Marmion in which a nun is walled alive inside a convent illustrate Scott s influence and use of Gothic themes br A late example of a traditional Gothic novel is Melmoth the Wanderer by Charles Maturin which combines themes of anti Catholicism with an outcast Byronic hero Jane C Loudon s The Mummy features standard Gothic motifs characters and plot but with one significant twist it is set in the twenty second century and speculates on fantastic scientific developments that might have occurred three hundred years in the future making it and Frankenstein among the earliest examples of the science fiction genre developing from Gothic traditions br During two decades the most famous author of Gothic literature in Germany was the polymath E T A Hoffmann Lewis s The Monk influenced and even mentioned it in his novel The Devil s Elixirs The novel explores the motive of Doppelg nger a term coined by another German author and supporter of Hoffmann Jean Paul in his humorous novel Siebenk s He also wrote an opera based on Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu s Gothic story Undine for which de la Motte Fouqu wrote the libretto Aside from Hoffmann and de la Motte Fouqu three other important authors from the era were Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff The Marble Statue Ludwig Achim von Arnim Die Majoratsherren and Adelbert von Chamisso Peter Schlemihls wundersame Geschichte After them Wilhelm Meinhold wrote The Amber Witch and Sidonia von Bork br In Spain the priest Pascual P rez Rodr guez was the most diligent novelist in the Gothic way closely aligned to the supernatural explained by Ann Radcliffe At the same time the poet Jos de Espronceda published The Student of Salamanca a narrative poem that presents a horrid variation on the Don Juan legend br br In Russia authors of the Romantic era include Antony Pogorelsky penname of Alexey Alexeyevich Perovsky Orest Somov Oleksa Storozhenko Alexandr Pushkin Nikolai Alekseevich Polevoy Mikhail Lermontov for his work Stuss and Alexander Bestuzhev Marlinsky Pushkin is particularly important as his short story The Queen of Spades was so popular that it was adapted into operas and later films by Russian and foreign artists Some parts of Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov s A Hero of Our Time are also considered to belong to the Gothic genre but they lack the supernatural elements of other Russian Gothic stories br The following poems are also now considered to belong to the Gothic genre Meshchevskiy s Lila Katenin s Olga Pushkin s The Bridegroom Pletnev s The Gravedigger and Lermontov s Demon br The key author of the transition from Romanticism to Realism Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol who was also one of the most important authors of Romanticism produced a number of works that qualify as Gothic fiction Each of his three short story collections features a number of stories that fall within the Gothic genre or contain Gothic elements They include Saint John s Eve and A Terrible Vengeance from Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka The Portrait from Arabesques and Viy from Mirgorod While all are well known the latter is probably the most famous having inspired at least eight film adaptations two now considered lost one animated film two documentaries and a video game Gogol s work differs from Western European Gothic fiction as his cultural influences drew on Ukrainian folklore the Cossack lifestyle and as a religious man Orthodox Christianity br Other relevant authors of this era include Vladimir Fyodorovich Odoevsky The Living Corpse written published The Ghost The Sylphide as well as short stories Count Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy The Family of the Vourdalak and The Vampire Mikhail Zagoskin Unexpected Guests J zef S kowski Osip Senkovsky Antar and Yevgeny Baratynsky The Ring br br By the Victorian era Gothic had ceased to be the dominant genre for novels in England partly replaced by more sedate historical fiction However Gothic short stories continued to be popular published in magazines or as small chapbooks called penny dreadfuls The most influential Gothic writer from this period was the American Edgar Allan Poe who wrote numerous short stories and poems reinterpreting Gothic tropes His story The Fall of the House of Usher revisits classic Gothic tropes of aristocratic decay death and madness Poe is now considered the master of the American Gothic In England one of the most influential penny dreadfuls is the anonymously authored Varney the Vampire which introduced the trope of vampires having sharpened teeth Another notable English author of penny dreadfuls is George W M Reynolds known for The Mysteries of London Faust Wagner the Wehr wolf and The Necromancer Elizabeth Gaskell s tales The Doom of the Griffiths Lois the Witch and The Grey Woman all employ one of the most common themes of Gothic fiction the power of ancestral sins to curse future generations or the fear that they will M R James an English medievalist whose stories are still popular today is known as the originator of the antiquarian ghost story In Spain Gustavo Adolfo B cquer stood out with his romantic poems and short tales some depicting supernatural events Today some consider him the most read Spanish writer after Miguel de Cervantes br br In addition to these short Gothic fictions some novels drew on the Gothic Emily Bront s Wuthering Heights transports the Gothic to the forbidding Yorkshire Moors and features ghostly apparitions and a Byronic hero in the person of the demonic Heathcliff The Bront s fictions were cited by feminist critic Ellen Moers as prime examples of Female Gothic exploring woman s entrapment within domestic space and subjection to patriarchal authority and the transgressive and dangerous attempts to subvert and escape such restriction Emily Bront s Cathy and Charlotte Bront s Jane Eyre are examples of female protagonists in such roles Louisa May Alcott s Gothic potboiler A Long Fatal Love Chase written in but published in is also an interesting specimen of this subgenre Charlotte Bront s Villette also shows the Gothic influence with its supernatural subplot featuring a ghostly nun and its view of Roman Catholicism as exotic and heathenistic Nathaniel Hawthorne s novel The House of the Seven Gables about a family s ancestral home is colored with suggestions of the supernatural and witchcraft and in true Gothic fashion it features the house itself as one of the main characters br br The genre also heavily influenced writers such as Charles Dickens who read Gothic novels as a teenager and incorporated their gloomy atmosphere and melodrama into his works shifting them to a more modern period and an urban setting for example in Oliver Twist Bleak House and Great Expectations These works juxtapose wealthy ordered and affluent civilization with the disorder and barbarity of the poor in the same metropolis Bleak House in particular is credited with introducing urban fog to the novel which would become a frequent characteristic of urban Gothic literature and film Mighall Miss Havisham from Great Expectations is one of Dickens most Gothic characters The bitter recluse who shuts herself away in her gloomy mansion ever since being jilted at the altar on her wedding day His most explicitly Gothic work is his last novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood which he did not live to complete and was published unfinished upon his death in The mood and themes of the Gothic novel held a particular fascination for the Victorians with their obsession with mourning rituals mementos and mortality in general br Irish Catholics also wrote Gothic fiction in the th century Although some Anglo Irish dominated and defined the subgenre decades later they did not own it Irish Catholic Gothic writers included Gerald Griffin James Clarence Mangan and John and Michael Banim William Carleton was a notable Gothic writer and converted from Catholicism to Anglicanism br In Switzerland Jeremias Gotthelf wrote The Black Spider an allegorical work that uses Gothic themes The last work from the German writer Theodor Storm The Rider on the White Horse also uses Gothic motives and themes br After Gogol Russian literature saw the rise of Realism but many authors continued to write stories within Gothic fiction territory Ivan Sergeyevich Turgenev one of the most celebrated Realists wrote Faust Phantoms Song of the Triumphant Love and Clara Milich Another classic Russian Realist Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky incorporated Gothic elements into many of his works although none can be seen as purely Gothic Grigory Petrovich Danilevsky who wrote historical and early science fiction novels and stories wrote Mertvec ubiytsa Dead Murderer in Also Grigori Alexandrovich Machtet wrote Zaklyatiy kazak which may now also be considered Gothic br br The s saw the revival of the Gothic as a powerful literary form allied to fin de siecle which fictionalized contemporary fears like ethical degeneration and questioned the social structures of the time Classic works of this Urban Gothic include Robert Louis Stevenson s Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde Oscar Wilde s The Picture of Dorian Gray George du Maurier s Trilby Richard Marsh s The Beetle Henry James The Turn of the Screw and the stories of Arthur Machen br In Ireland Gothic fiction tended to be purveyed by the Anglo Irish Protestant Ascendancy According to literary critic Terry Eagleton Charles Maturin Sheridan Le Fanu and Bram Stoker form the core of the Irish Gothic subgenre with stories featuring castles set in a barren landscape and a cast of remote aristocrats dominating an atavistic peasantry which represent an allegorical form the political plight of Catholic Ireland subjected to the Protestant Ascendancy Le Fanu s use of the gloomy villain forbidding mansion and persecuted heroine in Uncle Silas shows direct influence from Walpole s Otranto and Radcliffe s Udolpho Le Fanu s short story collection In a Glass Darkly includes the superlative vampire tale Carmilla which provided fresh blood for that particular strand of the Gothic and influenced Bram Stoker s vampire novel Dracula Stoker s book created the most famous Gothic villain ever Count Dracula and established Transylvania and Eastern Europe as the locus classicus of the Gothic Published in the same year as Dracula Florence Marryat s The Blood of the Vampire is another piece of vampire fiction The Blood of the Vampire which like Carmilla features a female vampire is notable for its treatment of vampirism as both racial and medicalized The vampire Harriet Brandt is also a psychic vampire killing unintentionally br In the United States notable late th century writers in the Gothic tradition were Ambrose Bierce Robert W Chambers and Edith Wharton Bierce s short stories were in the horrific and pessimistic tradition of Poe Chambers indulged in the decadent style of Wilde and Machen even including a character named Wilde in his The King in Yellow Wharton published some notable Gothic ghost stories Some works of the Canadian writer Gilbert Parker also fall into the genre including the stories in The Lane that had No Turning br br The serialized novel The Phantom of the Opera by the French writer Gaston Leroux is another well known example of Gothic fiction from the early th century when many German authors were writing works influenced by Schauerroman including Hanns Heinz Ewers br br Until the s Russian Gothic critics did not view Russian Gothic as a genre or label If used the word gothic was used to describe mostly early works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky from the s Most critics used tags such as Romanticism and fantastique such as in the story collection translated into English as Russian th Century Gothic Tales but originally titled literally The Fantastic World of Russian Romanticism Short Story Novella However since the mid s Russian gothic fiction as a genre began to be discussed in books such as The Gothic Fantastic in Nineteenth Century Russian Literature European Gothic A Spirited Exchange The Russian Gothic Novel and its British Antecedents and Goticheskiy roman v Rossii The Gothic Novel in Russia br The first Russian author whose work has been described as gothic fiction is considered to be Nikolay Mikhailovich Karamzin While many of his works feature gothic elements the first to belong purely under the gothic fiction label is Ostrov Borngolm Island of Bornholm from Nearly ten years later Nikolay Ivanovich Gnedich followed suit with his novel Don Corrado de Gerrera set in Spain during the reign of Philip II The term Gothic is sometimes also used to describe the ballads of Russian authors such as Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky particularly Ludmila and Svetlana both translations based on Gottfreid August Burger s Gothic German ballad Lenore br During the last years of Imperial Russia in the early th century many authors continued to write in the Gothic fiction genre They include the historian and historical fiction writer Alexander Valentinovich Amfiteatrov and Leonid Nikolaievich Andreyev who developed psychological characterization the symbolist Valery Yakovlevich Bryusov Alexander Grin Anton Pavlovich Chekhov and Aleksandr Ivanovich Kuprin Nobel Prize winner Ivan Alekseyevich Bunin wrote Dry Valley which is seen as influenced by Gothic literature In a monograph on the subject Muireann Maguire writes The centrality of the Gothic fantastic to Russian fiction is almost impossible to exaggerate and certainly exceptional in the context of world literature br br Gothic fiction and Modernism influenced each other This is often evident in detective fiction horror fiction and science fiction but the influence of the Gothic can also be seen in the high literary Modernism of the th century Oscar Wilde s The Picture of Dorian Gray initiated a re working of older literary forms and myths that became common in the work of W B Yeats T S Eliot James Joyce Virginia Woolf Shirley Jackson and Angela Carter among others In Joyce s Ulysses the living are transformed into ghosts which points to an Ireland in stasis at the time and a history of cyclical trauma from the Great Famine in the s through to the current moment in the text The way Ulysses uses Gothic tropes such as ghosts and hauntings while removing the supernatural elements of th century Gothic fiction indicates a general form of modernist Gothic writing in the first half of the th century br br In America pulp magazines such as Weird Tales reprinted classic Gothic horror tales from the previous century by authors like Poe Arthur Conan Doyle and Edward Bulwer Lytton and printed new stories by modern authors featuring both traditional and new horrors The most significant of these was H P Lovecraft who also wrote a conspectus of the Gothic and supernatural horror tradition in his Supernatural Horror in Literature and developed a Mythos that would influence Gothic and contemporary horror well into the st century Lovecraft s prot g Robert Bloch contributed to Weird Tales and penned Psycho which drew on the classic interests of the genre From these the Gothic genre per se gave way to modern horror fiction regarded by some literary critics as a branch of the Gothic although others use the term to cover the entire genre br The Romantic strand of Gothic was taken up in Daphne du Maurier s Rebecca which is seen by some to have been influenced by Charlotte Bront s Jane Eyre Other books by du Maurier such as Jamaica Inn also display Gothic tendencies Du Maurier s work inspired a substantial body of female Gothics concerning heroines alternately swooning over or terrified by scowling Byronic men in possession of acres of prime real estate and the appertaining droit du seigneur br br The genre also influenced American writing creating a Southern Gothic genre that combines some Gothic sensibilities such as the grotesque with the setting and style of the Southern United States Examples include Erskine Caldwell William Faulkner Carson McCullers John Kennedy Toole Manly Wade Wellman Eudora Welty V C Andrews Tennessee Williams Truman Capote Flannery O Connor Davis Grubb Anne Rice Harper Lee and Cormac McCarthy br br Mass produced Gothic romances became popular in the s s and s with authors such as Phyllis A Whitney Joan Aiken Dorothy Eden Victoria Holt

Clarissa Ross and Marilyn Ross were pseudonyms of the male Dan Ross Frank Belknap Long published Gothics under his wife s name Lyda Belknap Long the British writer Peter O Donnell wrote under the pseudonym Madeleine Brent After the gothic romance boom faded away in the early s very few publishers embraced the term for mass market romance paperbacks apart from imprints like Love Spell which was discontinued in However in recent years the term Gothic Romance is being used to describe both old and new works of Gothic fiction br br Gothic fiction continues to be extensively practised by contemporary authors br Many modern writers of horror or other types of fiction exhibit considerable Gothic sensibilities examples include Anne Rice Susan Hill Billy Martin Silvia Moreno Garcia Carmen Maria Machado Neil Gaiman and Stephen King Thomas M Disch s novel The Priest was subtitled A Gothic Romance and partly modeled on Matthew Lewis The Monk Many writers such as Billy Martin Stephen King Brett Easton Ellis and Clive Barker have focused on the body s surface and blood s visuality England s Rhiannon Ward is among the recent writers of Gothic fiction Catriona Ward won a British Fantasy Award for Best Horror Novel for her gothic novel Rawblood in br Contemporary American writers in the tradition include Joyce Carol Oates with such novels as Bellefleur and A Bloodsmoor Romance Toni Morrison with her radical novel Beloved about a slave woman whose murdered baby haunts her Raymond Kennedy with his novel Lulu Incognito Donna Tartt with her postmodern gothic horror novel The Secret

The Distant Hours and The House at Riverton br Southern Ontario Gothic applies a similar sensibility to a Canadian cultural context Robertson Davies Alice Munro Barbara Gowdy Timothy Findley and Margaret Atwood have all produced notable exemplars of this form Another writer in the tradition was Henry Farrell best known for his Hollywood horror novel What Ever Happened To Baby Jane Farrell s

published in The Williams Record The album recognized as initiating the goth music genre is Unknown Pleasures by the band Joy Division However earlier bands such as The Velvet Underground also
