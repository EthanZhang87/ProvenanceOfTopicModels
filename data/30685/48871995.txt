William Thompson Kirkpatrick January March was an Irish teacher and grammar school headmaster He is best known for having been the tutor of the two Lewis brothers from Belfast Warnie Lewis and C S Lewis C S Lewis who would later become well known as a literary critic novelist and Christian apologist lived as a resident pupil with Kirkpatrick from In his autobiography Lewis reports that he was significantly influenced by his tutor br br br Biography br br br Headmaster of Lurgan br Kirkpatrick was born to an agricultural family in at Boardmills County Down He was educated at Queen s College Belfast in At first following an ambition to be called into the Presbyterian ministry Kirkpatrick followed up his college studies with three years of theological training at Assembly s College Belfast the standard place of instruction for ordination into this denomination in Ireland He also became a grammar school teacher at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution He was licensed by Assembly s in Instead of accepting a call to a pulpit however he continued to teach Kirkpatrick s biographer Ian Wilson believes that Kirkpatrick quickly developed a strong reputation for aggressive teaching leadership at any rate in late the young Inst teacher put in his name as the prospective headmaster of the newly established County Armagh grammar school Lurgan College After a three year delay Kirkpatrick was taken on in January as the young College s year old headmaster br Lurgan at the start of had only pupils The College trustees asked their selectee to take steps to ensure the long term survival of the College Kirkpatrick aggressively recruited day boys and boarding pupils and enrolment increased to in Kirkpatrick was helped in his responsibilities starting with his marriage in July by his wife Louisa Smyth br At full size the College was able to support a Headmaster couple two Assistant Masters and a steward The staff and Headmaster shared out teaching responsibilities which centred on drilling the pupils in Latin Greek modern languages and mathematics in preparation for university Despite its small size Lurgan came to be seen as an Irish grammar school of the first rank and its pupils collected more than their numerical share of the honours and prizes distributed to Irish students in those days One of the College s students was the future Belfast solicitor Albert Lewis who studied there in br In Kirkpatrick abruptly departed from Lurgan College Surviving correspondence indicates that the parting was on less than friendly terms At some point around this time Kirkpatrick who had operated the College on explicitly Christian lines appears to have ceased to profess his faith He and Louisa moved first to Cheshire and then to Great Bookham in Surrey to carry on a new life as a gentleman householder who carried out private one to one tutoring of fee paying pupils br br br Tutor at Great Bookham br Kirkpatrick s biographer believes that the independent educator never tutored more than one or two young men at a time The Belfast solicitor Albert Lewis retained fond memories of his year at Lurgan but chose an Anglo Irish pathway for his sons and had sent them successively to Malvern College in Worcestershire Upon learning first in and then in that older brother Warnie and younger brother Jack were not doing well in public school Mr Lewis learned that a place was available at the Kirkpatrick home br Warnie Lewis who had not performed well academically at Malvern was intensively tutored in for a place at Sandhurst in line with the older son s ambition of joining the British colours These efforts were successful and he was entered into the British army establishment just before the start of World War I Warnie s departure from Great Bookham in opened a place for C S Jack Lewis who could in no sense have been considered an academic failure at Malvern but who had not fit in with that College s culture at the time Kirkpatrick who appears to have been baulked by the demands of his Headmastership and then by his private tutoring responsibilities from carrying out an ideal tutorial regime chose to subject the younger Lewis to an unusually intense course of study that combined the so called Great Books with philosophy of all ages up to the present Part of his goal which he shared with Jack s fee paying father Albert was to help start the likely lad on a course that would create a significant scholar of the th century The other part of this goal which was conveyed only to Jack was that his scholarly work would in no sense be Christian By this time the Kirkpatrick C S Lewis saw had become a stern ex Calvinistic rationalist of the old high and dry nineteenth century type with a strong bent toward formal logic and he sought to transmit this worldview to his pupil At the time Lewis completely agreed with this position and goal br Lewis s autobiography Surprised by Joy conveys rueful comments to indicate the author s disbelief that a good faith reader could understand his delight at the intellectual training provided by the Kirkpatrick tutorship Lewis by this time had begun to grasp his own potential powers and realized both at the time and later that a period of intense dialectical training such as had been provided by Kirkpatrick had been necessary to nurture them This was his summary of the intensity of Kirkpatrick s influence br br My debt to him is very great my reverence to this day undiminished br In Lewis sat for a scholarship place at University College Oxford and was accepted He returned to Kirkpatrick in the winter term to study mathematics in preparation for undergraduate life Retiring from the profession of tutoring Kirkpatrick remained at Great Bookham He died in March age leaving behind his widow Louisa and a single son Louis Kirkpatrick an electrical engineer His estate was probated at over a substantial sum for the time br br br
