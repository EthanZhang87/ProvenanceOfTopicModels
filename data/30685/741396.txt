Unfinished Tales of The Chronicles of Narnia br Lewis himself stated that br br The books don t tell us what happened to Susan She is left alive in this world at the end having by then turned into a rather silly conceited young woman But there s plenty of time for her to mend and perhaps she will get to Aslan s country in the end in her own way br Lewis further elaborated on Susan s fate in a February letter to Pauline Bannister who wrote to Lewis upset that Susan was excluded from her brothers and sister from Aslan s country He stated br br I could not write that story myself Not that I have no hope of Susan s ever getting to Aslan s country but because I have a feeling that the story of her journey would be longer and more like a grown up novel than I wanted to write But I may be mistaken Why not try it yourself br br br Criticism br Fantasy author Neil Gaiman s short story The Problem of Susan depicts its protagonist Professor Hastings who strongly resembles an adult version of Susan dealing with the grief and trauma of her entire family s death in a train crash as she is interviewed by a college literature student regarding her opinion on Susan s place in the Narnia books Since the publication of Gaiman s story the problem of Susan has become used more widely as a catchphrase for the literary and feminist investigation into Susan s treatment br Authors J K Rowling and Philip Pullman both of whom were influenced by Lewis have also commented on the issue br br There comes a point where Susan who was the older girl is lost to Narnia because she becomes interested in lipstick She s become irreligious basically because she found sex I have a big problem with that br I just don t like the conclusions Lewis comes to after all that analysis the way he shuts children out from heaven or whatever it is on the grounds that the one girl is interested in boys She s a teenager Ah it s terrible Sex can t have that br br br Portrayals br In the six part BBC
