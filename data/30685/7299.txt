id: 7299
Colonialism is the pursuing establishing and maintaining of control and exploitation of people and of resources by a foreign group Colonizers monopolize political power and hold conquered societies and their people to be inferior to their conquerors in legal administrative social cultural or biological terms While frequently advanced as an imperialist regime colonialism can also take the form of settler colonialism whereby colonial settlers invade and occupy territory to permanently replace an existing society with that of the colonizers possibly towards a genocide of native populations br Colonialism developed as a concept describing European colonial empires of the modern era which spread globally from the th century to the mid th century spanning of Earth s land by and peaking at by the beginning of World War I European colonialism employed mercantilism and chartered companies and established coloniality which keeps the colonized socio economically othered and subaltern through modern biopolitics of sexuality gender race disability and class among others resulting in intersectional violence and discrimination Colonialism has been justified with beliefs of having a civilizing mission to cultivate land and life based on beliefs of entitlement and superiority historically often rooted in the belief of a Christian mission br Because of this broad impact different instances of colonialism have been identified from around the world and in history starting with when colonization was developed by developing colonies and metropoles the base colonial separation and characteristic br Decolonization which started in the th century gradually in waves led to the independence of colonies with a particular large wave of decolonizations happening in the aftermath of World War II between and Colonialism has a persistent impact on a wide range of modern outcomes as scholars have shown that variations in colonial institutions can account for variations in economic development regime types and state capacity Some academics have used the term neocolonialism to describe the continuation or imposition of elements of colonial rule through indirect means in the contemporary period br br br Etymology br br Colonialism is etymologically rooted in the Latin word Colonus which was used to describe tenant farmers in the Roman Empire The coloni sharecroppers started as tenants of landlords but as the system evolved they became permanently indebted to the landowner and trapped in servitude br br br Definitions br br The earliest uses of colonialism referred to plantations that men emigrated to and settled The term expanded its meaning in the early th century to primarily refer to European imperial expansion and the imperial subjection of Asian and African peoples br Collins English Dictionary defines colonialism as the practice by which a powerful country directly controls less powerful countries and uses their resources to increase its own power and wealth Webster s Encyclopedic Dictionary defines colonialism as the system or policy of a nation seeking to extend or retain its authority over other people or territories The Merriam Webster Dictionary offers four definitions including something characteristic of a colony and control by one power over a dependent area or people br The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy uses the term to describe the process of European settlement and political control over the rest of the world including the Americas Australia and parts of Africa and Asia It discusses the distinction between colonialism imperialism and conquest and states that t he difficulty of defining colonialism stems from the fact that the term is often used as a synonym for imperialism Both colonialism and imperialism were forms of conquest that were expected to benefit Europe economically and strategically and continues given the difficulty of consistently distinguishing between the two terms this entry will use colonialism broadly to refer to the project of European political domination from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries that ended with the national liberation movements of the s br In his preface to J rgen Osterhammel s Colonialism A Theoretical Overview Roger Tignor says For Osterhammel the essence of colonialism is the existence of colonies which are by definition governed differently from other territories such as protectorates or informal spheres of influence In the book Osterhammel asks How can colonialism be defined independently from colony He settles on a three sentence definition br br Colonialism is a relationship between an indigenous or forcibly imported majority and a minority of foreign invaders The fundamental decisions affecting the lives of the colonised people are made and implemented by the colonial rulers in pursuit of interests that are often defined in a distant metropolis Rejecting cultural compromises with the colonised population the colonisers are convinced of their own superiority and their ordained mandate to rule br According to Julian Go Colonialism refers to the direct political control of a society and its people by a foreign ruling state The ruling state monopolizes political power and keeps the subordinated society and its people in a legally inferior position He also writes colonialism depends first and foremost upon the declaration of sovereignty and or territorial seizure by a core state over another territory and its inhabitants who are classified as inferior subjects rather than equal citizens br According to David Strang decolonization is achieved through the attainment of sovereign statehood with de jure recognition by the international community or through full incorporation into an existing sovereign state br br br Types of colonialism br br The Times once quipped that there were three types of colonial empire The English which consists in making colonies with colonists the German which collects colonists without colonies the French which sets up colonies without colonists Modern studies of colonialism have often distinguished between various overlapping categories of colonialism broadly classified into four types settler colonialism exploitation colonialism surrogate colonialism and internal colonialism Some historians have identified other forms of colonialism including national and trade forms br br Settler colonialism involves large scale immigration by settlers to colonies often motivated by religious political or economic reasons This form of colonialism aims largely to supplant prior existing populations with a settler one and involves large number of settlers emigrating to colonies for the purpose of establishing settlements Argentina Australia Brazil Canada Chile China New Zealand Russia South Africa United States Uruguay and controversially Israel are examples of nations created or expanded in their contemporary form by settler colonization br Exploitation colonialism involves fewer colonists and focuses on the exploitation of natural resources or labour to the benefit of the metropole This form consists of trading posts as well as larger colonies where colonists would constitute much of the political and economic administration The European colonization of Africa and Asia was largely conducted under the auspices of exploitation colonialism br Surrogate colonialism involves a settlement project supported by a colonial power in which most of the settlers do not come from the same ethnic group as the ruling power as it has been controversially argued was the case of Mandatory Palestine and the Colony of Liberia br Internal colonialism is a notion of uneven structural power between areas of a state The source of exploitation comes from within the state This is demonstrated in the way control and exploitation may pass from people from the colonizing country to an immigrant population within a newly independent country br National colonialism is a process involving elements of both settler and internal colonialism in which nation building and colonization are symbiotically connected with the colonial regime seeking to remake the colonized peoples into their own cultural and political image The goal is to integrate them into the state but only as reflections of the state s preferred culture The Republic of China in Taiwan is the archetypal example of a national colonialist society br Trade colonialism involves the undertaking of colonialist ventures in support of trade opportunities for merchants This form of colonialism was most prominent in th century Asia where previously isolationist states were forced to open their ports to Western powers Examples of this include the Opium Wars and the opening of Japan br br br Socio cultural evolution br br When colonists settled in pre populated areas the societies and cultures of the people in those areas permanently changed Colonial practices directly and indirectly forced the colonized peoples to abandon their traditional cultures For example European colonizers in the United States implemented the residential schools program to force native children to assimilate into the hegemonic culture br Cultural colonialism gave rise to culturally and ethnically mixed populations such as the mestizos of the Americas as well as racially divided populations such as those found in French Algeria or in Southern Rhodesia In fact everywhere where colonial powers established a consistent and continued presence hybrid communities existed br Notable examples in Asia include the Anglo Burmese Anglo Indian Burgher Eurasian Singaporean Filipino mestizo Kristang and Macanese peoples In the Dutch East Indies later Indonesia the vast majority of Dutch settlers were in fact Eurasians known as Indo Europeans formally belonging to the European legal class in the colony br br br History br br br Antiquity br Activity that could be called colonialism has a long history starting at least as early as the ancient Egyptians Phoenicians Greeks and Romans founded colonies in antiquity Phoenicia had an enterprising maritime trading culture that spread across the Mediterranean from BC to BC later the Persian Empire and various Greek city states continued on this line of setting up colonies The Romans would soon follow setting up coloniae throughout the Mediterranean in North Africa and in Western Asia br br br Medieval br Beginning in the th century Arabs colonized a substantial portion of the Middle East North Africa and parts of Asia and Europe From the th century Vikings Norsemen such as Leif Erikson established colonies in Britain Ireland Iceland Greenland North America present day Russia and Ukraine France Normandy and Sicily In the th century a new wave of Mediterranean colonisation began with competitors such as the Venetians Genovese and Amalfians infiltrating the wealthy previously Byzantine or Eastern Roman islands and lands European Crusaders set up colonial regimes in Outremer in the Levant and in the Baltic littoral th century onwards Venice began to dominate Dalmatia and reached its greatest nominal colonial extent at the conclusion of the Fourth Crusade in with the declaration of the acquisition of three octaves of the Byzantine Empire br br br Modern br br The European early modern period began with the Turkish colonization of Anatolia After the Ottoman Empire colonialised Constantinople in the sea routes discovered by Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator became central to trade and helped fuel the Age of Discovery br The Crown of Castile encountered the Americas in through sea travel and built trading posts or conquered large extents of land The Treaty of Tordesillas divided the areas of these new lands between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire in br The th century saw the birth of the Dutch Empire and French colonial empire as well as the English overseas possessions which later became the British Empire It also saw the establishment of Danish overseas colonies and Swedish overseas colonies br A first wave of separatism started with the American Revolutionary War initiating the Rise of the Second British Empire The Spanish Empire largely collapsed in the Americas with the Spanish American wars of independence Empire builders established several new colonies after this time including in the German colonial empire and Belgian colonial empire Starting with the end of the French Revolution European authors such as Johann Gottfried Herder August von Kotzebue and Heinrich von Kleist prolifically published so as to conjure up sympathy for the oppressed native peoples and the slaves of the new world thereby starting the idealization of native humans br br The Habsburg monarchy the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire existed at the same time but did not expand over oceans Rather these empires expanded through the conquest of neighbouring territories There was though some Russian colonization of North America across the Bering Strait From the s onwards the Empire of Japan modelled itself on European colonial empires and expanded its territories in the Pacific and on the Asian mainland The Empire of Brazil fought for hegemony in South America The United States gained overseas territories after the Spanish American War hence the coining of the term American imperialism br In the late th century many European powers became involved in the Scramble for Africa br br br th century br br The world s colonial population at the outbreak of the First World War a high point for colonialism totalled about million people of whom lived in British possessions in French possessions in Dutch possessions in Japanese possessions in German possessions in American possessions in Portuguese possessions in Belgian possessions and in Italian possessions The domestic domains of the colonial powers had a total population of about million people Outside Europe few areas had remained without coming under formal colonial tutorship and even Siam China Japan Nepal Afghanistan Persia and Abyssinia had felt varying degrees of Western colonial style influence concessions unequal treaties extraterritoriality and the like br Asking whether colonies paid economic historian Grover Clark argues an emphatic No He reports that in every case the support cost especially the military system necessary to support and defend colonies outran the total trade they produced Apart from the British Empire they did not provide favoured destinations for the immigration of surplus metropole populations The question of whether colonies paid is a complicated one when recognizing the multiplicity of interests involved In some cases colonial powers paid a lot in military costs while private investors pocketed the benefits In other cases the colonial powers managed to move the burden of administrative costs to the colonies themselves by imposing taxes br br After World War I the victorious Allies divided up the German colonial empire and much of the Ottoman Empire between themselves as League of Nations mandates grouping these territories into three classes according to how quickly it was deemed that they could prepare for independence The empires of Russia and Austria collapsed in and the Soviet empire started Nazi Germany set up short lived colonial systems Reichskommissariate Generalgouvernement in Eastern Europe in the early s br In the aftermath of World War II decolonisation progressed rapidly The tumultuous upheaval of the war significantly weakened the major colonial powers and they quickly lost control of colonies such as Singapore India and Libya In addition the United Nations shows support for decolonisation in its charter In the UN issued the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples which affirmed its stance though notably colonial empires such as France Spain the United Kingdom and the United States abstained br The word neocolonialism originated from Jean Paul Sartre in to refer to a variety of contexts since the decolonisation that took place after World War II Generally it does not refer to a type of direct colonisation rather to colonialism or colonial style exploitation by other means Specifically neocolonialism may refer to the theory that former or existing economic relationships such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Central American Free Trade Agreement or the operations of companies such as Royal Dutch Shell in Nigeria and Brunei fostered by former colonial powers were or are used to maintain control of former colonies and dependencies after the colonial independence movements of the post World War II period br The term neocolonialism became popular in ex colonies in the late th century br br br Contemporary br While colonies of contiguous empires have been historically excluded they can be seen as colonies br Contemporary expansion of colonies is seen by some in case of Russian imperialism and Chinese imperialism There is also ongoing debate in academia about Zionism as settler colonialism br br br Impact br br The impacts of colonisation are immense and pervasive Various effects both immediate and protracted include the spread of virulent diseases unequal social relations detribalization exploitation enslavement medical advances the creation of new institutions abolitionism improved infrastructure and technological progress Colonial practices also spur the spread of conquerors languages literature and cultural institutions while endangering or obliterating those of Indigenous peoples The cultures of the colonised peoples can also have a powerful influence on the imperial country br With respect to international borders Britain and France traced close to of the entire length of the world s international boundaries br br br Economy trade and commerce br Economic expansion sometimes described as the colonial surplus has accompanied imperial expansion since ancient times Greek trade networks spread throughout the Mediterranean region while Roman trade expanded with the primary goal of directing tribute from the colonised areas towards the Roman metropole According to Strabo by the time of emperor Augustus up to Roman ships would set sail every year from Myos Hormos in Roman Egypt to India With the development of trade routes under the Ottoman Empire br br Gujari Hindus Syrian Muslims Jews Armenians Christians from south and central Europe operated trading routes that supplied Persian and Arab horses to the armies of all three empires Mocha coffee to Delhi and Belgrade Persian silk to India and Istanbul br br Aztec civilisation developed into an extensive empire that much like the Roman Empire had the goal of exacting tribute from the conquered colonial areas For the Aztecs a significant tribute was the acquisition of sacrificial victims for their religious rituals br On the other hand European colonial empires sometimes attempted to channel restrict and impede trade involving their colonies funneling activity through the metropole and taxing accordingly br Despite the general trend of economic expansion the economic performance of former European colonies varies significantly In Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long run Growth economists Daron Acemoglu Simon Johnson and James A Robinson compare the economic influences of the European colonists on different colonies and study what could explain the huge discrepancies in previous European colonies for example between West African colonies like Sierra Leone and Hong Kong and Singapore br According to the paper economic institutions are the determinant of the colonial success because they determine their financial performance and order for the distribution of resources At the same time these institutions are also consequences of political institutions especially how de facto and de jure political power is allocated To explain the different colonial cases we thus need to look first into the political institutions that shaped the economic institutions br br For example one interesting observation is the Reversal of Fortune the less developed civilisations in like North America Australia and New Zealand are now much richer than those countries who used to be in the prosperous civilisations in before the colonists came like the Mughals in India and the Incas in the Americas One explanation offered by the paper focuses on the political institutions of the various colonies it was less likely for European colonists to introduce economic institutions where they could benefit quickly from the extraction of resources in the area Therefore given a more developed civilisation and denser population European colonists would rather keep the existing economic systems than introduce an entirely new system while in places with little to extract European colonists would rather establish new economic institutions to protect their interests Political institutions thus gave rise to different types of economic systems which determined the colonial economic performance br European colonisation and development also changed gendered systems of power already in place around the world In many pre colonialist areas women maintained power prestige or authority through reproductive or agricultural control For example in certain parts of sub Saharan Africa women maintained farmland in which they had usage rights While men would make political and communal decisions for a community the women would control the village s food supply or their individual family s land This allowed women to achieve power and autonomy even in patrilineal and patriarchal societies br Through the rise of European colonialism came a large push for development and industrialisation of most economic systems When working to improve productivity Europeans focused mostly on male workers Foreign aid arrived in the form of loans land credit and tools to speed up development but were only allocated to men In a more European fashion women were expected to serve on a more domestic level The result was a technologic economic and class based gender gap that widened over time br Within a colony the presence of extractive colonial institutions in a given area has been found have effects on the modern day economic development institutions and infrastructure of these areas br br br Slavery and indentured servitude br br European nations entered their imperial projects with the goal of enriching the European metropoles Exploitation of non Europeans and of other Europeans to support imperial goals was acceptable to the colonisers Two outgrowths of this imperial agenda were the extension of slavery and indentured servitude In the th century nearly two thirds of English settlers came to North America as indentured servants br European slave traders brought large numbers of African slaves to the Americas by sail Spain and Portugal had brought African slaves to work in African colonies such as Cape Verde and S o Tom and Pr ncipe and then in Latin America by the th century The British French and Dutch joined in the slave trade in subsequent centuries The European colonial system took approximately million Africans to the Caribbean and to North and South America as slaves br br Abolitionists in Europe and Americas protested the inhumane treatment of African slaves which led to the elimination of the slave trade and later of most forms of slavery by the late th century One disputed school of thought points to the role of abolitionism in the American Revolution while the British colonial metropole started to move towards outlawing slavery slave owning elites in the Thirteen Colonies saw this as one of the reasons to fight for their post colonial independence and for the right to develop and continue a largely slave based economy br British colonising activity in New Zealand from the early th century played a part in ending slave taking and slave keeping among the indigenous M ori br On the other hand British colonial administration in Southern Africa when it officially abolished slavery in the s caused rifts in society which arguably perpetuated slavery in the Boer Republics and fed into the philosophy of apartheid br br The labour shortages that resulted from abolition inspired European colonisers in Queensland British Guaiana and Fiji for example to develop new sources of labour re adopting a system of indentured servitude Indentured servants consented to a contract with the European colonisers Under their contract the servant would work for an employer for a term of at least a year while the employer agreed to pay for the servant s voyage to the colony possibly pay for the return to the country of origin and pay the employee a wage as well The employees became indentured to the employer because they owed a debt back to the employer for their travel expense to the colony which they were expected to pay through their wages In practice indentured servants were exploited through terrible working conditions and burdensome debts imposed by the employers with whom the servants had no means of negotiating the debt once they arrived in the colony br India and China were the largest source of indentured servants during the colonial era Indentured servants from India travelled to British colonies in Asia Africa and the Caribbean and also to French and Portuguese colonies while Chinese servants travelled to British and Dutch colonies Between and around million indentured servants migrated from India and million returned to India China sent more indentured servants to European colonies and around the same proportion returned to China br Following the Scramble for Africa an early but secondary focus for most colonial regimes was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade By the end of the colonial period they were mostly successful in this aim though slavery persists in Africa and in the world at large with much the same practices of de facto servility despite legislative prohibition br br br Military innovation br br Conquering forces have throughout history applied innovation in order to gain an advantage over the armies of the people they aim to conquer Greeks developed the phalanx system which enabled their military units to present themselves to their enemies as a wall with foot soldiers using shields to cover one another during their advance on the battlefield Under Philip II of Macedon they were able to organise thousands of soldiers into a formidable battle force bringing together carefully trained infantry and cavalry regiments Alexander the Great exploited this military foundation further during his conquests br The Spanish Empire held a major advantage over Mesoamerican warriors through the use of weapons made of stronger metal predominantly iron which was able to shatter the blades of axes used by the Aztec civilisation and others The use of gunpowder weapons cemented the European military advantage over the peoples they sought to subjugate in the Americas and elsewhere br br br End of empire br br The populations of some colonial territories such as Canada enjoyed relative peace and prosperity as part of a European power at least among the majority Minority populations such as First Nations peoples and French Canadians experienced marginalisation and resented colonial practices Francophone residents of Quebec for example were vocal in opposing conscription into the armed services to fight on behalf of Britain during World War I resulting in the Conscription crisis of Other European colonies had much more pronounced conflict between European settlers and the local population Rebellions broke out in the later decades of the imperial era such as India s Sepoy Rebellion of br The territorial boundaries imposed by European colonisers notably in central Africa and South Asia defied the existing boundaries of native populations that had previously interacted little with one another European colonisers disregarded native political and cultural animosities imposing peace upon people under their military control Native populations were often relocated at the will of the colonial administrators br The Partition of British India in August led to the Independence of India and the creation of Pakistan These events also caused much bloodshed at the time of the migration of immigrants from the two countries Muslims from India and Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan migrated to the respective countries they sought independence for br br br Post independence population movement br br In a reversal of the migration patterns experienced during the modern colonial era post independence era migration followed a route back towards the imperial country In some cases this was a movement of settlers of European origin returning to the land of their birth or to an ancestral birthplace French colonists known as the Pied Noirs resettled in France following Algeria s independence in A significant number of these migrants were also of Algerian descent people of Portuguese origin migrated to Portugal after the independence of former colonies in Africa between and settlers of Dutch origin migrated to the Netherlands from the Dutch West Indies after Dutch military control of the colony ended br After WWII Dutchmen from the Dutch East Indies of which the majority were people of Eurasian descent called Indo Europeans repatriated to the Netherlands A significant number later migrated to the US Canada Australia and New Zealand br Global travel and migration in general developed at an increasingly brisk pace throughout the era of European colonial expansion Citizens of the former colonies of European countries may have a privileged status in some respects with regard to immigration rights when settling in the former European imperial nation For example rights to dual citizenship may be generous or larger immigrant quotas may be extended to former colonies br In some cases the former European imperial nations continue to foster close political and economic ties with former colonies The Commonwealth of Nations is an organisation that promotes cooperation between and among Britain and its former colonies the Commonwealth members A similar organisation exists for former colonies of France the Francophonie the Community of Portuguese Language Countries plays a similar role for former Portuguese colonies and the Dutch Language Union is the equivalent for former colonies of the Netherlands br Migration from former colonies has proven to be problematic for European countries where the majority population may express hostility to ethnic minorities who have immigrated from former colonies Cultural and religious conflict have often erupted in France in recent decades between immigrants from the Maghreb countries of north Africa and the majority population of France Nonetheless immigration has changed the ethnic composition of France by the s of the total population of inner Paris and of the metropolitan region were of foreign origin mainly Algerian br br br Introduced diseases br br Encounters between explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced new diseases which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence For example smallpox measles malaria yellow fever and others were unknown in pre Columbian America br Half the native population of Hispaniola in was killed by smallpox Smallpox also ravaged Mexico in the s killing in Tenochtitlan alone including the emperor and Peru in the s aiding the European conquerors Measles killed a further two million Mexican natives in the th century In smallpox wiped out of the Massachusetts Bay Native Americans Smallpox epidemics in and brought devastation and drastic depopulation among the Plains Indians Some believe that the death of up to of the Native American population of the New World was caused by Old World diseases Over the centuries the Europeans had developed high degrees of immunity to these diseases while the indigenous peoples had no time to build such immunity br Smallpox decimated the native population of Australia killing around of indigenous Australians in the early years of British colonisation It also killed many New Zealand M ori As late as as many as out of Hawaiians are estimated to have died of measles whooping cough and influenza Introduced diseases notably smallpox nearly wiped out the native population of Easter Island In measles killed over Fijians approximately one third of the population The Ainu population decreased drastically in the th century due in large part br to infectious diseases brought by Japanese settlers pouring into Hokkaido br Conversely researchers have hypothesised that a precursor to syphilis may have been carried from the New World to Europe after Columbus s voyages The findings suggested Europeans could have carried the nonvenereal tropical bacteria home where the organisms may have mutated into a more deadly form in the different conditions of Europe The disease was more frequently fatal than it is today syphilis was a major killer in Europe during the Renaissance The first cholera pandemic began in Bengal then spread across India by Ten thousand British troops and countless Indians died during this pandemic Between and only some of East India Company s officers survived to take the final voyage home Waldemar Haffkine who mainly worked in India who developed and used vaccines against cholera and bubonic plague in the s is considered the first microbiologist br According to a study by J rg Baten and Laura Maravall on the anthropometric influence of colonialism on Africans the average height of Africans decreased by centimetres upon colonization and later recovered and increased overall during colonial rule The authors attributed the decrease to diseases such as malaria and sleeping sickness forced labor during the early decades of colonial rule conflicts land grabbing and widespread cattle deaths from the rinderpest viral disease br br br Countering disease br As early as the Spanish Crown organised a mission the Balmis expedition to transport the smallpox vaccine to the Spanish colonies and establish mass vaccination programs there By the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans Under the direction of Mountstuart Elphinstone a program was launched to propagate smallpox vaccination in India From the beginning of the th century onwards the elimination or control of disease in tropical countries became a driving force for all colonial powers The sleeping sickness epidemic in Africa was arrested due to mobile teams systematically screening millions of people at risk In the th century the world saw the biggest increase in its population in human history due to lessening of the mortality rate in many countries due to medical advances The world population has grown from billion in to over seven billion today br br br Botany br Colonial botany refers to the body of works concerning the study cultivation marketing and naming of the new plants that were acquired or traded during the age of European colonialism Notable examples of these plants included sugar nutmeg tobacco cloves cinnamon Peruvian bark peppers Sassafras albidum and tea This work was a large part of securing financing for colonial ambitions supporting European expansion and ensuring the profitability of such endeavors Vasco de Gama and Christopher Columbus were seeking to establish routes to trade spices dyes and silk from the Moluccas India and China by sea that would be independent of the established routes controlled by Venetian and Middle Eastern merchants Naturalists like Hendrik van Rheede Georg Eberhard Rumphius and Jacobus Bontius compiled data about eastern plants on behalf of the Europeans Though Sweden did not possess an extensive colonial network botanical research based on Carl Linnaeus identified and developed techniques to grow cinnamon tea and rice locally as an alternative to costly imports br br br Geography br br Settlers acted as the link between indigenous populations and the imperial hegemony thus bridging the geographical ideological and commercial gap between the colonisers and colonised While the extent in which geography as an academic study is implicated in colonialism is contentious geographical tools such as cartography shipbuilding navigation mining and agricultural productivity were instrumental in European colonial expansion Colonisers awareness of the Earth s surface and abundance of practical skills provided colonisers with a knowledge that in turn created power br Anne Godlewska and Neil Smith argue that empire was quintessentially a geographical project Historical geographical theories such as environmental determinism legitimised colonialism by positing the view that some parts of the world were underdeveloped which created notions of skewed evolution Geographers such as Ellen Churchill Semple and Ellsworth Huntington put forward the notion that northern climates bred vigour and intelligence as opposed to those indigenous to tropical climates See The Tropics viz a viz a combination of environmental determinism and Social Darwinism in their approach br Political geographers also maintain that colonial behaviour was reinforced by the physical mapping of the world therefore creating a visual separation between them and us Geographers are primarily focused on the spaces of colonialism and imperialism more specifically the material and symbolic appropriation of space enabling colonialism br br Maps played an extensive role in colonialism as Bassett would put it by providing geographical information in a convenient and standardised format cartographers helped open West Africa to European conquest commerce and colonisation Because the relationship between colonialism and geography was not scientifically objective cartography was often manipulated during the colonial era Social norms and values had an effect on the constructing of maps During colonialism map makers used rhetoric in their formation of boundaries and in their art The rhetoric favoured the view of the conquering Europeans this is evident in the fact that any map created by a non European was instantly regarded as inaccurate Furthermore European cartographers were required to follow a set of rules which led to ethnocentrism portraying one s own ethnicity in the centre of the map As J B Harley put it The steps in making a map selection omission simplification classification the creation of hierarchies and symbolisation are all inherently rhetorical br A common practice by the European cartographers of the time was to map unexplored areas as blank spaces This influenced the colonial powers as it sparked competition amongst them to explore and colonise these regions Imperialists aggressively and passionately looked forward to filling these spaces for the glory of their respective countries The Dictionary of Human Geography notes that cartography was used to empty undiscovered lands of their Indigenous meaning and bring them into spatial existence via the imposition of Western place names and borders therefore priming virgin putatively empty land wilderness for colonisation thus sexualising colonial landscapes as domains of male penetration reconfiguring alien space as absolute quantifiable and separable as property br br David Livingstone stresses that geography has meant different things at different times and in different places and that we should keep an open mind in regards to the relationship between geography and colonialism instead of identifying boundaries Geography as a discipline was not and is not an objective science Painter and Jeffrey argue rather it is based on assumptions about the physical world Comparison of exogeographical representations of ostensibly tropical environments in science fiction art support this conjecture finding the notion of the tropics to be an artificial collection of ideas and beliefs that are independent of geography br br br Ocean and space br br With contemporary advances in deep sea and outer space technologies colonization of the seabed and the Moon have become an object of non terrestrial colonialism br br br Versus imperialism br br br Marxism br Marxism views colonialism as a form of capitalism enforcing exploitation and social change Marx thought that working within the global capitalist system colonialism is closely associated with uneven development It is an instrument of wholesale destruction dependency and systematic exploitation producing distorted economies socio psychological disorientation massive poverty and neocolonial dependency Colonies are constructed into modes of production The search for raw materials and the current search for new investment opportunities is a result of inter capitalist rivalry for capital accumulation Lenin regarded colonialism as the root cause of imperialism as imperialism was distinguished by monopoly capitalism via colonialism and as Lyal S Sunga explains Vladimir Lenin advocated forcefully the principle of self determination of peoples in his Theses on the Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations to Self Determination as an integral plank in the programme of socialist internationalism and he quotes Lenin who contended that The right of nations to self determination implies exclusively the right to independence in the political sense the right to free political separation from the oppressor nation Specifically this demand for political democracy implies complete freedom to agitate for secession and for a referendum on secession by the seceding nation Non Russian Marxists within the RSFSR and later the USSR like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai meanwhile between and and then after considered the Soviet regime a renewed version of Russian imperialism and colonialism br br In his critique of colonialism in Africa the Guyanese historian and political activist Walter Rodney states The decisiveness of the short period of colonialism and its negative consequences for Africa spring mainly from the fact that Africa lost power Power is the ultimate determinant in human society being basic to the relations within any group and between groups It implies the ability to defend one s interests and if necessary to impose one s will by any means available When one society finds itself forced to relinquish power entirely to another society that in itself is a form of underdevelopment During the centuries of pre colonial trade some control over social political and economic life was retained in Africa in spite of the disadvantageous commerce with Europeans That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism Colonialism went much further than trade It meant a tendency towards direct appropriation by Europeans of the social institutions within Africa Africans ceased to set indigenous cultural goals and standards and lost full command of training young members of the society Those were undoubtedly major steps backwards Colonialism was not merely a system of exploitation but one whose essential purpose was to repatriate the profits to the so called mother country From an African view point that amounted to consistent expatriation of surplus produced by African labour out of African resources It meant the development of Europe as part of the same dialectical process in which Africa was underdeveloped Colonial Africa fell within that part of the international capitalist economy from which surplus was drawn to feed the metropolitan sector As seen earlier exploitation of land and labour is essential for human social advance but only on the assumption that the product is made available within the area where the exploitation takes place According to Lenin the new imperialism emphasised the transition of capitalism from free trade to a stage of monopoly capitalism to finance capital He states it is connected with the intensification of the struggle for the partition of the world As free trade thrives on exports of commodities monopoly capitalism thrived on the export of capital amassed by profits from banks and industry This to Lenin was the highest stage of capitalism He goes on to state that this form of capitalism was doomed for war between the capitalists and the exploited nations with the former inevitably losing War is stated to be the consequence of imperialism As a continuation of this thought G N Uzoigwe states But it is now clear from more serious investigations of African history in this period that imperialism was essentially economic in its fundamental impulses br br br Liberalism and capitalism br Classical liberals were generally in abstract opposition to colonialism and imperialism including Adam Smith Fr d ric Bastiat Richard Cobden John Bright Henry Richard Herbert Spencer H R Fox Bourne Edward Morel Josephine Butler W J Fox and William Ewart Gladstone Their philosophies found the colonial enterprise particularly mercantilism in opposition to the principles of free trade and liberal policies Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations that Britain should grant independence to all of its colonies and also argued that it would be economically beneficial for British people in the average although the merchants having mercantilist privileges would lose out br br br Race and gender br During the colonial era the global process of colonisation served to spread and synthesize the social and political belief systems of the mother countries which often included a belief in a certain natural racial superiority of the race of the mother country Colonialism also acted to reinforce these same racial belief systems within the mother countries themselves Usually also included within the colonial belief systems was a certain belief in the inherent superiority of male over female This particular belief was often pre existing amongst the pre colonial societies prior to their colonisation br Popular political practices of the time reinforced colonial rule by legitimising European and or Japanese male authority and also legitimising female and non mother country race inferiority through studies of craniology comparative anatomy and phrenology Biologists naturalists anthropologists and ethnologists of the th century were focused on the study of colonised indigenous women as in the case of Georges Cuvier s study of Sarah Baartman Such cases embraced a natural superiority and inferiority relationship between the races based on the observations of naturalists from the mother countries European studies along these lines gave rise to the perception that African women s anatomy and especially genitalia resembled those of mandrills baboons and monkeys thus differentiating colonised Africans from what were viewed as the features of the evolutionarily superior and thus rightfully authoritarian European woman br In addition to what would now be viewed as pseudo scientific studies of race which tended to reinforce a belief in an inherent mother country racial superiority a new supposedly science based ideology concerning gender roles also then emerged as an adjunct to the general body of beliefs of inherent superiority of the colonial era Female inferiority across all cultures was emerging as an idea supposedly supported by craniology that led scientists to argue that the typical brain size of the female human was on the average slightly smaller than that of the male thus inferring that therefore female humans must be less developed and less evolutionarily advanced than males This finding of relative cranial size difference was later attributed to the general typical size difference of the human male body versus that of the typical human female body br Within the former European colonies non Europeans and women sometimes faced invasive studies by the colonial powers in the interest of the then prevailing pro colonial scientific ideology of the day br br br Othering br Othering is the process of creating a separate entity to persons or groups who are labelled as different or non normal due to the repetition of characteristics Othering is the creation of those who discriminate to distinguish label categorise those who do not fit in the societal norm Several scholars in recent decades developed the notion of the other as an epistemological concept in social theory For example postcolonial scholars believed that colonising powers explained an other who were there to dominate civilise and extract resources through colonisation of land br Political geographers explain how colonial imperial powers othered places they wanted to dominate to legalise their exploitation of the land During and after the rise of colonialism the Western powers perceived the East as the other being different and separate from their societal norm This viewpoint and separation of culture had divided the Eastern and Western culture creating a dominant subordinate dynamic both being the other towards themselves br br br Post colonialism br br Post colonialism or post colonial theory can refer to a set of theories in philosophy and literature that grapple with the legacy of colonial rule In this sense one can regard post colonial literature as a branch of postmodern literature concerned with the political and cultural independence of peoples formerly subjugated in colonial empires br Many practitioners take Edward Sa d s book Orientalism as the theory s founding work although French theorists such as Aim C saire and Frantz Fanon made similar claims decades before Sa d Sa d analyzed the works of Balzac Baudelaire and Lautr amont arguing that they helped to shape a societal fantasy of European racial superiority br Writers of post colonial fiction interact with the traditional colonial discourse but modify or subvert it for instance by retelling a familiar story from the perspective of an oppressed minor character in the story Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak s Can the Subaltern Speak gave its name to Subaltern Studies br In A Critique of Postcolonial Reason Spivak argued that major works of European metaphysics such as those of Kant and Hegel not only tend to exclude the subaltern from their discussions but actively prevent non Europeans from occupying positions as fully human subjects Hegel s Phenomenology of Spirit famous for its explicit ethnocentrism considers Western civilisation as the most accomplished of all while Kant also had some traces of racialism in his work br The YouGov survey found that British people are mostly proud of colonialism and the British Empire br br A new YouGov survey finds that most think the British Empire is more something to be proud of than to be ashamed of don t know Young people are least likely to feel pride over shame when it comes to the Empire though about half of year old s do In comparison about two thirds of over s feel mostly proud A third of British people also say they would like it if Britain still had an empire Under half say they would not like the Empire to exist today don t know br br br Colonistics br The field of
