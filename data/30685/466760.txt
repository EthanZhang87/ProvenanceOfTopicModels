The wild man wild man of the woods or woodwose wodewose is a mythical figure and motif that appears in the art and literature of medieval Europe comparable to the satyr or faun type in classical mythology and to Silvanus the Roman god of the woodlands br The defining characteristic of the figure is its wildness from the th century it was consistently depicted as being covered with hair Images of wild men appear in the carved and painted roof bosses where intersecting ogee vaults meet in Canterbury Cathedral in positions where one is also likely to encounter the vegetal Green Man The image of the wild man survived to appear as supporter for heraldic coats of arms especially in Germany well into the th century Renaissance engravers in Germany and Italy were particularly fond of wild men wild women and wild families with examples from Martin Schongauer died and Albrecht D rer among others br br br Terminology br br The normal Middle English term also used to the present day was woodwose or wodewose also spelled woodehouse wudwas etc understood perhaps as variously singular or plural Wodwos occurs in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight c The Middle English word is first attested for the s in references to the wild man popular at the time in decorative art as in a Latin description of an tapestry of the Great Wardrobe of Edward III but as a surname it is found as early as of one Robert de Wudewuse In reference to an actual legendary or mythological creature the term is found during the s in Wycliffe s Bible translating LXX Latin pilosi meaning hairy in Isaiah The occurrences in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight date to soon after Wycliffe s Bible to c br The Old English form of woodwose is unattested but it would have been either wudu w sa or wude w sa The first element is usually explained as from wudu wood forest The second element is less clear It has been identified as a hypothetical noun w sa being from the verb wesan wosan to be to be alive It might alternatively mean a forlorn or abandoned person cognate with German Waise and Dutch wees which both mean orphan br br Old High German had the terms schrat scrato or scrazo which appear in glosses of Latin works as translations for fauni silvestres or pilosi identifying the creatures as hairy woodland beings Some of the local names suggest associations with characters from ancient mythology Common in Lombardy and the Italian speaking parts of the Alps are the terms salvan and salvang which derive from the Latin Silvanus the name of the Roman tutelary god of gardens and the countryside Similarly folklore in Tyrol and German speaking Switzerland into the th century included a wild woman known as Fange or Fanke which derives from the Latin fauna the feminine form of faun Medieval German sources give as names for the wild woman lamia and holzmoia or some variation the former clearly refers to the Greek wilderness demon Lamia while the latter derives ultimately from Maia a Greco Roman earth and fertility goddess who is identified elsewhere with Fauna and who exerted a wide influence on medieval wild man lore br Slavic has leshy forest man br Various languages and traditions include names suggesting affinities with Orcus a Roman and Italic god of death For many years people in Tyrol called the wild man Orke Lorke or Noerglein while in parts of Italy he was the orco or huorco The French ogre has the same derivation as do modern literary orcs Importantly Orcus is associated with Maia in a dance celebrated late enough to be condemned in a th or th century Spanish penitential br The term was usually replaced in literature of the Early Modern English period by classically derived equivalents or wild man but it survives in the form of the surname Wodehouse or Woodhouse see Wodehouse family Wild man and its cognates is the common term for the creature in most modern languages it appears in German as wilder Mann in French as homme sauvage and in Italian as uomo selvatico forest man br br br Origins br br Figures similar to the European wild man occur worldwide from very early times The earliest recorded example of the type is the character Enkidu of the ancient Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh br The description of Nebuchadnezzar II in the Book of Daniel nd century BC may have greatly influenced the medieval European concepts Daniel depicts God humbling the Babylonian king for his boastfulness stricken mad and ejected from human society he grows hair on his body and lives like a beast This image was popular in medieval depictions of Nebuchadnezzar Late medieval legends of Saint John Chrysostom died describe the saint s asceticism as making him so isolated and feral that hunters who capture him cannot tell if he is man or beast br The medieval wild man concept also drew on lore about similar beings from the Classical world such as the Roman faun and Silvanus and perhaps even Heracles Several folk traditions about the wild man correspond with ancient practices and beliefs Notably peasants in the Grisons tried to capture the wild man by getting him drunk and tying him up in hopes that he would give them his wisdom in exchange for freedom This suggests an association with an ancient tradition recorded as early as Xenophon d BC and appearing in the works of Ovid Pausanias and Claudius Aelianus in which shepherds caught a forest being here termed Silenus or Faunus in the same manner and for the same purpose br Besides mythological influences medieval wild man lore also drew on the learned writings of ancient historians though likely to a lesser degree These ancient wild men are naked and sometimes covered with hair though importantly the texts generally localize them in some faraway land distinguishing them from the medieval wild man who was thought to exist just at the boundaries of civilization The first historian to describe such beings Herodotus c BC c BC places them in western Libya alongside the headless men with eyes in their chest and dog faced creatures After the appearance of the former Persian court physician Ctesias s book Indika concerning India which recorded Persian beliefs about the Indian subcontinent and the conquests of Alexander the Great India became the primary home of fantastic creatures in the Western imagination and wild men were frequently described as living there Megasthenes Seleucus I Nicator s ambassador to Chandragupta Maurya wrote of two kinds of men to be found in India whom he explicitly describes as wild first a creature brought to court whose toes faced backwards second a tribe of forest people who had no mouths and who sustained themselves with smells Both Quintus Curtius Rufus and Arrian refer to Alexander himself meeting with a tribe of fish eating savages while on his Indian campaign br Distorted accounts of apes may have contributed to both the ancient and medieval conception of the wild man In his Natural History Pliny the Elder describes a race of silvestres wild creatures in India who had humanoid bodies but a coat of fur fangs and no capacity to speak a description that fits gibbons indigenous to the area The ancient Carthaginian explorer Hanno the Navigator fl BC reported an encounter with a tribe of savage men and hairy women in what may have been Sierra Leone their interpreters called them Gorillae a story which much later originated the name of the gorilla species and could indeed have related to a great ape Similarly the Greek historian Agatharchides describes what may have been chimpanzees as tribes of agile promiscuous seed eaters and wood eaters living in Ethiopia br One of the historical precedents which could have inspired the wild man representation could be the Grazers a group of monks in Eastern Christianity which lived alone without eating meat and often completely naked They were viewed as saints in Byzantine society and the hagiographical accounts about their lives were spread in all of Christianity possibly influencing later authors br br br Medieval representations br br Some of the earliest evidence for the wild man tradition appears in the above mentioned th or th century Spanish penitential This book describes a dance in which participants donned the guise of the figures Orcus Maia and Pela and ascribes a minor penance for those who participate with what was apparently a resurgence of an older pagan custom The identity of Pela is unknown but the earth goddess Maia appears as the wild woman Holz maia in the later German glossaries and names related to Orcus were associated with the wild man through the Middle Ages indicating that this dance was an early version of the wild man festivities celebrated through the Middle Ages and surviving in parts of Europe through modern times br br As the name implies the main characteristic of the wild man is his wildness Civilized people regarded wild men as beings of the wilderness the antithesis of civilization br Other characteristics developed or transmuted in different contexts From the earliest times sources associated wild men with hairiness by the th century they were almost invariably described as having a coat of hair covering their entire bodies except for their hands feet faces above their long beards and the breasts and chins of the females br In art the hair more often covers the same areas that a chemise or dress would except for the female s breasts male knees are also often hairless As with the feather tights of angels this is probably influenced by the costumes of popular drama The female depiction also follows Mary Magdalene s hair suit in art in medieval legend this miraculously appeared when she retreated to the desert after Christ s death and her clothes fell apart br br br Romanesque Europe br A wild man is described in the book Konungs skuggsj Speculum Regale or the King s Mirror written in Norway about br br It once happened in that country and this seems indeed strange that a living creature was caught in the forest as to which no one could say definitely whether it was a man or some other animal for no one could get a word from it or be sure that it understood human speech It had the human shape however in every detail both as to hands and face and feet but the entire body was covered with hair as the beasts are and down the back it had a long coarse mane like that of a horse which fell to both sides and trailed along the ground when the creature stooped in walking br br A black and hairy forest dwelling outcast is mentioned in the tale of Renaud de Montauban written in the late th century br br br Celtic mythology br The th century Irish tale Buile Shuibhne The Madness of Sweeney describes how Suibhne or Sweeney the pagan king of the D l nAraidi in Ulster assaults the Christian bishop Ronan Finn and is cursed with madness as a result He begins to grow feathers and talons as the curse runs its full course flies like a bird and spends many years travelling naked through the woods composing verses among other madmen In order to be forgiven by God King Suibhne composes a beautiful poem of praise to God before he dies There are further poems and stories recounting the life and madness of King Suibhne The Welsh told a similar story about Myrddin Wyllt the origin of the Merlin of later romance In these stories Myrddin is a warrior in the service of King Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio at the time of the Battle of Arfderydd When his lord is killed at the battle Myrddin travels to the Caledonian Forest in a fit of madness which endows him with the ability to compose prophetic poetry a number of later prophetic poems are attributed to him The Life of Saint Kentigern includes almost the same story though here the madman of Arfderydd is instead named Lailoken which may be the original name The fragmentary th century Breton text An Dialog Etre Arzur Roe D an Bretounet Ha Guynglaff Dialog Between Arthur and Guynglaff tells of a meeting between King Arthur and the wild man Guynglaff who predicts events which will occur as late as the th century br Geoffrey of Monmouth recounts the Myrddin Wyllt legend in his Latin Vita Merlini of about though here the figure has been renamed Merlin According to Geoffrey after Merlin witnessed the horrors of the battle br br a strange madness came upon him He crept away and fled to the woods unwilling that any should see his going Into the forest he went glad to lie hidden beneath the ash trees He watched the wild creatures grazing on the pasture of the glades Sometimes he would follow them sometimes pass them in his course He made use of the roots of plants and of grasses of fruit from trees and of the blackberries in the thicket He became a Man of the Woods as if dedicated to the woods So for a whole summer he stayed hidden in the woods discovered by none forgetful of himself and of his own lurking like a wild thing br br br Slavic mythology br br Wild divi people are

have grown wool they have a long tail and ears like an ox they do not speak but only squeal br br br Late Medieval br King Charles VI of France and five of his courtiers were dressed as wild men and chained together for a masquerade at the tragic Bal des Sauvages which occurred in Paris at the H tel Saint Pol January They were in costumes of linen cloth sewn onto their bodies and soaked in resinous wax or pitch to hold a covering of frazzled hemp so that they appeared shaggy hairy from head to foot In the midst of the festivities a stray spark from a torch set their flammable costumes ablaze burning several courtiers to death the king s own life was saved through quick action by his aunt Joann who covered him with her dress br The Burgundian court celebrated a pas d armes known as the Pas de la Dame Sauvage Passage of arms of the Wild Lady in Ghent in br A knight held a series of jousts with an allegoric meaning in which the conquest of the wild lady symbolized the feats the knight must do to merit a lady br Some early sets of playing cards have a suit of Wild Men including a pack engraved by the Master of the Playing Cards active in the Rhineland c some of the earliest European engravings A set of four miniatures on the estates of society by Jean Bourdichon of about includes a wild family along with poor artisan and rich ones br br br Martin Schongauer s Wild Men br br Martin Schongauer depicted wild people several times including on four heraldic shield engravings of the s which depict wild men holding the coat of arms of the print s patrons Each image is confined within an approximately mm circular composition which is not new to Schongauer s oeuvre br In Wild Man Holding a Shield with a Hare and a Shield with a Moor s Head the wild man holds two parallel shields which seem to project from the groin of the central figure The wild man supports the weight of the shields on two cliffs The hair on the apex of the wild man s head is adorned with twigs which project outward as if to make a halo The wild man does not look directly at the viewer in fact he looks down somberly toward the bottom right region of his circular frame His somber look is reminiscent of that an animal trapped in a zoo as if to suggest that he is upset to have been tamed br There is a stark contrast between the first print and Shield with a Greyhound held by a Wild Man as this figure stands much more confidently Holding a bludgeon he looks past the shield and off into the distance while wearing a crown of vines In Schongauer s third print Shield with Stag Held by Wild Man the figure grasps his bludgeon like a walking stick and steps in the same direction as the stag He too wears a crown of vines which trail behind into the wind toward a jagged mountaintop br In his fourth print Wild Woman Holding a Shield with a Lion s Head Schongauer depicts a different kind of scene This scene is more intimate The image depicts a wild woman sitting on a stump with her suckling offspring at her breast While the woman s body is covered in hair her face is left bare She also wears a crown of vines Then compared to the other wild men the wild woman is noticeably disproportionate br Finally each print is visually strong enough to stand alone as individual scenes but when lined up it seems as if they were stamped out of a continuous scene with a circular die br br br Early modern representations br br The wild man was used as a symbol of mining in late medieval and Renaissance Germany It appears in this context in the coats of arms of Naila and of Wildemann The town of Wildemann in the Upper Harz was founded during by miners who according to legend met a wild man and wife when they ventured into the wilds of the Harz mountain range br br Petrus Gonsalvus born was referred to by Ulisse Aldrovandi as the man of the woods due to his condition hypertrichosis Some of his children were also afflicted It is believed that his marriage to the lady Catherine inspired the fairy tale Beauty and the Beast br In Shakespeare s The Winter s Tale the dance of twelve Satyrs at the rustic sheep shearing IV iv prepared by a servant s account br br Masters there is three carters three shepherds three neat herds three swine herds that have made themselves all men of hair they call themselves Saltiers and they have a dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufrey of gambols br The account conflates wild men and satyrs Shakespeare may have been inspired by the episode of Ben Jonson s masque Oberon the Faery Prince performed January where the satyrs have tawnie wrists and shaggy thighs they run leaping and making antique action br br br Modern literary representations br The term wood woses or simply Woses is used by J R R Tolkien to describe a fictional race of wild men the Dr edain in his books on Middle earth According to Tolkien s legendarium other men including the Rohirrim mistook the Dr edain for goblins or other wood creatures and referred to them as P kel men Goblin men He allows the fictional possibility that his Dr edain were the actual origin of the wild men of later traditional folklore br British poet Ted Hughes used the form wodwo as the title of a poem and a volume of his collected works br The fictional character Tarzan from Edgar Rice Burroughs novel Tarzan of the Apes has been described as a modern version of the wild man
