Latin lingua Latina Latin l a a ti na or Latinum Latin a ti n is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo European languages Considered a dead language Latin was originally spoken in Latium now known as Lazio the lower Tiber area around Rome Italy Through the expansion of the Roman Republic it became the dominant language in the Italian Peninsula and subsequently throughout the Roman Empire Even after the fall of Western Rome Latin remained the common language of international communication science scholarship and academia in Europe until well into the early th century when regional vernaculars supplanted it in common academic and political usage including its own descendants the Romance languages For most of the time it was used it would be considered a dead language in the modern linguistic definition that is it lacked native speakers despite being used extensively and actively br Latin grammar is highly fusional with classes of inflections for case number person gender tense mood voice and aspect The Latin alphabet is directly derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets br By the late Roman Republic BC Old Latin had evolved into standardized Classical Latin Vulgar Latin was the colloquial register with less prestigious variations attested in inscriptions and some literary works such as those of the comic playwrights Plautus and Terence and the author Petronius Late Latin is the literary language from the rd century AD onward and Vulgar Latin s various regional dialects had developed by the th to th centuries into the ancestors of the modern Romance languages br In Latin s usage beyond the early medieval period it lacked native speakers Medieval Latin was used across Western and Catholic Europe during the Middle Ages as a working and literary language from the th century to the Renaissance which then developed a classicizing form called Renaissance Latin This was the basis for Neo Latin which evolved during the early modern period In these periods Latin was used productively and generally taught to be written and spoken at least until the late seventeenth century when spoken skills began to erode It then became increasingly taught only to be read br Latin remains the official language of the Holy See and the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church at the Vatican City The church continues to adapt concepts from modern languages to Ecclesiastical Latin of the Latin language Contemporary Latin is more often studied to be read rather than spoken or actively used br Latin has greatly influenced the English language along with a large amount of others and historically contributed many words to the English lexicon particularly after the Christianization of the Anglo Saxons and the Norman Conquest Latin and Ancient Greek roots are heavily used in English vocabulary in theology the sciences medicine and law br br A number of phases of the language have been recognized each distinguished by subtle differences in vocabulary usage spelling and syntax There are no hard and fast rules of classification different scholars emphasize different features As a result the list has variants as well as alternative names br In addition to the historical phases Ecclesiastical Latin refers to the styles used by the writers of the Roman Catholic Church from late antiquity onward as well as by Protestant scholars br br The earliest known form of Latin is Old Latin also called Archaic or Early Latin which was spoken from the Roman Kingdom traditionally founded in BC through the later part of the Roman Republic up to BC i e before the age of Classical Latin It is attested both in inscriptions and in some of the earliest extant Latin literary works such as the comedies of Plautus and Terence The Latin alphabet was devised from the Etruscan alphabet The writing later changed from what was initially either a right to left or a boustrophedon script to what ultimately became a strictly left to right script br br During the late republic and into the first years of the empire from about BC to AD a new Classical Latin arose a conscious creation of the orators poets historians and other literate men who wrote the great works of classical literature which were taught in grammar and rhetoric schools Today s instructional grammars trace their roots to such schools which served as a sort of informal language academy dedicated to maintaining and perpetuating educated speech br br Philological analysis of Archaic Latin works such as those of Plautus which contain fragments of everyday speech gives evidence of an informal register of the language Vulgar Latin termed sermo vulgi the speech of the masses by Cicero Some linguists particularly in the nineteenth century believed this to be a separate language existing more or less in parallel with the literary or educated Latin but this is now widely dismissed br The term Vulgar Latin remains difficult to define referring both to informal speech at any time within the history of Latin and the kind of informal Latin that had begun to move away from the written language significantly in the post Imperial period that led ultimately to the Romance languages br During the Classical period informal language was rarely written so philologists have been left with only individual words and phrases cited by classical authors inscriptions such as Curse tablets and those found as graffiti In the Late Latin period language changes reflecting spoken non classical norms tend to be found in greater quantities in texts br As it was free to develop on its own there is no reason to suppose that the speech was uniform either diachronically or geographically On the contrary Romanised European populations developed their own dialects of the language which eventually led to the differentiation of Romance languages br br Late Latin is a kind of written Latin used in the rd to th centuries This began to diverge from Classical forms at a faster pace It is characterised by greater use of prepositions and word order that is closer to modern Romance languages for example while grammatically retaining more or less the same formal rules as Classical Latin br Ultimately Latin diverged into a distinct written form where the commonly spoken form was perceived as a separate language for instance early French or Italian dialects that could be transcribed differently It took some time for these to be viewed as wholly different from Latin however br After the Western Roman Empire fell in and Germanic kingdoms took its place the Germanic people adopted Latin as a language more suitable for legal and other more formal uses br br While the written form of Latin was increasingly standardized into a fixed form the spoken forms began to diverge more greatly Currently the five most widely spoken Romance languages by number of native speakers are Spanish Portuguese French Italian and Romanian Despite dialectal variation which is found in any widespread language the languages of Spain France Portugal and Italy have retained a remarkable unity in phonological forms and developments bolstered by the stabilising influence of their common Christian Roman Catholic culture br It was not until the Muslim conquest of Spain in cutting off communications between the major Romance regions that the languages began to diverge seriously The spoken Latin that would later become Romanian diverged somewhat more from the other varieties as it was largely separated from the unifying influences in the western part of the Empire br Spoken Latin began to diverge into distinct languages by the th century at the latest when the earliest extant Romance writings begin to appear They were throughout the period confined to everyday speech as Medieval Latin was used for writing br For many Italians using Latin though there was no complete separation between Italian and Latin even into the beginning of the Renaissance Petrarch for example saw Latin as a literary version of the spoken language br br Medieval Latin is the written Latin in use during that portion of the post classical period when no corresponding Latin vernacular existed that is from around to AD The spoken language had developed into the various Romance languages however in the educated and official world Latin continued without its natural spoken base Moreover this Latin spread into lands that had never spoken Latin such as the Germanic and Slavic nations It became useful for international communication between the member states of the Holy Roman Empire and its allies br Without the institutions of the Roman Empire that had supported its uniformity Medieval Latin was much more liberal in its linguistic cohesion for example in classical Latin sum and eram are used as auxiliary verbs in the perfect and pluperfect passive which are compound tenses Medieval Latin might use fui and fueram instead Furthermore the meanings of many words were changed and new words were introduced often under influence from the vernacular Identifiable individual styles of classically incorrect Latin prevail br br Renaissance Latin to and the classicised Latin that followed through to the present are often grouped together as Neo Latin or New Latin which have in recent decades become a focus of renewed study given their importance for the development of European culture religion and science The vast majority of written Latin belongs to this period but its full extent is unknown br The Renaissance reinforced the position of Latin as a spoken and written language by the scholarship by the Renaissance humanists Petrarch and others began to change their usage of Latin as they explored the texts of the Classical Latin world Skills of textual criticism evolved to create much more accurate versions of extant texts through the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and some important texts were rediscovered Comprehensive versions of authors works were published by Isaac Casaubon Joseph Scaliger and others Nevertheless despite the careful work of Petrarch Politian and others first the demand for manuscripts and then the rush to bring works into print led to the circulation of inaccurate copies for several centuries following br Neo Latin literature was extensive and prolific but less well known or understood today Works covered poetry prose stories and early novels occasional pieces and collections of letters to name a few Famous and well regarded writers included Petrarch Erasmus Salutati Celtis George Buchanan and Thomas More Non fiction works were long produced in many subjects including the sciences law philosophy historiography and theology Famous examples include Isaac Newton s Principia Latin was also used as a convenient medium for translations of important works first written in a vernacular such as those of Descartes br Latin education underwent a process of reform to classicise written and spoken Latin Schooling remained largely Latin medium until approximately Until the end of the th century the majority of books and almost all diplomatic documents were written in Latin Afterwards most diplomatic documents were written in French a Romance language and later native or other languages Education methods gradually shifted towards written Latin and eventually concentrating solely on reading skills The decline of Latin education took several centuries and proceeded much more slowly than the decline in written Latin output br br Despite having no native speakers Latin is still used for a variety of purposes in the contemporary world br br The largest organisation that retains Latin in official and quasi official contexts is the Catholic Church The Catholic Church required that Mass be carried out in Latin until the Second Vatican Council of which permitted the use of the vernacular Latin remains the language of the Roman Rite The Tridentine Mass also known as the Extraordinary Form or Traditional Latin Mass is celebrated in Latin Although the Mass of Paul VI also known as the Ordinary Form or the Novus Ordo is usually celebrated in the local vernacular language it can be and often is said in Latin in part or in whole especially at multilingual gatherings It is the official language of the Holy See the primary language of its public journal the Acta Apostolicae Sedis and the working language of the Roman Rota Vatican City is also home to the world s only automatic teller machine that gives instructions in Latin In the pontifical universities postgraduate courses of Canon law are taught in Latin and papers are written in the same language br There are a small number of Latin services held in the Anglican church These include an annual service in Oxford delivered with a Latin sermon a relic from the period when Latin was the normal spoken language of the university br br In the Western world many organizations governments and schools use Latin for their mottos due to its association with formality tradition and the roots of Western culture br Canada s motto A mari usque ad mare from sea to sea and most provincial mottos are also in Latin The Canadian Victoria Cross is modelled after the British Victoria Cross which has the inscription For Valour Because Canada is officially bilingual the Canadian medal has replaced the English inscription with the Latin Pro Valore br Spain s motto Plus ultra meaning even further or figuratively Further is also Latin in origin It is taken from the personal motto of Charles V Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain as Charles I and is a reversal of the original phrase Non terrae plus ultra No land further beyond No further According to legend this phrase was inscribed as a warning on the Pillars of Hercules the rocks on both sides of the Strait of Gibraltar and the western end of the known Mediterranean world Charles adopted the motto following the discovery of the New World by Columbus and it also has metaphorical suggestions of taking risks and striving for excellence br In the United States the unofficial national motto until was E pluribus unum meaning Out of many one The motto continues to be featured on the Great Seal It also appears on the flags and seals of both houses of congress and the flags of the states of Michigan North Dakota New York and Wisconsin The motto s letters symbolically represent the original Thirteen Colonies which revolted from the British Crown The motto is featured on all presently minted coinage and has been featured in most coinage throughout the nation s history br Several states of the United States have Latin mottos such as br br Arizona s Ditat deus God enriches br Connecticut s Qui transtulit sustinet He who transplanted sustains br Kansas s Ad astra per aspera Through hardships to the stars br Colorado s Nil sine numine Nothing without providence br Michigan s Si quaeris peninsulam amoenam circumspice If you seek a pleasant peninsula look about you is based on that of Sir Christopher Wren in St Paul s Cathedral br Missouri s Salus populi suprema lex esto The health of the people should be the highest law br New York s Excelsior Ever upward br North Carolina s Esse Quam Videri To be rather than to seem br South Carolina s Dum spiro spero While I breathe I hope br Virginia s Sic semper tyrannis Thus always to tyrants and br West Virginia s Montani Semper Liberi Mountaineers are always free br Many military organizations today have Latin mottos such as br br Semper Paratus always ready the motto of the United States Coast Guard br Semper Fidelis always faithful the motto of the United States Marine Corps br Semper Supra always above the motto of the United States Space Force br Per ardua ad astra Through adversity struggle to the stars the motto of the Royal Air Force RAF and br Vigilamus pro te We stand on guard for thee the motto of the Canadian Armed Forces br Some law governing bodies in the Philippines have Latin mottos such as br br Justitiae Pax Opus Justice peace work the motto of the Department of Justice Philippines br Some colleges and universities have adopted Latin mottos for example Harvard University s motto is Veritas truth Veritas was the goddess of truth a daughter of Saturn and the mother of Virtue br br Switzerland has adopted the country s Latin short name Helvetia on coins and stamps since there is no room to use all of the nation s four official languages For a similar reason it adopted the international vehicle and internet code CH which stands for Confoederatio Helvetica the country s full Latin name br Some film and television in ancient settings such as Sebastiane The Passion of the Christ and Barbarians TV series have been made with dialogue in Latin Occasionally Latin dialogue is used because of its association with religion or philosophy in such film television series as The Exorcist and Lost Jughead Subtitles are usually shown for the benefit of those who do not understand Latin There are also songs written with Latin lyrics The libretto for the opera oratorio Oedipus rex by Igor Stravinsky is in Latin br The continued instruction of Latin is seen by some as a highly valuable component of a liberal arts education Latin is taught at many high schools especially in Europe and the Americas It is most common in British public schools and grammar schools the Italian liceo classico and liceo scientifico the German Humanistisches Gymnasium and the Dutch gymnasium br br Occasionally some media outlets targeting enthusiasts broadcast in Latin Notable examples include Radio Bremen in Germany YLE radio in Finland the Nuntii Latini broadcast from until it was shut down in June and Vatican Radio Television all of which broadcast news segments and other material in Latin br A variety of organisations as well as informal Latin circuli circles have been founded in more recent times to support the use of spoken Latin Moreover a number of university classics departments have begun incorporating communicative pedagogies in their Latin courses These include the University of Kentucky the University of Oxford and also Princeton University br There are many websites and forums maintained in Latin by enthusiasts The Latin Wikipedia has more than articles br Urdaneta City s motto Deo servire populo sufficere It is enough for the people to serve God can be read in the old seal of this Philippine city br br Italian French Portuguese Spanish Romanian Catalan Romansh and other Romance languages are direct descendants of Latin There are also many Latin borrowings in English and Albanian as well as a few in German Dutch Norwegian Danish and Swedish Latin is still spoken in Vatican City a city state situated in Rome that is the seat of the Catholic Church br br The works of several hundred ancient authors who wrote in Latin have survived in whole or in part in substantial works or in fragments to be analyzed in philology They are in part the subject matter of the field of classics Their works were published in manuscript form before the invention of printing and are now published in carefully annotated printed editions such as the Loeb Classical Library published by Harvard University Press or the Oxford Classical Texts published by Oxford University Press br Latin translations of modern literature such as The Hobbit Treasure Island Robinson Crusoe Paddington Bear Winnie the Pooh The Adventures of Tintin Asterix Harry Potter Le Petit Prince Max and Moritz How the Grinch Stole Christmas The Cat in the Hat and a book of fairy tales fabulae mirabiles are intended to garner popular interest in the language Additional resources include phrasebooks and resources for rendering everyday phrases and concepts into Latin such as Meissner s Latin Phrasebook br br Some inscriptions have been published in an internationally agreed monumental multivolume series the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum CIL Authors and publishers vary but the format is about the same volumes detailing inscriptions with a critical apparatus stating the provenance and relevant information The reading and interpretation of these inscriptions is the subject matter of the field of epigraphy About inscriptions are known br br The Latin influence in English has been significant at all stages of its insular development In the Middle Ages borrowing from Latin occurred from ecclesiastical usage established by Saint Augustine of Canterbury in the th century or indirectly after the Norman Conquest through the Anglo Norman language From the th to the th centuries English writers cobbled together huge numbers of new words from Latin and Greek words dubbed inkhorn terms as if they had spilled from a pot of ink Many of these words were used once by the author and then forgotten but some useful ones survived such as imbibe and extrapolate Many of the most common polysyllabic English words are of Latin origin through the medium of Old French Romance words make respectively and of English German and Dutch vocabularies Those figures can rise dramatically when only non compound and non derived words are included br br The influence of Roman governance and Roman technology on the less developed nations under Roman dominion led to the adoption of Latin phraseology in some specialized areas such as science technology medicine and law For example the Linnaean system of plant and animal classification was heavily influenced by Historia Naturalis an encyclopedia of people places plants animals and things published by Pliny the Elder Roman medicine recorded in the works of such physicians as Galen established that today s medical terminology would be primarily derived from Latin and Greek words the Greek being filtered through the Latin Roman engineering had the same effect on scientific terminology as a whole Latin law principles have survived partly in a long list of Latin legal terms br A few international auxiliary languages have been heavily influenced by Latin Interlingua is sometimes considered a simplified modern version of the language Latino sine Flexione popular in the early th century is Latin with its inflections stripped away among other grammatical changes br The Logudorese dialect of the Sardinian language and Standard Italian are the two closest contemporary languages to Latin br br Throughout European history an education in the classics was considered crucial for those who wished to join literate circles This also was true in the United States where many of the nation s founders obtained a classically based education in grammar schools or from tutors Admission to Harvard in the Colonial era required that the applicant Can readily make and speak or write true Latin prose and has skill in making verse Latin Study and the classics were emphasized in American secondary schools and colleges well into the Antebellum era br Instruction in Latin is an essential aspect In today s world a large number of Latin students in the US learn from Wheelock s Latin The Classic Introductory Latin Course Based on Ancient Authors This book first published in was written by Frederic M Wheelock who received a PhD from Harvard University Wheelock s Latin has become the standard text for many American introductory Latin courses br The numbers of people studying Latin varies significantly by country In the United Kingdom Latin is available in around of state primary schools representing a significant increase in availability In Germany over students study Latin each year representing a decrease from over in Latin is still required for some University courses but this has become less frequent br The Living Latin movement attempts to teach Latin in the same way that living languages are taught as a means of both spoken and written communication It is available in Vatican City and at some institutions in the US such as the University of Kentucky and Iowa State University The British Cambridge University Press is a major supplier of Latin textbooks for all levels such as the Cambridge Latin Course series It has also published a subseries of children s texts in Latin by Bell Forte which recounts the adventures of a mouse called Minimus br In the United Kingdom the Classical Association encourages the study of antiquity through various means such as publications and grants The University of Cambridge the Open University a number of independent schools for example Eton Harrow Haberdashers Aske s Boys School Merchant Taylors School and Rugby and The Latin Programme Via Facilis a London based charity run Latin courses In the United States and in Canada the American Classical League supports every effort to further the study of classics Its subsidiaries include the National Junior Classical League with more than members which encourages high school students to pursue the study of Latin and the National Senior Classical League which encourages students to continue their study of the classics into college The league also sponsors the National Latin Exam Classicist Mary Beard wrote in The Times Literary Supplement in that the reason for learning Latin is because of what was written in it br br Latin was or is the official language of European states br br Hungary Latin was an official language in the Kingdom of Hungary from the th century to the mid th century when Hungarian became the exclusive official language in The best known Latin language poet of Croatian Hungarian origin was Janus Pannonius br Croatia Latin was the official language of Croatian Parliament Sabor from the th to the th century The oldest preserved records of the parliamentary sessions Congregatio Regni totius Sclavonie generalis held in Zagreb Zagabria Croatia date from April An extensive Croatian Latin literature exists Latin was used on Croatian coins on even years until January when Croatia adopted the Euro as its official currency br Poland Kingdom of Poland officially recognised and widely used between the th and th centuries commonly used in foreign relations and popular as a second language among some of the nobility br br The ancient pronunciation of Latin has been reconstructed among the data used for reconstruction are explicit statements about pronunciation by ancient authors misspellings puns ancient etymologies the spelling of Latin loanwords in other languages and the historical development of Romance languages br br The consonant phonemes of Classical Latin are as follows br br z was not native to Classical Latin It appeared in Greek loanwords starting around the first century BC when it was probably pronounced at least by educated speakers z initially and doubled zz between vowels in accordance with its pronunciation in Koine Greek In Classical Latin poetry the letter z between vowels always counts as two consonants for metrical purposes The consonant b usually sounds as b however when t or s follows b then it is pronounced as in pt or ps In Latin q is always followed by the vowel u Together they make a k sound br In Old and Classical Latin the Latin alphabet had no distinction between uppercase and lowercase and the letters J U W did not exist In place of J U I V were used respectively I V represented both vowels and consonants Most of the letter forms were similar to modern uppercase as can be seen in the inscription from the Colosseum shown at the top of the article br The spelling systems used in Latin dictionaries and modern editions of Latin texts however normally use j u in place of Classical era i v Some systems use j v for the consonant sounds j w except in the combinations gu su qu for which v is never used br Some notes concerning the mapping of Latin phonemes to English graphemes are given below br br In Classical Latin as in modern Italian double consonant letters were pronounced as long consonant sounds distinct from short versions of the same consonants Thus the nn in Classical Latin annus year and in Italian anno is pronounced as a doubled nn as in English unnamed In English distinctive consonant length or doubling occurs only at the boundary between two words or morphemes as in that example br br In Classical Latin U did not exist as a letter distinct from V the written form V was used to represent both a vowel and a consonant Y was adopted to represent upsilon in loanwords from Greek but it was pronounced like u and i by some speakers It was also used in native Latin words by confusion with Greek words of similar meaning such as sylva and br Classical Latin distinguished between long and short vowels Then long vowels except for i were frequently marked using the apex which was sometimes similar to an acute accent V Long i was written using a taller version of I called i longa long I In modern texts long vowels are often indicated by a macron and short vowels are usually unmarked except when it is necessary to distinguish between words when they are marked with a breve However they would also signify a long vowel by writing the vowel larger than other letters in a word or by repeating the vowel twice in a row The acute accent when it is used in modern Latin texts indicates stress as in Spanish rather than length br Although called long vowels their exact quality in Classical Latin is different from short vowels The difference is described in the table below br br This difference in quality is posited by W Sidney Allen in his book Vox Latina However Andrea Calabrese has disputed this assertion based in part upon the observation that in Sardinian and some Lucanian dialects each long and short vowel pair merged as opposed to in Italo Western languages in which short i and u merged with long e and o c f Latin siccus Italian secco and Sardinian siccu br A vowel letter followed by m at the end of a word or a vowel letter followed by n before s or f represented a short nasal vowel as in monstrum m str br br Classical Latin had several diphthongs The two most common were ae au The former pronounced like the i in mine and the later like the ow in power oe was fairly rare and ui eu ei were very rare at least in native Latin words There has also been debate over whether ui is truly a diphthong in Classical Latin due to its rarity absence in works of Roman grammarians and the roots of Classical Latin words i e hui ce to huic quoi to cui etc not matching or being similar to the pronunciation of classical words if ui were to be considered a diphthong br The sequences sometimes did not represent diphthongs ae and oe also represented a sequence of two vowels in different syllables in a nus a e n s bronze and co pit k e p t began and au ui eu ei ou represented sequences of two vowels or of a vowel and one of the semivowels j w in cav ka we beware cuius k j j s whose monu m n i I warned solv s wi I released d l v de le wi I destroyed eius j j s his and novus n w s new br Old Latin had more diphthongs but most of them changed into long vowels in Classical Latin The Old Latin diphthong ai and the sequence became Classical ae Old Latin oi and ou changed to Classical except in a few words whose oi became Classical oe These two developments sometimes occurred in different words from the same root for instance Classical poena punishment and p n re to punish Early Old Latin ei usually monophthongized to a later Old Latin to Classical br By the late Roman Empire ae oe had merged with e During the Classical period this sound change was present in some rural dialects but deliberately avoided by well educated speakers br br Syllables in Latin are signified by the presence of diphthongs and vowels The number of syllables is the same as the number of vowel sounds br Further if a consonant separates two vowels it will go into the syllable of the second vowel When there are two consonants between vowels the last consonant will go with the second vowel An exception occurs when a phonetic stop and liquid come together In this situation they are thought to be a single consonant and as such they will go into the syllable of the second vowel br br Syllables in Latin are considered either long or short less often called heavy and light respectively Within a word a syllable may either be long by nature or long by position A syllable is long by nature if it has a diphthong or a long vowel On the other hand a syllable is long by position if the vowel is followed by more than one consonant br br There are two rules that define which syllable is stressed in Classical Latin br br In a word with only two syllables the emphasis will be on the first syllable br In a word with more than two syllables there are two cases br If the second to last syllable is long that syllable will have stress br If the second to last syllable is not long the syllable before that one will be stressed instead br br Latin was written in the Latin alphabet A B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X derived from the Etruscan alphabet which was in turn drawn from the Greek alphabet and ultimately the Phoenician alphabet This alphabet has continued to be used over the centuries as the script for the Romance Celtic Germanic Baltic Finnic and many Slavic languages Polish Slovak Slovene Croatian Bosnian Serbian and Czech and it has been adopted by many languages around the world including Vietnamese the Austronesian languages many Turkic languages and most languages in sub Saharan Africa the Americas and Oceania making it by far the world s single most widely used writing system br The number of letters in the Latin alphabet has varied When it was first derived from the Etruscan alphabet it contained only letters Later G was added to represent which had previously been spelled C and Z ceased to be included in the alphabet as the language then had no voiced alveolar fricative The letters K Y and Z were later added to represent Greek letters kappa upsilon and zeta respectively in Greek loanwords br W was created in the th century from VV in some areas and uu in others It represented w in Germanic languages not Latin which still uses V for the purpose J was distinguished from the original I only during the late Middle Ages as was the letter U from V Although some Latin dictionaries use J it is rarely used for Latin text as it was not used in classical times but many other languages use it br br Classical Latin did not contain sentence punctuation letter case or interword spacing but apices were sometimes used to distinguish length in vowels and the interpunct was used at times to separate words br The first line of Catullus Mourn O Venuses and Cupids was originally written as br br It would be rendered in a modern edition as br br The Roman cursive script is commonly found on the many wax tablets excavated at sites such as forts an especially extensive set having been discovered at Vindolanda on Hadrian s Wall in Britain Most notable is the fact that while most of the Vindolanda tablets show spaces between words spaces were avoided in monumental inscriptions from that era br br Occasionally Latin has been written in other scripts br br The Praeneste fibula is a th century BC pin with an Old Latin inscription written using the Etruscan script br The rear panel of the early th century Franks Casket has an inscription that switches from Old English in Anglo Saxon runes to Latin in Latin script and to Latin in runes br br Latin is a synthetic fusional language in the terminology of linguistic typology Words involve an objective semantic element and markers usually suffixes specifying the grammatical use of the word expressing gender number and case in adjectives nouns and pronouns declension and verbs to denote person number tense voice mood and aspect conjugation Some words are uninflected and undergo neither process such as adverbs prepositions and interjections br Latin inflection can result in words with much ambiguity For example am bit he she it will love is formed from am a future tense morpheme bi and a third person singular morpheme t the last of which t does not express masculine feminine or neuter gender A major task in understanding Latin phrases and clauses is to clarify such ambiguities by an analysis of context br br A regular Latin noun belongs to one of five main declensions a group of nouns with similar inflected forms The declensions are identified by the genitive singular form of the noun br br The first declension with a predominant ending letter of a is signified by the genitive singular ending of ae br The second declension with a predominant ending letter of us is signified by the genitive singular ending of i br The third declension with a predominant ending letter of i is signified by the genitive singular ending of is br The fourth declension with a predominant ending letter of u is signified by the genitive singular ending of s br The fifth declension with a predominant ending letter of e is signified by the genitive singular ending of ei br There are seven Latin noun cases which also apply to adjectives and pronouns and mark a noun s syntactic role in the sentence by means of inflections Thus word order is not as important in Latin as it is in English which is less inflected The general structure and word order of a Latin sentence can therefore vary The cases are as follows br br Nominative used when the noun is the subject or a predicate nominative The thing or person acting the girl ran puella cucurrit or cucurrit puella br Genitive used when the noun is the possessor of or connected with an object the horse of the man or the man s horse in both instances the word man would be in the genitive case when it is translated into Latin It also indicates the partitive in which the material is quantified a group of people a number of gifts people and gifts would be in the genitive case Some nouns are genitive with special verbs and adjectives The cup is full of wine Poculum pl num v n est The master of the slave had beaten him Dominus serv eum verber verat br Dative used when the noun is the indirect object of the sentence with special verbs with certain prepositions and if it is used as agent reference or even possessor The merchant hands the stola to the woman Merc tor f minae stolam tr dit br Accusative used when the noun is the direct object of the subject as the object of a preposition demonstrating place to which and sometimes to indicate a duration of time The man killed the boy Vir puerum nec vit br Ablative used when the noun demonstrates separation or movement from a source cause agent or instrument or when the noun is used as the object of certain prepositions and to indicate a specific place in time adverbial You walked with the boy Cum puer ambul vist br Vocative used when the noun is used in a direct address The vocative form of a noun is often the same as the nominative with the exception of second declension nouns ending in us The us becomes an e in the vocative singular If it ends in ius such as f lius the ending is just fil as distinct from the nominative plural fili in the vocative singular Master shouted the slave Domine cl m vit servus br Locative used to indicate a location corresponding to the English in or at It is far less common than the other six cases of Latin nouns and usually applies to cities and small towns and islands along with a few common nouns such as the words domus house humus ground and rus country In the singular of the first and second declensions its form coincides with the genitive Roma becomes Romae in Rome In the plural of all declensions and the singular of the other declensions it coincides with the ablative Ath nae becomes Ath n s at Athens In the fourth declension word domus the locative form dom at home differs from the standard form of all other cases br Latin lacks both definite and indefinite articles so puer currit can mean either the boy is running or a boy is running br br There are two types of regular Latin adjectives first and second declension and third declension They are so called because their forms are similar or identical to first and second declension and third declension nouns respectively Latin adjectives also have comparative and superlative forms There are also a number of Latin participles br Latin numbers are sometimes declined as adjectives See Numbers below br First and second declension adjectives are declined like first declension nouns for the feminine forms and like second declension nouns for the masculine and neuter forms For example for mortuus mortua mortuum dead mortua is declined like a regular first declension noun such as puella girl mortuus is declined like a regular second declension masculine noun such as dominus lord master and mortuum is declined like a regular second declension neuter noun such as auxilium help br Third declension adjectives are mostly declined like normal third declension nouns with a few exceptions In the plural nominative neuter for example the ending is ia omnia all everything and for third declension nouns the plural nominative neuter ending is a or ia capita heads animalia animals They can have one two or three forms for the masculine feminine and neuter nominative singular br br Latin participles like English participles are formed from a verb There are a few main types of participles Present Active Participles Perfect Passive Participles Future Active Participles and Future Passive Participles br br Latin sometimes uses prepositions depending on the type of prepositional phrase being used Most prepositions are followed by a noun in either the accusative or ablative case apud puerum with the boy with puerum being the accusative form of puer boy and sine puero without the boy puero being the ablative form of puer A few adpositions however govern a noun in the genitive such as gratia and tenus br br A regular verb in Latin belongs to one of four main conjugations A conjugation is a class of verbs with similar inflected forms The conjugations are identified by the last letter of the verb s present stem The present stem can be found by omitting the re r in deponent verbs ending from the present infinitive form The infinitive of the first conjugation ends in re or ri active and passive respectively am re to love hort r to exhort of the second conjugation by re or r mon re to warn ver r to fear of the third conjugation by ere d cere to lead t to use of the fourth by re r aud re to hear exper r to attempt The stem categories descend from Indo European and can therefore be compared to similar conjugations in other Indo European languages br Irregular verbs are verbs that do not follow the regular conjugations in the formation of the inflected form Irregular verbs in Latin are esse to be velle to want ferre to carry edere to eat dare to give ire to go posse to be able fieri to happen and their compounds br There are six simple tenses in Latin present imperfect future perfect pluperfect and future perfect three moods indicative imperative and subjunctive in addition to the infinitive participle gerund gerundive and supine three persons first second and third two numbers singular and plural two voices active and passive and two aspects perfective and imperfective Verbs are described by four principal parts br br The first principal part is the first person singular present tense active voice indicative mood form of the verb If the verb is impersonal the first principal part will be in the third person singular br The second principal part is the present active infinitive br The third principal part is the first person singular perfect active indicative form Like the first principal part if the verb is impersonal the third principal part will be in the third person singular br The fourth principal part is the supine form or alternatively the nominative singular of the perfect passive participle form of the verb The fourth principal part can show one gender of the participle or all three genders us for masculine a for feminine and um for neuter in the nominative singular The fourth principal part will be the future participle if the verb cannot be made passive Most modern Latin dictionaries if they show only one gender tend to show the masculine but many older dictionaries instead show the neuter as it coincides with the supine The fourth principal part is sometimes omitted for intransitive verbs but strictly in Latin they can be made passive if they are used impersonally and the supine exists for such verbs br The six simple tenses of Latin are divided into two systems the present system which is made up of the present imperfect and future forms and the perfect system which is made up of the perfect pluperfect and future perfect forms Each simple tense has a set of endings corresponding to the person number and voice of the subject Subject nominative pronouns are generally omitted for the first I we and second you persons except for emphasis br The table below displays the common inflected endings for the indicative mood in the active voice in all six tenses For the future tense the first listed endings are for the first and second conjugations and the second listed endings are for the third and fourth conjugations br br Some Latin verbs are deponent causing their forms to be in the passive voice but retain an active meaning hortor hort r hort tus sum to urge br br As Latin is an Italic language most of its vocabulary is likewise Italic ultimately from the ancestral Proto Indo European language However because of close cultural interaction the Romans not only adapted the Etruscan alphabet to form the Latin alphabet but also borrowed some Etruscan words into their language including persona mask and histrio actor Latin also included vocabulary borrowed from Oscan another Italic language br After the Fall of Tarentum BC the Romans began Hellenising or adopting features of Greek culture including the borrowing of Greek words such as camera vaulted roof sumbolum symbol and balineum bath This Hellenisation led to the addition of Y and Z to the alphabet to represent Greek sounds Subsequently the Romans transplanted Greek art medicine science and philosophy to Italy paying almost any price to entice Greek skilled and educated persons to Rome and sending their youth to be educated in Greece Thus many Latin scientific and philosophical words were Greek loanwords or had their meanings expanded by association with Greek words as ars craft and art br Because of the Roman Empire s expansion and subsequent trade with outlying European tribes the Romans borrowed some northern and central European words such as beber beaver of Germanic origin and bracae breeches of Celtic origin The specific dialects of Latin across Latin speaking regions of the former Roman Empire after its fall were influenced by languages specific to the regions The dialects of Latin evolved into different Romance languages br During and after the adoption of Christianity into Roman society Christian vocabulary became a part of the language either from Greek or Hebrew borrowings or as Latin neologisms Continuing into the Middle Ages Latin incorporated many more words from surrounding languages including Old English and other Germanic languages br Over the ages Latin speaking populations produced new adjectives nouns and verbs by affixing or compounding meaningful segments For example the compound adjective omnipotens all powerful was produced from the adjectives omnis all and potens powerful by dropping the final s of omnis and concatenating Often the concatenation changed the part of speech and nouns were produced from verb segments or verbs from nouns and adjectives br br In ancient times numbers in Latin were written only with letters Today the numbers can be written with the Arabic numbers as well as with Roman numerals The numbers and and every whole hundred from to are declined as nouns and adjectives with some differences br br The numbers from to do not change their endings As in modern descendants such as Spanish the gender for naming a number in isolation is masculine so that is counted as nus duo tr s br br Commentarii de Bello Gallico also called De Bello Gallico The Gallic War written by Gaius Julius Caesar begins with the following passage br br Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres quarum unam incolunt Belgae aliam Aquitani tertiam qui ipsorum lingua Celtae nostra Galli appellantur Hi omnes lingua institutis legibus inter se differunt Gallos ab Aquitanis Garumna flumen a Belgis Matrona et Sequana dividit Horum omnium fortissimi sunt Belgae propterea quod a cultu atque humanitate provinciae longissime absunt minimeque ad eos mercatores saepe commeant atque ea quae ad effeminandos animos pertinent important proximique sunt Germanis qui trans Rhenum incolunt quibuscum continenter bellum gerunt Qua de causa Helvetii quoque
