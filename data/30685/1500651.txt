and joy It is described either as a parallel world that exists alongside our own or as a heavenly land beyond the sea or under the earth The Otherworld is usually elusive but various mythical heroes visit it either through chance or after being invited by one of its residents They often reach it by entering ancient burial mounds or caves or by going under water or across the western sea Sometimes they suddenly find themselves in the Otherworld with the appearance of a magic mist supernatural beings or unusual animals An otherworldly woman may invite the hero into the Otherworld by offering an apple or a silver apple branch or a ball of thread to follow as it unwinds br The Otherworld is usually called Annwn in Welsh mythology and Avalon in Arthurian legend In Irish mythology it has several

multicoloured plain Mag C uin the gentle plain and Emain Ablach possibly isle of apples br It is described as a supernatural realm where there is everlasting youth beauty health abundance and joy and where time moves differently It is the dwelling place of the gods the Tuatha D Danann as well as certain heroes and ancestors It was probably similar to the Elysium of Greek mythology and both may have a shared origin in ancient Proto Indo European religion The Otherworld is elusive but various mythical heroes such as C chulainn Fionn and Bran visit it either through chance or after being invited by one of its residents In Irish myth and later folklore the festivals of Samhain and Beltane Bealtaine are liminal times when contact with the Otherworld was more likely br In the tales the Otherworld is often reached by entering ancient burial mounds such as those at Br na B inne and Cnoc Meadha These were known as s dhe Otherworld dwellings and were the dwellings of the gods later called the aos s or daoine s Otherworld folk Irish mythology says the gods retreated into the s dhe when the Gaels Milesians took Ireland from them In some tales the Otherworld is reached by going under the waters of pools lakes or the sea or else by crossing the western sea In Irish Immrama voyage tales a beautiful young Otherworld woman often approaches the hero and sings to him of this happy land Sometimes she offers him an apple or the promise of her love in exchange for his help in battle He follows her and they journey over the sea together and are seen no more Their journey may be in a boat of glass in a chariot or on horseback usually on a white horse as in the case of the goddess Niamh of the Golden Hair br Sometimes the hero returns after what he believes is a short time only to find that all his companions are dead and he has actually been away for hundreds of years Sometimes the hero sets out on a quest and a magic mist descends upon him He may find himself before an unusual palace and enter to find a warrior or a beautiful woman who makes him welcome The woman may be the goddess Fand the warrior may be Manann n mac Lir or Lugh and after strange adventures the hero may return successfully However even when the mortal manages to return to his own time and place he is forever changed by his contact with the Otherworld br The Otherworld was also seen as a source of authority In the tale Baile in Sc il the phantom s ecstatic vision Conn of the Hundred Battles visits an Otherworld hall where the god Lugh legitimizes his kingship and that of his successors br In Irish myth there is another otherworldly realm called Tech Duinn House of Donn or House of the Dark One It was believed that the souls of the dead travelled to Tech Duinn perhaps to remain there forever or perhaps before reaching their final destination in the Otherworld or before being reincarnated Donn is portrayed as a god of the dead and ancestor of the Gaels Tech Duinn is commonly identified with Bull Rock an islet off the west coast of Ireland which resembles a portal tomb In Ireland there was a belief that the souls of the dead departed westwards over the sea with the setting sun westward also being the direction in which the phantom island anglicised as Hy Brasil was purported to be found br br br Welsh mythology br In Welsh mythology the Otherworld is usually called Annwn or Annwfn The Welsh tale of Branwen daughter of Llyr ends with the survivors of the great battle feasting in the Otherworld in the presence of the severed head of Bran the Blessed having forgotten all their suffering and sorrow and having become unaware of the passage of time Annwn is ruled by the Otherworld kings Arawn and Gwyn ap Nudd br In the First Branch of the Welsh tales known as the Mabinogi entitled Pwyll Prince of Dyfed the eponymous prince offends Arawn ruler of Annwn by baiting his hunting hounds on a stag that Arawn s dogs had brought down In recompense Pwyll swaps places with Arawn for a year and defeats Arawn s enemy Hafgan Meanwhile Arawn rules Dyfed During this year Pwyll does not sleep with Arawn s wife earning himself gratitude from Arawn On his return Pwyll becomes known by the title Pen Annwn Head or Ruler of Annwn br br br Continental Celtic mythology br br The Gauls divided the universe into three parts Albios heaven white world upper world Bitu world of the living beings and Dubnos hell lower world black world According to Lucan the Gaulish druids believed that the soul went to an Otherworld which he calls by the Latin name Orbis alius before being reincarnated br Greco Roman geographers tell us about Celtic belief in islands consecrated to gods and heroes Among them were Anglesey M n off the north coast of Wales which was the sacred isle of the druids of Britain the Scilly isles where archaeological remains of proto historical temples have been found and some of the Hebrides which were in the Gaelic tradition home to ghosts and demons on one of them Skye the Irish hero C chulainn was taught by the warrior woman Scathach br Byzantine scholar Procopius of Caesarea described the Otherworld of the ancient Gauls He said it was thought that the land of the dead lay west of Great Britain The Continental Celtic myths told that once the souls of the dead had left their bodies they traveled to the northwest coast of Gaul and took a boat toward Britain When they crossed the Channel the souls went to the homes of the fishermen and knocked desperately at their doors The fishermen then went out of their houses and led the souls to their destination in ghostly ships br There are still remains of those beliefs in the folklore of Brittany where the name Bag an Noz is used to denote those ships who carry the dead to their goal Anatole Le Braz describes in his book La l gende de la mort chez les Bretons armoricains the existence of souls processions which make their way toward coastal places like Laoual to start their last travel from there br In Asturian mythology there are many stories which describe human encounters with xanas fairies which are dancing around a chief fairy the Xana Mega or the Queen of Fairies known as xacias in Galicia The castro of Altamira is said to hide an enormous underground realm which is ruled by a royal couple and whose entrance is found some place on the hill br br br Adaptation in Fiction br Modern authors such as J R R Tolkien C S Lewis and Jim Butcher have all drawn inspiration from various aspects of the Celtic Otherworld In Tolkien s The Hobbit the inspiration is seen when the narrative ventures into the otherworldly elven realm of the Mirkwood In Lewis s The Chronicles of Narnia there exists a magical land called Narnia populated by magical beings talking animals and other supernatural elements In Butcher s The Dresden Files most supernatural beings come from another plane of existence called the Nevernever including the Sidhe inspired by the Aos S and
