Wuxia j literally martial arts and chivalry is a genre of Chinese fiction concerning the adventures of martial artists in ancient China Although wuxia is traditionally a form of historical fantasy literature its popularity has caused it to be adapted for such diverse art forms as Chinese opera manhua television dramas films and video games It forms part of popular culture in many Chinese speaking communities around the world According to Hong Kong film director producer and movie writer Ronny Yu wuxia movies are not to be confused with martial arts movies br The word w xi is a compound composed of the elements w literally martial military or armed and xi literally chivalrous vigilante or hero A martial artist who follows the code of xia is often referred to as a xi k literally follower of xia or y uxi literally wandering xia In some translations the martial artist is referred to as a ji nxi or ji nk either of which can be interpreted as a swordsman or swordswoman even though they may not necessarily wield a sword br The heroes in wuxia fiction typically do not serve a lord wield military power or belong to the aristocratic class They often originate from the lower social classes of ancient Chinese society A code of chivalry usually requires wuxia heroes to right and redress wrongs fight for righteousness remove oppressors and bring retribution for past misdeeds Chinese xia traditions may be compared to martial codes from other cultures such as the Japanese samurai bushid br br br History br br br Earlier precedents br Even though the term wuxia as the name of a genre is a recent coinage stories about xia date back more than years Wuxia stories have their roots in some early youxia tales from BC The Legalist philosopher Han Fei spoke disparagingly of youxias in his book Han Feizi in the chapter On Five Maggot Classes about five social classes in the Spring and Autumn period Some well known stories include Zhuan Zhu s assassination of King Liao of Wu and most notably Jing Ke s attempt on the life of the King of Qin who later became Qin Shi Huang In Volume of the Records of the Grand Historian Shi Ji Sima Qian mentioned five notable assassins Cao Mo Zhuan Zhu Yu Rang Nie Zheng and Jing Ke in the Warring States period who undertook tasks of conducting political assassinations of aristocrats and nobles These assassins were known as cike literally stabbing guests They usually rendered their loyalties and services to feudal lords and nobles in return for rewards such as riches and women In Volume of the Shi Ji Sima Qian detailed several embryonic features of xia culture from his period These popular phenomena were also documented in other historical records such as the Book of Han and the Book of the Later Han br Xiake stories made a turning point in the Tang dynasty and returned in the form of chuanqi literally legendary tales Stories from that era such as Nie Yinniang The Kunlun Slave Thirteenth Madame Jing Red String and The Bearded Warrior served as prototypes for modern wuxia stories They featured fantasies and isolated protagonists usually loners who performed daring heroic deeds During the Song dynasty similar stories circulated in the huaben short works that were once thought to have served as prompt books for shuochang traditional Chinese storytelling br The genre of the martial or military romance also developed during the Tang dynasty In the Ming dynasty Luo Guanzhong and Shi Nai an wrote Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin respectively which are among the Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature The former is a romanticised historical retelling of the events in the late Eastern Han dynasty and the Three Kingdoms period while the latter criticises the deplorable socio economic status of the late Northern Song dynasty Water Margin is often seen as the first full length wuxia novel the portrayal of the heroes and their code of honour and willingness to become outlaws rather than serve a corrupt government played an influential role in the development of jianghu Jianghu is the setting that wuxia stories inhabit Literally meaning rivers and lakes Jianghu settings are fictionalized versions of China which focus on social underworlds and the marginalized figures which inhabit them culture in later centuries Romance of the Three Kingdoms is also seen as a possible early antecedent and contains classic close combat descriptions that were later emulated by wuxia writers in their works br In the Qing dynasty further developments were the gong an literally public case and related detective novels where xia and other heroes in collaboration with a judge or magistrate solved crimes and battled injustice The Justice Bao stories from Sanxia Wuyi later extended and renamed to Qixia Wuyi and Xiaowuyi incorporated much of social justice themes of later wuxia stories Xiayi stories of chivalrous romance which frequently featured female heroes and supernatural fighting abilities also surfaced during the Qing dynasty Novels such as Shi Gong an Qiwen and Ern Yingxiong Zhuan have been cited as the clearest nascent wuxia novels br The term wuxia as a genre label itself first appeared at the end of the Qing dynasty a calque of the Japanese buky a genre of oft militaristic and bushido influenced adventure fiction The term was brought to China by writers such as Liang Qichao and students who hoped that China would modernise its military and place emphasis on martial virtues and it quickly became entrenched as the term used to refer to xiayi and other predecessors of wuxia proper In Japan however the term buky faded into obscurity br Many wuxia works produced during the Ming and Qing dynasties were lost due to the governments crackdown on and banning of such works Wuxia works like Water Margin were deemed responsible for brewing anti government sentiments which led to rebellions in those eras The departure from mainstream literature also meant that patronage of this genre was limited to the masses and not to the literati which led to the stifling of the development of the wuxia genre Nonetheless the wuxia genre remained enormously popular with the common people br br br th century br The modern wuxia genre rose to prominence in the early th century after the May Fourth Movement of A new literature evolved calling for a break with Confucian values and the xia emerged as a symbol of personal freedom defiance to Confucian tradition and rejection of the Chinese family system br Xiang Kairan pen name Pingjiang Buxiaosheng became the first notable wuxia writer with his debut novel being The Peculiar Knights Errant of the Jianghu It was serialised from to and was adapted into the first wuxia film The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple Zhao Huanting who wrote Chronicles of the Loyal Knights Errant serialised was another well known wuxia writer based in Shanghai Starting from the s wuxia works proliferated and its centre shifted to Beijing and Tianjin in northern China The most prolific writers there were collectively referred to as the Five Great Masters of the Northern School Huanzhulouzhu who wrote The Swordspeople from Shu Mountains Gong Baiyu who wrote Twelve Coin Darts Wang Dulu who wrote The Crane Iron Pentalogy Zheng Zhengyin who wrote The King of Eagle Claws Zhu Zhenmu who wrote The Seven Kill Stele br Wuxia fiction was banned at various times during the Republican era and these restrictions stifled the growth of the genre In China also banned martial arts novels as vulgar reading In Taiwan banned several wuxia works at Despite this wuxia prevailed in other Chinese speaking regions In Hong Kong Between the s and s the genre entered a golden age Writers such as Liang Yusheng and Louis Cha Jin Yong spearheaded the founding of a new school of the wuxia genre that differed largely from its predecessors They wrote serials for newspapers and magazines They also incorporated several fictional themes such as mystery and romance from other cultures In Taiwan Wolong Sheng Sima Ling Zhuge Qingyun Shiao Yi and Gu Long became the region s best known wuxia writers After them writers such as Woon Swee Oan and Huang Yi rose to prominence in a later period Chen Yu hui is a contemporary female wuxia novelist who made her debut with the novel The Tian Guan Duo Heroes br There have also been works created after the s which attempt to create a post wuxia genre Yu Hua one of the more notable writers from this period published a counter genre short story titled Blood and Plum Blossoms in which the protagonist goes on a quest to avenge his murdered father br br br Themes plots and settings br br Modern wuxia stories are largely set in ancient or pre modern China The historical setting can range from being quite specific and important to the story to being vaguely defined anachronistic or mainly for use as a backdrop Elements of fantasy such as the use of magic powers and appearance of supernatural beings are common in some wuxia stories but are not a prerequisite of the wuxia genre However the martial arts element is a definite part of a wuxia tale as the characters must know some form of martial arts Themes of romance are also strongly featured in some wuxia tales br A typical wuxia story features a young male protagonist who experiences a tragedy such as the loss of his loved ones and goes on to undertake several trials and tribulations to learn several forms of martial arts from various fighters At the end of the story he emerges as a powerful fighter whom few can equal He uses his abilities to follow the code of xia and mends the ills of the jianghu For instance the opening chapters of some of Jin Yong s works follow a certain pattern a tragic event occurs usually one that costs the lives of the newly introduced characters and then it sets events into motion that will culminate in the primary action of the story br Other stories use different structures For instance the protagonist is denied admission into a martial arts school He experiences hardships and trains secretly and waits until there is an opportunity for him to show off his skills and surprise those who initially looked down on him Some stories feature a mature hero with powerful martial arts abilities confronting an equally powerful antagonist as his nemesis The plot will gradually meander to a final dramatic showdown between the protagonist and his nemesis These types of stories were prevalent during the era of anti Qing revolutionaries br Certain stories have unique plots such as those by Gu Long and Huang Yi Gu Long s works have an element of mystery and are written like detective stories The protagonist usually a formidable martial artist and intelligent problem solver embarks on a quest to solve a mystery such as a murder case Huang Yi s stories are blended with science fiction br Despite these genre blending elements wuxia is primarily a historical genre of fiction Notwithstanding this wuxia writers openly admit that they are unable to capture the entire history of a course of events and instead choose to structure their stories along the pattern of the protagonist s progression from childhood to adulthood instead The progression may be symbolic rather than literal as observed in Jin Yong s The Smiling Proud Wanderer where Linghu Chong progresses from childish concerns and dalliances into much more adult ones as his unwavering loyalty repeatedly thrusts him into the rocks of betrayal at the hands of his inhumane master br br br Code of xia br The eight common attributes of the xia are listed as benevolence justice individualism loyalty courage truthfulness disregard for wealth and desire for glory Apart from individualism these characteristics are similar to Confucian values such as ren benevolence kindness zhong loyalty yong courage bravery and yi righteousness The code of xia also emphasises the importance of repaying benefactors after having received deeds of en grace favour from others as well as seeking chou vengeance revenge to bring villains to justice However the importance of vengeance is controversial as a number of wuxia works stress Buddhist ideals which include forgiveness compassion and a prohibition on killing While borrowing ideas from the better known Confucian values the root of Xia originated from the lesser known Mohism which in the Warring States period saw a few Mohists stood up to defend kingdoms being attacked by other kingdoms br In the jianghu martial artists are expected to be loyal to their master Shifu This gives rise to the formation of several complex trees of master apprentice relations as well as the various schools such as Shaolin and Wudang If there are any disputes between fighters they will choose the honourable way of settling their issues through fighting in duels br br br Skills and abilities br br The martial arts in wuxia stories are based on wushu techniques and other real life Chinese martial arts In wuxia tales however the mastery of such skills are highly exaggerated to superhuman levels of achievement and prowess br The following is a list of skills and abilities a typical fighter in a wuxia story possesses br br Martial arts Fighting techniques in a codified sequence called zhaoshi which are based on real life Chinese martial arts br Weapons and objects Combatants use a wide range of weapons in combat The most commonly used ones are the dao broadsword or saber jian sword gun staff and qiang spear Everyday objects such as abaci benches fans ink brushes smoking pipes sewing needles or various musical instruments are also used as weapons as well br Qinggong A form of real Chinese martial arts In wuxia fiction however its use is exaggerated to the point that characters can circumvent gravity to fly cover tremendous distances in a single stride run across surfaces of water mount trees and jump over or scale high walls br Neili lit internal force or internal strength Neigong literally internal skill or internal function The ability to build up and cultivate inner energy known as qi and utilise it for offensive or defensive purposes Characters use this energy to attain skills such as superhuman strength speed stamina endurance and healing as well as the ability to project energy beams and elemental forces from their bodies br Dianxue literally touching acupuncture points Characters use various acupuncture techniques to kill paralyse immobilise or even manipulate opponents by attacking their acupressure points with their bare hands or weapons Such techniques can also be used for healing purposes such as halting excessive bleeding Real life martial artists do use such techniques to paralyse or stun their opponents However their effectiveness is highly exaggerated in wuxia stories br In wuxia stories characters attain the above skills and abilities by devoting themselves to years of diligent study and exercise but can also have such power conferred upon them by a master who transfers his energy to them The instructions to mastering these skills through training are found in secret manuals known as miji In some stories specific skills can be learned by spending several years in seclusion with a master or training with a group of fighters br br br Menpai br Menpai is often translated as sect school society church house or cult Members of the same menpai follow the guidance and train under the same leader If the members of the menpai are related then it can be translated as clan Since some of the menpai are religiously affiliated sect has come to be a common translation for the non family based menpai However it would be inaccurate to use sect to denote menpais that are not associated with religion br br br Literature br Notable modern wuxia writers include br br br Comics br New and original wuxia writings have dwindled significantly in modern times particularly so as patronage and readerships of the genre decimated due to readily available alternatives in entertainment such as DVDs gaming consoles and other newer forms of entertainment However the genre has persisted in the form of manhua Chinese comics in places like Hong Kong and Taiwan with the core essentials of the wuxia genre living on in weekly editions equivalent to the Japanese manga br Some notable comic artists are listed as follows br br br Film and television br br The earliest wuxia films date back to the s Extant early wuxia films produced in China include Red Heroine Woman Warrior White Rose and Woman Warrior of the Wild River Rumble at Deerhorn Gully the sixth film in a series Hua Mu Lan another surviving film is considered a representative of the second wave of wuxia films during the Anti Japanese War Films directed by King Hu and produced by the Shaw Brothers Studio featured sophisticated action choreography using wire and trampoline assisted acrobatics combined with sped up camera techniques The storylines in the early films were loosely adapted from existing literature br Cheng Pei pei Jimmy Wang and Connie Chan are among the better known wuxia movie stars in

to the underworld interpretation of jianghu It was selected to compete for the Palme d Or at the Cannes Film Festival The story is loosely based on the leader of a gang from Jia Zhangke s childhood whom he had admired as a role model Like the rest of Jia s films it opened to widespread acclaim br There have been Western attempts at the genre such as the film The Forbidden Kingdom which starred Jackie Chan Jet Li and Michael Angarano other movies including wuxia elements are the first three in The Matrix film series the fourth film from was choreographed by Joshua Grothe and the Kill Bill films from all of which were choregraphed by Yuen Woo ping Perhaps the most successful example was DreamWorks Animation s media franchise Kung Fu Panda Created as an earnest if humorous emulation by producers who were knowledgeable admirers of the genre the series has been particularly hailed in China as an excellent contribution to the form From the s s Hong Kong stars Daniel Wu and Stephen Fung have worked with AMC Networks to bring wuxia to a US television audience with Into the Badlands which premiered in and ran for three seasons br In Keanu Reeves directed and starred as the main antagonist in Man of Tai Chi with Tiger Chen as a martial artist attending underground fights The Mulan remake in was Disney s attempt in making a wuxia movie In Marvel s Shang Chi opens with a wuxia sequence and has action sequences inspired by Jackie Chan br br br Video games br Some notable wuxia video games of the action RPG genre include The Legend of Sword and Fairy Xuan Yuan Sword Jade Empire and Kingdom of Paradise all of which blend wuxia with elements of Chinese mythology and fantasy The Legend of Sword and Fairy in particular expanded into a franchise of eight video games two of which were adapted into the television series Chinese Paladin and Chinese Paladin There are also MMORPGs such as JX Online Heroes of Kung Fu and Age of Wulin and hack and slash games such as Bujingai
