John Ronald Reuel Tolkien ROOL TOL keen January September was an English writer and philologist He was the author of the high fantasy works The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings br From to Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo Saxon and a Fellow of Pembroke College both at the University of Oxford He then moved within the same university to become the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College and held these positions from until his retirement in Tolkien was a close friend of C S Lewis a co member of the informal literary discussion group The Inklings He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on March br After Tolkien s death his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father s extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts including The Silmarillion These together with The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings form a connected body of tales poems fictional histories invented languages and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and within it Middle earth Between and Tolkien applied the term legendarium to the larger part of these writings br While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien the tremendous success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings ignited a profound interest in the fantasy genre and ultimately precipitated an avalanche of new fantasy books and authors As a result he has been popularly identified as the father of modern fantasy literature and is widely regarded as one of the most influential authors of all time br br Tolkien was English and thought of himself as such br His immediate paternal ancestors were middle class craftsmen who made and sold clocks watches and pianos in London and Birmingham The Tolkien family originated in the East Prussian town of Kreuzburg near K nigsberg which had been founded during the medieval German eastward expansion where his earliest known paternal ancestor Michel Tolkien was born around br Michel s son Christianus Tolkien was a wealthy miller in Kreuzburg His son Christian Tolkien moved from Kreuzburg to nearby Danzig and his two sons Daniel Gottlieb Tolkien and Johann later known as John Benjamin Tolkien emigrated to London in the s and became the ancestors of the English family the younger brother was J R R Tolkien s second great grandfather br In John Benjamin Tolkien and William Gravell took over the Erdley Norton manufacture in London which from then on sold clocks and watches under the name Gravell Tolkien Daniel Gottlieb obtained British citizenship in but John Benjamin apparently never became a British citizen Other German relatives joined the two brothers in London Several people with the surname Tolkien or similar spelling some of them members of the same family as J R R Tolkien live in northern Germany but most of them are descendants of people who evacuated East Prussia in at the end of World War II br According to Ryszard Derdzi ski the surname Tolkien is of Low Prussian origin and probably means son descendant of Tolk Tolkien mistakenly believed his surname derived from the German word tollk hn meaning foolhardy and jokingly inserted himself as a cameo into The Notion Club Papers under the literally translated name Rashbold However Derdzi ski has demonstrated this to be a false etymology While J R R Tolkien was aware of his family s German origin his knowledge of the family s history was limited because he was early isolated from the family of his prematurely deceased father br br John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on January in Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State later annexed by the British Empire now Free State Province in the Republic of South Africa to Arthur Reuel Tolkien an English bank manager and his wife Mabel n e Suffield The couple had left England when Arthur was promoted to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked Tolkien had one sibling his younger brother Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien who was born on February br As a child Tolkien was bitten by a large baboon spider in the garden an event some believe to have been later echoed in his stories although he admitted no actual memory of the event as an adult In an earlier incident from Tolkien s infancy a young family servant took the baby to his homestead returning him the next morning br When he was three he went to England with his mother and brother on what was intended to be a lengthy family visit His father however died in South Africa of rheumatic fever before he could join them This left the family without an income so Tolkien s mother took him to live with her parents in Kings Heath Birmingham Soon after in they moved to Sarehole now in Hall Green then a Worcestershire village later annexed to Birmingham He enjoyed exploring Sarehole Mill and Moseley Bog and the Clent Lickey and Malvern Hills which would later inspire scenes in his books along with nearby towns and villages such as Bromsgrove Alcester and Alvechurch and places such as his aunt Jane s farm Bag End the name of which he used in his fiction br br Mabel Tolkien taught her two children at home Ronald as he was known in the family was a keen pupil She taught him a great deal of botany and awakened in him the enjoyment of the look and feel of plants Young Tolkien liked to draw landscapes and trees but his favourite lessons were those concerning languages and his mother taught him the rudiments of Latin very early br Tolkien could read by the age of four and could write fluently soon afterwards His mother allowed him to read many books He disliked Treasure Island and The Pied Piper and thought Alice s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll was amusing but disturbing He liked stories about Red Indians the term then used for Native Americans in adventure stories and works of fantasy by George MacDonald In addition the Fairy Books of Andrew Lang were particularly important to him and their influence is apparent in some of his later writings br br Mabel Tolkien was received into the Roman Catholic Church in despite vehement protests by her Baptist family which stopped all financial assistance to her In when J R R Tolkien was his mother died of acute diabetes at Fern Cottage in Rednal which she was renting She was then about years of age about as old as a person with diabetes mellitus type could survive without treatment insulin would not be discovered until two decades later Nine years after her death Tolkien wrote My own dear mother was a martyr indeed and it is not to everybody that God grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to Hilary and myself giving us a mother who killed herself with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith br Before her death Mabel Tolkien had assigned the guardianship of her sons to her close friend Father Francis Xavier Morgan of the Birmingham Oratory who was assigned to bring them up as good Catholics In a letter to his son Michael Tolkien recalled the influence of the man whom he always called Father Francis He was an upper class Welsh Spaniard Tory and seemed to some just a pottering old gossip He was and he was not I first learned charity and forgiveness from him and in the light of it pierced even the liberal darkness out of which I came knowing more about Bloody Mary than the Mother of Jesus who was never mentioned except as an object of wicked worship by the Romanists After his mother s death Tolkien grew up in the Edgbaston area of Birmingham and attended King Edward s School Birmingham and later St Philip s School In he won a Foundation Scholarship and returned to King Edward s br br While in his early teens Tolkien had his first encounter with a constructed language Animalic an invention of his cousins Mary and Marjorie Incledon At that time he was studying Latin and Anglo Saxon Their interest in Animalic soon died away but Mary and others including Tolkien himself invented a new and more complex language called Nevbosh The next constructed language he came to work with Naffarin would be his own creation Tolkien learned Esperanto some time before Around June he composed The Book of the Foxrook a sixteen page notebook where the earliest example of one of his invented alphabets appears Short texts in this notebook are written in Esperanto br In while they were at King Edward s School Tolkien and three friends Rob Gilson Geoffrey Bache Smith and Christopher Wiseman formed a semi secret society they called the T C B S The initials stood for Tea Club and Barrovian Society alluding to their fondness for drinking tea in Barrow s Stores near the school and secretly in the school library After leaving school the members stayed in touch and in December they held a council in London at Wiseman s home For Tolkien the result of this meeting was a strong dedication to writing poetry br In Tolkien went on a summer holiday in Switzerland a trip that he recollected vividly in a letter noting that Bilbo s journey across the Misty Mountains including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods is directly based on his adventures as their party of hiked from Interlaken to Lauterbrunnen and on to camp in the moraines beyond M rren Fifty seven years later Tolkien remembered his regret at leaving the view of the eternal snows of Jungfrau and Silberhorn the Silvertine Celebdil of my dreams They went across the Kleine Scheidegg to Grindelwald and on across the Grosse Scheidegg to Meiringen They continued across the Grimsel Pass through the upper Valais to Brig and on to the Aletsch glacier and Zermatt br In October of the same year Tolkien began studying at Exeter College Oxford He initially read classics but changed his course in to English language and literature graduating in with first class honours Among his tutors at Oxford was Joseph Wright whose Primer of the Gothic Language had inspired Tolkien as a schoolboy br br At the age of Tolkien met Edith Mary Bratt who was three years his senior when he and his brother Hilary moved into the boarding house where she lived in Duchess Road Edgbaston According to Humphrey Carpenter Edith and Ronald took to frequenting Birmingham teashops especially one which had a balcony overlooking the pavement There they would sit and throw sugarlumps into the hats of passers by moving to the next table when the sugar bowl was empty With two people of their personalities and in their position romance was bound to flourish Both were orphans in need of affection and they found that they could give it to each other During the summer of they decided that they were in love br His guardian Father Morgan considered it altogether unfortunate that his surrogate son was romantically involved with an older Protestant woman Tolkien wrote that the combined tensions contributed to his having muffed his exams Morgan prohibited him from meeting talking to or even corresponding with Edith until he was Tolkien obeyed this prohibition to the letter with one notable early exception over which Father Morgan threatened to cut short his university career if he did not stop br On the evening of his st birthday Tolkien wrote to Edith who was living with family friend C H Jessop at Cheltenham He declared that he had never ceased to love her and asked her to marry him Edith replied that she had already accepted the proposal of George Field the brother of one of her closest school friends But Edith said she had agreed to marry Field only because she felt on the shelf and had begun to doubt that Tolkien still cared for her She explained that because of Tolkien s letter everything had changed br On January Tolkien travelled by train to Cheltenham and was met on the platform by Edith The two took a walk into the countryside sat under a railway viaduct and talked By the end of the day Edith had agreed to accept Tolkien s proposal She wrote to Field and returned her engagement ring Field was dreadfully upset at first and the Field family was insulted and angry Upon learning of Edith s new plans Jessop wrote to her guardian I have nothing to say against Tolkien he is a cultured gentleman but his prospects are poor in the extreme and when he will be in a position to marry I cannot imagine Had he adopted a profession it would have been different br Following their engagement Edith reluctantly announced that she was converting to Catholicism at Tolkien s insistence Jessop like many others of his age and class strongly anti Catholic was infuriated and he ordered Edith to find other lodgings br Edith Bratt and Ronald Tolkien were formally engaged at Birmingham in January and married at St Mary Immaculate Catholic Church at Warwick on March In his letter to Michael Tolkien expressed admiration for his wife s willingness to marry a man with no job little money and no prospects except the likelihood of being killed in the Great War br br In August Britain entered the First World War Tolkien s relatives were shocked when he elected not to volunteer immediately for the British Army In a letter to his son Michael Tolkien recalled In those days chaps joined up or were scorned publicly It was a nasty cleft to be in for a young man with too much imagination and little physical courage Instead Tolkien endured the obloquy and entered a programme by which he delayed enlistment until completing his degree By the time he passed his finals in July Tolkien recalled that the hints were becoming outspoken from relatives He was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the Lancashire Fusiliers on July He trained with the th Reserve Battalion on Cannock Chase Rugeley Camp near to Rugeley Staffordshire for months In a letter to Edith Tolkien complained Gentlemen are rare among the superiors and even human beings rare indeed Following their wedding Lieutenant and Mrs Tolkien took up lodgings near the training camp On June Tolkien received a telegram summoning him to Folkestone for posting to France The Tolkiens spent the night before his departure in a room at the Plough Harrow Hotel in Edgbaston Birmingham He later wrote Junior officers were being killed off a dozen a minute Parting from my wife then it was like a death br br On June Tolkien boarded a troop transport for an overnight voyage to Calais Like other soldiers arriving for the first time he was sent to the British Expeditionary Force s base depot at taples On June he was informed that he had been assigned as a signals officer to the th Service Battalion Lancashire Fusiliers The battalion was part of the th Brigade th Division While waiting to be summoned to his unit Tolkien sank into boredom To pass the time he composed a poem titled The Lonely Isle which was inspired by his feelings during the sea crossing to Calais To evade the British Army s postal censorship he developed a code of dots by which Edith could track his movements He left taples on June and joined his battalion at Rubempr near Amiens He found himself commanding enlisted men who were drawn mainly from the mining milling and weaving towns of Lancashire According to John Garth he felt an affinity for these working class men but military protocol prohibited friendships with other ranks Instead he was required to take charge of them discipline them train them and probably censor their letters If possible he was supposed to inspire their love and loyalty Tolkien later lamented The most improper job of any man is bossing other men Not one in a million is fit for it and least of all those who seek the opportunity br br Tolkien arrived at the Somme in early July In between terms behind the lines at Bouzincourt he participated in the assaults on the Schwaben Redoubt and the Leipzig salient Tolkien s time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith who feared that every knock on the door might carry news of her husband s death Edith could track her husband s movements on a map of the Western Front The Reverend Mervyn S Evers Anglican chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers recorded that Tolkien and his fellow officers were eaten by hordes of lice which found the Medical Officer s ointment merely a kind of hors d oeuvre and the little beggars went at their feast with renewed vigour On October as his battalion attacked Regina Trench Tolkien contracted trench fever a disease carried by lice He was invalided to England on November br According to his children John and Priscilla Tolkien In later years he would occasionally talk of being at the front of the horrors of the first German gas attack of the utter exhaustion and ominous quiet after a bombardment of the whining scream of the shells and the endless marching always on foot through a devastated landscape sometimes carrying the men s equipment as well as his own to encourage them to keep going Some remarkable relics survive from that time a trench map he drew himself pencil written orders to carry bombs to the fighting line br Many of his dearest school friends were killed in the war Among their number were Rob Gilson of the Tea Club and Barrovian Society who was killed on the first day of the Somme while leading his men in the assault on Beaumont Hamel Fellow T C B S member Geoffrey Smith was killed during the battle when a German artillery shell landed on a first aid post Tolkien s battalion was almost completely wiped out following his return to England br br According to John Garth Kitchener s Army in which Tolkien served at once marked existing social boundaries and counteracted the class system by throwing everyone into a desperate situation together Tolkien was grateful writing that it had taught him a deep sympathy and feeling for the Tommy especially the plain soldier from the agricultural counties br br A weak and emaciated Tolkien spent the remainder of the war alternating between hospitals and garrison duties being deemed medically unfit for general service During his recovery in a cottage in Little Haywood Staffordshire he began to work on what he called The Book of Lost Tales beginning with The Fall of Gondolin Lost Tales represented Tolkien s attempt to create a mythology for England a project he would abandon without ever completing Throughout and his illness kept recurring but he had recovered enough to do home service at various camps It was at this time that Edith bore their first child John Francis Reuel Tolkien In a letter Tolkien described his son John as conceived and carried during the starvation year of and the great U boat campaign round about the Battle of Cambrai when the end of the war seemed as far off as it does now Tolkien was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant on January When he was stationed at Kingston upon Hull he and Edith went walking in the woods at nearby Roos and Edith began to dance for him in a clearing among the flowering hemlock After his wife s death in Tolkien remembered br br I never called Edith Luthien but she was the source of the story that in time became the chief part of the Silmarillion It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks at Roos in Yorkshire where I was for a brief time in command of an outpost of the Humber Garrison in and she was able to live with me for a while In those days her hair was raven her skin clear her eyes brighter than you have seen them and she could sing and dance But the story has gone crooked I am left and I cannot plead before the inexorable Mandos br On July Tolkien was taken off active service at Fovant on Salisbury Plain with a temporary disability pension On November Tolkien was demobilized and left the army retaining his rank of lieutenant br br After the end of World War I in Tolkien s first civilian job was at the Oxford English Dictionary where he worked mainly on the history and etymology of words of Germanic origin beginning with the letter W In mid he began to tutor Oxford undergraduates privately most importantly those of Lady Margaret Hall and St Hugh s College given that the women s colleges were in great need of good teachers in their early years and Tolkien as a married academic then still not common was considered suitable as a bachelor don would not have been br In he took up a post as reader in English language at the University of Leeds becoming the youngest member of the academic staff there While at Leeds he produced A Middle English Vocabulary and a definitive edition of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight with E V Gordon both became academic standard works for several decades He also translated Sir Gawain Pearl and Sir Orfeo but the translations would not be published until In he was promoted from a readership at Leeds to a professorship br In October he returned to Oxford as Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo Saxon with a fellowship at Pembroke College During his time at Pembroke College Tolkien wrote The Hobbit and the first two volumes of The Lord of the Rings while living at Northmoor Road in North Oxford In he published a philological essay on the name Nodens following Sir Mortimer Wheeler s unearthing of a Roman Asclepeion at Lydney Park Gloucestershire in br br In the s Tolkien undertook a translation of Beowulf which he finished in but did not publish It was later edited by his son Christopher and published in br Ten years after finishing his translation Tolkien gave a highly acclaimed lecture on the work Beowulf The Monsters and the Critics which had a lasting influence on Beowulf research Lewis E Nicholson said that the article is widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to its purely linguistic elements At the time the consensus of scholarship deprecated Beowulf for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare Tolkien argued that the author of Beowulf was addressing human destiny in general not as limited by particular tribal politics and therefore the monsters were essential to the poem Where Beowulf does deal with specific tribal struggles as at Finnsburg Tolkien argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements In the essay Tolkien revealed how highly he regarded Beowulf Beowulf is among my most valued sources this influence may be seen throughout his Middle earth legendarium br According to Humphrey Carpenter Tolkien began his series of lectures on Beowulf in a most striking way entering the room silently fixing the audience with a look and suddenly declaiming in Old English the opening lines of the poem starting with a great cry of Hw t It was a dramatic impersonation of an Anglo Saxon bard in a mead hall and it made the students realize that Beowulf was not just a set text but a powerful piece of dramatic poetry Decades later W H Auden wrote to his former professor thanking him for the unforgettable experience of hearing him recite Beowulf and stating The voice was the voice of Gandalf br br In the run up to the Second World War Tolkien was earmarked as a codebreaker In January he was asked to serve in the cryptographic department of the Foreign Office in the event of national emergency Beginning on March he took an instructional course at the London HQ of the Government Code and Cypher School He was informed in October that his services would not be required br In Tolkien moved to Merton College Oxford becoming the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature in which post he remained until his retirement in He served as an external examiner for University College Galway now NUI Galway for many years In Tolkien received an honorary degree from the National University of Ireland of which University College Galway was a constituent college Tolkien completed The Lord of the Rings in close to a decade after the first sketches br br The Tolkiens had four children John Francis Reuel Tolkien November January Michael Hilary Reuel Tolkien October February Christopher John Reuel Tolkien November January and Priscilla Mary Anne Reuel Tolkien June February Tolkien was very devoted to his children and sent them illustrated letters from Father Christmas when they were young br br During his life in retirement from up to his death in Tolkien received steadily increasing public attention and literary fame In his friend C S Lewis even nominated him for the Nobel Prize in Literature The sales of his books were so profitable that he regretted that he had not chosen early retirement In a letter he deplored having become a cult figure but admitted that even the nose of a very modest idol cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense br Fan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class Tolkien s status as a best selling author gave them easy entry into polite society but Tolkien deeply missed the company of his fellow Inklings Edith however was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place The genuine and deep affection between Ronald and Edith was demonstrated by their care about the other s health in details like wrapping presents in the generous way he gave up his life at Oxford so she could retire to Bournemouth and in her pride in his becoming a famous author They were tied together too by love for their children and grandchildren br In his retirement Tolkien was a consultant and translator for The Jerusalem Bible published in He was initially assigned a larger portion to translate but due to other commitments only managed to offer some criticisms of other contributors and a translation of the Book of Jonah br br Edith died on November at the age of Ronald returned to Oxford where Merton College gave him convenient rooms near the High Street He missed Edith but enjoyed being back in the city br Tolkien was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours and received the insignia of the Order at Buckingham Palace on March In the same year Oxford University gave him an honorary Doctorate of Letters br He had the name Luthien sic engraved on Edith s tombstone at Wolvercote Cemetery Oxford When Tolkien died months later on September from a bleeding ulcer and chest infection at the age of he was buried in the same grave with Beren added to his name Tolkien s will was proven on December with his estate valued at equivalent to in br br Tolkien s Catholicism was a significant factor in C S Lewis s conversion from atheism to Christianity and it has been suggested that Tolkien was dismayed that Lewis chose to join the Church of England although there seems to be no real evidence of that He once wrote to Rayner Unwin s daughter Camilla who wished to know the purpose of life that it was to increase according to our capacity our knowledge of God by all the means we have and to be moved by it to praise and thanks He had a special devotion to the blessed sacrament writing to his son Michael that in the Blessed Sacrament you will find romance glory honour fidelity and the true way of all your loves upon earth and more than that He accordingly encouraged frequent reception of Holy Communion again writing to his son Michael that the only cure for sagging of fainting faith is Communion He believed the Catholic Church to be true most of all because of the pride of place and the honour in which it holds the Blessed Sacrament In the last years of his life Tolkien resisted the liturgical changes implemented after the Second Vatican Council especially the use of English for the liturgy he continued to make the responses in Latin loudly ignoring the rest of the congregation br br Tolkien s fantasy writings have been said to embody a racist attitude Scholars have noted that he was influenced by Victorian attitudes to race and to a literary tradition of monsters and that he was anti racist in peacetime and during the World Wars With the late th century background of eugenics and a fear of moral decline some critics saw the mention of race mixing in The Lord of the Rings as embodying scientific racism Other commentators saw in Tolkien s orcs a reflection of wartime propaganda caricatures of the Japanese Critics have observed that the work embodies a moral geography with good in the West evil in the East Against this scholars have noted that Tolkien was outraged in peacetime by Nazi racial theory while during the Second World War he was equally disgusted by anti German racial propaganda Other scholars have stated that Tolkien s Middle earth is definitely polycultural and polylingual and that attacks on Tolkien based on The Lord of the Rings often omit evidence from the text br br During most of his own life conservationism was not yet on the political agenda and Tolkien himself did not directly express conservationist views except in some private letters in which he tells about his fondness for forests and sadness at tree felling In later years a number of authors of biographies or literary analyses of Tolkien conclude that during his writing of The Lord of the Rings Tolkien gained increased interest in the value of wild and untamed nature and in protecting what wild nature was left in the industrialized world br br Tolkien s fantasy books on Middle earth especially The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion drew on a wide array of influences including his philological interest in language Christianity medievalism mythology archaeology ancient and modern literature and personal experience His philological work centred on the study of Old English literature especially Beowulf and he acknowledged its importance to his writings He was a gifted linguist influenced by Germanic Celtic Finnish and Greek language and mythology Commentators have attempted to identify many literary and topological antecedents for characters places and events in Tolkien s writings Some writers were important to him including the Arts and Crafts polymath William Morris and he undoubtedly made use of some real place names such as Bag End the name of his aunt s home He acknowledged too John Buchan and H Rider Haggard authors of modern adventure stories that he enjoyed The effects of some specific experiences have been identified Tolkien s childhood in the English countryside and its urbanization by the growth of Birmingham influenced his creation of the Shire while his personal experience of fighting in the trenches of the First World War affected his depiction of Mordor br br In addition to writing fiction Tolkien was an author of academic literary criticism His seminal lecture later published as an article revolutionized the treatment of the Anglo Saxon epic Beowulf by literary critics The essay remains highly influential in the study of Old English literature to this day Beowulf is one of the most significant influences upon Tolkien s later fiction with major details of both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings being adapted from the poem br br This essay discusses the fairy story as a literary form It was initially written as the Andrew Lang Lecture at the University of St Andrews Scotland Tolkien focuses on Andrew Lang s work as a folklorist and collector of fairy tales He disagreed with Lang s broad inclusion in his Fairy Book collections of traveller s tales beast fables and other types of stories Tolkien held a narrower perspective viewing fairy stories as those that took place in Faerie an enchanted realm with or without fairies as characters He viewed them as the natural development of the interaction of human imagination and human language br br In addition to his mythopoeic compositions Tolkien enjoyed inventing fantasy stories to entertain his children He wrote annual Christmas letters from Father Christmas for them building up a series of short stories later compiled and published as The Father Christmas Letters Other works included Mr Bliss and Roverandom for children and Leaf by Niggle part of Tree and Leaf The Adventures of Tom Bombadil Smith of Wootton Major and Farmer Giles of Ham Roverandom and Smith of Wootton Major like The Hobbit borrowed ideas from his legendarium br br Tolkien never expected his stories to become popular but by sheer accident a book called The Hobbit which he had written some years before for his own children came in to the attention of Susan Dagnall an employee of the London publishing firm George Allen Unwin who persuaded Tolkien to submit it for publication When it was published a year later the book attracted adult readers as well as children and it became popular enough for the publishers to ask Tolkien to produce a sequel br br The request for a sequel prompted Tolkien to begin what became his most famous work the epic novel The Lord of the Rings originally published in three volumes in Tolkien spent more than ten years writing the primary narrative and appendices for The Lord of the Rings during which time he received the constant support of the Inklings in particular his closest friend C S Lewis the author of The Chronicles of Narnia Both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are set against the background of The Silmarillion but in a time long after it br Tolkien at first intended The Lord of the Rings to be a children s tale in the style of The Hobbit but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing Though a direct sequel to The Hobbit it addressed an older audience drawing on the immense backstory of Beleriand that Tolkien had constructed in previous years and which eventually saw posthumous publication in The Silmarillion and other volumes Tolkien strongly influenced the fantasy genre that grew up after the book s success br The Lord of the Rings became immensely popular in the s and has remained so ever since ranking as one of the most popular works of fiction of the th century judged by both sales and reader surveys In the Big Read survey conducted by the BBC The Lord of the Rings was found to be the UK s Best loved Novel Australians voted The Lord of the Rings My Favourite Book in a survey conducted by the Australian ABC In a poll of Amazon com customers The Lord of the Rings was judged to be their favourite book of the millennium In Tolkien was voted the nd greatest Briton in a poll conducted by the BBC and in he was voted th in the SABC s Great South Africans the only person to appear in both lists His popularity is not limited to the English speaking world in a poll inspired by the UK s Big Read survey about Germans found The Lord of the Rings to be their favourite work of literature br br Tolkien wrote a brief Sketch of the Mythology which included the tales of Beren and L thien and of T rin and that sketch eventually evolved into the Quenta Silmarillion an epic history that Tolkien started three times but never published Tolkien desperately hoped to publish it along with The Lord of the Rings but publishers both Allen Unwin and Collins declined Moreover printing costs were very high in s Britain requiring The Lord of the Rings to be published in three volumes The story of this continuous redrafting is told in the posthumous series The History of Middle earth edited by Tolkien s son Christopher Tolkien From around Tolkien began to extend this framework to include the tale of The Fall of N menor which was inspired by the legend of Atlantis br Tolkien appointed his son Christopher to be his literary executor and he with assistance from Guy Gavriel Kay later a well known fantasy author in his own right organized some of this material into a single coherent volume published as The Silmarillion in It received the Locus Award for Best Fantasy novel in br br In Christopher Tolkien published a collection of more fragmentary material under the title Unfinished Tales of N menor and Middle earth In subsequent years he published a large amount of the remaining unpublished materials together with notes and extensive commentary in a series of twelve volumes called The History of Middle earth They contain unfinished abandoned alternative and outright contradictory accounts since they were always a work in progress for Tolkien and he only rarely settled on a definitive version for any of the stories There is not complete consistency between The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit the two most closely related works because Tolkien never fully integrated all their traditions into each other He commented in while editing The Hobbit for a third edition that he would have preferred to rewrite the book completely because of the style of its prose br br Before his death Tolkien negotiated the sale of the manuscripts drafts proofs and other materials related to his then published works including The Lord of the Rings The Hobbit and Farmer Giles of Ham to the Department of Special Collections and University Archives at Marquette University s John P Raynor S J Library in Milwaukee Wisconsin After his death his estate donated the papers containing Tolkien s Silmarillion mythology and his academic work to the Bodleian Library at Oxford University The Bodleian Library held an exhibition of his work in including more than items which had never been seen in public before br In a partial draft of Language and Human Nature which Tolkien had begun co writing with C S Lewis but had never completed was discovered at the Bodleian Library br br Both Tolkien s academic career and his literary production are inseparable from his love of language and philology He specialized in English philology at university and in graduated with Old Norse as his special subject He worked on the Oxford English Dictionary from and is credited with having worked on a number of words starting with the letter W including walrus over which he struggled mightily In he became Reader in English Language at the University of Leeds where he claimed credit for raising the number of students of linguistics from five to twenty He gave courses in Old English heroic verse history of English various Old English and Middle English texts Old and Middle English philology introductory Germanic philology Gothic Old Icelandic and Medieval Welsh When in aged thirty three Tolkien applied for the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo Saxon at Pembroke College Oxford he boasted that his students of Germanic philology in Leeds had even formed a Viking Club He had a certain if imperfect knowledge of Finnish br Privately Tolkien was attracted to things of racial and linguistic significance and in his lecture English and Welsh which is crucial to his understanding of race and language he entertained notions of inherent linguistic predilections which he termed the native language as opposed to the cradle tongue which a person first learns to speak He considered the West Midlands dialect of Middle English to be his own native language and as he wrote to W H Auden in I am a West midlander by blood and took to early west midland Middle English as a known tongue as soon as I set eyes on it br br Parallel to Tolkien s professional work as a philologist and sometimes overshadowing this work to the effect that his academic output remained rather thin was his affection for constructing languages The most developed of these are Quenya and Sindarin the etymological connection between which formed the core of much of Tolkien s legendarium Language and grammar for Tolkien was a matter of aesthetics and euphony and Quenya in particular was designed from phonaesthetic considerations it was intended as an Elven latin and was phonologically based on Latin with ingredients from Finnish Welsh English and Greek br Tolkien considered languages inseparable from the mythology associated with them and he consequently took a dim view of auxiliary languages in a congress of Esperantists were told as much by him in his lecture A Secret Vice Your language construction will breed a mythology but by he had concluded that Volap k Esperanto Ido Novial c c are dead far deader than ancient unused languages because their authors never invented any Esperanto legends br The popularity of Tolkien s books has had a small but lasting effect on the use of language in fantasy literature in particular and even on mainstream dictionaries which today commonly accept Tolkien s idiosyncratic spellings dwarves and dwarvish alongside dwarfs and dwarfish which had been little used since the mid th century and earlier In fact according to Tolkien had the Old English plural survived it would have been dwarrows or dwerrows He coined the term eucatastrophe used mainly in connection with his own work br br Tolkien learnt to paint and draw as a child and continued to do so all his adult life From early in his writing career the development of his stories was accompanied by drawings and paintings especially of landscapes and by maps of the lands in which the tales were set He produced pictures to accompany the stories told to his own children including those later published in Mr Bliss and Roverandom and sent them elaborately illustrated letters purporting to come from Father Christmas Although he regarded himself as an amateur the publisher used the author s own cover art his maps and full page illustrations for the early editions of The Hobbit He prepared maps and illustrations for The Lord of the Rings but the first edition contained only the maps his calligraphy for the inscription on the One Ring and his ink drawing of the Doors of Durin Much of his artwork was collected and published in as a book J R R Tolkien Artist and Illustrator The book discusses Tolkien s paintings drawings and sketches and reproduces approximately examples of his work Catherine McIlwaine curated a major exhibition of Tolkien s artwork at the Bodleian Library Tolkien Maker of Middle earth accompanied by a book of the same name that analyses Tolkien s achievement and illustrates the full range of the types of artwork that he created br br While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien the great success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings led directly to a popular resurgence and the shaping of the modern fantasy genre This
