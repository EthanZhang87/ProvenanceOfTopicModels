In fantasy fiction a lich from the Old English l meaning corpse is a type of undead creature br Various works of fantasy fiction such as Clark Ashton Smith s The Empire of the Necromancers had used lich as a general term for any corpse animated or inanimate before the term s specific use in fantasy role playing games The more recent use of the term lich for a specific type of undead creature originates from the Dungeons Dragons role playing game booklet Greyhawk written by Gary Gygax and Rob Kuntz br Often such a creature is the result of a willful transformation as a powerful wizard skilled in necromancy who seeks eternal life uses rare substances in a magical ritual to become undead Unlike zombies which are often depicted as mindless liches are sapient revenants retaining their previous intelligence and magical abilities Liches are often depicted as holding power over lesser mindless undead soldiers and servants br A lich s most often depicted distinguishing feature from other undead in fantasy fiction is the method of achieving immortality liches give up their souls to form soul artifacts called a soul gem or phylactery in other fantasy works the source of their magic and immortality Many liches take precautions to hide and or safeguard one or more soul artifacts that anchor a part of a lich s soul to the material world If the corporeal body of a lich is killed that portion of the lich s soul that had remained in the body does not pass on to the next world but will rather exist in a non corporeal form capable of being resurrected in the near future However if all of the lich s soul artifacts are destroyed then the lich s only anchor in the material world would be the corporeal body whereupon destruction will cause permanent death br br Lich is an archaic English word for corpse the gate at the lowest end of the cemetery where the coffin and funerary procession usually entered was commonly referred to as the lich gate This gate was quite often covered by a small roof where part of the funerary service could be carried out Liches are sometimes depicted using a magical device called a phylactery to anchor their souls to the physical world so that if their body is destroyed they can rise again over and over as long as the phylactery remains intact br br The lich developed from monsters found in earlier classic sword and sorcery fiction which is filled with powerful sorcerers who use their magic to triumph over death Many of Clark Ashton Smith s short stories feature powerful wizards whose magic enables them to return from the dead Several stories by Robert E Howard such as the novella Skull Face and the short story Scarlet Tears feature undying sorcerers who retain a semblance of life through mystical means their bodies reduced to shriveled husks with which they manage to maintain inhuman mobility and active thought Gary Gygax one of the co creators of Dungeons Dragons stated that he based the description of a lich included in the game on the short story The Sword of the Sorcerer by Gardner Fox The term lich used as an archaic word for corpse or body is commonly used in these stories Ambrose Bierce s tale of possession The Death of Halpin Frayser features the word in its introduction referring to a corpse H P Lovecraft also used the word in The Thing on the Doorstep published where the narrator refers to the corpse of his friend possessed by a sorcerer Other imagery surrounding demiliches in particular that of a jeweled skull is drawn from the early Fritz Leiber story Thieves House br br Acererak
