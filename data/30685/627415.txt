Nerdcore is a genre of hip hop music characterized by subject matter considered of interest to nerds and geeks Self described nerdcore musician MC Frontalot has the earliest known recorded use of the term to describe this genre in the song Nerdcore Hiphop Frontalot like most nerdcore artists self publishes his work and has released much of it for free online As a niche genre nerdcore generally holds to the DIY ethic and has a history of self publishing and self production br Though nerdcore rappers rhyme about anything from politics to science fiction there are some perennial favorites in nerdcore subject matter including anime Star Wars role playing games science fantasy and computers br Music with similar themes but different musical styles can be found in the filk and geek rock genres There are hip hop artists who have recorded compositions which focus on similar topics but who are not generally considered nerdcore Examples would be Blackalicious a group which does not claim to be nerdcore despite science oriented songs like Chemical Calisthenics and MF DOOM who was heavily inspired by comic book supervillains but is generally seen as more conventional hip hop Conversely one does not need to concentrate on those topics to be nerdcore most of the songs by Frontalot do not focus narrowly on stereotypically nerdy topics The difference is largely one of self identification the group Blackalicious does not identify as nerds while Frontalot does br br br Sound br br Being more defined by lyrics nerdcore has no unifying musical sound and the sound of nerdcore varies wildly from artist to artist One common theme especially in the early days of the genre is uncleared sampling MC Frontalot addressed this directly in his song Good Old Clyde a thank you of sorts to Clyde Stubblefield for the funky drummer break which was sampled to provide the song s beat Sources for samples in nerdcore range from Vanilla Ice to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Rondo Alla Turca in MC Plus s Computer Science for Life YTCracker s Nerdrap Entertainment System is an entire album made up primarily of samples from bit Nintendo games Another notable artist Random created an album dedicated to the Mega Man video games in titled MegaRan Though some artists have moved away from this Frontalot for example completely remixed several songs to remove uncleared samples before releasing them commercially on his album Nerdcore Rising it is still quite common as most nerdcore tracks are released non commercially and thus attract little to no attention from the RIAA br Several DJs have provided beats and done remixes for multiple nerdcore artists most notably Baddd Spellah who currently mixes the majority of Frontalot s tracks Spellah also won a remix competition in br br br History br br br The earliest known recorded use of the term nerdcore hip hop was in by MC Frontalot However prior to that time artists as varied as the Beastie Boys Kool Keith Deltron MC Ft Jesus MC Paul Barman Company Flow and MF Doom began exploring topics far outside the traditional hip hop culture including stereotypically nerdy topics like space and science fiction Though these underground artists were generally outside geek culture and are not considered nerdcore they can be said to have set the stage for artists like Frontalot who has listed several of them as influences Beastie Boys outer space sci fi themed album Hello Nasty in including among other potentially influencing tracks the spacey robotic Intergalactic and the distinctively video game sound themed song Unite garnered mainstream recognition years ahead of the popular movement Nerdcore had clear influences from geek culture as well including geek rockers like They Might Be Giants parodists like Weird Al Yankovic who released the rap songs I Can t Watch This in It s All About the Pentiums in White Nerdy in and Foil in and others br br In the summer of the fledgling genre took a large step forward when the popular web comic Penny Arcade held its first convention The Penny Arcade Expo in Bellevue WA Though the expo was primarily devoted to video and table top gaming geek friendly musicians also performed including Penny Arcade s official rapper MC Frontalot and Optimus Rhyme br The next year two full concerts took place at the Penny Arcade Expo and included nerdy hip hop acts MC Frontalot and Optimus Rhyme After the expo all three acts would have the nerdcore label permanently affixed to them Thanks to the popularity of these acts the nerdcore fan base began to form and in some cases those fans would go on to become nerdcore artists themselves br Also in the new subgenre of geeksta rap named for gangsta rap emerged largely independently of more traditional nerdcore The difference was in both lyrics and attitude the geeksta artists mostly computer scientists focused on proclaiming their prowess with computers and other technical abilities This braggadocio led to the first nerdcore feud between MC Plus and Monzy br br In nerdcore rapper Jason Z Christie a k a High C created the first websites dedicated solely to the genre of nerdcore NerdcoreHipHop org and RhymeTorrents com The sites quickly became the foundation of the scene s online community Along with the websites High C also created the world s first all nerdcore hip hop compilation CD The Rhyme Torrents Compilation consisted of numerous volumes and dozens and dozens of tracks by various artists Soon after the release of the cds Nerdcore as a genre began getting mainstream press attention High C also appeared in Wired Magazine and the film Nerdcore for Life He was removed from the release version of the documentary Nerdcore Rising br Additionally in MC Lars s single Download This Song which critiqued the music industry s stance on digital downloading and highlighted the battles many faced with the RIAA charted at number on the ARIA Chart This not only amplified the reach of nerdcore but also underscored the significance of digital culture and the internet within the evolving landscape of hip hop music br Each summer from July to nerdcore rappers and other nerd music acts gathered in Orlando Florida for an event named Nerdapalooza a nerd music charity festival based on bringing various genres of nerd music together into one large production br Glitched The Dutch Nerdcore Event was the first major all nerdcore event to be held outside the United States It took place at Club Panama in Amsterdam in February and featured the European premiere of the documentary Nerdcore for Life as well as performances of four rappers from the film MC Lars YTCracker Beefy and MC Router br As of the late s to early s a branch of Nerdcore has taken off of YouTube where musicians create songs about
