and dawn or entering water alone Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane but the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time The myth is suggested to have arisen in part because dolphin genitalia bear a resemblance to those of humans Others believe the myth served and

the act The most famous case would be the Monkey King a mischievous trickster who often utilizes his power of transformations to thwart his foes br br Shapeshifting may be used as a plot device such as when Puss in Boots in the fairy tales tricks the ogre into becoming a mouse to be eaten Shapeshifting may also include symbolic significance like the Beast s transformation in Beauty and the Beast indicates Belle s ability to accept him despite his appearance br When a form is taken on involuntarily the thematic effect can be one of confinement and restraint the person is bound to the new form In extreme cases such as petrifaction the character is entirely disabled On the other hand voluntary shapeshifting can be a means of escape and liberation Even when the form is not undertaken to resemble a literal escape the abilities specific to the form allow the character to act in a manner that was previously impossible br Examples of this are in fairy tales A prince who is forced into a bear s shape as in East of the Sun and West of the Moon is a prisoner but a princess who takes on a bear s shape voluntarily to flee a situation as in The She Bear escapes with her new shape In the Earthsea books Ursula K Le Guin depicts an animal form as slowly transforming the wizard s mind so that the dolphin bear or other creature forgets it was human making it impossible to change back This makes an example of a voluntary shapeshifting becoming an imprisoning metamorphosis br Beyond this the uses of shapeshifting transformation and metamorphosis in fiction are as protean as the forms the characters take on Some are rare such as Italo Calvino s The Canary Prince is a Rapunzel variant in which shape shifting is used to gain access to the tower br br In many cases imposed forms are punitive This may be a just punishment the nature of the transformation matching the crime for which it occurs in other cases the form is unjustly imposed by an angry and powerful person In fairy tales such transformations are usually temporary but they commonly appear as the resolution of myths as in many of the Metamorphoses or produce origin myths br br In many fairy tales and ballads as in Child Ballad The Twa Magicians or Farmer Weathersky a magical chase occurs where the pursued endlessly takes on forms in an effort to shake off the pursuer and the pursuer answers with shapeshifting as a dove is answered with a hawk and a hare with a greyhound The pursued may finally succeed in escape or the pursuer in capturing br The Grimm Brothers fairy tale Foundling Bird contains this as the bulk of the plot In the Italian Campania Fables collection of Pentamerone by Gianbattista Basile tells of a Neapolitan princess who to escape from her father who had imprisoned her becomes a huge she bear The magic happens due to a potion given to her by an old witch The girl once gone can regain her human aspect br In other variants the pursued may transform various objects into obstacles as in the fairy tale The Master Maid where the Master Maid transforms a wooden comb into a forest a lump of salt into a mountain and a flask of water into a sea In these tales the pursued normally escapes after overcoming three obstacles This obstacle chase is literally found worldwide in many variants in every region br In fairy tales of the Aarne Thompson type A The Girl Helps the Hero Flee such a chase is an integral part of the tale It can be either a transformation chase as in The Grateful Prince King Kojata Foundling Bird Jean the Soldier and Eulalie the Devil s Daughter or The Two Kings Children or an obstacle chase as in The Battle of the Birds The White Dove or The Master Maid br In a similar effect a captive may shapeshift to break a hold on him Proteus and Nereus s shapeshifting was to prevent heroes such as Menelaus and Heracles from forcing information from them Tam Lin once seized by Janet was transformed by the faeries to keep Janet from taking him but as he had advised her she did not let go and so freed him The motif of capturing a person by holding him through many transformations is found in folktales throughout Europe and Patricia A McKillip references it in her Riddle Master trilogy a shape shifting Earthmaster finally wins its freedom by startling the man holding it br br One motif is a shape change in order to obtain abilities in the new form Berserkers were held to change into wolves and bears to fight more effectively In many cultures evil magicians could transform into animal shapes and thus skulk about br In many fairy tales the hero s talking animal helper proves to be a shapeshifted human being able to help him in its animal form In one variation featured in The Three Enchanted Princes and The Death of Koschei the Deathless the hero s three sisters have been married to animals These prove to be shapeshifted men who aid their brother in law in a variant of tale types br In an early Mayan text the Shapeshifter or Mestaclocan can change his appearance and manipulate the minds of animals In one tale the Mestaclocan finds a dying eagle Changing into the form of an eagle he convinces the dying bird that it is in fact not dying As the story goes they both soar into the heavens and live together for eternity br br Beauty and the Beast has been interpreted as a young woman s coming of age in which she changes from being repulsed by sexual activity and regarding a husband therefore bestial to a mature woman who can marry br br Some shapeshifters can change form only if they have some item usually an article of clothing In Bisclavret by Marie de France a werewolf cannot regain human form without his clothing but in wolf form does no harm to anyone However the most common use of this motif is in tales where a man steals the article and forces the shapeshifter trapped in human form to become his bride This lasts until she discovers where he has hidden the article and she can flee Selkies feature in these tales Others include swan maidens and the Japanese tennin br Swedish writer Selma Lagerl f in The Wonderful Adventures of Nils included a version of the story with the typical elements fisherman sees mermaids dancing on an island and steals the sealskin of one of them preventing her from becoming a seal again so that he could marry her and linked it to the founding of the city of Stockholm br br The power to externally transform can symbolize an internal savagery a central theme in many strands of werewolf mythology and the inversion of the liberation theme as in Dr Jekyll s transformation into Mr Hyde br br Some transformations are performed to remove the victim from his place so that the transformer can usurp it Bisclaveret s wife steals his clothing and traps him in wolf form because she has a lover A witch in The Wonderful Birch changed a mother into a sheep to take her place and had the mother slaughtered when her stepdaughter married the king the witch transformed her into a reindeer to

is removed In Brother and Sister when two children flee from their cruel stepmother she enchants the streams along the way to transform them While the brother refrains from the first two which threaten to turn them into tigers and wolves he is too thirsty at the third which turns him into a deer The Six Swans are transformed into swans by their stepmother as are the Children of Lir in Irish mythology br br Many fairy tale characters have expressed ill advised wishes to have any child at all even one that has another form and had such children born to them At the end of the fairy tale normally after marriage such children metamorphose into human form Hans My Hedgehog was born when his father wished for a child even a hedgehog Even stranger forms are possible Giambattista Basile included in his Pentamerone the tale of a girl born as a sprig of myrtle and Italo Calvino in his Italian Folktales a girl born as an apple br Sometimes the parent who wishes for a child is told how to gain one but does not obey the directions perfectly resulting in a transformed birth In Prince Lindworm the woman eats two onions but does not peel one resulting in her first child being a lindworm In Tatterhood a woman magically produces two flowers but disobeys the directions to eat only the beautiful one resulting in her having a beautiful and sweet daughter but only after a disgusting and hideous one br Less commonly ill advised wishes can transform a person after birth The Seven Ravens are transformed when their father thinks his sons are playing instead of fetching water to christen their newborn and sickly sister and curses them In Puddocky when three princes start to quarrel over the beautiful heroine a witch curses her because of the noise br br Such wished for children may become monstrous brides or bridegrooms These tales have often been interpreted as symbolically representing arranged marriages the bride s revulsion to marrying a stranger is symbolized by his bestial form br The heroine must fall in love with the transformed groom The hero or heroine must marry as promised and the monstrous form is removed by the wedding Sir Gawain thus transformed the Loathly lady although he was told that this was halfway she could at his choice be beautiful by day and hideous by night or vice versa he told her that he would choose what she preferred which broke the spell entirely In Tatterhood Tatterhood is transformed by her asking her bridegroom why he didn t ask her why she rode a goat why she carried a spoon and why she was so ugly and when he asked her denying it and therefore transforming her goat into a horse her spoon into a fan and herself into a beauty Puddocky is transformed when her prince after she had helped him with two other tasks tells him that his father has sent him for a bride A similar effect is found in Child ballad Kemp Owyne where the hero can transform a dragon back into a maiden by kissing her three times br Sometimes the bridegroom removes his animal skin for the wedding night whereupon it can be burned Hans My Hedgehog The Donkey and The Pig King fall under this grouping At an extreme in Prince Lindworm the bride who avoids being eaten by the lindworm bridegroom arrives at her wedding wearing every gown she owns and she tells the bridegroom she will remove one of hers if he removes one of his only when her last gown comes off has he removed his last skin and become a white shape that she can form into a man br In some tales the hero or heroine must obey a prohibition the bride must spend a period not seeing the transformed groom in human shape as in East of the Sun and West of the Moon or the bridegroom must not burn the animals skins In The Brown Bear of Norway The Golden Crab The Enchanted Snake and some variants of The Frog Princess burning the skin is a catastrophe putting the transformed bride or bridegroom in danger In these tales the prohibition is broken invariably resulting in a separation and a search by one spouse for the other br br Ghosts sometimes appear in animal form In The Famous Flower of Serving Men the heroine s murdered husband appears to the king as a white dove lamenting her fate over his own grave In The White and the Black Bride and The Three Little Men in the Wood the murdered drowned true bride reappears as a white duck In The Rose Tree and The Juniper Tree the murdered children become birds who avenge their own deaths There are African folk tales of murder victims avenging themselves in the form of crocodiles that can shapeshift into human form br In some fairy tales the character can reveal himself in every new form and so a usurper repeatedly kills the victim in every new form as in Beauty and Pock Face A String of Pearls Twined with Golden Flowers and The Boys with the Golden Stars This eventually leads to a form in which the character or characters can reveal the truth to someone able to stop the villain br Similarly the transformation back may be acts that would be fatal In The Wounded Lion the prescription for turning the lion back into a prince was to kill him chop him to pieces burn the pieces and throw the ash into the water Less drastic but no less fatal the fox in The Golden Bird the foals in The Seven Foals and the cats in Lord Peter and The White Cat tell the heroes of those stories to cut off their heads this restores
