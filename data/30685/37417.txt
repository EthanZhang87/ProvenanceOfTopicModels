Mercury Latin Mercurius m r k rij s is a major god in Roman religion and mythology being one of the Dii Consentes within the ancient Roman pantheon He is the god of financial gain commerce eloquence messages communication including divination travelers boundaries luck trickery and thieves he also serves as the guide of souls to the underworld and the messenger of the gods br In Roman mythology he was the son of Maia one of the seven daughters of the Titan Atlas and Jupiter In his earliest forms he appears to have been related to the Etruscan deity Turms both gods share characteristics with the Greek god Hermes He is often depicted holding the caduceus in his left hand Similar to his Greek equivalent Hermes he was awarded a magic wand by Apollo which later turned into the caduceus the staff with intertwined snakes br br The name Mercury is possibly related to the Latin words merx merchandise cf merchant commerce etc mercari to trade and merces wages another possible connection is the Proto Indo European root mer for boundary border cf Old English mearc Old Norse mark and Latin marg and Greek by analogy of Arct rus as the keeper of boundaries referring to his role as bridge between the upper and lower worlds br br Mercury did not appear among the numinous di indigetes of early Roman religion Rather he subsumed the earlier Dei Lucrii as Roman religion was syncretized with Greek religion during the time of the Roman Republic starting around the th century BC His cult was introduced also by influence of Etruscan religion in which Turms had similar characteristics From the beginning Mercury had essentially the same aspects as Hermes wearing winged shoes talaria and a winged hat petasos and carrying the caduceus a herald s staff with two entwined snakes that was Apollo s gift to Hermes He was often accompanied by a rooster herald of the new day a ram or goat symbolizing fertility and a tortoise referring to Mercury s legendary invention of the lyre from a tortoise shell br Like Hermes he was also a god of messages eloquence and of trade particularly of the grain trade He was the patron of travelers and the god of thievery as well Mercury was also considered a god of abundance and commercial success particularly in Gaul where he was said to have been particularly revered He was also like Hermes the Romans psychopomp leading newly deceased souls to the afterlife Additionally Ovid wrote that Mercury carried Morpheus s dreams from the valley of Somnus to sleeping humans br Archeological evidence from Pompeii suggests that Mercury was among the most popular of Roman gods The god of commerce was depicted on two early bronze coins of the Roman Republic the sextans and the semuncia br br When they described the gods of Celtic and Germanic tribes rather than considering them separate deities the Romans interpreted them as local manifestations or aspects of their own gods a cultural trait called the interpretatio romana Mercury in particular was reported as becoming extremely popular among the nations the Roman Empire conquered Julius Caesar wrote of Mercury being the most popular god in Britain and Gaul regarded as the inventor of all the arts This is probably because in the Roman syncretism Mercury was equated with the Celtic god Lugus and in this aspect was commonly accompanied by the Celtic goddess Rosmerta Although Lugus may originally have been a deity of light or the sun though this is disputed similar to the Roman Apollo his importance as a god of trade made him more comparable to Mercury and Apollo was instead equated with the Celtic deity Belenus br Romans associated Mercury with the Germanic god Wotan by interpretatio romana st century Roman writer Tacitus identifies him as the chief god of the Germanic peoples This association of Mercury and Wotan is seen in the English language day name Wednesday and the French Mercredi br br Mercury is known to the Romans as Mercurius and occasionally in earlier writings as Merqurius Mirqurios or Mircurios had a number of epithets representing different aspects or roles or representing syncretisms with non Roman deities The most common and significant of these epithets included the following br br Mercurius Artaios a syncretism of Mercury with the Celtic god Artaios a deity of bears and hunting who was worshipped at Beaucroissant France br Mercurius Arvernus a syncretism of the Celtic Arvernus with Mercury Arvernus was worshipped in the Rhineland possibly as a particular deity of the Arverni tribe though no dedications to Mercurius Arvernus occur in their territory in the Auvergne region of central France br Mercurius Cimbrianus a syncretism of Mercury with a god of the Cimbri sometimes thought to represent Odin br Mercurius Cissonius a combination of Mercury with the Celtic god Cissonius who is written of in the area spanning from Cologne Germany to Saintes France br Mercurius Esibraeus a syncretism of the Iberian deity Esibraeus with the Roman deity Mercury Esibraeus is mentioned only in an inscription found at Medelim Portugal and is possibly the same deity as Banda Isibraiegus who is invoked in an inscription from the nearby village of Bemposta br Mercurius Gebrinius a syncretism of Mercury with the Celtic or Germanic Gebrinius known from an inscription on an altar in Bonn Germany br Mercurius Moccus from a Celtic god Moccus who was equated with Mercury known from evidence at Langres France The name Moccus pig implies that this deity was connected to boar hunting br Mercurius Sobrius Mercury the Teetotaler a syncretism of Mercury with a Carthaginian god of commerce br Mercurius Visucius a syncretism of the Celtic god Visucius with the Roman god Mercury attested in an inscription from Stuttgart Germany Visucius was worshipped primarily in the frontier area of the empire in Gaul and Germany Although he was primarily associated with Mercury Visucius was also sometimes linked to the Roman god Mars as a dedicatory inscription to Mars Visucius and Visucia Visicius female counterpart was found in Gaul br br In Virgil s Aeneid Mercury reminds Aeneas of his mission to found the city of Rome In Ovid s Fasti Mercury is assigned to escort the nymph Larunda to the underworld Mercury however falls in love with Larunda and makes love to her on the way Larunda thereby becomes mother to two children referred to as the Lares invisible household gods br br Mercury s temple in Rome was situated in the Circus Maximus between the Aventine and Palatine Hills and was built in BC br That year saw disturbances at Rome between the patrician senators and the plebeians which led to a secession of the plebs in the following year At the completion of its construction a dispute emerged between the consuls Appius Claudius Sabinus Regillensis and Publius Servilius Priscus Structus as to which of them should have the honour of dedicating the temple br The Roman Senate referred the decision to the popular assembly and also decreed that whichever was chosen should also exercise additional duties including presiding over the markets establish a merchants guild and exercising the functions of the pontifex maximus The people because of the ongoing public discord and in order to spite the senate and the consuls instead awarded the honour of dedicating the temple to Marcus Laetorius the senior military officer of one of the legions The senate and the consuls in particular the conservative Appius were outraged at this decision and it inflamed the ongoing situation br The dedication occurred on May BC br The temple was regarded as a fitting place to worship a swift god of trade and travel since it was a major center of commerce as well as a racetrack Since it stood between the plebeian stronghold on the Aventine and the patrician center on the Palatine it also emphasized the role of Mercury as a mediator br br Because Mercury was not one of the early deities surviving from the Roman Kingdom he was not assigned a flamen priest but he did have his own major festival on May the Mercuralia During the Mercuralia merchants sprinkled water from his sacred well near the Porta Capena on their heads br br Mercury features in the first published comic book story of Jack Kirby Mercury in the th Century published in Red Raven Comics br The United States so called Mercury dime issued from to actually features a Winged Liberty and not the god Mercury but despite wearing a Phrygian cap instead of a winged helm the coin bears his name due to resemblance br Mercury is one of the playable
