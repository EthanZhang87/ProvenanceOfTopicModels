An egregore also spelled egregor from French gr gore from Ancient Greek egr goros wakeful is a concept in Western esotericism of a non physical entity or thoughtform that arises from the collective thoughts and emotions of a distinct group of individuals br br In magical and other occult traditions it is typically seen as having an independent existence but in other kinds of esotericism it is merely the collective mind of a religious community either esoteric or exoteric In the latter sense as a collective mind the term collective entity preferred by Ren Gu non is synonymous with egregore See the usage overview below br In the apocryphal Book of Enoch the term had referred to angelic beings known as watchers and it was also used by associated Enochian traditions to refer to the specific rituals and practices associated with these entities Some other literary and religious works such as The Manuscript Found in Saragossa have also made references to these angelic beings br br Egregores had been quite independent entities in the Book of Enoch and there was then no notion of them arising from a collective In literature especially older literature egregores have often been straightforward references to these Enochian entities This was the case in Jan Potocki s novel The Manuscript Found in Saragossa which referred to egregores as the most illustrious of fallen angels The French author Victor Hugo in La L gende des si cles The Legend of the Ages also uses the word gr gore first as an adjective then as a noun while leaving the meaning obscure br br The Traditionalist School philosopher Julius Evola in his Revolt Against the Modern World referred to an elite of spiritually aware people who keep Tradition alive as those who are awake whom in Greek are called the apparently alluding to the Watchers and the most literal sense of their name which is wakeful or awake br br In esotericism the term egregore has been used to denote a group mind or collective consciousness of a religious community As Ren Gu non said the collective in its psychic as well as its corporeal aspects is nothing but a simple extension of the individual and thus has absolutely nothing transcendent with respect to it as opposed to spiritual influences which are of a wholly different order This usage was followed by Gnosis magazine and by Olavo de Carvalho and according to Gu non began with liphas L vi See the section on the history of this usage br br Some authors seem to have merged the esoteric concept with the Enochian concept to arrive at an idea of spiritual entities that feed off the thoughts and energy of a unified multitude as the website Occultist net described it while nevertheless having more of a life of their own their more specific features and powers will depend on the particular author Kate Strong writing for the newsletter Know Thyself Heal Thyself described egregores as symbols ideas or ideals that exist in the collective psyche of a group of people and are thought to have an autonomous existence This usage seems to have come largely from the Meditations on the Tarot as may be seen in the next section The concept of a tulpa is similar as Gary Lachman and Mark Stavish noted br br The Meditations on the Tarot described the Antichrist as an egregore an artificial being who owes his existence to collective generation from below Elsewhere the book described egregores as demons engendered by the collective will and imagination of nations The book cites but does not completely agree with the usage of Robert Ambelain in his work La Kabbale pratique Ambelain had defined the egregore as a force generated by a powerful spiritual current and then nourished at regular intervals according to a rhythm in harmony with the universal life of the cosmos or to a union of entities united by a common characteristic nature The author of the Meditations on the Tarot described this passage from Ambelain as a definition which leaves nothing more to be desired but disagreed with Ambelain s description of Catholicism Freemasonry and Protestantism as egregores br br Gary Lachman followed the usage of the Meditations on the Tarot in his book Dark Star Rising which went on to suggest that Pepe the Frog may be an egregore in this sense or a tulpa which Lachman saw as a similar phenomenon In the usage of Lachman and of the Meditations on the Tarot there are no good egregores only negative ones Lachman cited Joscelyn Godwin s The Golden Thread which had itself cited the Meditations on the Tarot as a source for the idea that while a religious or other group who creates an egregore can rely on it as an efficacious magical ally the egregore s help comes at a price since as Godwin had put it its creators must thenceforth meet the egregore s unlimited appetite for their future devotion br br Liber Null Psychonaut by the British chaos magician Peter J Carroll uses the word egregore for the first time at the end of the following passage Religion takes the view that consciousness preceded organic life Supposedly there were gods angelic forces titans and demons setting the scene before material life developed Science takes the opposite view and considers that much organic evolution occurred before the phenomenon of consciousness appeared Magic which has given more attention to the quality of consciousness itself takes an alternative view and concludes that organic and psychic forms evolve synchronously As organic development occurs a psychic field is generated which feeds back into the organic forms Thus each species of living being has its own type of psychic form or magical essence These egregores may occasionally be felt as a presence or even glimpsed in the form of the species they watch over The book goes on to say that those who have perceived the human egregore usually describe it as God and that magicians consider that all life on this world contributes to and depends on a vast composite egregore which has variously been known as the Great Mother the Anima Mundi the Great Archon the Devil Pan and Baphomet br br Following this usage though giving no citations the glossary in the book The Philosophy of Dark Paganism by Frater Tenebris defines an egregore as an occult term for an independently functioning spiritual entity created by one or more magick practitioners Many egregores begin as thought forms but then become capable of operating independently of the practitioners It defines thought form as an esoteric entity created by magick and magick as a spiritual practice and process to influence the probability of events br The book itself mentions egregores in the context of archetypism a view that understands the different gods and goddesses as either psychological structures similar to Carl Jung s archetypes or different currents of arcane energy found in the Cosmos that are anthropomorphized Noting that some archetypists consider the gods to be thought forms created from worship and prayer by generations of believers it says that over time these thought forms may become egregores that exhibit some autonomy apart from their worshipers and that one might imagine these gods along the line of Neil Gaiman s deities in the novel American Gods br br Mauricio Medeiros writing for the theosophist website Estudo Teos fico defined an egregore as an astral mental or spiritual construct sustained by several people over a long period of time giving it a character of permanence that does not depend on any particular individual While saying that egregores have no life of their own Medeiros nevertheless emphasized their independence noting that egregores can be associated with physical locations so that when we enter an environment and feel uncomfortable what we are often experiencing is the clash between the energies expressed by the egregores of the place and our own energies br br The Book of Enoch refers to which is usually translated as watchers As Ren Gu non says these are entities of a rather enigmatic character that whatever they may be seem to belong to the intermediary world this is all that they have in common with the collective entities to which the same name has been applied in esoteric literature br br While Gu non notes that he had never used the word egregore to designate what he preferred instead to call a collective entity he notes that he had described these same entities in his Perspectives on Initiation in the following passage Each collectivity can thus be regarded as possessing a subtle force made up in a way of the contributions of all its members past and present and which is consequently all the more considerable and able to produce greater effects as the collectivity is older and is composed of a greater number of members It is evident moreover that this quantitative consideration essentially indicates that it is a question of the individual domain beyond which this force could not in any way intervene Gu non believed that prayer is not directly addressed to spiritual entities such as gods or angels but rather consciously or not addresses itself most immediately to the collective entity and it is only by the intermediary of this latter that it also addresses the spiritual influence that works through it Olavo de Carvalho believed that according to Gu non s view the prayers of persons who are not members of a community are ineffectual br br According to Gu non the term was first used to designate these collective entities by liphas L vi who to justify this meaning gave it an improbable Latin etymology deriving it from grex flock whereas the word is purely Greek and has never signified anything but watcher According to Mark Stavish s description in his book Egregores however L vi s Le Grand Arcane The Great Secret clearly identifies the word egregore with the Kabbalistic lore of those beings who were said to be the fathers of the Nephilim i e the Watchers L vi described them as terrible beings that crush us without pity because they are unaware of our existence br Following the usage of egregore as a collective entity a article by Gaetan Delaforge in Gnosis magazine defines an egregore as a kind of group mind which is created when people consciously come together for a common purpose br Olavo de Carvalho s course on esotericism presented a division of types of rites rites are divided into magic rites and religious rites and religious rites are further divided into propitiatory sacrificial aggregation and initiation rites Aggregation rites are rites which are directed to the egregore of a community and make someone a member of it Olavo cited Ren Gu non s view that prayer is directed primarily to the egregore without noting that Gu non himself did not use the term br br Akashic records Term in theosophy and anthroposophy br Collective unconscious Term of analytical psychology br Faith healing Prayer and gestures
