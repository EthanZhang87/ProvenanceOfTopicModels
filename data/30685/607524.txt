occurrences elsewhere in their towns br br br Juvenile fiction br A helping of the fantastic is often an element in children s literature but the two major strands of urban fantasy are well represented in particular br The hidden world focuses on stories and characters taking place in a fully realized domain which operates secretly but simultaneously to the world with which we are familiar An outstanding example are the Harry Potter books of J K Rowling where our own muggle world is unaware of an entire universe of wizards and magical creatures and intersections of these domains provide plot material and character dimensionality for the action taking place primarily in the magic universe and so being a type of high fantasy br On the other hand magical charm stories operate mostly in the mundane universe but where a spell or token provides plot interest The protagonist of Robert Lawson s Mr Wilmer works as a clerk for a big New York City company but suddenly one morning he can speak with and understand animals In the magical stories of Edward Eager groups of children are granted wishes or transported through time by invoking spells This makes the stories a variety of low fantasy br Possibly the best known urban fantasy series for children are P L Travers low fantasy Mary Poppins stories set in London between the World Wars As well as eight books there have been several film and stage adaptations The high fantasy Harry Potter phenomenon may soon be in position to overtake Poppins br br br Paranormal romance br In an online commentary author Jeannie Holmes described differences between urban fantasy and paranormal romance br br The two share of their genre DNA However the main differences are this Urban fantasy focuses on an issue outside of a romantic relationship between two characters Paranormal romance focuses on a romantic relationship between two characters and how outside forces affect that relationship The best litmus test to determine if a story is urban fantasy or paranormal romance is to ask the following question If the romance between Character A and Character B were removed would the plot still stand as a viable storyline If the answer is yes chances are good it s urban fantasy If the answer is no it s most likely paranormal romance br br br Media tie ins br Use of other forms of media has become a common part of the creation and promotion of urban fantasy works br br br Music br br Several urban fantasy authors cite music as an inspiration Certain writers recommend songs or playlists on their official websites including Courtney Allison Moulton Jaye Wells and Sarah J Maas who couple their recommendations with links to music providing services Publishers have also used music for book trailers

been adapted to or have originated in film and television Aside from popular ghost and horror films from the s s well known examples include the series Highlander and the TV adaptation of Buffy the Vampire Slayer which is regarded as a seminal work of the genre br Certain staples of urban fantasy novels are also present in television shows The concept of peaceful coexistence with paranormal beings is explored in the series Kindred The Embraced which focuses on secret vampire clans in San Francisco Works such as Witchblade present the more common matter of a protagonist attempting to protect citizens br While urban fantasy novels are often centered on heroines television programs have regularly featured both genders in leading roles Shows such as Beauty and the Beast The Dresden Files Forever Knight Grimm Moonlight and Supernatural are based around male protagonists while other programs including Buffy the Vampire Slayer Charmed and Witchblade focus largely on female protagonists br br br Video games br While most fantasy video games take place in science fantasy or high fantasy settings the subgenre of urban fantasy has a significant niche in the video game media
