Horror is a genre of fiction that is intended to disturb frighten or scare Horror is often divided into the sub genres of psychological horror and supernatural horror which are in the realm of speculative fiction Literary historian J A Cuddon in defined the horror story as a piece of fiction in prose of variable length which shocks or even frightens the reader or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing Horror intends to create an eerie and frightening atmosphere for the reader Often the central menace of a work of horror fiction can be interpreted as a metaphor for larger fears of a society br br br History br br br Before br br The horror genre has ancient origins with roots in folklore and religious traditions focusing on death the afterlife evil the demonic and the principle of the thing embodied in the person These manifested in stories of beings such as demons witches vampires werewolves and ghosts European horror fiction became established through works of the Ancient Greeks and Ancient Romans Mary Shelley s well known novel about Frankenstein was greatly influenced by the story of Hippolytus whom Asclepius revives from death Euripides wrote plays based on the story Hippolytos Kalyptomenos and Hippolytus In Plutarch s The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans in the account of Cimon the author describes the spirit of a murderer Damon who himself was murdered in a bathhouse in Chaeronea br Pliny the Younger to c tells the tale of Athenodorus Cananites who bought a haunted house in Athens Athenodorus was cautious since the house seemed inexpensive While writing a book on philosophy he was visited by a ghostly figure bound in chains The figure disappeared in the courtyard the following day the magistrates dug in the courtyard and found an unmarked grave br Elements of the horror genre also occur in Biblical texts notably in the Book of Revelation br br br After br The Witch of Berkeley by William of Malmesbury has been viewed as an early horror story Werewolf stories were popular in medieval French literature One of Marie de France s twelve lais is a werewolf story titled Bisclavret br br The Countess Yolande commissioned a werewolf story titled Guillaume de Palerme Anonymous writers penned two werewolf stories Biclarel and Melion br Much horror fiction derives from the cruellest personages of the th century Dracula can be traced to the Prince of Wallachia Vlad III whose alleged war crimes were published in German pamphlets A pamphlet was published by Markus Ayrer which is most notable for its woodcut imagery The alleged serial killer sprees of Gilles de Rais have been seen as the inspiration for Bluebeard The motif of the vampiress is most notably derived from the real life noblewoman and murderer Elizabeth Bathory and helped usher in the emergence of horror fiction in the th century such as through L szl Tur czi s book Tragica Historia br br br th century br br The th century saw the gradual development of Romanticism and the Gothic horror genre It drew on the written and material heritage of the Late Middle Ages finding its form with Horace Walpole s seminal and controversial novel The Castle of Otranto In fact the first edition was published disguised as an actual medieval romance from Italy discovered and republished by a fictitious translator Once revealed as modern many found it anachronistic reactionary or simply in poor taste but it proved immediately popular Otranto inspired Vathek by William Beckford A Sicilian Romance The Mysteries of Udolpho The Italian by Ann Radcliffe and The Monk by Matthew Lewis A significant amount of horror fiction of this era was written by women and marketed towards a female audience a typical scenario of the novels being a resourceful female menaced in a gloomy castle br br br th century br br The Gothic tradition blossomed into the genre that modern readers today call horror literature in the th century Influential works and characters that continue resonating in fiction and film today saw their genesis in the Brothers Grimm s H nsel und Gretel Mary Shelley s Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus John Polidori s The Vampyre Charles Maturin s Melmoth the Wanderer Washington Irving s The Legend of Sleepy Hollow Jane C Loudon s The Mummy Or a Tale of the Twenty Second Century Victor Hugo s The Hunchback of Notre Dame Thomas Peckett Prest s Varney the Vampire the works of Edgar Allan Poe the works of Sheridan Le Fanu Robert Louis Stevenson s Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde Oscar Wilde s The Picture of Dorian Gray Sir Arthur Conan Doyle s Lot No H G Wells The Invisible Man and Bram Stoker s Dracula Each of these works created an enduring icon of horror seen in later re imaginings on the page stage and screen br br br th century br A proliferation of cheap periodicals around the turn of the century led to a boom in horror writing For example Gaston Leroux serialized his Le Fant me de l Op ra before it became a novel in One writer who specialized in horror fiction for mainstream pulps such as All Story Magazine was Tod Robbins whose fiction deals with themes of madness and cruelty In Russia the writer Alexander Belyaev popularized these themes in his story Professor Dowell s Head in which a mad doctor performs experimental head transplants and reanimations on bodies stolen from the morgue and which was first published as a magazine serial before being turned into a novel Later specialist publications emerged to give horror writers an outlet prominent among them was Weird Tales and Unknown Worlds br Influential horror writers of the early th century made inroads in these mediums Particularly the venerated horror author H P Lovecraft and his enduring Cthulhu Mythos transformed and popularized the genre of cosmic horror and M R James is credited with redefining the ghost story in that era br The serial murderer became a recurring theme Yellow journalism and sensationalism of various murderers such as Jack the Ripper and lesser so Carl Panzram Fritz Haarman and Albert Fish all perpetuated this phenomenon The trend continued in the postwar era partly renewed after the murders committed by Ed Gein In Robert Bloch inspired by the murders wrote Psycho The crimes committed in by the Manson Family influenced the slasher theme in horror fiction of the s In Thomas Harris wrote Red Dragon introducing Dr Hannibal Lecter In the sequel to that novel The Silence of the Lambs was published br Early cinema was inspired by many aspects of horror literature and started a strong tradition of horror films and subgenres that continues to this day Up until the graphic depictions of violence and gore on the screen commonly associated with s and s slasher films and splatter films comic books such as those published by EC Comics most notably Tales From The Crypt in the s satisfied readers quests for horror imagery that the silver screen could not provide This imagery made these comics controversial and as a consequence they were frequently censored br The modern zombie tale dealing with the motif of the living dead harks back to works including H P Lovecraft s stories Cool Air In The Vault and The Outsider and Dennis Wheatley s Strange Conflict Richard Matheson s novel I Am Legend influenced an entire genre of apocalyptic zombie fiction emblematized by the films of George A Romero br In the late s and early s the enormous commercial success of three books Rosemary s Baby by Ira Levin The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty and The Other by Thomas Tryon encouraged publishers to begin releasing numerous other horror novels thus creating a horror boom br br One of the best known late th century horror writers is Stephen King known for Carrie The Shining It Misery and several dozen other novels and about short stories Beginning in the s King s stories have attracted a large audience for which he was awarded by the U S National Book Foundation in Other popular horror authors of the period included Anne Rice Shaun Hutson Brian Lumley Graham Masterton James Herbert Dean Koontz Richard Laymon Clive Barker Ramsey Campbell and Peter Straub br br br st century br Best selling book series of contemporary times exist in genres related to horror fiction such as the werewolf fiction urban fantasy Kitty Norville books by Carrie Vaughn onward Horror elements continue to expand outside the genre The alternate history of more traditional historical horror in Dan Simmons s novel The Terror sits on bookstore shelves next to genre mash ups such as Pride and Prejudice and Zombies and historical fantasy and horror comics such as Hellblazer onward and Mike Mignola s Hellboy onward Horror also serves as one of the central genres in more complex modern works such as Mark Z Danielewski s House of Leaves a finalist for the National Book Award There are many horror novels for children and teens such as R L Stine s Goosebumps series or The Monstrumologist by Rick Yancey Additionally many movies for young audiences particularly animated ones use horror aesthetics and conventions for example ParaNorman These are what can be collectively referred to as children s horror Although it is unknown for sure why children enjoy these movies as it seems counter intuitive it is theorized that it is in part grotesque monsters that fascinate kids Tangential to this the internalized impact of horror television programs and films on children is rather under researched especially when compared to the research done on the similar subject of violence in TV and film s impact on the young mind What little research there is tends to be inconclusive on the impact that viewing such media has br br br Characteristics br One defining trait of the horror genre is that it provokes an emotional psychological or physical response within readers that causes them to react with fear One of H P Lovecraft s most famous quotes about the genre is that The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown the first sentence from his seminal essay Supernatural Horror in Literature Science fiction historian Darrell Schweitzer has stated In the simplest sense a horror story is one that scares us and the true horror story requires a sense of evil not in necessarily in a theological sense but the menaces must be truly menacing life destroying and antithetical to happiness br In her essay Elements of Aversion Elizabeth Barrette articulates the need by some for horror tales in a modern world br br The old fight or flight reaction of our evolutionary heritage once played a major role in the life of every human Our ancestors lived and died by it Then someone invented the fascinating game of civilization and things began to calm down Development pushed wilderness back from settled lands War crime and other forms of social violence came with civilization and humans started preying on each other but by and large daily life calmed down We began to feel restless to feel something missing the excitement of living on the edge the tension between hunter and hunted So we told each other stories through the long dark nights when the fires burned low we did our best to scare the daylights out of each other The rush of adrenaline feels good Our hearts pound our breath quickens and we can imagine ourselves on the edge Yet we also appreciate the insightful aspects of horror Sometimes a story intends to shock and disgust but the best horror intends to rattle our cages and shake us out of our complacency It makes us think forces us to confront ideas we might rather ignore and challenges preconceptions of all kinds Horror reminds us that the world is not always as safe as it seems which exercises our mental muscles and reminds us to keep a little healthy caution close at hand br In a sense similar to the reason a person seeks out the controlled thrill of a roller coaster readers in the modern era seek out feelings of horror and terror to feel a sense of excitement However Barrette adds that horror fiction is one of the few mediums where readers seek out a form of art that forces themselves to confront ideas and images they might rather ignore to challenge preconceptions of all kinds br One can see the confrontation of ideas that readers and characters would rather ignore throughout literature in famous moments such as Hamlet s musings about the skull of Yorick its implications of the mortality of humanity and the gruesome end that bodies inevitably come to In horror fiction the confrontation with the gruesome is often a metaphor for the problems facing the current generation of the author br There are many theories as to why people enjoy being scared For example people who like horror films are more likely to score highly for openness to experience a personality trait linked to intellect and imagination br It is a now commonly accepted view that the horror elements of Dracula s portrayal of vampirism are metaphors for sexuality in a repressed Victorian era But this is merely one of many interpretations of the metaphor of Dracula Jack Halberstam postulates many of these in his essay Technologies of Monstrosity Bram Stoker s Dracula He writes br br The image of dusty and unused gold coins from many nations and old unworn jewels immediately connects Dracula to the old money of a corrupt class to a kind of piracy of nations and to the worst excesses of the aristocracy br br Halberstram articulates a view of Dracula as manifesting the growing perception of the aristocracy as an evil and outdated notion to be defeated The depiction of a multinational band of protagonists using the latest technologies such as a telegraph to quickly share collate and act upon new information is what leads to the destruction of the vampire This is one of many interpretations of the metaphor of only one central figure of the canon of horror fiction as over a dozen possible metaphors are referenced in the analysis from the religious to the antisemitic br No l Carroll s Philosophy of Horror postulates that a modern piece of horror fiction s monster villain or a more inclusive menace must exhibit the following two traits br br A menace that is threatening either physically psychologically socially morally spiritually or some combination of the aforementioned br A menace that is impure that violates the generally accepted schemes of cultural categorization We consider impure that which is categorically contradictory br br br Scholarship and criticism br In addition to those essays and articles shown above scholarship on horror fiction is almost as old as horror fiction itself In the gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe published an essay distinguishing two elements of horror fiction terror and horror Whereas terror is a feeling of dread that takes place before an event happens horror is a feeling of revulsion or disgust after an event has happened Radcliffe describes terror as that which expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life whereas horror is described as that which freezes and nearly annihilates them br Modern scholarship on horror fiction draws upon a range of sources In their historical studies of the gothic novel both Devendra Varma and S L Varnado make reference to the theologian Rudolf Otto whose concept of the numinous was originally used to describe religious experience br br A recent survey reports how often horror media is consumed To assess frequency of horror consumption we asked respondents the following question In the past year about how often have you used horror media for example horror literature film and video games for entertainment said Never Once Several times Once a month Several times a month Once a week and Several times a week Evidently then most respondents claimed to use horror media several times a year or more often Unsurprisingly there is a strong correlation between liking and frequency of use r p br br br Awards and associations br Achievements in horror fiction are recognized by numerous awards The Horror Writers Association presents the Bram Stoker Awards for Superior Achievement named in honor of Bram Stoker author of the seminal horror novel Dracula The Australian Horror Writers Association presents annual Australian Shadows Awards The International Horror Guild Award was presented annually to works of horror and dark fantasy from to The Shirley Jackson Awards are literary awards for outstanding achievement in the literature of psychological suspense horror and the dark fantastic works Other important awards for horror literature are included as subcategories within general awards for fantasy and science fiction in such awards as the Aurealis Award br br br Alternative terms br Some writers of fiction normally classified as horror tend to dislike the term considering it too lurid They instead use the terms dark fantasy or Gothic fantasy for supernatural horror or psychological thriller for non supernatural horror br br br See also br br Related genres br Christmas horror br Crime
