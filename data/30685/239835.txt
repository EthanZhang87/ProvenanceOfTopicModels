Etruscan god Orcus who fed on human flesh Its earliest attestation is in Chr tien de Troyes late th century verse romance Perceval li contes del graal which contains the lines br br Et s est escrit que il ert ancore br que toz li reaumes de Logres br qui jadis fu la terre as ogres br ert destruite par cele lance br br And it is written that he will come again br to all the realms of Logres br which was formerly land of ogres br and destroy them with that lance br br The ogres in this rhyme may refer to the ogres who were in the pseudohistorical work History of the Kings of Britain by Geoffrey of Monmouth the inhabitants of Britain prior to human settlement The Italian author Giambattista Basile used the related Neapolitan word uerco or in standard Italian orco in some of his tales This word is documented in earlier Italian works Fazio degli Uberti th century Luigi Pulci th century Ludovico Ariosto th th centuries and has even older cognates with the Latin orcus and the Old English orcn as found in Beowulf lines which inspired J R R Tolkien s Orc All these words may derive from a shared Indo European mythological concept as Tolkien himself speculated as cited by Tom Shippey The Road to Middle earth The Dictionary of the Academy of France alternatively states that the name is derived from the word Hongrois which means Hungarian as of western cultures referred to Hungarians as a kind of monstrosity Ogre could possibly also derive from the biblical Og last of the giants or from the Greek river god Oiagros father of Orpheus br The word ogre came into wider usage
