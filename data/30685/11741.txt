Fantasy films are films that belong to the fantasy genre with fantastic themes usually magic supernatural events mythology folklore or exotic fantasy worlds The genre is considered a form of speculative fiction alongside science fiction films and horror films although the genres do overlap Fantasy films often have an element of magic myth wonder escapism and the extraordinary br br br Subgenres br Several sub categories of fantasy films can be identified although the delineations between these subgenres much as in fantasy literature are somewhat fluid br The most common fantasy subgenres depicted in movies are high fantasy and sword and sorcery Both categories typically employ quasi medieval settings wizards magical creatures and other elements commonly associated with fantasy stories br High fantasy films tend to feature a more richly developed fantasy world and may also be more character oriented or thematically complex Often they feature a hero of humble origins and a clear distinction between good and evil set against each other in an epic struggle Many scholars cite J R R Tolkien s The Lord of the Rings novel as the prototypical modern example of high fantasy in literature and the recent Peter Jackson film adaptation of the books is a good example of the high fantasy subgenre on the silver screen br Sword and sorcery movies tend to be more plot driven than high fantasy and focus heavily on action sequences often pitting a physically powerful but unsophisticated warrior against an evil wizard or other supernaturally endowed enemy Although sword and sorcery films sometimes describe an epic battle between good and evil similar to those found in many High fantasy movies they may alternately present the hero as having more immediate motivations such as the need to protect a vulnerable maiden or village or even being driven by the desire for vengeance br The film adaptation of Robert E Howard s Conan the Barbarian for example is a personal non epic story concerning the hero s quest for revenge and his efforts to thwart a single megalomaniac while saving a beautiful princess in the process Some critics refer to such films by the term Sword and Sandal rather than sword and sorcery although others would maintain that the Sword and Sandal label should be reserved only for the subset of fantasy films set in ancient times on the planet Earth and still others would broaden the term to encompass films that have no fantastic elements whatsoever To some the term Sword and Sandal has pejorative connotations designating a film with a low quality script bad acting and poor production values br Another important subgenre of fantasy films that has become more popular in recent years is contemporary fantasy Such films feature magical effects or supernatural occurrences happening in the real world of today br Films with live action and animation such as Disney s Mary Poppins Pete s Dragon Enchanted and the Robert Zemeckis film Who Framed Roger Rabbit are also fantasy films although are more often referred to as Live action animation hybrids of those are also classified as musicals br Fantasy films set in the afterlife called Bangsian fantasy are less common although films such as the Albert Brooks comedy Defending Your Life would likely qualify Other uncommon subgenres include historical fantasy and romantic fantasy although s Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl successfully incorporated elements of both br As noted above superhero movies and fairy tale films might each be considered subgenres of fantasy films although most would classify them as altogether separate movie genres br br br Fantasy movies and the film industry br As a cinematic genre fantasy has traditionally not been regarded as highly as the related genre of science fiction film Undoubtedly the fact that until recently fantasy films often suffered from the Sword and Sandal afflictions of inferior production values over the top acting and decidedly poor special effects was a significant factor in fantasy film s low regard br Since the early s however the genre has gained new respectability in a way driven principally by the successful adaptations of Tolkien s The Lord of the Rings and J K Rowling s Harry Potter series Jackson s The Lord of the Rings trilogy is notable due to its ambitious scale serious tone and thematic complexity These pictures achieved phenomenal commercial and critical success and the third installment of the trilogy became the first fantasy film ever to win the Academy Award for Best Picture The Harry Potter series has been a tremendous financial success has achieved critical acclaim for its design thematic sophistication and emotional depth grittier realism and darkness narrative complexity and characterization and boasts an enormous and loyal fanbase br Following the success of these ventures Hollywood studios have greenlighted additional big budget productions in the genre These have included adaptations of the first second and third books in C S Lewis The Chronicles of Narnia and the teen novel Eragon as well as adaptations of Susan Cooper s The Dark Is Rising Cornelia Funke s Inkheart Philip Pullman s The Golden Compass Holly Black s The Spiderwick Chronicles Nickelodeon s TV show Avatar The Last Airbender and the Fantasia segment along with Johann Wolfgang von Goethe s original poem The Sorcerer s Apprentice br Many fantasy movies starting in the s such as The Lord of the Rings films the st and rd Narnia adaptations and the st nd th and th Harry Potter adaptations have most often been released in November and December This is in contrast to sci fi films which are often released during the northern hemisphere summer June August All of the Pirates of the Caribbean films however were released in July July and May respectively and the latest releases in the Harry Potter series were released in July and July The huge commercial success of these pictures may indicate a change in Hollywood s approach to big budget fantasy film releases br Screenwriter and scholar Eric R Williams identifies fantasy films as one of eleven super genres in his screenwriters taxonomy claiming that all feature length narrative films can be classified by these super genres The other super genres are action crime horror romance sci fi slice of life sports thriller war and western br br br History br br Fantasy films have a history almost as old as the medium itself However fantasy films were relatively few and far between until the s when high tech filmmaking techniques and increased audience interest caused the genre to flourish br What follows are some notable Fantasy films For a more complete list see List of fantasy films br br br s br

color fantasy films produced by Alexander Korda including The Thief of Bagdad a film on par with The Wizard of Oz and Jungle Book In Jean Cocteau s classic adaptation of Beauty and the Beast won praise for its surreal elements and for transcending the boundaries of the fairy tale genre Sinbad the Sailor starring Douglas Fairbanks Jr has the feel of a fantasy film though it does not actually

imaginary kingdoms around the legendary Iron Crown historically the ancient crown of Italy with war cruelty betrayal heroism sex magic and mysticism a whirl of events taken from every possible fairy tale and legend source Blasetti could find This movie is unlike anything done before indeed considering that it was finished fifteen years before the publication of Lord Of The Rings its invention of a vast national epic mythology is an act of genius And while the storytelling is rough due to the need to insert everything and the resources limited Blasetti shows how to make a little go a long way through beautifully staged and designed battle and crowd scenes br Although it s not classified as a fantasy film Gene Kelly s Anchors Aweigh had a fantasy sequence called The King who Couldn t Dance in which Gene did a song and dance number with Jerry Mouse from Tom and Jerry br Because these movies do not feature elements common to high fantasy or sword and sorcery pictures some modern critics

films The fantasy picture Faces of Dr Lao in which Tony Randall portrayed several characters from Greek mythology was released in But the adaptation of the Broadway musical Camelot removed most of the
