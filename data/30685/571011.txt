Golden Compass singular which it mistakenly understood as a reference to Lyra s alethiometer depicted on the front cover shown at the head of this article because of the device s resemblance to a navigational compass By the time Pullman had replaced The Golden Compasses with His Dark Materials as the name of the trilogy the US publisher had become so attached to the original title that it insisted on publishing the first book as The Golden Compass rather than as Northern Lights the title used in Britain and Australia br br br Critical reception br br br Awards br Pullman won both the
