Belfast BEL fast fahst from Irish B al Feirste b e l f t is the capital city and principal port of Northern Ireland standing on the banks of the River Lagan and connected to the open sea through Belfast Lough and the North Channel It is second to Dublin as the largest city on the island of Ireland with a population in of and a metro area population of br First chartered as an English settlement in the town s early growth was driven by an influx of Scottish Presbyterians Their descendants disaffection with Ireland s Anglican establishment contributed to the rebellion of and to the union with Great Britain in later regarded as a key to the town s industrial transformation When granted city status in Belfast was the world s largest centre of linen manufacture and by the s her shipyards were building up to a quarter of total United Kingdom tonnage br Sectarian tensions accompanied the growth of an Irish Catholic population drawn by mill and factory employment from western districts Heightened by division over Ireland s future in the United Kingdom these twice erupted in periods of sustained violence in as Belfast emerged as the capital of the six northeast counties retaining the British connection and over three decades from the late s during which the British Army was continually deployed on the streets A legacy of conflict is the barrier reinforced separation of Protestant and Catholic working class districts br Since the Belfast Agreement the electoral balance in the once unionist controlled city has shifted albeit with no overall majority in favour of Irish nationalists At the same time new immigrants are adding to the growing number of residents unwilling to identify with either of the two communal traditions br Belfast has seen significant services sector growth with important contributions from financial technology fintech from tourism and with facilities in the redeveloped Harbour Estate from film It retains a port with commercial and industrial docks including a reduced Harland Wolff shipyard and aerospace and defence contractors Post Brexit Belfast and Northern Ireland remain uniquely within both the British domestic and European Single trading areas for goods br The city is served by two airports George Best Belfast City Airport on the Lough shore and Belfast International Airport miles kilometres west of the city It supports two universities on the north side of the city centre Ulster University and on the southside the longer established Queens University Since Belfast has been a UNESCO designated City of Music br br br History br br br Name br The name Belfast derives from the Irish B al Feirste Irish pronunciation b e l f t Mouth of the Farset a river whose name in the Irish Feirste refers to a sandbar or tidal ford This was formed where the river ran until culverted late in the th century down High Street into the Lagan It was at this crossing located under or close to the current Queen s Bridge that the early settlement developed br The compilers of Ulster Scots use various transcriptions of local pronunciations of Belfast with which they sometimes are also content including Bilfawst Bilfaust or Baelfawst br br br Early settlements br The site of Belfast has been occupied since the Bronze Age The Giant s Ring a year old henge is located near the city and the remains of Iron Age hill forts can still be seen in the surrounding hills At the beginning of the th century Papal tax rolls record two churches the Chapel of Dundela at Knock Irish Cnoc from cnoc meaning hill in the east connected by some accounts to the th century evangelist St Colmcille and the Chapel of the Ford which may have been a successor to a much older parish church on the present Shankill Seanchill Old Church Road dating back to the th and possibly to St Patrick in the mid th century br A Norman settlement at the ford comprising the parish church now St George s a watermill and a small fort was an outpost of Carrickfergus Castle Established in the late th century miles km out along the north shore of the Lough Carrickfergus was to remain the principal English foothold in the north east until the scorched earth Nine Years War at the end of the th century broke the remaining Irish power the O Neills br br br Developing port radical politics br With a commission from James I in Sir Arthur Chichester undertook the Plantation of Belfast and the surrounding area attracting mainly English and Manx settlers The subsequent arrival of Scottish Presbyterians embroiled Belfast in its only recorded siege denounced from London by John Milton as ungrateful and treacherous guests in the newcomers were temporarily expelled by an English Parliamentarian army In Catholic Jacobite forces briefly in command of the town abandoned it in advance of the landing at Carrickfergus of William Prince of Orange who proceeded through the Belfast to his celebrated victory on July at the Boyne br br Together with French Huguenots the Scots introduced the production of linen a flax spinning industry that in the th century carried Belfast trade to the Americas Fortunes were made carrying rough linen clothing and salted provisions to the slave plantations of the West Indies sugar and rum to Baltimore and New York and for the return to Belfast flaxseed and tobacco from the colonies From the s profits from the trade financed improvements in the town s commercial infrastructure including the Lagan Canal new docks and quays and the construction of the White Linen Hall which together attracted to Belfast the linen trade that had formerly gone through Dublin Abolitionist sentiment however defeated the proposal of the greatest of the merchant houses Cunningham and Greg in to commission ships for the Middle Passage As Dissenters from the established Anglican church with its episcopacy and ritual Presbyterians were conscious of sharing if only in part the disabilities of Ireland s dispossessed Roman Catholic majority and of being denied representation in the Irish Parliament Belfast s two MPs remained nominees of the Chichesters Marquesses of Donegall With their emigrant kinsmen in America the region s Presbyterians were to share a growing disaffection from the Crown br When early in the American War of Independence Belfast Lough was raided by the privateer John Paul Jones the townspeople assembled their own Volunteer militia Formed ostensibly for defence of the Kingdom Volunteer corps were soon pressing their own protest against taxation without representation Further emboldened by the French Revolution a more radical element in the town the Society of United Irishmen called for Catholic emancipation and a representative national government In hopes of French assistance in the Society organised a republican insurrection The rebel tradesmen and tenant farmers were defeated north of the town at the Battle of Antrim and to the south at the Battle of Ballynahinch br Britain seized on the rebellion to abolish the Irish Parliament unlamented in Belfast and to incorporate Ireland in a United Kingdom In British parliamentary reform permitted the town its first electoral contest an occasion for an early and lethal sectarian riot br br br Industrial expansion sectarian division br br While other Irish towns experienced a loss of manufacturing and after a cotton boom and bust from the s Belfast underwent rapid industrial expansion As the global leader in the production of linen goods mill and finishing work largely employing women and children it won the moniker Linenopolis Shipbuilding led the development of heavier industry By the s her shipyards were building up to a quarter of the total United Kingdom tonnage This included from the yard of Harland Wolff the ill fated RMS Titanic at the time of her launch in the largest ship afloat Other major export industries included textile machinery rope tobacco and mineral waters br Industry drew in a new Catholic population settling largely in the west of the town refugees from a rural poverty intensified by Belfast s mechanisation of spinning and weaving and in the s by famine The plentiful supply of cheap labour helped attract English and Scottish capital to Belfast but it was also a cause of insecurity Protestant workers organised and dominated the apprenticed trades and gave a new lease of life to the once largely rural Orange Order Sectarian tensions which frequently broke out in riots and workplace expulsions were also driven by the constitutional question the prospect of a restored Irish parliament in which Protestants and northern industry feared being a minority interest br On September unionists massed at Belfast s City Hall to sign the Ulster Covenant pledging to use all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present conspiracy to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland This was followed by the drilling and eventual arming of a strong Ulster Volunteer Force UVF The immediate crisis was averted by the onset of the Great War The UVF formed the th Ulster Division whose sacrifices in the Battle of the Somme continue to be commemorated in the city by unionist and loyalist organisations br In as Belfast emerged as the capital of the six counties remaining as Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom there was widespread violence disloyal workers were driven from their jobs in the shipyards in addition to Catholics rotten Prods Protestants whose labour politics disregarded sectarian distinctions Gunbattles grenade attacks and house burnings contributed to as many as deaths A curfew remained in force until The lines drawn saw off the challenge to unionist unity posed by labour industry had been paralysed by strikes in and again in Until troubles returned at the end of the s it was not uncommon in Belfast for the Ulster Unionist Party to have its council and parliamentary candidates returned unopposed br In the opening of the new buildings for Northern Ireland s devolved Parliament at Stormont was overshadowed by the protests of the unemployed and ten days of running street battles with the police The government conceded increases in Outdoor Relief but labour unity was short lived In celebrations of King George V s Jubilee and of the annual Twelfth were followed by deadly riots and expulsions a sectarian logic that extended itself to the interpretation of darkening events in Europe Labour candidates found their support for the anti clerical Spanish Republic characterised as another instance of No Popery Today the cause of the republic in the Spanish Civil War is commemorated by a No Pasaran stained glass window in City Hall br In nearly a third of industrial workers were unemployed malnutrition was a major issue and at the city s infant mortality rate compared with in Sheffield England was among the highest in United Kingdom br br br The Blitz and post war development br br In the spring of the German Luftwaffe appeared twice over Belfast In addition to the shipyards and the Short Harland aircraft factory the Belfast Blitz severely damaged or destroyed more than half the city s housing stock and devastated the old town centre around High Street In the greatest loss of life in any air raid outside of London more than a thousand people were killed br At the end of World War II the Unionist government undertook programmes of slum clearance the Blitz had exposed the uninhabitable condition of much of the city s housing which involved decanting populations out of mill and factory built red brick terraces and into new peripheral housing estates At the same time a British funded welfare state revolutionised access to education and health care The resulting rise in expectations together with the uncertainty caused by the decline of the city s Victorian era industries contributed to growing protest and counter protest in the s over the Unionist government s record on civil and political rights br br br The Troubles br br For reasons that nationalists and unionists dispute the public protests of the late s soon gave way to communal violence in which as many as people were intimidated from their homes and to loyalist and republican paramilitarism Introduced onto the streets in August the British Army committed to the longest continuous deployment in its history Operation Banner Beginning in with the Falls curfew and followed in by internment this included counterinsurgency measures directed chiefly at the Provisional Irish Republican Army PIRA who characterised their operations including the bombing of Belfast s commercial centre as a struggle against British occupation br Preceded by loyalist and republican ceasefires the Good Friday Belfast Agreement returned a new power sharing legislative assembly and executive to Stormont In the intervening years in Belfast some people had been injured and killed br br Eighty five percent of the conflict related deaths had occurred within metres of the communal interfaces largely in the north and west of the city The security barriers erected at these interfaces are an enduring physical legacy of the Troubles The neighbourhoods they separate are among the most deprived wards in Northern Ireland In May the Northern Ireland Executive committed to the removal of all peace lines by mutual consent The target date of was passed with only a small number dismantled br The more affluent districts escaped the worst of the violence but the city centre was a major target This was especially so during the first phase of the PIRA campaign in the early s when the organisation hoped to secure quick political results through maximum destruction Including car bombs and incendiaries between and the city experienced explosions In addition to the death and injury caused they accelerated the loss of the city s Victorian fabric br br br st century br Since the turn of the century the loss of employment and population in the city centre has been reversed This reflects the growth of the service economy for which a new district has been developed on former dockland the Titanic Quarter The growing tourism sector paradoxically lists as attractions the murals and peace walls that echo the violence of the past In recent years Troubles tourism has presented visitors with new territorial markers flags murals and graffiti in which loyalists and republicans take opposing sides in the Israeli Palestinian conflict br The demographic balance of some areas has been changed by immigration according to the census just under of the city s population was born outside the British Isles by local differences in births and deaths between Catholics and Protestants and by a growing number of particularly younger people no longer willing to self identify on traditional lines br In unionists lost overall control of Belfast City Council for the first time in its history The election in saw Irish nationalist councillors outnumber unionist councillors for the first time with Sinn F in becoming the largest party and the cross community Alliance Party holding the balance of power br br In the Brexit referendum Belfast s four parliamentary constituencies returned a substantial majority percent for remaining within the European Union as did Northern Ireland as a whole the only UK region outside London and Scotland to do so In February the Democratic Unionist Party which had actively campaigned for Brexit withdrew from the power sharing executive and collapsed the Stormont institutions to protest the UK EU Northern Ireland Protocol With the promise of equal access to the British and European markets this designates Belfast as a point of entry to the European Single Market within whose regulatory framework local producers will continue to operate After two years the standoff was resolved with an agreement to eliminate routine checks on UK destined goods br br br Cityscape br br br Location and topography br br Belfast is at the mouth of the River Lagan at the head of Belfast Lough open through the North Channel to the Irish Sea and to the North Atlantic In the course of the th century the location s estuarine features were re engineered With dredging and reclamation the lough was made to accommodate a deep sea port and extensive shipyards The lagan was banked in a weir raised its water level to cover what remained of the tidal mud flats and its various tributaries were culverted On the model pioneered in by the Connswater Community Greenway some are now being considered for daylighting br It remains the case that much of the city centre is built on an estuarine bed of sleech silt peat mud and a source the city s ubiquitous red brick soft clay that presents a challenge for high rise construction It was this soft foundation that persuaded St Anne s Cathedral to abandon plans for a bell tower and in to substitute a lightweight steel spire The city centre is also subject to tidal flood risk Rising sea levels could mean that without significant investment flooding in the coming decades will be persistent br The city is overlooked on the County Antrim side to the north and northwest by a precipitous basalt escarpment the near continuous line of Divis Mountain m Black Mountain m and Cavehill m whose heathery slopes and hanging fields are visible from almost any part of the city From County Down side on the south and south east it is flanked by the lower lying Castlereagh and Hollywood hills The sand and gravel Malone Ridge extends up river to the south west br br br North Belfast and Shankill br From Belfast began to spread rapidly beyond its th century limits To the north it stretched out along roads which drew into the town migrants from Scots settled hinterland of County Antrim Largely Presbyterian they enveloped a number of Catholic occupied mill row clusters New Lodge Ardoyne and the Marrowbone Together with areas of more substantial housing in the Oldpark district these are wedged between Protestant working class housing stretching from Tiger s Bay out the Shore Road on one side and up the Shankill the original Antrim Road on the other br The Greater Shankill area including Crumlin and Woodvale is over the line from the Belfast North parliamentary assembly constituency but is physically separated from the rest of Belfast West by an extensive series of separation barriers peace walls owned together with five daytime gates into the Falls area by the Department of Justice These include Cupar Way where tourists are informed that at feet the barrier is three times higher than the Berlin Wall and has been in place for twice as long br With other working class districts Shankill suffered from the collapse of old industrial Belfast But it was also greatly affected from the s by the city s most ambitious programme of slum clearance Red brick two up two down terraced streets typical of th century working class housing were replaced with flats maisonettes and car parks but few facilities In a period of twenty years due largely to redevelopment residents left the area leaving an aging population of and more than acres of wasteland br Meanwhile road schemes including the terminus of the M motorway and the Westlink demolished a mixed dockland community Sailortown and severed the streets linking the Shankill area and the rest of both north and west Belfast to the city centre br New green field housing estates were built on the outer edges of the city The onset of the Troubles overwhelmed attempts to promote these as mixed neighbourhoods so that the largest of these developments on the city s northern edge Rathcoole rapidly solidified as a loyalist community In it was estimated that of public housing in Belfast was divided along religious lines br Among the principal landmarks of north Belfast are the Crumlin Road Gaol now a major visitor attraction Belfast Royal Academy the oldest school in the city St Malachy s College Holy Cross Church Ardoyne Waterworks Park and Belfast Zoo br br br West Belfast br In the mid th century rural poverty and famine drove large numbers of Catholic tenant farmers landless labourers and their families toward Belfast Their route brought them down the Falls Road and into what are now remnants of an older Catholic enclave around St Mary s Church the town s first Catholic chapel opened in with Presbyterian subscriptions and Smithfield Market Eventually an entire west side of the city stretching up the Falls Road along the Springfield Road encompassing the new housing estates built s and s Highfield New Barnsley Ballymurphy Whiterock and Turf Lodge and out past Andersonstown on the Stewartstown Road toward Poleglass became near exclusively Catholic and in political terms nationalist br Reflecting the nature of available employment as mill workers domestics and shop assistants the population initially was disproportionately female Further opportunities for women on the Falls Road arose through developments in education and public health In the Dominican Order opened St Mary s Teacher Training College and in King Edward VII opened the Royal Victoria Hospital at the junction with the Grosvenor Road Extensively redeveloped and expanded the hospital has a staff of more than br Landmarks in the area include the Gothic revival St Peter s Cathedral signature twin spires added in Clonard Monastery the Conway Mill re developed as a community enterprise arts and education centre in Belfast City Cemetery and best known for its republican graves Milltown Cemetery br The area s greatest visitor attractions are its wall and gable end murals In contrast to those in loyalist areas where Israel is typically the only outside reference these range more freely beyond the local conflict frequently expressing solidarity with Palestinians with Cuba and with Basque and Catalan separatists br br br South Belfast br West Belfast is separated from South Belfast and from the otherwise abutting loyalist districts of Sandy Row and the Donegall Road by rail lines the M Motorway to Dublin and the west industrial and retail parks and the remnants of the Blackstaff Owenvarra bog meadows br Belfast began stretching up river in the s and s out the Ormeau and Lisburn roads and between them running along a ridge of higher ground the Malone Road From leafy avenues of increasingly substantial and in the course of time mixed housing the Upper Malone broadened out into areas of parkland and villas br Further out still where they did not survive as public parks from the s the great house demesnes of the city s former mill owners and industrialists were developed for public housing loyalist estates such as Seymour Hill and Belvoir Meanwhile in Malone and along the river embankments new houses and apartment blocks have been squeezed in increasing the general housing density br Beyond the Queen s University area the area s principal landmarks are the storey tower block of Belfast City Hospital on the Lisburn Road and the Lagan Valley Regional Park through which a towpath extends from the City centre quayside to Lisburn br Northern Ireland s three permanent diplomatic missions are situated on the Malone Road the consulates of China Poland and the United States br br br East Belfast br The first district on the right bank of the Lagan the County Down side to be incorporated in Belfast was Ballymacarrett after Harland Wolff whose gantry cranes Samson Goliath tower over the area was long the mainstay of employment although less securely so for the townland s Catholics In when the yard still had a workforce of only Catholics were employed Tolerated in periods of expansion as navvies and casual labourers they concentrated in a small enclave the Short Strand which has continued into this century to feature as a sectarian flashpoint Home to around people it is the only distinctly nationalist area in the east of the river br East Belfast developed from the Queens Bridge through Ballymacarrett east along the Newtownards Road and north along the east shore of the Lough up the Holywood Road and from the Albert Bridge south east out the Cregagh and Castlereagh roads The further out the more substantial and less religiously segregated the housing until again encountering the city s outer ring of public housing estates loyalist Knocknagoney Lisnasharragh and Tullycarnet br This century efforts have been made to add to East Belfast s two obvious visitor attractions Samson Goliath the banana yellow cranes date only from the early s and the Parliament Buildings at Stormont What is marketed now as EastSide features at the intersection of the Connswater and Comber Greenways and next to the EastSide Visitor Centre

which sweeps across the dockland to the north the Westlink that connects to the M for points south and west and with less certainty the Bruce Street and Bankmore connectors that tie back toward the Lagan at the Gasworks Business Park and the beginning of the Ormeau Road This embraces the Markets the one remaining inner city area of housing Of the various markets including those for the sale and shipping of livestock from which it derives its name only one survives the former produce market St George s now a food and craft market popular with visitors to the city br br br Architectural

during the Troubles But retail footfall in the centre is limited by competition with out of town shopping centres and with internet retailing As of November footfall had not recovered pre COVID pandemic levels There are compensating trends the growth in tourism and hospitality which has included a sustained boom in hotel construction br The City Council also talks of a residential led regeneration New townhouse and apartments schemes are being developed for the city s quays and for Titanic Quarter The completion in of Ulster University s enhanced Belfast campus in one of the largest higher education capital builds in Europe and the determination of Queen s University to compete with the private sector in the provision of student housing has fostered the construction downtown of multiple new student residences br br br Rough sleeping and homelessness br People can be found sleeping rough on the streets of the city centre Numbers while growing may be comparatively small for a city of its size in the British Isles In counts and estimates by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive identified a total of rough sleepers in Belfast This is against a background in of people of residents presenting as homeless many of whom are in temporary accommodation and shelters Such figures however do not include all those living in severely overcrowded conditions involuntarily sharing with other households on a long term basis or sleeping rough in hidden locations br br br The Quarters br br Since buoyed by increasing numbers of tourists the city council has promoted a number of cultural quarters br The Cathedral Quarter comprises much of Belfast s old trade and warehousing district in the narrow streets and entries around St Anne s Cathedral with a concentration of bars beer gardens clubs and restaurants including two establishments claiming descent from the early town White s and The Duke of York and performance spaces most notably the Black Box and Oh Yeah It hosts a yearly visual and performing arts festival The adjoining Custom House Square is one of the city s main outdoor venues for free concerts and street entertainment br Without defined geographical boundaries the Gaeltacht Quarter encompasses Irish speaking Belfast According to the census of people in the city have some knowledge of Irish speak it daily It is generally understood as an area around the Falls Road in west Belfast served by the Cult rlann McAdam Fiaich cultural centre It can be said to include at the Skainos Centre in unionist east Belfast Turas a
