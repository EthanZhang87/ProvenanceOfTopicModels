Surrey now classified as Inner London the daughter of an agricultural chemist John Collis Nesbit who died in March before her fourth birthday Her mother was Sarah Green n e Alderton br The ill health of Edith s sister Mary meant that the family travelled for some years living variously in Brighton Buckinghamshire France Dieppe Rouen Paris Tours Poitiers Angoul me Bordeaux Arcachon Pau Bagn res de Bigorre and Dinan in Brittany Spain and Germany Mary was engaged in to the poet Philip Bourke Marston but later that year she died of tuberculosis in Normandy br After Mary s death Edith and her mother settled for three years at Halstead Hall Halstead north west Kent a location that inspired The Railway Children although the distinction has also been claimed by the Derbyshire town of New Mills br When Nesbit was the family moved back to Lewisham in south east London There is a Lewisham Council plaque to her at Elswick Road br In at the age of Nesbit met the bank clerk Hubert Bland her elder by three years Seven months pregnant she married Bland on April but did not initially live with him as Bland remained with his mother Their marriage was tumultuous Early on Nesbit found that another woman believed she was Hubert s fianc e and had also borne him a child A more serious blow came in when she discovered that her friend Alice Hoatson was pregnant by him She had previously agreed to adopt Hoatson s child and allow Hoatson to live with her as their housekeeper After she discovered the truth she and her husband quarrelled violently and she suggested that Hoatson and the baby Rosamund should leave her husband threatened to leave Edith if she disowned the baby and its mother Hoatson remained with them as a housekeeper and secretary and became pregnant by Bland again years later Edith again adopted Hoatson s child John br Nesbit s children by Bland were Paul Cyril Bland to whom The Railway Children was dedicated Mary Iris Bland who married John Austin D Phillips in and Fabian Bland Bland s two children by Alice Hoatson whom Edith adopted were Rosamund Edith Nesbit Hamilton later Bland who married Clifford Dyer Sharp on October and to whom The Book of Dragons was dedicated and John Oliver Wentworth Bland to whom The House of Arden and Five Children and It were dedicated Nesbit s son Fabian died aged after a tonsil operation Nesbit dedicated several books to him including The Story of the Treasure Seekers and its sequels Nesbit s adopted daughter Rosamund collaborated with her on Cat Tales br br Nesbit admired the artist and Marxian socialist William Morris The couple joined the founders of the Fabian Society in after which their son Fabian was named and jointly edited its journal Today Hoatson was its assistant secretary Nesbit and Bland dallied with the Social Democratic Federation but found it too radical Nesbit was a prolific lecturer and writer on socialism in the s She and her husband co wrote under the pseudonym Fabian Bland However the joint work dwindled as her success rose as a children s author She was a guest speaker at the London School of Economics which had been founded by other Fabian Society members br Edith lived from to at Well Hall Eltham in south east London which makes fictional appearances in several of her books such as The Red House From she kept a second home on the Sussex Downs at Crowlink Friston East Sussex She and her husband entertained many friends colleagues and admirers at Well Hall br On February some three years after Bland died Nesbit married Thomas the Skipper Tucker in Woolwich where he was captain of the Woolwich Ferry br Towards the end of her life Nesbit moved first to Crowlink then with the skipper to two conjoined properties which were Royal Flying Corps buildings Jolly Boat and Long Boat Nesbit lived in Jolly Boat and the Skipper in Long Boat Nesbit died in The Long Boat at Jesson St Mary s Bay New Romney Kent in probably from lung cancer she smoked incessantly and was buried in the churchyard of St Mary in the Marsh Her husband Thomas died at the same address on May Edith s son Paul Bland was an executor of Thomas Tucker s will br br br Writer br Nesbit s first published works were poems She was under in March when the monthly magazine Good Words printed her poem Under the Trees In all she published about books for children including novels storybooks and picture books She also published almost as many books jointly with others br Nesbit s biographer Julia Briggs names her the first modern writer for children who helped to reverse the great tradition of children s literature inaugurated by Lewis Carroll George MacDonald and Kenneth Grahame in turning away from their secondary worlds to the tough truths to be won from encounters with things as they are previously the province of adult novels Briggs also credits Nesbit with inventing the children s adventure story No l Coward was an admirer In a letter to an early biographer Noel Streatfeild wrote She had an economy of phrase and an unparalleled talent for evoking hot summer days in the English countryside br Among Nesbit s best known books are The Story of the Treasure Seekers and The Wouldbegoods which tell of the Bastables a middle class family fallen on relatively hard times The Railway Children is also popularised by a film version Gore Vidal called the time travel book The Story of the Amulet one where Nesbit s powers of invention are at their best Her children s writing also included plays and collections of verse br Nesbit has been cited as the creator of modern children s fantasy Her innovations placed realistic contemporary children in real world settings with magical objects which would now be classed as contemporary fantasy and adventures and sometimes travel to fantastic worlds This influenced directly or indirectly many later writers including P L Travers of Mary Poppins Edward Eager Diana Wynne Jones and J K Rowling C S Lewis too paid heed to her in the Narnia series and mentions the Bastable children in The Magician s Nephew Michael Moorcock later wrote a series of steampunk novels around an adult Oswald Bastable of The Treasure Seekers In Jacqueline Wilson wrote a sequel to the Psammead trilogy Four Children and It br Nesbit also wrote for adults including eleven novels short stories and four collections of horror stories br In Nesbit was accused of plagiarising the plot of The Railway Children from The House by the Railway by Ada J Graves The Telegraph reported that the Graves book had appeared in nine years before The Railway Children and listed similarities between them However not all sources agree on this finding The magazine Tor com posited an error in the earlier news reports saying both books had been released in the same year br Although she was the family breadwinner and has the father in The Railway Children declare that Girls are just as clever as boys and don t you forget it she did not champion women s rights She opposed the cause of women s suffrage mainly she claimed because women could swing Tory thus harming the Socialist cause She is said to have avoided the literary moralizing that characterized the age And most crucially both books are constructed from a blueprint that is also a kind of re nactment of the author s own childhood an idyll torn up at its roots by the exigencies of illness loss and grief br br br Legacy br br br Places br Edith Nesbit Walk and cycleway runs along the south side of Well Hall Pleasaunce in Eltham br Lee Green also in south east London has Edith
