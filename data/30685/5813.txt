Clive Staples Lewis November November was a British writer literary scholar and Anglican lay theologian He held academic positions in English literature at both Magdalen College Oxford and Magdalene College Cambridge He is best known as the author of The Chronicles of Narnia but he is also noted for his other works of fiction such as The Screwtape Letters and The Space Trilogy and for his non fiction Christian apologetics including Mere Christianity Miracles and The Problem of Pain br Lewis was a close friend of J R R Tolkien author of The Lord of the Rings Both men served on the English faculty at Oxford University and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the Inklings According to Lewis s memoir Surprised by Joy he was baptized in the Church of Ireland but fell away from his faith during adolescence Lewis returned to Anglicanism at the age of owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends and he became an ordinary layman of the Church of England Lewis s faith profoundly affected his work and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim br Lewis wrote more than books which have been translated into more than languages and have sold millions of copies The books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia have sold the most and have been popularized on stage TV radio and cinema His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian scholars from many denominations br In Lewis married American writer Joy Davidman she died of cancer four years later at the age of Lewis died on November from kidney failure at age In on the th anniversary of his death Lewis was honoured with a memorial in Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey br br br Life br br br Childhood br br Clive Staples Lewis was born in Belfast in Ulster Ireland before partition on November His father was Albert James Lewis a solicitor whose father Richard Lewis had come to Ireland from Wales during the mid th century Lewis s mother was Florence Augusta Lewis n e Hamilton known as Flora the daughter of Thomas Hamilton a Church of Ireland priest and the great granddaughter of both Bishop Hugh Hamilton and John Staples Lewis had an elder brother Warren Hamilton Lewis known as Warnie He was baptized on January by his maternal grandfather in St Mark s Church Dundela br When his dog Jacksie was fatally struck by a horse drawn carriage the four year old Lewis adopted the name Jacksie At first he would answer to no other name but later accepted Jack the name by which he was known to friends and family for the rest of his life When he was seven his family moved into Little Lea the family home of his childhood in the Strandtown area of East Belfast br As a boy Lewis was fascinated with anthropomorphic animals he fell in love with Beatrix Potter s stories and often wrote and illustrated his own animal tales Along with his brother Warnie he created the world of Boxen a fantasy land inhabited and run by animals Lewis loved to read from an early age His father s house was filled with books he later wrote that finding something to read was as easy as walking into a field and finding a new blade of grass br br Lewis was schooled by private tutors until age nine when his mother died in from cancer His father then sent him to England to live and study at Wynyard School in Watford Hertfordshire Lewis s brother had enrolled there three years previously Not long after the school was closed due to a lack of pupils Lewis then attended Campbell College in the east of Belfast about a mile from his home but left after a few months due to respiratory problems br He was then sent back to England to the health resort town of Malvern Worcestershire where he attended the preparatory school Cherbourg House which Lewis referred to as Chartres in his autobiography It was during this time that he abandoned the Christianity he was taught as a child and became an atheist During this time he also developed a fascination with European mythology and the occult br In September Lewis enrolled at Malvern College where he remained until the following June He found the school socially competitive After leaving Malvern he studied privately with William T Kirkpatrick his father s old tutor and former headmaster of Lurgan College br As a teenager Lewis was wonderstruck by the songs and legends of what he called Northernness the ancient literature of Scandinavia preserved in the Icelandic sagas These legends intensified an inner longing that he would later call joy He also grew to love nature its beauty reminded him of the stories of the North and the stories of the North reminded him of the beauties of nature His teenage writings moved away from the tales of Boxen and he began experimenting with different art forms such as epic poetry and opera to try to capture his new found interest in Norse mythology and the natural world br Studying with Kirkpatrick The Great Knock as Lewis afterward called him instilled in him a love of Greek literature and mythology and sharpened his debate and reasoning skills In Lewis was awarded a scholarship at University College Oxford br br br My Irish life br br Lewis experienced a certain cultural shock on first arriving in England No Englishman will be able to understand my first impressions of England Lewis wrote in Surprised by Joy The strange English accents with which I was surrounded seemed like the voices of demons But what was worst was the English landscape I have made up the quarrel since but at that moment I conceived a hatred for England which took many years to heal br From boyhood Lewis had immersed himself in Norse and Greek mythology and later in Irish mythology and literature He also expressed an interest in the Irish language though there is not much evidence that he laboured to learn it He developed a particular fondness for W B Yeats in part because of Yeats s use of Ireland s Celtic heritage in poetry In a letter to a friend Lewis wrote I have here discovered an author exactly after my own heart whom I am sure you would delight in W B Yeats He writes plays and poems of rare spirit and beauty about our old Irish mythology br In Lewis met Yeats twice since Yeats had moved to Oxford Lewis was surprised to find his English peers indifferent to Yeats and the Celtic Revival movement and wrote I am often surprised to find how utterly ignored Yeats is among the men I have met perhaps his appeal is purely Irish if so then thank the gods that I am Irish Early in his career Lewis considered sending his work to the major Dublin publishers writing If I do ever send my stuff to a publisher I think I shall try Maunsel those Dublin people and so tack myself definitely onto the Irish school br After his conversion to Christianity his interests gravitated towards Christian theology and away from pagan Celtic mysticism as opposed to Celtic Christian mysticism br Lewis occasionally expressed a somewhat tongue in cheek chauvinism towards the English Describing an encounter with a fellow Irishman he wrote Like all Irish people who meet in England we ended by criticisms on the invincible flippancy and dullness of the Anglo Saxon race After all there is no doubt ami that the Irish are the only people with all their faults I would not gladly live or die among another folk Throughout his life he sought out the company of other Irish people living in England and visited Northern Ireland regularly In he spent his honeymoon there at the Old Inn Crawfordsburn which he called my Irish life br Various critics have suggested that it was Lewis s dismay over the sectarian conflict in his native Belfast which led him to eventually adopt such an ecumenical brand of Christianity As one critic has said Lewis repeatedly extolled the virtues of all branches of the Christian faith emphasising a need for unity among Christians around what the Catholic writer G K Chesterton called Mere Christianity the core doctrinal beliefs that all denominations share On the other hand Paul Stevens of the University of Toronto has written that Lewis mere Christianity masked many of the political prejudices of an old fashioned Ulster Protestant a native of middle class Belfast for whom British withdrawal from Northern Ireland even in the s and s was unthinkable br br br First World War and Oxford University br br Lewis entered Oxford in the summer term studying at University College and shortly after he joined the Officers Training Corps at the university as his most promising route into the army From there he was drafted into a Cadet Battalion for training After his training he was commissioned into the rd Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry of the British Army as a Second Lieutenant and was later transferred to the st Battalion of the regiment then serving in France he would not remain with the rd Battalion as it moved to Northern Ireland Within months of entering Oxford he was shipped by the British Army to France to fight in the First World War br On his th birthday November Lewis arrived at the front line in the Somme Valley in France where he experienced trench warfare for the first time On April as st Battalion Somerset Light Infantry assaulted the village of Riez du Vinage in the midst of the German spring offensive Lewis was wounded and two of his colleagues were killed by a British shell falling short of its target He was depressed and homesick during his convalescence and upon his recovery in October he was assigned to duty in Andover England He was demobilized in December and soon restarted his studies In a later letter Lewis stated that his experience of the horrors of war along with the loss of his mother and unhappiness in school were the basis of his pessimism and atheism br After Lewis returned to Oxford University he received a First in Honour Moderations Greek and Latin literature in a First in Greats Philosophy and Ancient History in and a First in English in In he became a Philosophy tutor at University College and in was elected a Fellow and Tutor in English Literature at Magdalen College where he served for years until br br br Janie Moore br During his army training Lewis shared a room with another cadet Edward Courtnay Francis Paddy Moore Maureen Moore Paddy s sister said that the two made a mutual pact that if either died during the war the survivor would take care of both of their families Paddy was killed in action in and Lewis kept his promise Paddy had earlier introduced Lewis to his mother Janie King Moore and a friendship quickly sprang up between Lewis who was when they met and Janie who was The friendship with Moore was particularly important to Lewis while he was recovering from his wounds in hospital as his father did not visit him br Lewis lived with and cared for Moore until she was hospitalized in the late s He routinely introduced her as his mother referred to her as such in letters and developed a deeply affectionate friendship with her Lewis s own mother had died when he was a child while his father was distant demanding and eccentric br Speculation regarding their relationship resurfaced with the publication of A N Wilson s biography of Lewis Wilson who never met Lewis attempted to make a case for their having been lovers for a time Wilson s biography was not the first to address the question of Lewis s relationship with Moore George Sayer knew Lewis for years and he had sought to shed light on the relationship during the period of years before Lewis s conversion to Christianity In his biography Jack A Life of C S Lewis he wrote br br Were they lovers Owen Barfield who knew Jack well in the s once said that he thought the likelihood was fifty fifty Although she was twenty six years older than Jack she was still a handsome woman and he was certainly infatuated with her But it seems very odd if they were lovers that he would call her mother We know too that they did not share the same bedroom It seems most likely that he was bound to her by the promise he had given to Paddy and that his promise was reinforced by his love for her as his second mother br Later Sayer changed his mind In the introduction to the edition of his biography of Lewis he wrote br br I have had to alter my opinion of Lewis s relationship with Mrs Moore In chapter eight of this book I wrote that I was uncertain about whether they were lovers Now after conversations with Mrs Moore s daughter Maureen and a consideration of the way in which their bedrooms were arranged at The Kilns I am quite certain that they were br However the romantic nature of the relationship is doubted by other writers for example Philip Zaleski and Carol Zaleski write in The Fellowship that br br When or whether Lewis commenced an affair with Mrs Moore remains unclear br Lewis spoke well of Mrs Moore throughout his life saying to his friend George Sayer She was generous and taught me to be generous too In December Lewis wrote in a letter to his childhood friend Arthur Greeves that Janie and Greeves were the two people who matter most to me in the world br In Lewis moved into The Kilns with his brother Warnie Mrs Moore and her daughter Maureen The Kilns was a house in the district of Headington Quarry on the outskirts of Oxford now part of the suburb of Risinghurst They all contributed financially to the purchase of the house which eventually passed to Maureen who by then was Dame Maureen Dunbar when Warren died in br Moore had dementia in her later years and was eventually moved into a nursing home where she died in Lewis visited her every day in this home until her death br br br Return to Christianity br Lewis was raised in a religious family that attended the Church of Ireland He became an atheist at age though he later described his young self as being paradoxically very angry with God for not existing and equally angry with him for creating a world His early separation from Christianity began when he started to view his religion as a chore and a duty around this time he also gained an interest in the occult as his studies expanded to include such topics Lewis quoted Lucretius De rerum natura as having one of the strongest arguments for atheism br br which he translated poetically as follows br br This is a highly poetic rather than a literal translation A more literal translation by William Ellery Leonard reads That in no wise the nature of all things For us was fashioned by a power divine So great the faults it stands encumbered with br Lewis s interest in the works of the Scottish writer George MacDonald was part of what turned him from atheism This can be seen particularly well through this passage in Lewis s The Great Divorce chapter nine when the semi autobiographical main character meets MacDonald in Heaven br br I tried trembling to tell this man all that his writings had done for me I tried to tell how a certain frosty afternoon at Leatherhead Station when I had first bought a copy of Phantastes being then about sixteen years old had been to me what the first sight of Beatrice had been to Dante Here begins the new life I started to confess how long that Life had delayed in the region of imagination merely how slowly and reluctantly I had come to admit that his Christendom had more than an accidental connexion with it how hard I had tried not to see the true name of the quality which first met me in his books is Holiness br He eventually returned to Christianity having been influenced by arguments with his Oxford colleague and friend J R R Tolkien whom he seems to have met for the first time on May as well as the book The Everlasting Man by G K Chesterton Lewis vigorously resisted conversion noting that he was brought into Christianity like a prodigal kicking struggling resentful and darting his eyes in every direction for a chance to escape He described his last struggle in Surprised by Joy br br You must picture me alone in that room in Magdalen College Oxford night after night feeling whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work the steady unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet That which I greatly feared had at last come upon me In the Trinity Term of I gave in and admitted that God was God and knelt and prayed perhaps that night the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England br After his conversion to theism in Lewis converted to Christianity in following a long discussion during a late night walk along Addison s Walk with close friends Tolkien and Hugo Dyson He records making a specific commitment to Christian belief while on his way to the zoo with his brother He became a member of the Church of England somewhat to the disappointment of Tolkien who had hoped that he would join the Catholic Church br Lewis was a committed Anglican who upheld a largely orthodox Anglican theology though in his apologetic writings he made an effort to avoid espousing any one denomination In his later writings some believe that he proposed ideas such as purification of venial sins after death in purgatory The Great Divorce and Letters to Malcolm and mortal sin The Screwtape Letters which are generally considered to be Roman Catholic teachings although they are also widely held in Anglicanism particularly in high church Anglo Catholic circles Regardless Lewis considered himself an entirely orthodox Anglican to the end of his life reflecting that he had initially attended church only to receive communion and had been repelled by the hymns and the poor quality of the sermons He later came to consider himself honoured by worshipping with men of faith who came in shabby clothes and work boots and who sang all the verses to all the hymns br br br Second World War br After the outbreak of the Second World War in the Lewises took child evacuees from London and other cities into The Kilns Lewis was only when the war began and he tried to re enter military service offering to instruct cadets however his offer was not accepted He rejected the recruiting office s suggestion of writing columns for the Ministry of Information in the press as he did not want to write lies to deceive the enemy He later served in the local Home Guard in Oxford br From to Lewis spoke on religious programmes broadcast by the BBC from London while the city was under periodic air raids These broadcasts were appreciated by civilians and servicemen at that stage For example Air Chief Marshal Sir Donald Hardman wrote br br The war the whole of life everything tended to seem pointless We needed many of us a key to the meaning of the universe Lewis provided just that br The youthful Alistair Cooke was less impressed and in described the alarming vogue of Mr C S Lewis as an example of how wartime tends to spawn so many quack religions and Messiahs The broadcasts were anthologized in Mere Christianity From Lewis was occupied at his summer holiday weekends visiting R A F stations to speak on his faith invited by Chaplain in Chief Maurice Edwards br It was also during the same wartime period that Lewis was invited to become first President of the Oxford Socratic Club in January a position that he enthusiastically held until he resigned on appointment to Cambridge University in br br br Honour declined br Lewis was named on the last list of honours by George VI in December as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire CBE but declined so as to avoid association with any political issues br br br Chair at Cambridge University br In Lewis accepted the newly founded chair in Mediaeval and Renaissance Literature at Magdalene College Cambridge where he finished his career He maintained a strong attachment to the city of Oxford keeping a home there and returning on weekends until his death in br br br Joy Davidman br br In later life Lewis corresponded with Joy Davidman Gresham an American writer of Jewish background a former Communist and a convert from atheism to Christianity She was separated from her alcoholic and abusive husband novelist William L Gresham and came to England with her two sons David and Douglas Lewis at first regarded her as an agreeable intellectual companion and personal friend and it was on this level that he agreed to enter into a civil marriage contract with her so that she could continue to live in the UK They were married at the register office St Giles Oxford on April Lewis s brother Warren wrote For Jack the attraction was at first undoubtedly intellectual Joy was the only woman whom he had met who had a brain which matched his own in suppleness in width of interest and in analytical grasp and above all in humour and a sense of fun After complaining of a painful hip she was diagnosed with terminal bone cancer and the relationship developed to the point that they sought a Christian marriage Since she was divorced this was not straightforward in the Church of England at the time but a friend the Rev Peter Bide performed the ceremony at her bed in the Churchill Hospital on March br Gresham s cancer soon went into remission and the couple lived together as a family with Warren Lewis until when her cancer recurred She died on July Earlier that year the couple took a brief holiday in Greece and the Aegean Lewis was fond of walking but not of travel and this marked his only crossing of the English Channel after Lewis s book A Grief Observed describes his experience of bereavement in such a raw and personal fashion that he originally released it under the pseudonym N W Clerk to keep readers from associating the book with him Ironically many friends recommended the book to Lewis as a method for dealing with his own grief After Lewis s death his authorship was made public by Faber with the permission of the executors br Lewis had adopted Gresham s two sons and continued to raise them after her death Douglas Gresham is a Christian like Lewis and his mother while David Gresham turned to his mother s ancestral faith becoming Orthodox Jewish in his beliefs His mother s writings had featured the Jews in an unsympathetic manner particularly on shechita ritual slaughter David informed Lewis that he was going to become a shohet a ritual slaughterer to present this type of Jewish religious functionary to the world in a more favourable light In a interview Douglas Gresham acknowledged that he and his brother were not close although they had corresponded via email br David died on December In Douglas revealed that his brother had died at a Swiss mental hospital and that when David was a young man he had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia br br br Illness and death br br In early June Lewis began experiencing nephritis which resulted in blood poisoning His illness caused him to miss the autumn term at Cambridge though his health gradually began improving in and he returned that April His health continued to improve and according to his friend George Sayer Lewis was fully himself by early br On July that year Lewis fell ill and was admitted to the hospital he had a heart attack at pm the next day and lapsed into a coma but unexpectedly woke the following day at pm After he was discharged from the hospital Lewis returned to the Kilns though he was too ill to return to work As a result he resigned from his post at Cambridge in August br Lewis s condition continued to decline and he was diagnosed with end stage kidney failure in mid November He collapsed in his bedroom at pm on November at age and died a few minutes later He is buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church Headington Oxford His brother Warren died on April and was buried in the same grave br Media coverage of Lewis s death was almost completely overshadowed by news of the assassination of John F Kennedy which occurred on the same day approximately minutes following Lewis s collapse as did the death of English writer Aldous Huxley author of Brave New World This coincidence was the inspiration for Peter Kreeft s book Between Heaven and Hell A Dialog Somewhere Beyond Death with John F Kennedy C S Lewis Aldous Huxley Lewis is commemorated on November in the church calendar of the Episcopal Church br br br Career br br br Scholar br br Lewis began his academic career as an undergraduate student at Oxford University where he won a triple first the highest honours in three areas of study He was then elected a Fellow of Magdalen College Oxford where he worked for nearly thirty years from to In he was awarded the newly founded chair of Mediaeval and Renaissance Literature at Cambridge University and was elected a fellow of Magdalene College Concerning his appointed academic field he argued that there was no such thing as an English Renaissance Much of his scholarly work concentrated on the later Middle Ages especially its use of allegory His The Allegory of Love helped reinvigorate the serious study of late medieval narratives such as the Roman de la Rose br br Lewis was commissioned to write the volume English Literature in the Sixteenth Century Excluding Drama for the Oxford History of English Literature His book A Preface to Paradise Lost is still cited as a criticism of that work His last academic work The Discarded Image An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature is a summary of the medieval world view a reference to the discarded image of the cosmos br Lewis was a prolific writer and his circle of literary friends became an informal discussion society known as the Inklings including J R R Tolkien Nevill Coghill Lord David Cecil Charles Williams Owen Barfield and his brother Warren Lewis Glyer points to December as the Inklings beginning date Lewis s friendship with Coghill and Tolkien grew during their time as members of the Kolb tar an Old Norse reading group that Tolkien founded and which ended around the time of the inception of the Inklings At Oxford he was the tutor of poet John Betjeman critic Kenneth Tynan mystic Bede Griffiths novelist Roger Lancelyn Green and Sufi scholar Martin Lings among many other undergraduates The religious and conservative Betjeman detested Lewis whereas the anti establishment Tynan retained a lifelong admiration for him br Of Tolkien Lewis writes in Surprised by Joy br br When I began teaching for the English Faculty I made two other friends both Christians these queer people seemed now to pop up on every side who were later to give me much help in getting over the last stile They were HVV Dyson and JRR Tolkien Friendship with the latter marked the breakdown of two old prejudices At my first coming into the world I had been implicitly warned never to trust a Papist and at my first coming into the English Faculty explicitly never to trust a philologist Tolkien was both br br br Novelist br In addition to his scholarly work Lewis wrote several popular novels including the science fiction Space Trilogy for adults and the Narnia fantasies for children Most deal implicitly with Christian themes such as sin humanity s fall from grace and redemption br His first novel after becoming a Christian was The Pilgrim s Regress which depicted his journey to Christianity in the allegorical style of John Bunyan s The Pilgrim s Progress The book was poorly received by critics at the time although David Martyn Lloyd Jones one of Lewis s contemporaries at Oxford gave him much valued encouragement Asked by Lloyd Jones when he would write another book Lewis replied When I understand the meaning of prayer br The Space Trilogy also called the Cosmic Trilogy or Ransom Trilogy dealt with what Lewis saw as the dehumanizing trends in contemporary science fiction The first book Out of the Silent Planet was apparently written following a conversation with his friend J R R Tolkien about these trends Lewis agreed to write a space travel story and Tolkien a time travel one but Tolkien never completed The Lost Road linking his Middle earth to the modern world Lewis s main character Elwin Ransom is based in part on Tolkien a fact to which Tolkien alludes in his letters br The second novel Perelandra depicts a new Garden of Eden on the planet Venus a new Adam and Eve and a new serpent figure to tempt Eve The story can be seen as an account of what might have happened if the terrestrial Adam had defeated the serpent and avoided the Fall of Man with Ransom intervening in the novel to ransom the new Adam and Eve from the deceptions of the enemy The third novel That Hideous Strength develops the theme of nihilistic science threatening traditional human values embodied in Arthurian legend br Many ideas in the trilogy particularly opposition to dehumanization as portrayed in the third book are presented more formally in The Abolition of Man based on a series of lectures by Lewis at Durham University in Lewis stayed in Durham where he says he was overwhelmed by the magnificence of the cathedral That Hideous Strength is in fact set in the environs of Edgestow university a small English university like Durham though Lewis disclaims any other resemblance between the two br Walter Hooper Lewis s literary executor discovered a fragment of another science fiction novel apparently written by Lewis called The Dark Tower Ransom appears in the story but it is not clear whether the book was intended as part of the same series of novels The manuscript was eventually published in though Lewis scholar Kathryn Lindskoog doubts its authenticity br br The Chronicles of Narnia considered a classic of children s literature is a series of seven fantasy novels Written between and and illustrated by Pauline Baynes the series is Lewis s most popular work having sold over million copies in languages Kelly Guthmann It has been adapted several times complete or in part for radio television stage and cinema br The books contain Christian ideas intended to be easily accessible to young readers In addition to Christian themes Lewis also borrows characters from Greek and Roman mythology as well as traditional British and Irish fairy tales br Lewis s last novel Till We Have Faces a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche was published in Although Lewis called it far and away my best book it was not as well reviewed as his previous work br br br Other works br Lewis wrote several works on Heaven and Hell One of these The Great Divorce is a short novella in which a few residents of Hell take a bus ride to Heaven where they are met by people who dwell there The proposition is that they can stay if they choose in which case they can call the place where they had come from Purgatory instead of Hell but many find it not to their taste The title is a reference to William Blake s The Marriage of Heaven and Hell a concept that Lewis found a disastrous error This work deliberately echoes two other more famous works with a similar theme the Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri and Bunyan s The Pilgrim s Progress br Another short work The Screwtape Letters which he dedicated to J R R Tolkien consists of letters of advice from senior demon Screwtape to his nephew Wormwood on the best ways to tempt a particular human and secure his damnation Lewis s last novel was Till We Have Faces which he thought of as his most mature and masterly work of fiction but which was never a popular success It is a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche from the unusual perspective of Psyche s sister It is deeply concerned with religious ideas but the setting is entirely pagan and the connections with specific Christian beliefs are left implicit br Before Lewis s conversion to Christianity he published two books Spirits in Bondage a collection of poems and Dymer a single narrative poem Both were published under the pen name Clive Hamilton Other narrative poems have since been published posthumously including Launcelot The Nameless Isle and The Queen of Drum br He also wrote The Four Loves which rhetorically explains four categories of love friendship eros affection and charity br In a partial draft was discovered of Language and Human Nature which Lewis had begun co writing with J R R Tolkien but which was never completed br In an original poem was discovered in a collection of documents in Special Collections at the University of Leeds Its Old English title M d r e Ne W g is not easily translated into modern English and references the epic poem Beowulf The poem was addressed to professor of English Eric Valentine Gordon and his wife Dr Ida Gordon It was written under the pen name Nat Whilk meaning someone in Old English br br br Christian apologist br Lewis is also regarded by many as one of the most influential Christian apologists of his time in addition to his career as an English professor and an author of fiction Mere Christianity was voted best book of the th century by Christianity Today in He has been called The Apostle to the Skeptics due to his approach to religious belief as a sceptic and his following conversion br Lewis was very interested in presenting an argument from reason against metaphysical naturalism and for the existence of God Mere Christianity The Problem of Pain and Miracles were all concerned to one degree or another with refuting popular objections to Christianity such as the question How could a good God allow pain to exist in the world He also became a popular lecturer and broadcaster and some of his writing originated as scripts for radio talks or lectures including much of Mere Christianity br According to George Sayer losing a debate with Elizabeth Anscombe also a Christian led Lewis to re evaluate his role as an apologist and his future works concentrated on devotional literature and children s books Anscombe had a completely different recollection of the debate s outcome and its emotional effect on Lewis Victor Reppert also disputes Sayer listing some of Lewis s post apologetic publications including the second and revised edition of his Miracles in in which Lewis addressed Anscombe s criticism Noteworthy too is Roger Teichman s suggestion in The Philosophy of Elizabeth Anscombe that the intellectual impact of Anscombe s paper on Lewis s philosophical self confidence should not be over rated it seems unlikely that he felt as irretrievably crushed as some of his acquaintances have made out the episode is probably an inflated legend in the same category as the affair of Wittgenstein s Poker Certainly Anscombe herself believed that Lewis s argument though flawed was getting at something very important she thought that this came out more in the improved version of it that Lewis presented in a subsequent edition of Miracles though that version also had much to criticize in it br Lewis wrote an autobiography titled Surprised by Joy which places special emphasis on his own conversion He also wrote many essays and public speeches on Christian belief many of which were collected in God in the Dock and The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses br His most famous works the Chronicles of Narnia contain many strong Christian messages and are often considered allegory Lewis an expert on the subject of allegory maintained that the books were not allegory and preferred to call the Christian aspects of them suppositional As Lewis wrote in a letter to a Mrs Hook in December br br If Aslan represented the immaterial Deity in the same way in which Giant Despair a character in The Pilgrim s Progress represents despair he would be an allegorical figure In reality he is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question What might Christ become like if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours This is not allegory at all br Prior to his conversion Lewis used the word Moslem to refer to Muslims adherents of Islam following his conversion however he started using Mohammedans and described Islam as a Christian heresy rather than an independent religion br br br Trilemma br br In a much cited passage from Mere Christianity Lewis challenged the view that Jesus was a great moral teacher but not God He argued that Jesus made several implicit claims to divinity which would logically exclude that claim br br I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him I m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher but I don t accept his claim to be God That is the one thing we must not say A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher He would either be a lunatic on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg or else he would be the Devil of Hell You must make your choice Either this man was and is the Son of God or else a madman or something worse You can shut him up for a fool you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher He has not left that open to us He did not intend to br Although this argument is sometimes called Lewis s trilemma Lewis did not invent it but rather developed and popularized it It has also been used by Christian apologist Josh McDowell in his book More Than a Carpenter It has been widely repeated in Christian apologetic literature but largely ignored by professional theologians and biblical scholars br Lewis s Christian apologetics and this argument in particular have been criticized Philosopher John Beversluis described Lewis s arguments as textually careless and theologically unreliable and this particular argument as logically unsound and an example of a false dilemma The Pluralist theologian John Hick claimed that New Testament scholars do not now support the view that Jesus claimed to be God The Anglican New Testament scholar N T Wright criticizes Lewis for failing to recognize the significance of Jesus s Jewish identity and setting an oversight which at best drastically short circuits the argument and which lays Lewis open to criticism that his argument doesn t work as history and it backfires dangerously when historical critics question his reading of the gospels although he argues that this doesn t undermine the eventual claim br Lewis used a similar argument in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe when the old Professor advises his young guests that their sister s claims of a magical world must logically be taken as either lies madness or truth br br br Universal morality br One of the main theses in Lewis s apologia is that there is a common morality known throughout humanity which he calls natural law In the first five chapters of Mere Christianity Lewis discusses the idea that people have a standard of behaviour to which they expect people to adhere Lewis claims that people all over the earth know what this law is and when they break it He goes on to claim that there must be someone or something behind such a universal set of principles br br These then are the two points that I wanted to make First that human beings all over the earth have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way and cannot really get rid of it Secondly that they do not in fact behave in that way They know the Law of Nature they break it These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in br Lewis also portrays Universal Morality in his works of fiction In The Chronicles of Narnia he describes Universal Morality as the deep magic which everyone knew br In the second chapter of Mere Christianity Lewis recognizes that many people find it difficult to understand what this Law of Human Nature is And he responds first to the idea that the Moral Law is simply our herd instinct and second to the idea that the Moral Law is simply a social convention In responding to the second idea Lewis notes that people often complain that one set of moral ideas is better than another but that this actually argues for there existing some Real Morality to which they are comparing other moralities Finally he notes that sometimes differences in moral codes are exaggerated by people who confuse differences in beliefs about morality with differences in beliefs about facts br br I have met people who exaggerate the differences because they have not distinguished between differences of morality and differences of belief about facts For example one man said to me Three hundred years ago people in England were putting witches to death Was that what you call the Rule of Human Nature or Right Conduct But surely the reason we do not execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things If we did if we really thought that there were people going about who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or drive them mad or bring bad weather surely we would all agree that if anyone deserved the death penalty then these filthy quislings did There is no difference of moral principle here the difference is simply about matter of fact It may be a great advance in knowledge not to believe in witches there is no moral advance in not executing them when you do not think they are there You would not call a man humane for ceasing to set mousetraps if he did so because he believed there were no mice in the house br Lewis also had fairly progressive views on the topic of animal morality in particular the suffering of animals as is evidenced by several of his essays most notably On Vivisection and On the Pains of Animals br br br Legacy br br Lewis continues to attract a wide readership In The Times ranked him eleventh on their list of the greatest British writers since Readers of his fiction are often unaware of what Lewis considered the Christian themes of his works His Christian apologetics are read and quoted by members of many Christian denominations In on the
