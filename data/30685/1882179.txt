The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian is a high fantasy film directed by Andrew Adamson who co wrote the screenplay with Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely based on the novel Prince Caspian Produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media the second published and fourth chronological novel in the children s book series The Chronicles of Narnia by C S Lewis The sequel to The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe it is the second installment in The Chronicles of Narnia film series br William Moseley Anna Popplewell Skandar Keynes Georgie Henley Liam Neeson and Tilda Swinton reprise their roles from the previous film while new cast includes Ben Barnes Sergio Castellitto Peter Dinklage Eddie Izzard Warwick Davis Ken Stott and Vincent Grass In the film the four Pevensie siblings return to Narnia to aid Prince Caspian in his struggle for the throne against his corrupt uncle King Miraz br Work on the script for the film began before The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe was released so filming could begin before the actors grew too old for their parts Director Andrew Adamson wanted to make the film more spectacular than the first and created an action sequence not in the novel The Narnians were designed to look wilder as they have been hiding from persecution stressing the darker tone of the sequel The filmmakers also took a Spanish influence for the antagonistic race of the Telmarines Filming began in February in New Zealand but unlike the previous film the majority of shooting took place in Central Europe because of the larger sets available in those countries To keep costs down Adamson chose to base post production in the United Kingdom because of recent tax credits there br The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian premiered on May at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City before it was theatrically released on May in the United States and on June in the United Kingdom by Walt Disney Pictures The film received generally positive reviews from critics Many praised the performances and visual effects however the film s darker tone and mature themes drew polarizing opinions It was a moderate success at the box office grossing million during its opening weekend By the end of its theatrical run it had grossed million worldwide becoming the tenth highest grossing film of br Prince Caspian was the last The Chronicles of Narnia film to be co produced by Walt Disney Pictures as th Century Fox became the distributor for the next film The Chronicles of Narnia The Voyage of the Dawn Treader due to budgetary disputes between Disney and Walden Media but as a result of Disney eventually purchasing st Century Fox in Disney now owns the rights to all the films in the series br br br Plot br In Narnia almost years after the Pevensie siblings King Peter Queen Susan King Edmund and Queen Lucy left Narnia and returned to their world Caspian a Telmarine prince is awakened by his mentor Doctor Cornelius Doctor Cornelius informs Caspian that his aunt has just given birth to a son and that his life is now in grave danger Cornelius gives him Queen Susan s ancient magical horn and instructs him to use it if he is in dire need Knowing that his Uncle Miraz would kill him to be king Caspian flees Chased by several Telmarine soldiers Caspian falls from his horse and encounters two Narnian dwarfs and a talking badger in the woods One of the dwarfs Trumpkin is captured by the soldiers after sacrificing himself to save Caspian The other dwarf Nikabrik and the badger Trufflehunter save Caspian Not knowing they are trying to save him Caspian blows the magical horn trying to summon help br In England after one year has passed in their world since they left Narnia the four Pevensie children wait at the Strand tube station for their train which will take them to boarding school Just as the train pulls into the station the station tears apart and they are transported back to Narnia There they discover their castle Cair Paravel was attacked and ruined in their absence The Pevensies save a bound and gagged Trumpkin who is about to be drowned and they set out together Lucy sees Aslan trying to show them a safe path but finds her siblings unable to see him She later manages to contact Aslan in a dream but only Edmund believes her br Meanwhile Nikabrik and Trufflehunter lead Caspian to the Dancing Lawn where all the old Narnians have assembled Caspian convinces them to help him win his throne Caspian and his troops encounter the Pevensies and Trumpkin and they journey together to Aslan s How a huge underground hall built over the Stone Table Lucy wants to wait for Aslan but Peter decides they have waited long enough and suggests attacking Miraz s castle The Narnians infiltrate the castle but Caspian learning that Miraz is responsible for his father s death confronts his uncle and compromises the attack The attack fails because of Caspian s actions and many Narnians are killed due to Peter s recklessness br Nikabrik and a werewolf tell Caspian that there is a way he can claim revenge When Caspian agrees a hag uses black sorcery to summon the White Witch From inside a wall of ice the spirit of the Witch tries to convince Caspian to give her a drop of his blood to resurrect her The spirit of the Witch attempts to convince Peter to do the same Edmund Trumpkin and Lucy arrive and kill the rogues Edmund shatters the wall of ice before the Witch can be resurrected br Seeking redemption Peter challenges Miraz to a one on one duel to buy Lucy time to find Aslan Peter wounds Miraz and gives his sword to Caspian to finish him off Caspian spares Miraz s life but says he intends to return Narnia to its people Lord Sopespian one of Miraz s generals kills Miraz with an arrow and blames the Narnians igniting a massive battle between the Narnians and the Telmarines Lucy meanwhile has found Aslan in the woods he awakens the trees and the whole forest suddenly attacks the Telmarines Lord Sopespian orders the retreat only to be confronted by Lucy and Aslan Aslan summons a river god who wipes out most of the Telmarine army including Sopespian the surviving Telmarine soldiers surrender to the Narnians br Caspian becomes the King of Narnia and with Aslan s help brings peace between the Narnian and Telmarine kingdoms Before the Pevensies depart Peter and Susan reveal that Aslan has told them they will never re enter Narnia again since they have learned all they can from Narnia but Lucy and Edmund might still come back The Pevensies return to England leaving Caspian as King of Narnia br br br Cast br br Pevensies br William Moseley as Peter Pevensie In a departure from the novel Peter has a rivalry with Caspian Moseley explained Peter s got his own issues to deal with and Caspian s got his own issues to deal with and when neither is willing to compromise there s bound to be friction Peter came back to Narnia expecting to be king again and that everyone would do as he said and Caspian is unwilling to let him take over so that causes some of it That s really what happens And it s a lot about humility I think they both have to learn a certain humility and that s really what a great king needs is to be humble to listen to his people to be willing to compromise and they start off as these sort of angry teenagers and become kings at the end In real life the two actors got on well together Moseley also stated that he identified with Peter having gone back to school between shooting both films He trained for three months in New York City to improve his performance and his physicality br Anna Popplewell as Susan Pevensie the second oldest Pevensie Popplewell had been disappointed she barely used her bow and arrows in the first film Adamson convinced Douglas Gresham to have her present during the battles by suggesting her passive role in the novel indicated Lewis view of women before he met Joy Gresham I think Lewis cast women down in the earlier books but when you look at The Horse and His Boy it has a strong female character Doug s mother was a strong woman Adamson also chose to have her fall for Caspian because The kids are growing up If you look at Ben and you look at Anna it seems really implausible that they wouldn t have some feelings for each other He knew it had to be sensitively handled though and ultimately it is not about romance but accepting the fact that you can have a wondrous experience enjoy it and move on Popplewell added that it would not make sense for the Narnians not to use Susan a talented archer in battle and that the romance contributed to her character s reconciliation with losing Narnia in the first place br Skandar Keynes as Edmund Pevensie the second youngest Pevensie Edmund matured during the events of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe so the writers saw him as our Han Solo doing the right thing and probably going to be a little low key about it highlighting the immaturity of his older brother Keynes bruised his heel when performing a stunt where he jumped onto a horse He narrowly missed landing on it and hit his foot against a column when holding on Excepting that he enjoyed performing the action br Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie Henley acknowledged Lucy represents faith in the story being the youngest and therefore most open minded of the Pevensies During filming Henley s baby teeth were falling out so she wore fake teeth to fill in the gaps br br Telmarines br Ben Barnes as Prince Caspian Adamson said Caspian is a coming of age and to some degree a loss of innocence story with Caspian starting out quite na ve then craving revenge and finally letting go of the vengeance Andrew Garfield auditioned for the role but was passed up for not being handsome enough according to his agent Nicholas Hoult also auditioned While many readers interpret Caspian as a child a passage in the novel mentions his age to be near that of Peter s so an older actor was sought to match Moseley Barnes had read the novel as a child and was cast in two and a half weeks after meeting with the filmmakers He spent two months in New Zealand horse riding and stunt training to prepare for shooting Barnes modelled his Spanish accent on Mandy Patinkin s performance as Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride though he also had a dialect coach aiding him Adamson did not expect to cast a British actor as Caspian and said Barnes fitted well into the surrogate family of Adamson and the four actors playing the Pevensies When cast Barnes was set to tour with the Royal National Theatre s production of The History Boys producer Mark Johnson joked Barnes probably isn t the Nation s favourite actor right now Barnes left England without telling the Theatre They were furious when they found out that he had left them without permission so they considered suing him for breach of contract but decided against it br Sergio Castellitto as King Miraz Castellitto was not familiar with the novel but his four children had enjoyed the first film Miraz marks the first time the Italian actor has portrayed a villain and he found it interesting to act out a stereotype Nonetheless he also felt that he and Adamson brought depth to the role explaining Miraz is a soldier not a coward and that he takes the throne for his son He compared the character to King Claudius in Hamlet br Pierfrancesco Favino as General Glozelle Miraz s military commander who plots with Sopespian to have his king killed in combat with Caspian and Peter in order to lead his own attack on the Narnians However in the end Glozelle repents and is the first to volunteer to go into the Pevensies world and in return is granted a good future by Aslan This was Favino s idea because originally Glozelle would have died in battle Adamson dubbed the character a real Benedict Arnold Favino is able to speak several languages and generally acted as a translator to Adamson on set while working with actors and crew members of multiple nationalities br Dami n Alc zar as Lord Sopespian In some ways Sopespian turns out to be the real bad guy of the film Adamson said Where it seems that Miraz has the upper hand at the beginning we see that Sopespian like Shakespeare s Iago is trying to manipulate the situation Alc zar was originally offered the role of Miraz but once the filmmakers were informed that his little height would prevent him from intimidating Barnes taller Caspian Adamson decided to cast him as Sopespian promising him to still give him a larger role br Vincent Grass as Dr Cornelius Caspian s mentor who is half dwarf Adamson compared Caspian and Cornelius s relationship to Aristotle and Alexander the Great Cornelius s role in the movie is significantly smaller than in the novel and he is not named on screen being referred to only as Professor br Alicia Borrachero as Queen Prunaprismia Prunaprismia was Miraz s wife When she had learned that her husband had killed his own brother she became heartbroken After Miraz s death Prunaprismia was the second volunteer to go back to our world with her child Because of her repenting Prunaprismia and her child were promised a good life back in our world br Sim n Andreu as Lord Scythley br Predrag Bjelac as Lord Donnon br David Bowles as Lord Gregoire He served as one of the marshals during the duel between Peter and Miraz br Juan Diego Montoya Garcia as Lord Montoya br br Narnians br Liam Neeson reprises his role as the voice of the lion Aslan Aslan is more parental here he lets the kids well make their own mistakes Aslan s entrance was filmed as a dream sequence to emphasize his messianic nature and not make it reflect badly on his absence when Narnia is in turmoil Although the character is considered C S Lewis version of Jesus Neeson see s him more as the spirit of the planet this living breathing planet That s what he stands for for me more what the native Americans would believe As Aslan has fewer action scenes than in the first film the animators found it difficult to make him move interestingly His pose had to be regal but if he moved his head too much he would remind viewers of a dog As well as having his size increased by fifteen percent Aslan s eyes were also changed to look less Egyptian Many of his shots were finished at the last minute br Peter Dinklage as Trumpkin a cynical red dwarf Dinklage was Adamson and Johnson s first choice having seen him in The Station Agent He accepted because often you get the hero and the villain and not much in between Trumpkin is in between He is not a lovable Snow White dwarf Audiences appreciate these cynical characters It helps parents and adults to go along with the journey Dinklage s prosthetics took three hours to apply and restricted his performance to his eyes Even his frown was built into the make up On his first day of filming he was bitten by sand flies and fell into a river We were lucky that he returned after his first day recalled Johnson br Warwick Davis as Nikabrik a black dwarf He is descendant of Ginarrbrik who served the White Witch and bears one of his rings which was passed down from each generation Mark Johnson acknowledged casting Davis as the treacherous Nikabrik was casting against type Berger covered all his face bar his eyelids in prosthetics to allow Davis to ward off the audience s perceptions of him Nikabrik s nose was based on Berger Davis feared filming in the Czech Republic because the grass is filled with ticks so he put elastic bands to hold his trousers against his legs Davis portrayed Reepicheep in the BBC production of Prince Caspian br Ken Stott as the voice of Trufflehunter the badger Adamson called Trufflehunter a walking and talking Narnian library who is totally old school The animators visited a badger sanctuary to aid in depicting his performance br Eddie Izzard as the voice of Reepicheep a swashbuckling mouse Over actors auditioned to voice the character Izzard approached Reepicheep as less camp and more of a bloodthirsty assassin with a sense of honour a cross between Mad Max and a Stormtrooper from Star Wars Izzard interpreted Reepicheep as someone whose family was killed by the Telmarines The Narnia series were some of the few books Izzard read as a child and he cherished them When discussing Reepicheep with the animators Adamson told them to rent as many Errol Flynn films as possible Adamson credits Izzard for making the role his own beforehand the director was approaching the character similarly to Puss in Boots in Shrek br Cornell John as Glenstorm the Centaur Adamson had seen John perform in Porgy and Bess in London and liked his long face John imagined the character as being years old and wanted to convey honour pride and tradition br Lejla Abbasov as Windmane Glenstorm s wife br Yemi Akinyemi as Ironhoof Glenstorm s son br Carlos Da Silva as Suncloud Glenstorm s son br Ephraim Goldin as Rainstone Glenstorm s son br David Walliams as the voice of the Bulgy Bear br Klara Issova as a Narnian Hag who attempts to resurrect the White Witch She used some Arabic words in her incantation br Gomez Mussenden son of costume designer Isis Mussenden plays Lightning Bolt a child Centaur br Jan Pavel Filipensky as Wimbleweather the giant br Shane Rangi as Asterius an elderly minotaur who aids Caspian Josh Campbell provides the voice for the character Asterius is killed during the raid while holding the gate open to allow some of the army to escape Rangi also stood in for Aslan the Bulgy Bear the werewolf another minotaur and the wild bear on set Rangi played General Otmin in the previous film and Tavros in The Voyage of The Dawn Treader He was able to see more in the redesigned animatronic minotaur heads though in order to make the eye line straight and correct you ve actually got to hold your head down so your view is only about a foot and a half in front of you which still makes it a little bit hard This resulted in Rangi knocking himself against the rising gate of the Telmarine castle although he was fine and it was the animatronic head that bore the brunt of the damage The costumes were still very hot reducing him to a walking waterfall Although a head sculpt of Aslan was used to stand in for the character on the first film Rangi had to portray the character on set because Lucy interacts with him more Rangi lost four kilograms wearing all his costumes Rangi also portrayed the werewolf and he was the physical stand in for Aslan the Bulgy Bear and the wild bear br Cameos br Tilda Swinton reprises her role as Jadis the White Witch Her ghost appears as the hag and werewolf attempt to resurrect her Swinton and her two children also cameoed towards the film s end as centaurs br Harry Gregson Williams the film s composer as the voice of Pattertwig the squirrel as Adamson felt he had a squirrel like energy br Douglas Gresham as a Telmarine crier br br br Production br br br Writing br br Before the release of The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe the screenplay for the sequel Prince Caspian had already been written Director Andrew Adamson said the decision was made to follow the publication order of the novels because if we don t make it now we ll never be able to because the actors will be too old Prince Caspian the second published novel in the series is the fourth chronologically The Horse and His Boy takes place during a time only hinted at in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe The writers briefly considered combining Caspian with The Voyage of the Dawn Treader which the BBC did for their television adaptation br Screenwriters Christopher Markus Stephen McFeely wanted to explore how the Pevensies felt after returning from Narnia going from being kings and queens back to an awkward year as school children They noted C S Lewis doesn t much consider what it would be like for a King of Narnia to return to being a s schoolchild They also decided to introduce the Pevensies back into Narnia nearer the start in order to weave the two separate stories of the Pevensies and Caspian in contrast to the book s structure A sense of guilt on the Pevensies part was added seeing the destruction of Narnia in their absence as was hubris for Peter to enhance the theme of belief his arrogance means he is unable to see Aslan br Adamson also desired to make the film larger in scale I ve gained confidence having gone through the first This time I was able to go larger in scale with more extras and bigger battle scenes Inspired by a passage in the novel where Reepicheep says he would like to attack the castle a new battle scene in which Peter and Caspian make an attempted raid on Miraz s castle was created Adamson felt the imagery of mythological Greek creatures storming a castle was highly original Markus and McFeely used the sequence to illustrate Peter and Caspian s conflict and Edmund s maturity in an effort to tighten the script by using action as drama Adamson preferred subtlety to the drama scenes asking his young male actors not to perform angrily Adamson copied Alfred Hitchcock by tell ing people at the end of the scene Now just give me something where you re not thinking about anything By using it in context the audience will read an emotion into it br br br Design br br Andrew Adamson described the film as being darker as it takes place another years later and Narnia has been oppressed by Telmarines for a large period of that time so it s a dirtier grittier darker place than the last world was He added This one is more of a boy s movie It s a harsher world The villains are human and that lends a more realistic attitude Creatures were designed by veteran horror and monster concept artist Jordu Schell and supervised by Howard Berger who said that Prince Caspian would be more medieval than The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Alongside Adamson Berger s children critiqued his designs aiding the process his son thought the werewolf s ears were silly so they were made smaller br For the Narnians Berger envisioned them as more wild in appearance as they have been forced into the forests He also decided to increase the portrayal of various ages sizes and races The black dwarfs are distinguished from the red dwarfs as they have more leather and jewellery and a darker colour scheme in their costumes Each race of creatures also had their fighting styles made more distinguishable The minotaurs have maces and the centaurs use swords The satyrs were redesigned as their creation on the first film had been rushed Four thousand and six hundred make up jobs were performed which Berger believes is a record br The filmmakers interpreted the Telmarines including Caspian as being Spanish because of their pirate origins which producer Mark Johnson noted made Caspian a contrast to the lily white Pevensies Production designer Roger Ford originally wanted the Telmarines to be French as they had a confrontational history with the English who are represented by the Pevensies This was scrapped as the crew were unable to shoot at Pierrefonds Castle for Miraz s lair so they went for the Spanish feel Weta Workshop created masked helmets for their army and faceplates for the live horses on set The stunt soldiers wield two hundred polearms in two different styles two hundred rapiers of varying design over a hundred falchions two hundred and fifty shields and fifty five crossbows Caspian s own sword is a variation of the Royal Guard s weapons Costume designer Isis Mussenden looked to the paintings of El Greco to inspire the Telmarines costumes She wanted to use colours that looked acidic and hot and cool at the same time unlike the red and gold seen in the Narnian soldiers Their masked helmets are based on conquistadors and samurai She visited the armour archives of the Metropolitan Museum of Art for inspiration An eagle emblem was incorporated into the characters lairs to make them feel fascist br br br Filming br Eight months were spent scouting locations including Ireland China and Argentina before New Zealand Prague Slovenia and Poland were chosen Whereas the previous film was predominantly shot in New Zealand with a few months of filming in Central Europe Adamson decided New Zealand lacked enough sound stages to accommodate the larger scale of the film The decision to film most of the picture in Europe also allowed the ability to shoot during summer in both continents although the weather turned out to be so erratic during filming that Adamson joked he had been lied to br br Filming began on February in Auckland The scene where the Pevensies return to the ruined Cair Paravel was shot at Cathedral Cove The filmmakers chose the location because it had a tunnel like arch which echoed the train tunnel the children go into before being summoned back into Narnia Henderson Valley Studios was used for the Pevensies ancient treasure room and the Underground station br On April the crew began filming at Barrandov Studios in Prague There sets such as Miraz s castle Aslan s How and the underground hiding places of the Narnians were created The foot tall m castle was built to scale because Adamson felt he overused digital sets on the last film The castle was built in the open air during winter where the temperature would drop to F C Miraz s courtyard is the largest set in production designer Roger Ford s career including the previous Narnia film Aslan s How was modified into the hideout after filming for those scenes was finished To create Trufflehunter s den Ford s crew put a camera inside a badger s den to study what it should look like The den s roof had to be raised by three inches because Ben Barnes was too tall br In June they shot the bridge battle near Bovec in the So a Valley Slovenia The location was chosen for its resemblance to New Zealand A large bridge was built which was modelled on the one Julius Caesar built to cross the Rhine Whereas Caesar supposedly built his bridge in ten days the filmmakers had around forty The schedule was short though but the authorities would only allow them this build time to not completely disrupt normal summer activities on the lake The filmmakers made a trench to change the river s course so they could deepen the drained sides of the riverbed so it looked like one could drown in it The crew also cut down trees for shots of the Telmarines building the bridge the trees were moved to another side of the river for decoration The bridge stood for two months before being dismantled As part of the clean up the cut down trees and parts of the bridge were sent to a recycling plant while other portions of the bridge were sent to the studio for close ups shot against bluescreen br br Part of the battle was shot at st nad Labem in the Czech Republic Only the entrance to Aslan s How was built on location Adamson wanted Peter and Miraz s duel to feel unique and not like a controlled overly choreographed fencing match Moseley and Castellitto began training for the scene in November The stunt coordinator Allan Poppleton doubled for Castellitto in some shots because they are similar in size For claustrophobic shots cameras were built into their shields The main camera was placed on a degree track surrounding the ruin it takes place on The filmmakers dug a large hole in the ground for the scene where the Narnians cause the pillars supporting the growth near Aslan s How to collapse on the Telmarines The earth was then restored following completion of the scene They also had to restore the grass after filming numerous cavalry charges fern plants were imported to the Czech Republic to create a forest A scene shot in Poland which involved building a cliff face also had to leave no trace behind Filming finished by September br br br Effects br Prince Caspian has over special effects shots more than The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe s effects shots yet the film had less time to complete them The scale of special effects led Andrew Adamson to base production in the UK to take advantage of new tax credits Therefore it legally qualifies as a British film This also meant the director only had to walk five minutes from the editing room to supervise the effects British visual effects companies the Moving Picture Company and Framestore CFC were hired to create the visual effects alongside Weta Digital Framestore worked on Aslan Trufflehunter and the door in the air Scanline did the River god Weta created the werewolf the wild bear and Miraz s castle MPC and Escape Studios did the main battle the tunnel scene the castle assault the council scenes and all the other creatures br Alex Funke who worked on The Lord of the Rings directed the film s miniatures unit These include th and th scale miniatures of Miraz s castle A scale model was built of the Narnians cave hideouts during the climactic battle which the actor playing the giant Wimbleweather was filmed against One of the improvements made over the previous film was to make the centaurs walk during dialogue scenes so Cornell John as Glenstorm wore Power Risers mechanical stilts with springs to mimic a horse s canter and height The animatronic Minotaur heads were also improved to properly lip sync although this was not as successful as hoped and had to be revamped digitally br In the climactic battle extras stood in for the Narnians while extras were used for the Telmarines These were digitally duplicated until there were Narnians and Telmarines onscreen The animators found it easier to create entirely digital centaurs and fauns rather than mix digital legs with real actors The dryads were entirely computer generated whereas in the first film digital petals had been composited over actors However Adamson had chosen to make the centaurs not wear armour meaning the animators had to make the human horse joint behave more cohesively Combining digital characters with actors such as when Lucy hugs Aslan had become easier since the first film as lighting had improved To achieve Lucy hugging Aslan Framestore even replaced Georgie Henley s arm with a digital version For the gryphons a motion control rig was created for the actors to ride on The rig could simulate subtle movements such as wing beats for realism Adamson cited the river god as the character he was most proud of It was a really masterful effect to control water like that is incredibly difficult he said The visual effects company told us they d been waiting to do a shot like that for ten years br The film features catapults resembling windmills that can fire rapidly and a ballista that can fire three projectiles at a time The practical versions of these were metal with fibreglass painted and aged to resemble wood on top Weta created props of the missiles thrown by the Telmarine equipment The practical version of the catapult had its upper half painted blue to composite a digital version programmed for rapid firing movement br br br Music br br The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe composer Harry Gregson Williams began composing the sequel in December Recording began at Abbey Road Studios the following month and finished by April The Crouch End Festival Chorus Regina Spektor s song The Call Oren Lavie s song Dance Round The Memory Tree and Switchfoot s song This Is Home are featured on the soundtrack Imogen Heap who sang Can t Take It In for the first film wrote a new song which Gregson Williams considered too dark br Gregson Williams score is darker to follow suit with the film Gregson Williams wanted Caspian s theme to convey a vulnerability which would sound more vibrant as he became more heroic It originally used a time signature but the opening scene required a and thus it was changed To represent Miraz s cunning the heroic theme from the first film was inverted For Reepicheep a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character Gregson Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle but found that it sounded too cute and broke the tension of the night raid br br br Release br br During pre production Disney announced a December release date but pushed it back to May because Disney opted to not release it in competition with The Water Horse another Walden Media production Disney also felt the Harry Potter films comfortably changed their release dates from Northern Hemisphere winters to summers and Narnia could likewise do the same because the film was darker and more like an action film The world premiere was held at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on May The British premiere was held at the O Arena on June the first time the dome has hosted a film screening Around people attended the event the proceeds of which went to Great Ormond Street Hospital br The film opened in theaters in the United States and Canada on May The Motion Picture Association of America gave the film a PG To earn this rating which the filmmakers were contractually bound by Disney to do Adamson altered a shot of a fallen helmet to make clear that it did not contain a severed head Adamson made numerous edits to the film beforehand after showing the film to a young audience explaining When you sit down and you re watching it and you see the kids faces while making the film you re just making an attempt you re making it exciting you re doing all of these things because you re essentially making the film for yourself When you start showing it to an audience that then influences how you feel about the film br br br Marketing br Adding to the film s million budget almost million of which were spent on the effects Disney also spent million on promoting the film Play Along Toys created a playset of Miraz s castle a series of inch and inch action figures and roleplaying costumes Weta Workshop s Collectibles unit also created statues busts and helmets based on their props for the film and there was also a Monopoly edition based on the film In the UK Damaris Trust was commissioned to produce resources relating to the film for churches and schools which are available from the official UK Narnia website In June the Journey into Narnia Prince Caspian Attraction opened at Disney s Hollywood Studios featuring a recreation of the Stone Table behind the scenes footage concept art storyboards props and costumes from the film The tone of the film s marketing focused on the film s action and unlike The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Disney and Walden did not screen the film for pastors or give Bible based study guides in North America br br br Home media br Prince Caspian was released on DVD and Blu ray Disc in the UK on November and on December in North America It was the top selling DVD of its release week in the U S taking in million The film was released in Australia on November There were one disc and three disc DVD editions two disc only in the UK and two disc and three disc Blu ray Disc editions two disc only in the UK The first two discs contain an audio commentary by Adamson blooper reel deleted

additional disc of special features was only made available in Japan and Zavvi stores in the UK while a separate version containing a disc of electronic press kit material was exclusive to Sanity stores in Australia By the end of the film earned almost million in DVD sales br br br Reception br br br Critical response br The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that of critics gave the film positive reviews based on reviews The site s critical consensus reads The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian is an entertaining family adventure worthy of the standard set by its predecessor Metacritic reported the film had an average score of out of based on critics indicating generally favorable reviews Audience members polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A on an A to F scale br Film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film out of stars as he did with The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe calling the performances strong the storytelling solid and the scenery breathtaking though he also said it s a dark tale and the climactic battle scenes go on at length br Two film industry trade journals gave the film positive reviews Todd McCarthy of Variety felt Adamson s direction had a surer sense of cinematic values and praised the improved special effects the timeless locations and production design On the performances he felt the four kids overall have more character and are therefore more interesting to watch than they were before and Italian actor Castellitto registers strongly with evil that s implacable but not overplayed Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter noted the film was darker than its predecessor with the loss of innocence theme significantly deepened He highlighted Peter Dinklage s performance which outmaneuver ed the title character as Narnia s most colorful new inhabitant br A number of critics took issue with what they interpreted as the film s underlying messages San Francisco Chronicle critic Mick Lasalle wrote in his parental advisory that basically this is a movie about kids who go into another world and dimension and spend the whole time killing people MSNBC reviewer Alonso Duralde noted that all the heroes have British accents while the Telmarines are all decidedly Mediterranean in appearance and inflection An Anglican Journal review described the movie as reasonably faithful to the adventure elements of the book much lighter on the religious faith aspects which they found integral to the novel and deficient on character and emotion br The Visual Effects Society nominated it for Best Visual Effects and Best Compositing It was nominated for Best Fantasy Film Best Costumes Best Make up and Best Special Effects at the Saturn Awards Keynes and Henley received nominations at the Young Artist Awards br In Mark Johnson a producer from all of the Narnia movies admitted that We made some mistakes with Prince Caspian and I don t want to make them again He also said Prince Caspian lacked some of the wonder and magic of Narnia was a little bit too rough for families and was too much of a boys action movie br br br Box office br When released on May in the United States and Canada the film grossed million from screens at theaters in its opening weekend ranking at the box office taking that spot from Marvel s Iron Man which premiered on May Disney said it was happy with the film s performance although the opening fell short of industry expectations of million and was also behind The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe s opening gross of million By June it grossed million while the first film
