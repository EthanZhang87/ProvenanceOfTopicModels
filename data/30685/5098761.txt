interplanetary trilogy Kathryn Lindskoog the American author of a study of Lewis wrote a book alleging that the novel was either partly or entirely forged by Hooper and also questioning the authenticity of other Lewis works that Hooper had edited Hooper rejected Lindskoog s accusations and her assault on his integrity is now generally acknowledged to be baseless In particular Professor Alastair Fowler of the University of Edinburgh whose doctoral research Lewis supervised in recalled The Dark Tower as a story that Lewis had discussed with him Lewis s stepson Douglas Gresham has also rejected Lindskoog s claims The whole controversy thing was engineered for very personal reasons Her fanciful theories have been pretty thoroughly discredited br br br Related works br Diana Pavlac
