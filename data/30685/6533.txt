Charles Walter Stansby Williams September May was an English poet novelist playwright theologian and literary critic Most of his life was spent in London where he was born but in he moved to Oxford with the university press for which he worked and was buried there following his early death br br br Early life and education br Charles Williams was born in London in the only son of Richard Walter Stansby Williams and Mary n e Wall His father Walter was a journalist and foreign business correspondent for an importing firm writing in French and German who was a regular and valued contributor of verse stories and articles to many popular magazines His mother Mary the sister of the ecclesiologist and historian J Charles Wall was a former milliner hatmaker of Islington He had one sister Edith born in The Williams family lived in shabby genteel circumstances owing to Walter s increasing blindness and the decline of the firm by which he was employed in Holloway In the family moved to St Albans in Hertfordshire where Williams lived until his marriage in br Educated at St Albans School Williams was awarded a scholarship to University College London but he left in without attempting to gain a degree due to an inability to pay tuition fees br Williams began work in in a Methodist bookroom He was employed by the Oxford University Press OUP as a proofreading assistant in and quickly climbed to the position of editor He continued to work at the OUP in various positions of increasing responsibility until his death in One of his greatest editorial achievements was the publication of the first major English language edition of the works of S ren Kierkegaard His work was part of the literature event in the art competition at the Summer Olympics br Although chiefly remembered as a novelist Williams also published poetry works of literary criticism theology drama history biography and a voluminous number of book reviews Some of his best known novels are War in Heaven Descent into Hell and All Hallows Eve T S Eliot who wrote an introduction for the last of these described Williams s novels as supernatural thrillers because they explore the sacramental intersection of the physical with the spiritual while also examining the ways in which power even spiritual power can corrupt as well as sanctify br All of Williams s fantasies unlike those of J R R Tolkien and most of those of C S Lewis are set in the contemporary world Williams has been described by Colin Manlove as one of the three main writers of Christian fantasy in the twentieth century the other two being C S Lewis and T F Powys More recent writers of fantasy novels with contemporary settings notably Tim Powers cite Williams as a model and inspiration br W H Auden one of Williams s greatest admirers reportedly re read Williams s extraordinary and highly unconventional history of the church The Descent of the Dove every year Williams s study of Dante entitled The Figure of Beatrice was very highly regarded at its time of publication and continues to be consulted by Dante scholars today His work inspired Dorothy L Sayers to undertake her translation of The Divine Comedy Williams however regarded his most important work to be his extremely dense and complex Arthurian poetry of which two books were published Taliessin through Logres and The Region of the Summer Stars and more remained unfinished at his death Some of Williams s essays were collected and published posthumously in Image of the City and Other Essays edited by Anne Ridler br Williams gathered many followers and disciples during his lifetime He was for a period a member of the Salvator Mundi Temple of the Fellowship of the Rosy Cross He met fellow Anglican Evelyn Underhill in and would later write the introduction to her published Letters in br When World War II broke out in Oxford University Press moved its offices from London to Oxford Williams was reluctant to leave his beloved city and his wife Florence refused to go From the nearly letters he wrote to his wife during the war years a generous selection has been published primarily love letters the editor calls them br But the move to Oxford did allow him to participate regularly in Lewis s literary society known as the Inklings In this setting Williams was able to read and improve his final published novel All Hallows Eve as well as to hear J R R Tolkien read aloud to the group some of his early drafts of The Lord of the Rings In addition to meeting in Lewis s rooms at Oxford they also regularly met at The Eagle and Child pub in Oxford better known by its nickname The Bird and Baby During this time Williams also gave lectures at Oxford on John Milton William Wordsworth and other authors and received an honorary M A degree br Williams is buried in Holywell Cemetery in Oxford His headstone bears the word poet followed by the words Under the Mercy a phrase often used by Williams himself br br br Personal life br br In Williams married his first sweetheart Florence Conway following a long courtship during which he presented her with a sonnet sequence that would later become his first published book of poetry The Silver Stair Their son Michael was born in br Williams was an unswerving and devoted member of the Church of England reputedly with a tolerance of the scepticism of others and a firm belief in the necessity of a doubting Thomas in any apostolic body br Although Williams attracted the attention and admiration of some of the most notable writers of his day including T S Eliot and W H Auden his greatest admirer was probably C S Lewis whose novel That Hideous Strength has been regarded as partially inspired by his acquaintance with both the man and his novels and poems Williams came to know Lewis after reading Lewis s then recently published study The Allegory of Love he was so impressed he jotted down a letter of congratulation and dropped it in the mail Coincidentally Lewis had just finished reading Williams s novel The Place of the Lion and had written a similar note of congratulation The letters crossed in the mail and led to an enduring and fruitful friendship br br br Theology br Williams developed the concept of co inherence and gave rare consideration to the theology of romantic love Falling in love for Williams was a form of mystical envisioning in which one saw the beloved as he or she was seen through the eyes of God Co inherence was a term used in Patristic theology to describe the relationship between the human and divine natures of Jesus Christ and the relationship between the persons of the blessed Trinity Williams extended the term to include the ideal relationship between the individual parts of God s creation including human beings It is our mutual indwelling Christ in us and we in Christ interdependent It is also the web of interrelationships social and economic and ecological by which the social fabric and the natural world function But especially for Williams co inherence is a way of talking about the Body of Christ and the communion of saints For Williams salvation was not a solitary affair The thread of the love of God was strong enough to save you and all the others but not strong enough to save you alone He proposed an order the Companions of the Co inherence who would practice substitution and exchange living in love in God truly bearing one another s burdens being willing to sacrifice and to forgive living from and for one another in Christ According to Gunnar Urang co inherence is the focus of all Williams s novels br br br Works br br br Fiction br He is writing that sort of book in which we begin by saying let us suppose that this everyday world were at some one point invaded by the marvellous br War in Heaven London Victor Gollancz The Holy Grail surfaces in an obscure country parish and becomes variously a sacramental object to protect or a vessel of power to exploit br Many Dimensions London Victor Gollancz An evil antiquarian illegally purchases the fabled Stone of Suleiman Williams uses this Muslim form rather than the more familiar King Solomon from its Islamic guardian and returns to England to discover not only that the Stone can multiply itself infinitely without diminishing the original but that it also allows its possessor to transcend the barriers of space and time br Et in Sempiternum Pereant a short story first published in The London Mercury December in which Lord Arglay protagonist in Many Dimensions has his life put at risk encountering a ghost on the path to damnation Later included in The Oxford Book of English Ghost Stories London Oxford University Press br The Place of the Lion London Mundanus Platonic archetypes begin to appear around an English country town wreaking havoc and drawing to the surface the spiritual strengths and flaws of individual characters br The Greater Trumps London Victor Gollancz The original Tarot deck is used to unlock enormous metaphysical powers by allowing the possessors to see across space and time create matter and raise powerful natural storms br Shadows of Ecstasy London Victor Gollancz A humanistic adept has discovered that by focusing his energies inward he can extend his life almost indefinitely He undertakes an experiment using African lore to die and resurrect his own body thereby assuring his immortality His followers begin a revolutionary movement to supplant European civilisation The first of Williams s novels to be written though not the first published br Descent into Hell London Faber Faber Generally thought to be Williams s best novel Descent deals with various forms of selfishness and how the cycle of sin brings about the necessity for redemptive acts In it an academic becomes so far removed from the world that he fetishises a woman to the extent that his perversion takes the form of a succubus Other characters include a doppelg nger the ghost of a suicidal Victorian labourer and a playwright modelled in some ways on the author Illustrates Williams s belief in the replacement of sin and substitutional love br All Hallows Eve London Faber Faber Follows the fortunes of two women after death and their interactions with those they knew before contrasting the results of action based either on selfishness or an accepting love br The Noises That Weren t There Unfinished
