id: 13482953
Superhero fiction is a subgenre of speculative fiction examining the adventures personalities and ethics of costumed crime fighters known as superheroes who often possess superhuman powers and battle similarly powered criminals known as supervillains The genre primarily falls between hard fantasy and soft science fiction in the spectrum of scientific realism It is most commonly associated with American comic books though it has expanded into other media through adaptations and original works br br br Common plot elements br br br Superheroes br br A superhero is most often the protagonist of superhero fiction However some titles such as Marvels by Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross use superheroes as secondary characters A superhero sometimes rendered super hero or super hero is a type of stock character possessing extraordinary or superhuman powers and dedicated to protecting the public Since the debut of the prototypical superhero Superman in stories of superheroes ranging from brief episodic adventures to continuing years long sagas have dominated American comic books and crossed over into other media The word itself dates to at least A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine also rendered super heroine or super heroine In the United States the term SUPER HEROES is a registered trademark co owned by DC Comics and Marvel Comics br By most definitions characters do not strictly require actual superhuman powers to be deemed superheroes although terms such as costumed crime fighters or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to those such as Batman and Green Arrow without such powers who share other common superhero traits Such characters were generally referred to as mystery men in the so called Golden Age of Comic Books to distinguish them from characters with super powers Normally superheroes use their powers to counter day to day crime while also combating threats against humanity by their criminal counterparts supervillains br Long running superheroes such as DC s Batman Superman and Wonder Woman and Marvel s Spider Man Captain America and Iron Man have a rogues gallery of such enemies One of these supervillains might be the superhero s archenemy Superheroes will sometimes combat other threats such as aliens magical fantasy entities natural disasters political ideologies such as Nazism or communism and their proponents and godlike or demonic creatures br br br Supervillains br br A supervillain or supervillainess is a variant of the villain character type commonly found in comic books action movies and science fiction in various media They are sometimes used as foils to superheroes and other heroes Whereas superheroes often wield fantastic powers the supervillain possesses commensurate powers and abilities so that he can present a daunting challenge to the hero Even without actual physical mystical superhuman or superalien powers the supervillain often possesses a genius intellect that allows him to draft complex schemes or create fantastic devices br Another common trait is possession of considerable resources to help further his aims Many supervillains share some typical characteristics of real world dictators mobsters and terrorists and often have aspirations of world domination or universal leadership Superheroes and supervillains often mirror each other in their powers abilities or origins In some cases the only difference between the two is that the hero uses his extraordinary powers to help others while the villain uses his powers for selfish destructive or ruthless purposes br br br Secret identities br br Both superheroes and supervillains often use alter egos while in action While sometimes the character s real name is publicly known alter egos are most often used to hide the character s secret identity from their enemies and the public br With superheroes the duality of their identities is kept a secret and closely guarded to protect those close to them from being harmed and to prevent them from being called upon constantly even for problems not serious enough to require their attention This can be a source of drama with the superhero being forced to devise means of getting out of sight to change without revealing their identity or bearing the price of keeping such a secret In addition this narrative trope can allow fantasy characters to be in occasional realistic stories without the fantasy element of the sub genre appearing br With supervillains by contrast the duality of their identities is kept a secret and closely guarded to conceal their crimes from the general public so that they may inflict greater harm on the general public and to enable them to act freely and hence illegally without risk of arrest by law enforcement authorities br br br Death br br Death in superhero fiction is rarely permanent as characters who die are often brought back to life through supernatural means or via retcons retroactive changes to the continuity the alteration of previously established facts in the continuity of a fictional work Fans have termed the practice of bringing back dead characters comic book death br Another common trait of superhero fiction is the killing off of a superhero s significant other by a supervillain to advance the plot Comic book writer Gail Simone has coined the term Women in Refrigerators named after an incident in Green Lantern where Kyle Rayner s girlfriend Alex DeWitt is murdered by the supervillain Major Force and stuffed into Rayner s refrigerator to refer to this practice br br br Continuity br br Many works of superhero fiction occur in a shared fictional universe sometimes as in the cases of the DC and Marvel Universes establishing a fictional continuity of thousands of works spread over many decades br Changes to continuity are also common ranging from small changes to established continuity commonly called retcons to full reboots erasing all previous continuity br It is also common for works of superhero fiction to contain established characters and setting while occurring outside of the main canon for those characters br br br Crossovers br br Crossovers often occur between characters of different works of superhero fiction In comic books highly publicized events are published featuring crossovers between many characters In previous eras especially in the Bronze Age of Comic Books Marvel and DC had dedicated series in which their marquee characters such as Spider Man and Superman would meet various characters in single stories such as Marvel Team Up and DC Comics Presents However that publishing fashion has fallen away in favor of occasional limited series and guest appearances in regular series when the writers felt the character s presence was justified br Intercompany crossovers between characters of different continuity are also common br br br Genre flexibility br br Over the history of the comic book genre writers for major characters series were required to produce material to strict regular publishing schedules that often ran for years As such to fulfill this strenuous creative requirement superhero stories have used a wide variety of story genres such as Fantasy Science fiction Mystery Horror Crime fiction etc that put superhero characters in a vast variety and combinations of story settings and fiction tropes with their presence the major common element As such it has become an expected element to superhero fiction for the heroic characters to be placed in nearly any story situation including relatively down to Earth drama with their personal lives out of costume br For instance The New Teen Titans was a mainstream superhero series which had characters that were a mix of fantasy Raven Wonder Girl science fiction Cyborg Starfire Changeling Kid Flash and crime fiction Robin Furthermore their series had such a variety of stories such as in a year long period of where in rapid succession the team would face Brother Blood a costumed supervillain cult leader then promptly have a space opera story where the team goes to another planet to oppose the imperial forces of Blackfire and then return to Earth only to get involved in a relatively realistic urban crime story about runaways br br br History br br br Prototypes br br The mythologies of many ancient civilizations feature pantheons of gods and goddesses with superhuman powers as well as heroes such as Hanuman Gilgamesh Perseus Odysseus and David and demigods like Heracles Real life inspirations behind costumed superheroes can be traced back to the masked vigilantes of the American Old West such as the San Diego Vigilantes and the Bald Knobbers who fought and killed outlaws while wearing masks The character of Spring Heeled Jack who first emerged as an urban legend of the early th century was re conceived as a masked and costumed adventurer during the s br The hero s journey is a well known archetypal story type in which the protagonist undertakes a quest to achieve both material advantage and psychological and ethical maturity and is generally considered to function as a metaphor and guide for children transitioning to adulthood or from egoism to altruism as the core concept of the self Antecedents of the superhero archetype include such folkloric heroes as Robin Hood who adventured in distinctive clothing and King Arthur who possessed a supernatural weapon Penny dreadfuls shilling shockers dime novels radio programs and other popular fiction of the late th and early th centuries featured mysterious swashbuckling heroes with distinct costumes unusual abilities and altruistic missions The play The Scarlet Pimpernel and its spinoffs further popularized the idea of a masked avenger and the superhero trope of a secret identity such characters as the Green Hornet and the Scarecrow of Romney Marsh would follow Likewise the science fiction heroes John Carter of Mars Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon with their futuristic weapons and gadgets Tarzan with his high degree of athleticism and strength and his ability to communicate with animals Robert E Howard s Conan the Barbarian and the biologically modified Hugo Danner of the novel Gladiator were heroes with unusual abilities who fought sometimes larger than life foes The word superhero itself dates to at least br The most direct antecedents are pulp magazine crime fighters such as the masked and caped Zorro introduced by Johnston M McCulley in with The Curse of Capistrano with his trademark Z the technologically advanced Black Sapper the preternaturally mesmeric The Shadow the peak human Doc Savage and The Spider and comic strip characters such as Hugo Hercules Popeye the Phantom and Olga Mesmer The first masked crime fighter created for comic books was writer artist George Brenner s non superpowered detective the Clock who debuted in Centaur Publications Funny Pages Nov In August in a letter column of the pulp magazine Thrilling Wonder Stories the word superhero was used to define the title character of the comic strip Zarnak by Max Plaisted Historians point to the first appearance of Superman created by Jerome Jerry Siegel and designed by Joseph Joe Shuster in Action Comics June as the debut of the comic book archetype of the superhero br Outside the American comics industry superpowered costumed superheroes such as gon Bat and the Prince of Gamma early s were visualized in painted panels used by kamishibai oral storytellers in Japan They both anticipated elements of Superman and Batman Prince of Gamma for example had an extraterrestrial origin story and a secret identity his alter ego was a street urchin much like Superman An earlier example from Japan is Sarutobi Sasuke a superhero ninja from children s novels in the s By his abilities included superhuman strength chanting incantations appearing and disappearing jumping to the top of the highest trees riding on clouds conjuring the elements water fire and wind and transforming into other people or animals br br br Golden Age br br In writer Jerry Siegel and artist Joe Shuster who had previously worked in pulp science fiction magazines introduced Superman Siegel as the writer actually created the central and supporting characters Shuster as the artist designed these characters and gave Superman the first version of his now iconic uniform The character possessed many of the traits that have come to define the superhero a secret identity superhuman powers and a colorful costume including a symbol and cape His name is also the source of the term superhero although early comic book heroes were sometimes also called mystery men or masked heroes br DC Comics which published under the names National and All American at the time received an overwhelming response to Superman and in the years that followed introduced Batman Wonder Woman The Green Lantern The Flash The Hawkman Aquaman and The Green Arrow The first team of superheroes was DC s Justice Society of America featuring most of the aforementioned characters br Although DC dominated the superhero market at this time companies large and small created hundreds of superheroes The Human Torch of the Golden Age and the Sub Mariner from Marvel Comics then called Timely Comics and later re branded Atlas Comics and Plastic Man and Phantom Lady from Quality Comics were also hits Will Eisner s The Spirit featured in a comic strip would become a considerable artistic inspiration to later comic book creators The era s most popular superhero however was Fawcett Comics s Captain Marvel whose exploits regularly outsold those of Superman during the s When Fawcett Comics went out of business as such DC Comics which had been embroiled in a bitter copyright dispute with Fawcett Comics over Captain Marvel bought out the copyright to not only the character but also his ancillary Marvel Family of heroes and villains br During World War II superheroes grew in popularity surviving paper rationing and the loss of many writers and illustrators to service in the armed forces The need for simple tales of good triumphing over evil may explain the wartime popularity of superheroes Publishers responded with stories in which superheroes battled the Axis Powers and the patriotically themed superheroes most notably Marvel s Captain America as well as DC s Wonder Woman br Like other pop culture figures of the time Superheroes were used to promote domestic propaganda during wartime ranging from the purchasing of war bonds br Following superheroes s popularity during this time those characters appeal began to dwindle in the post war era Comic book publishers casting about for new subjects and genres found success in particularly crime fiction the most prominent comic of which was Lev Gleason Publications s Crime Does Not Pay and horror The lurid nature of these genres sparked a moral crusade in which comics were blamed for juvenile delinquency and the United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency began The movement was spearheaded by psychiatrist Fredric Wertham who argued in Seduction of the Innocent that deviant sexual undertones ran rampant in superhero comics In his methodology was reviewed and his results were found to be misleading if not falsified br In response the comic book industry adopted the stringent Comics Code By the mid s only Superman Batman and Wonder Woman retained a sliver of their prior popularity although effort towards complete inoffensiveness led to stories that many consider silly especially by modern standards This ended what historians have called the Golden Age of comic books br br br Silver Age br br In the s DC Comics under the editorship of Julius Schwartz recreated many popular s heroes launching an era later deemed the Silver Age of comic books The Flash Green Lantern Hawkman and several others were recreated with new origin stories While past superheroes resembled mythological heroes in their origins and abilities these heroes were inspired by contemporary science fiction In DC banded its most popular heroes together in the Justice League of America which became a sales phenomenon br Empowered by the return of the superhero at DC Marvel Comics editor writer Stan Lee and the artists co writers Jack Kirby Steve Ditko and Bill Everett launched a new line of superhero comic books beginning with the Fantastic Four in and continuing with the Incredible Hulk Spider Man Iron Man Thor the X Men and Daredevil These comics continued DC s use of science fiction concepts radiation was a common source of superpowers but placed greater emphasis on personal conflict and character development This led to many superheroes that differed from predecessors with more dramatic potential For example the Fantastic Four were a superhero family of sorts who squabbled and even held some unresolved acrimony towards one another and Spider Man was a teenager who struggled to earn money and maintain his social life in addition to his costumed exploits br br br In non comics media br br br Film br br Superhero films began as Saturday movie serials aimed at children during the s with the first film adaptation of a comic book superhero being The Adventures of Captain Marvel in The decline of these serials meant the death of superhero films until the release of s Superman a critical and commercial success Several sequels followed in the s s Batman was also highly successful and followed by several sequels in the s Yet while both franchises were initially successful later sequels in both series fared poorly both artistically and financially stunting the growth of superhero films for a time br Hit films such as s Blade s X Men and Unbreakable and s Spider Man have led to sequel installments as well as encouraging the development of numerous superhero film franchises in the st century both successful such as s Batman Begins a reboot of the Batman film series and unsuccessful such as s Catwoman With that resurgence the subgenre has become a major element of mainstream film production with outstanding successes like s The Dark Knight s The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises s Iron Man and s Avengers Age of Ultron attracting major revenue and critical plaudits This trend was reinforced in with the outstanding success of the critically lauded Deadpool a film adaptation of a relatively minor Marvel Comics character that premiered at over million in February a time of year generally considered poor for movie audience interest It was an observation further confirmed in when Black Panther was an even grander success with a million debut in the same time of year and later became the first superhero film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture Avengers Endgame became the highest grossing film of all time In the film Sign Gene featured about deaf superheroes who use sign language br br br Live action television series br br Several live action superhero programs aired from the early s until the late s These included Adventures of Superman starring George Reeves the action comedy Batman series of the s often interpreted as being campy starring Adam West and Burt Ward In the s however the genre would find a newfound credibility in the medium with the original series The Six Million Dollar Man and its spinoff The Bionic Woman being sustained successes This led to direct adaptations of comic book superheroes such as ABC CBS drama series Wonder Woman of the s starring Lynda Carter The Incredible Hulk of the late s and early s however had a more somber tone Superboy ran from to in syndication In the s the Power Rangers adapted from the Japanese Super Sentai became popular Other shows targeting teenage and young adult audiences that decade included Lois and Clark The New Adventures of Superman In Smallville retooled Superman s origin as a teen drama The NBC series Heroes

groundbreaking Superman cartoons which became the first examples of superheroes in animation Since the s superhero cartoons have been a staple of children s television particularly in the U S However by the early s US broadcasting restrictions on violence in children s entertainment led to series that were extremely tame a trend exemplified by the series Super Friends Meanwhile Japan s anime industry successfully contributed its own style of superhero series such as Science Ninja Team Gatchaman br In the s the Saturday morning cartoon Spider Man and His Amazing Friends brought together Spider Man Iceman and Firestar The following decade Batman The Animated Series which was aimed at somewhat older audiences found critical success in mainstream publications This series led to the successful DC Animated Universe franchise and other adaptations such as Teen Titans which Marvel emulated with X Men and Spider Man The Animated Series br Comics superhero mythos itself received a nostalgic treatment in the Disney Pixar release The Incredibles which utilized computer animation Original superheroes with basis in older trends have also been made for television such as Disney s
