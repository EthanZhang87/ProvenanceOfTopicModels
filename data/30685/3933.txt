Braille BRAYL French b j is a tactile writing system used by people who are visually impaired It can be read either on embossed paper or by using refreshable braille displays that connect to computers and smartphone devices Braille can be written using a slate and stylus a braille writer an electronic braille notetaker or with the use of a computer connected to a braille embosser br br Braille is named after its creator Louis Braille a Frenchman who lost his sight as a result of a childhood accident In at the age of fifteen he developed the braille code based on the French alphabet as an improvement on night writing He published his system which subsequently included musical notation in The second revision published in was the first binary form of writing developed in the modern era br Braille characters are formed using a combination of six raised dots arranged in a matrix called the braille cell The number and arrangement of these dots distinguishes one character from another Since the various braille alphabets originated as transcription codes for printed writing the mappings sets of character designations vary from language to language and even within one in English braille there are three levels uncontracted a letter by letter transcription used for basic literacy contracted an addition of abbreviations and contractions used as a space saving mechanism and grade various non standardized personal stenographies that are less commonly used br In addition to braille text letters punctuation contractions it is also possible to create embossed illustrations and graphs with the lines either solid or made of series of dots arrows and bullets that are larger than braille dots A full braille cell includes six raised dots arranged in two columns each column having three dots The dot positions are identified by numbers from one to six There are possible combinations including no dots at all for a word space Dot configurations can be used to represent a letter digit punctuation mark or even a word br Early braille education is crucial to literacy education and employment among the blind Despite the evolution of new technologies including screen reader software that reads information aloud braille provides blind people with access to spelling punctuation and other aspects of written language less accessible through audio alone br While some have suggested that audio based technologies will decrease the need for braille technological advancements such as braille displays have continued to make braille more accessible and available Braille users highlight that braille remains as essential as print is to the sighted br br Braille was based on a tactile code now known as night writing developed by Charles Barbier The name night writing was later given to it when it was considered as a means for soldiers to communicate silently at night and without a light source but Barbier s writings do not use this term and suggest that it was originally designed as a simpler form of writing and for the visually impaired In Barbier s system sets of embossed dots were used to encode different sounds Braille identified three major defects of the code first the symbols represented phonetic sounds and not letters of the alphabet thus the code was unable to render the orthography of the words Second the dot symbols could not easily fit beneath the pad of the reading finger This required the reading finger to move in order to perceive the whole symbol which slowed the reading process This was because Barbier s system was based only on the number of dots in each of two dot columns not the pattern of the dots Third the code did not include symbols for numerals or punctuation Braille s solution was to use dot cells and to assign a specific pattern to each letter of the alphabet Braille also developed symbols for representing numerals and punctuation br At first braille was a one to one transliteration of the French alphabet but soon various abbreviations contractions and even logograms were developed creating a system much more like shorthand br Today there are braille codes for over languages br In English some variations in the braille codes have traditionally existed among English speaking countries In work to standardize the braille codes used in the English speaking world began Unified English Braille UEB has been adopted in all seven member countries of the International Council on English Braille ICEB as well as Nigeria br For blind readers braille is an independent writing system rather than a code of printed orthography br br Braille is derived from the Latin alphabet albeit indirectly In Braille s original system the dot patterns were assigned to letters according to their position within the alphabetic order of the French alphabet of the time with accented letters and w sorted at the end br Unlike print which consists of mostly arbitrary symbols the braille alphabet follows a logical sequence The first ten letters of the alphabet a j use the upper four dot positions black dots in the table below These stand for the ten digits and in an alphabetic numeral system similar to Greek numerals as well as derivations of it including Hebrew numerals Cyrillic numerals Abjad numerals also Hebrew gematria and Greek isopsephy br Though the dots are assigned in no obvious order the cells with the fewest dots are assigned to the first three letters and lowest digits abc and to the three vowels in this part of the alphabet aei whereas the even digits are right angles br The next ten letters k t are identical to a j respectively apart from the addition of a dot at position red dots in the bottom left corners of the cells in the table below br br The next ten letters the next decade are the same again but with dots also at both position and position green dots in the bottom rows of the cells in the table above Here w was initially left out as not being a part of the official French alphabet at the time of Braille s life the French braille order is u v x y z br The next ten letters ending in w are the same again except that for this series position purple dot in the bottom right corner of the cell in the table above is used without a dot at position In French braille these are the letters w W had been tacked onto the end of letters of the French alphabet to accommodate English br The a j series shifted down by one dot space is used for punctuation Letters a and c which only use dots in the top row were shifted two places for the apostrophe and hyphen These are also the decade diacritics at left in the table below of the second and third decade br In addition there are ten patterns that are based on the first two letters with their dots shifted to the right these were assigned to non French letters or serve non letter functions superscript in English the accent mark currency prefix capital in English the decimal point number sign emphasis mark symbol prefix br br The first four decades are similar in respect that in those decades the decade dots are applied to the numeric sequence as a logical inclusive OR operation whereas the fifth decade applies a shift down operation to the numeric sequence br Originally there had been nine decades The fifth through ninth used dashes as well as dots but proved to be impractical and were soon abandoned These could be replaced with what we now know as the number sign though that only caught on for the digits old th decade modern st decade The dash occupying the top row of the original sixth decade was simply dropped producing the modern fifth decade See braille br br Historically there have been three principles in assigning the values of a linear script print to Braille Using Louis Braille s original French letter values reassigning the braille letters according to the sort order of the print alphabet being transcribed and reassigning the letters to improve the efficiency of writing in braille br Under international consensus most braille alphabets follow the French sorting order for the letters of the basic Latin alphabet and there have been attempts at unifying the letters beyond these see international braille though differences remain for example in German Braille This unification avoids the chaos of each nation reordering the braille code to match the sorting order of its print alphabet as happened in Algerian Braille where braille codes were numerically reassigned to match the order of the Arabic alphabet and bear little relation to the values used in other countries compare modern Arabic Braille which uses the French sorting order and as happened in an early American version of English Braille where the letters w x y z were reassigned to match English alphabetical order A convention sometimes seen for letters beyond the basic is to exploit the physical symmetry of braille patterns iconically for example by assigning a reversed n to or an inverted s to sh See Hungarian Braille and Bharati Braille which do this to some extent br A third principle was to assign braille codes according to frequency with the simplest patterns quickest ones to write with a stylus assigned to the most frequent letters of the alphabet Such frequency based alphabets were used in Germany and the United States in the th century see American Braille but with the invention of the braille typewriter their advantage disappeared and none are attested in modern use they had the disadvantage that the resulting small number of dots in a text interfered with following the alignment of the letters and consequently made texts more difficult to read than Braille s more arbitrary letter assignment Finally there are braille scripts that do not order the codes numerically at all such as Japanese Braille and Korean Braille which are based on more abstract principles of syllable composition br Texts are sometimes written in a script of eight dots per cell rather than six enabling them to encode a greater number of symbols See Gardner Salinas braille codes Luxembourgish Braille has adopted eight dot cells for general use for example it adds a dot below each letter to derive its capital variant br br Braille was the first writing system with binary encoding The system as devised by Braille consists of two parts br br Character encoding that mapped characters of the French alphabet to tuples of six bits the dots br The physical representation of those six bit characters with raised dots in a braille cell br Within an individual cell the dot positions are arranged in two columns of three positions A raised dot can appear in any of the six positions producing possible patterns including one in which there are no raised dots For reference purposes a pattern is commonly described by listing the positions where dots are raised the positions being universally numbered from top to bottom as to on the left and to on the right For example dot pattern describes a cell with three dots raised at the top and bottom in the left column and at the top of the right column that is the letter m The lines of horizontal braille text are separated by a space much like visible printed text so that the dots of one line can be differentiated from the braille text above and below Different assignments of braille codes or code pages are used to map the character sets of different printed scripts to the six bit cells Braille assignments have also been created for mathematical and musical notation However because the six dot braille cell allows only patterns including space the characters of a braille script commonly have multiple values depending on their context That is character mapping between print and braille is not one to one For example the character corresponds in print to both the letter d and the digit br In addition to simple encoding many braille alphabets use contractions to reduce the size of braille texts and to increase reading speed See Contracted braille br br Braille may be produced by hand using a slate and stylus in which each dot is created from the back of the page writing in mirror image or it may be produced on a braille typewriter or Perkins Brailler or an electronic Brailler or braille notetaker Braille users with access to smartphones may also activate the on screen braille input keyboard to type braille symbols on to their device by placing their fingers on to the screen according to the dot configuration of the symbols they wish to form These symbols are automatically translated into print on the screen The different tools that exist for writing braille allow the braille user to select the method that is best for a given task For example the slate and stylus is a portable writing tool much like the pen and paper for the sighted Errors can be erased using a braille eraser or can be overwritten with all six dots Interpoint refers to braille printing that is offset so that the paper can be embossed on both sides with the dots on one side appearing between the divots that form the dots on the other br Using a computer or other electronic device Braille may be produced with a braille embosser printer or a refreshable braille display screen br br Braille has been extended to an dot code particularly for use with braille embossers and refreshable braille displays In dot braille the additional dots are added at the bottom of the cell giving a matrix dots high by dots wide The additional dots are given the numbers for the lower left dot and for the lower right dot Eight dot braille has the advantages that the case of an individual letter is directly coded in the cell containing the letter and that all the printable ASCII characters can be represented in a single cell All possible combinations of dots are encoded by the Unicode standard Braille with six dots is frequently stored as Braille ASCII br br The first braille letters up through the first half of the rd decade transcribe a z skipping w In English Braille the rest of that decade is rounded out with the ligatures and for of the and with Omitting dot from these forms the th decade the ligatures ch gh sh th wh ed er ou ow and the letter w br br See English Braille br br Various formatting marks affect the values of the letters that follow them They have no direct equivalent in print The most important in English Braille are br br That is is read as capital A and as the digit br br Basic punctuation marks in English Braille include br br is both the question mark and the opening quotation mark Its reading depends on whether it occurs before a word or after br is used for both opening and closing parentheses Its placement relative to spaces and other characters determines its interpretation br Punctuation varies from language to language For example French Braille uses for its question mark and swaps the quotation marks and parentheses to and it uses the period for the decimal point as in print and the decimal point to mark capitalization br br Braille contractions are words and affixes that are shortened so that they take up fewer cells In English Braille for example the word afternoon is written with just three letters afn much like stenoscript There are also several abbreviation marks that create what are effectively logograms The most common of these is dot which combines with the first letter of words With the letter m the resulting word is mother There are also ligatures contracted letters which are single letters in braille but correspond to more than one letter in print The letter and for example is used to write words with the sequence a n d in them such as grand br br Most braille embossers support between and cells per line and lines per page br A manually operated Perkins braille typewriter supports a maximum of cells per line its margins are adjustable and typical paper allows lines per page br A large interlining Stainsby has cells per line and lines per page br An A sized Marburg braille frame which allows interpoint braille dots on both sides of the page offset so they do not interfere with each other has cells per line and lines per page br br A Braille writing machine is a typewriter with six keys that allows the user to write braille on a regular hard copy page br The first Braille typewriter to gain general acceptance was invented by Frank Haven Hall Superintendent of the Illinois School for the Blind and was presented to the public in br The Stainsby Brailler developed by Henry Stainsby in is a mechanical writer with a sliding carriage that moves over an aluminium plate as it embosses Braille characters An improved version was introduced around br In David Abraham a woodworking teacher at the Perkins School for the Blind produced a more advanced Braille typewriter the Perkins Brailler br Braille printers or embossers were produced in the s br In Robert Mann a teacher in MIT wrote DOTSYS a software that allowed automatic braille translation and another group created an embossing device called M I T Braillemboss The Mitre Corporation team of Robert Gildea Jonathan Millen Reid Gerhart and Joseph Sullivan now president of Duxbury Systems developed DOTSYS III the first braille translator written in a portable programming language DOTSYS III was developed for the Atlanta Public Schools as a public domain program br In Ernest Bate developed the Mountbatten Brailler an electronic machine used to type braille on braille paper giving it a number of additional features such as word processing audio feedback and embossing This version was improved in with a quiet writer that had an erase key br In David S Morgan produced the first SMART Brailler machine with added text to speech function and allowed digital capture of data entered br br Braille is traditionally read in hardcopy form such as with paper books written in braille documents produced in paper braille such as restaurant menus and braille labels or public signage It can also be read on a refreshable braille display either as a stand alone electronic device or connected to a computer or smartphone Refreshable braille displays convert what is visually shown on a computer or smartphone screen into braille through a series of pins that rise and fall to form braille symbols Currently more than of all printed books have been translated into hardcopy braille br The fastest braille readers apply a light touch and read braille with two hands although reading braille with one hand is also possible Although the finger can read only one braille character at a time the brain chunks braille at a higher level processing words a digraph root or suffix at a time The processing largely takes place in the visual cortex br br Children who are blind miss out on fundamental parts of early and advanced education if not provided with the necessary tools such as access to educational materials in braille Children who are blind or visually impaired can begin learning foundational braille skills from a very young age to become fluent braille readers as they get older Sighted children are naturally exposed to written language on signs on TV and in the books they see Blind children require the same early exposure to literacy through access to braille rich environments and opportunities to explore the world around them Print braille books for example present text in both print and braille and can be read by sighted parents to blind children and vice versa allowing blind children to develop an early love for reading even before formal reading instruction begins br Adults who experience sight loss later in life or who did not have the opportunity to learn it when they were younger can also learn braille In most cases adults who learn braille were already literate in print before vision loss and so instruction focuses more on developing the tactile and motor skills needed to read braille br While different countries publish statistics on how many readers in a given organization request braille these numbers only provide a partial picture of braille literacy statistics For example this data does not survey the entire population of braille readers or always include readers who are no longer in the school system adults or readers who request electronic braille materials Therefore there are currently no reliable statistics on braille literacy rates as described in a publication in the Journal of Visual Impairment and Blindness Regardless of the precise percentage of braille readers there is consensus that braille should be provided to all those who benefit from it br Numerous factors influence access to braille literacy including school budget constraints technology advancements such as screen reader software access to qualified instruction and different philosophical views over how blind children should be educated br In the USA a key turning point for braille literacy was the passage of the Rehabilitation Act of an act of Congress that moved thousands of children from specialized schools for the blind into mainstream public schools Because only a small percentage of public schools could afford to train and hire braille qualified teachers braille literacy has declined since the law took effect Braille literacy rates have improved slightly since the bill was passed in part because of pressure from consumers and advocacy groups that has led states to pass legislation mandating that children who are legally blind be given the opportunity to learn braille br In there were legally blind students registered in the United States but only of them used braille as their primary reading medium br Early Braille education is crucial to literacy for a blind or low vision child A study conducted in the state of Washington found that people who learned braille at an early age did just as well as if not better than their sighted peers in several areas including vocabulary and comprehension In the preliminary adult study while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment it was found that of the participants who had learned to read in braille were unemployed compared to the unemployment rate of those who had learned to read using print Currently among the estimated blind adults in the United States of those who are braille literate are employed Among adults who do not know braille only are employed Statistically history has proven that braille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows blind or low vision children to compete with their sighted peers in a school environment and later in life as they enter the workforce br Regardless of the specific percentage of braille readers proponents point out the importance of increasing access to braille for all those who can benefit from it br br Although it is possible to transcribe print by simply substituting the equivalent braille character for its printed equivalent in English such a character by character transcription known as uncontracted braille is typically used by beginners or those who only engage in short reading tasks such as reading household labels br Braille characters are much larger than their printed equivalents and the standard by in by cm page has room for only lines of characters To reduce space and increase reading speed most braille alphabets and orthographies use ligatures abbreviations and contractions Virtually all English braille books in hardcopy paper format are transcribed in contracted braille The Library of Congress s Instruction Manual for Braille Transcribing runs to over pages and braille transcribers must pass certification tests br Uncontracted braille was previously known as grade braille and contracted braille was previously known as grade braille Uncontracted braille is a direct transliteration of print words one to one correspondence hence the word about would contain all the same letters in uncontracted braille as it does in inkprint Contracted braille includes short forms to save space hence for example the letters ab when standing alone represent the word about in English contracted braille In English some braille users only learn uncontracted braille particularly if braille is being used for shorter reading tasks such as reading household labels However those who plan to use braille for educational and employment purposes and longer reading texts often go on to contracted braille br The system of contractions in English Braille begins with a set of words contracted to single characters Thus the word but is contracted to the single letter b can to c do to d and so on Even this simple rule creates issues requiring special cases for example d is specifically an abbreviation of the verb do the noun do representing the note of the musical scale is a different word and must be spelled out br Portions of words may be contracted and many rules govern this process For example the character with dots the letter f lowered in the Braille cell stands for ff when used in the middle of a word At the beginning of a word this same character stands for the word to the character is written in braille with no space following it This contraction was removed in the Unified English Braille Code At the end of a word the same character represents an exclamation point br Some contractions are more similar than their print equivalents For example the contraction lr meaning letter differs from ll meaning little only by one dot in the second letter little letter This causes greater confusion between the braille spellings of these words and can hinder the learning process of contracted braille br The contraction rules take into account the linguistic structure of the word thus contractions are generally not to be used when their use would alter the usual braille form of a base word to which a prefix or suffix has been added Some portions of the transcription rules are not fully codified and rely on the judgment of the transcriber Thus when the contraction rules permit the same word in more than one way preference is given to the contraction that more nearly approximates correct pronunciation br Grade braille is a variety of non standardized systems that include many additional shorthand like contractions They are not used for publication but by individuals for their personal convenience br br When people produce braille this is called braille transcription When computer software produces braille this is called a braille translator Braille translation software exists to handle almost all of the common languages of the world and many technical areas such as mathematics mathematical notation for example WIMATS music musical notation and tactile graphics br br Since Braille is one of the few writing systems where tactile perception is used as opposed to visual perception a braille reader must develop new skills One skill important for Braille readers is the ability to create smooth and even pressures when running one s fingers along the words There are many different styles and techniques used for the understanding and development of braille even though a study by B F Holland suggests that there is no specific technique that is superior to any other br Another study by Lowenfield Abel shows that braille can be read the fastest and best by students who read using the index fingers of both hands Another important reading skill emphasized in this study is to finish reading the end of a line with the right hand and to find the beginning of the next line with the left hand simultaneously br br When Braille was first adapted to languages other than French many schemes were adopted including mapping the native alphabet to the alphabetical order of French e g in English W which was not in the French alphabet at the time is mapped to braille X X to Y Y to Z and Z to the first French accented letter or completely rearranging the alphabet such that common letters are represented by the simplest braille patterns Consequently mutual intelligibility was greatly hindered by this state of affairs In the International Congress on Work for the Blind held in Paris proposed an international braille standard where braille codes for different languages and scripts would be based not on the order of a particular alphabet but on phonetic correspondence and transliteration to Latin br This unified braille has been applied to the languages of India and Africa Arabic Vietnamese Hebrew Russian and Armenian as well as nearly all Latin script languages In Greek for example g is written as Latin g despite the fact that it has the alphabetic position of c Hebrew b the second letter of the alphabet and cognate with the Latin letter b is sometimes pronounced b and sometimes v and is written b or v accordingly Russian ts is written as c which is the usual letter for ts in those Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet and Arabic f is written as f despite being historically p and occurring in that part of the Arabic alphabet between historic o and q br br Other systems for assigning values to braille patterns are also followed beside the simple mapping of the alphabetical order onto the original French order Some braille alphabets start with unified braille and then diverge significantly based on the phonology of the target languages while others diverge even further br In the various Chinese systems traditional braille values are used for initial consonants and the simple vowels In both Mandarin and Cantonese Braille however characters have different readings depending on whether they are placed in syllable initial onset or syllable final rime position For instance the cell for Latin k represents Cantonese k g in Yale and other modern romanizations when initial but aak when final while Latin j represents Cantonese initial j but final oei br Novel systems of braille mapping include Korean which adopts separate syllable initial and syllable final forms for its consonants explicitly grouping braille cells into syllabic groups in the same way as hangul Japanese meanwhile combines independent vowel dot patterns and modifier consonant dot patterns into a single braille cell an abugida representation of each Japanese mora br br Braille is read by people who are blind deafblind or who have low vision and by both those born with a visual impairment and those who experience sight loss later in life Braille may also be used by print impaired people who although may be fully sighted due to a physical disability are unable to read print Even individuals with low vision will find that they benefit from braille depending on level of vision or context for example when lighting or colour contrast is poor Braille is used for both short and long reading tasks Examples of short reading tasks include braille labels for identifying household items or cards in a wallet reading elevator buttons accessing phone numbers recipes grocery lists and other personal notes Examples of longer reading tasks include using braille to access educational materials novels and magazines People with access to a refreshable braille display can also use braille for reading email and ebooks browsing the internet and accessing other electronic documents It is also possible to adapt or purchase playing cards and board games in braille br In India there are instances where the parliament acts have been published in braille such as The Right to Information Act Sylheti Braille is used in Northeast India br In Canada passenger safety information in braille and tactile seat row markers are required aboard planes trains large ferries and interprovincial busses pursuant to the Canadian Transportation Agency s regulations br In the United States the Americans with Disabilities Act of requires various building signage to be in braille br In the United Kingdom it is required that medicines have the name of the medicine in Braille on the labeling br br The current series of Canadian banknotes has a tactile feature consisting of raised dots that indicate the denomination allowing bills to be easily identified by blind or low vision people It does not use standard braille numbers to identify the value Instead the number of full braille cells which can be simply counted by both braille readers and non braille readers alike is an indicator of the value of the bill br Mexican bank notes Australian bank notes Indian rupee notes Israeli new shekel notes and Russian ruble notes also have special raised symbols to make them identifiable by persons who are blind or have low vision br Euro coins were designed in cooperation with organisations representing blind people and as a result they incorporate many features allowing them to be distinguished by touch alone In addition their visual appearance is designed to make them easy to tell apart for persons who cannot read the inscriptions on the coins A good design for the blind and partially sighted is a good design for everybody was the principle behind the cooperation of the European Central Bank and the European Blind Union during the design phase of the first series Euro banknotes in the s As a result the design of the first euro banknotes included several characteristics which aid both the blind and partially sighted to confidently use the notes br Australia introduced the tactile feature onto their five dollar banknote in br In the United Kingdom the front of the polymer note the side with raised print has two clusters of raised dots in the top left hand corner and the note has three This tactile feature helps blind and partially sighted people identify the value of the note br In the US Mint introduced the commemorative Alabama State Quarter which recognized State Daughter Helen Keller on the Obverse including the name Helen Keller in both English script and Braille inscription This appears to be the first known use of Braille on US Coin Currency though not standard on all coins of this type br br The Braille set was added to the Unicode Standard in version br Most braille embossers and refreshable braille displays do not use the Unicode code points but instead reuse the bit code points that are assigned to standard ASCII for braille ASCII Thus for simple material the same bitstream may be interpreted equally as visual letter forms for sighted readers or their exact semantic equivalent in tactile patterns for blind readers However some codes have quite different tactile versus visual interpretations and most are not even defined in Braille ASCII br Some embossers have proprietary control codes for dot braille or for full graphics mode where dots may be placed anywhere on the page without leaving any space between braille cells so that continuous lines can be drawn in diagrams but these are rarely used and are not standard br The Unicode standard encodes dot and dot braille glyphs according to their binary appearance rather than following their assigned numeric order Dot corresponds to the least significant bit of the low byte of the Unicode scalar value and dot to the high bit of that byte br The Unicode block for braille is U U FF The mapping of patterns to characters etc is language dependent even for English for example see American Braille and English Braille br br Every year on January World Braille Day is observed internationally to commemorate the birth of Louis Braille and to recognize his efforts Although the event is not considered a public holiday it has been recognized by the United Nations as an official day of celebration since br br There is a variety of contemporary electronic devices that serve the needs of blind people that operate in Braille such as refreshable braille displays and Braille e books that use different technologies for
