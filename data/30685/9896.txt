An elf pl elves is a type of humanoid supernatural being in Germanic folklore Elves appear especially in North Germanic mythology being mentioned in the Icelandic Poetic Edda and Snorri Sturluson s Prose Edda br In medieval Germanic speaking cultures elves generally seem to have been thought of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them However the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space and have flourished in both pre Christian and Christian cultures br Sometimes elves are like dwarves associated with craftsmanship Wayland the Smith embodies this feature He is known under many names depending on the language in which the stories were distributed The names include V lund in Old Norse W land in Anglo Saxon and Wieland in German The story of Wayland is also to be found in the Prose Edda br The word elf is found throughout the Germanic languages and seems originally to have meant white being However reconstructing the early concept of an elf depends largely on texts written by Christians in Old and Middle English medieval German and Old Norse These associate elves variously with the gods of Norse mythology with causing illness with magic and with beauty and seduction br After the medieval period the word elf tended to become less common throughout the Germanic languages losing out to alternative native terms like Zwerg dwarf in German and huldra hidden being in North Germanic languages and to loan words like fairy borrowed from French into most of the Germanic languages Still belief in elves persisted in the early modern period particularly in Scotland and Scandinavia where elves were thought of as magically powerful people living usually invisibly alongside everyday human communities They continued to be associated with causing illnesses and with sexual threats For example several early modern ballads in the British Isles and Scandinavia originating in the medieval period describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human characters br With urbanisation and industrialisation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries belief in elves declined rapidly though Iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves However elves started to be prominent in the literature and art of educated elites from the early modern period onwards These literary elves were imagined as tiny playful beings with William Shakespeare s A Midsummer Night s Dream being a key development of this idea In the eighteenth century German Romantic writers were influenced by this notion of the elf and re imported the English word elf into the German language br From the Romantic idea of elves came the elves of popular culture that emerged in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries The Christmas elves of contemporary popular culture are a relatively recent creation popularized during the late th century in the United States Elves entered the twentieth century high fantasy genre in the wake of works published by authors such as J R R Tolkien these re popularised the idea of elves as human sized and humanlike beings Elves remain a prominent feature of fantasy media today br br Elves have in many times and places been believed to be real beings Where enough people have believed in the reality of elves that those beliefs then had real effects in the world they can be understood as part of people s worldview and as a social reality a thing which like the exchange value of a dollar bill or the sense of pride stirred up by a national flag is real because of people s beliefs rather than as an objective reality Accordingly beliefs about elves and their social functions have varied over time and space br Even in the twenty first century fantasy stories about elves have been argued both to reflect and to shape their audiences understanding of the real world and traditions about Santa Claus and his elves relate to Christmas br Over time people have attempted to demythologise or rationalise beliefs in elves in various ways br br Beliefs about elves have their origins before the conversion to Christianity and associated Christianization of northwest Europe For this reason belief in elves has from the Middle Ages through into recent scholarship often been labelled pagan and a superstition However almost all surviving textual sources about elves were produced by Christians whether Anglo Saxon monks medieval Icelandic poets early modern ballad singers nineteenth century folklore collectors or even twentieth century fantasy authors Attested beliefs about elves therefore need to be understood as part of Germanic speakers Christian culture and not merely a relic of their pre Christian religion Accordingly investigating the relationship between beliefs in elves and Christian cosmology has been a preoccupation of scholarship about elves both in early times and modern research br Historically people have taken three main approaches to integrate elves into Christian cosmology all of which are found widely across time and space br br Identifying elves with the demons of Judaeo Christian Mediterranean tradition For example br In English language material in the Royal Prayer Book from c elf appears as a gloss for Satan In the late fourteenth century Wife of Bath s Tale Geoffrey Chaucer equates male elves with incubi demons which rape sleeping women In the early modern Scottish witchcraft trials witnesses descriptions of encounters with elves were often interpreted by prosecutors as encounters with the Devil br In medieval Iceland Snorri Sturluson wrote in his Prose Edda of lj s lfar and d kk lfar light elves and dark elves the lj s lfar living in the heavens and the d kk lfar under the earth The consensus of modern scholarship is that Snorri s elves are based on angels and demons of Christian cosmology br Elves appear as demonic forces widely in medieval and early modern English German and Scandinavian prayers br Viewing elves as being more or less like people and more or less outside Christian cosmology The Icelanders who copied the Poetic Edda did not explicitly try to integrate elves into Christian thought Likewise the early modern Scottish people who confessed to encountering elves seem not to have thought of themselves as having dealings with the Devil Nineteenth century Icelandic folklore about elves mostly presents them as a human agricultural community parallel to the visible human community which may or may not be Christian It is possible that stories were sometimes told from this perspective as a political act to subvert the dominance of the Church br Integrating elves into Christian cosmology without identifying them as demons The most striking examples are serious theological treatises the Icelandic T fordrif by J n Gu mundsson l r i or in Scotland Robert Kirk s Secret Commonwealth of Elves Fauns and Fairies This approach also appears in the Old English poem Beowulf which lists elves among the races springing from Cain s murder of Abel The late thirteenth century South English Legendary and some Icelandic folktales explain elves as angels that sided neither with Lucifer nor with God and were banished by God to earth rather than hell One famous Icelandic folktale explains elves as the lost children of Eve br br Some nineteenth and twentieth century scholars attempted to rationalise beliefs in elves as folk memories of lost indigenous peoples Since belief in supernatural beings is ubiquitous in human cultures scholars no longer believe such explanations are valid Research has shown however that stories about elves have often been used as a way for people to think metaphorically about real life ethnic others br br Scholars have at times also tried to explain beliefs in elves as being inspired by people suffering certain kinds of illnesses such as Williams syndrome Elves were certainly often seen as a cause of illness and indeed the English word oaf seems to have originated as a form of elf the word elf came to mean changeling left by an elf and then because changelings were noted for their failure to thrive to its modern sense a fool a stupid person a large clumsy man or boy However it again seems unlikely that the origin of beliefs in elves itself is to be explained by people s encounters with objectively real people affected by disease br br The English word elf is from the Old English word most often attested as lf whose plural would have been lfe Although this word took a variety of forms in different Old English dialects these converged on the form elf during the Middle English period During the Old English period separate forms were used for female elves such as lfen putatively from Proto Germanic l i innj but during the Middle English period the word elf routinely came to include female beings br The Old English forms are cognates linguistic siblings stemming from a common origin with medieval Germanic terms such as Old Norse alfr elf plural alfar Old High German alp evil spirit pl alp elp feminine elbe Burgundian alfs elf and Middle Low German alf evil spirit These words must come from Proto Germanic the ancestor language of the attested Germanic languages the Proto Germanic forms are reconstructed as l i z and l z br Germanic l i z l z is generally agreed to be a cognate with Latin albus matt white Old Irish ailbh n flock Ancient Greek alph s whiteness white leprosy and Albanian elb barley and the Germanic word for swan reconstructed as albit compare Modern Icelandic lpt is often thought to be derived from it These all come from a Proto Indo European root h elb and seem to be connected by the idea of whiteness The Germanic word presumably originally meant white one perhaps as a euphemism Jakob Grimm thought whiteness implied positive moral connotations and noting Snorri Sturluson s lj s lfar suggested that elves were divinities of light This is not necessarily the case however For example because the cognates suggest matt white rather than shining white and because in medieval Scandinavian texts whiteness is associated with beauty Alaric Hall has suggested that elves may have been called the white people because whiteness was associated with specifically feminine beauty Some scholars have argued that the names Albion and Alps may also be related possibly through Celtic br A completely different etymology making elf a cognate with the bhus semi divine craftsmen in Indian mythology was suggested by Adalbert Kuhn in In this case l i z would connote the meaning skillful inventive clever and could be a cognate with Latin labor in the sense of creative work While often mentioned this etymology is not widely accepted br br Throughout the medieval Germanic languages elf was one of the nouns used in personal names almost invariably as a first element These names may have been influenced by Celtic names beginning in Albio such as Albiorix br br Personal names provide the only evidence for elf in Gothic which must have had the word albs plural albeis The most famous name of this kind is Alboin Old English names in elf include the cognate of Alboin lfwine literally elf friend m lfric elf powerful m lfweard elf guardian m and lfwaru elf care f A widespread survivor of these in modern English is Alfred Old English lfr d elf advice Also surviving are the English surname Elgar lfgar elf spear and the name of St Alphege lfh ah elf tall German examples are Alberich Alphart and Alphere father of Walter of Aquitaine and Icelandic examples include lfhildur These names suggest that elves were positively regarded in early Germanic culture Of the many words for supernatural beings in Germanic languages the only ones regularly used in personal names are elf and words denoting pagan gods suggesting that elves were considered similar to gods br In later Old Icelandic alfr elf and the personal name which in Common Germanic had been A a l wulfaz both coincidentally became lfr lfr br Elves appear in some place names though it is difficult to be sure how many of other words including personal names can appear similar to elf because of confounding elements such as al from eald meaning old The clearest appearances of elves in English examples are Elveden elves hill Suffolk and Elvendon elves valley Oxfordshire other examples may be Eldon Hill Elves hill Derbyshire and Alden Valley elves valley Lancashire These seem to associate elves fairly consistently with woods and valleys br br The earliest surviving manuscripts mentioning elves in any Germanic language are from Anglo Saxon England Medieval English evidence has therefore attracted quite extensive research and debate In Old English elves are most often mentioned in medical texts which attest to the belief that elves might afflict humans and livestock with illnesses apparently mostly sharp internal pains and mental disorders The most famous of the medical texts is the metrical charm Wi f rstice against a stabbing pain from the tenth century compilation Lacnunga but most of the attestations are in the tenth century Bald s Leechbook and Leechbook III This tradition continues into later English language traditions too elves continue to appear in Middle English medical texts br Belief in elves causing illnesses remained prominent in early modern Scotland where elves were viewed as supernaturally powerful people who lived invisibly alongside everyday rural people Thus elves were often mentioned in the early modern Scottish witchcraft trials many witnesses in the trials believed themselves to have been given healing powers or to know of people or animals made sick by elves Throughout these sources elves are sometimes associated with the succubus like supernatural being called the mare br While they may have been thought to cause diseases with magical weapons elves are more clearly associated in Old English with a kind of magic denoted by Old English s den and s dsa a cognate with the Old Norse sei r and also paralleled in the Old Irish Serglige Con Culainn By the fourteenth century they were also associated with the arcane practice of alchemy br br In one or two Old English medical texts elves might be envisaged as inflicting illnesses with projectiles In the twentieth century scholars often labelled the illnesses elves caused as elf shot but work from the s onwards showed that the medieval evidence for elves being thought to cause illnesses in this way is slender debate about its significance is ongoing br The noun elf shot is first attested in a Scots poem Rowlis Cursing from around where elf schot is listed among a range of curses to be inflicted on some chicken thieves The term may not always have denoted an actual projectile shot could mean a sharp pain as well as projectile But in early modern Scotland elf schot and other terms like elf arrowhead are sometimes used of neolithic arrow heads apparently thought to have been made by elves In a few witchcraft trials people attest that these arrow heads were used in healing rituals and occasionally alleged that witches and perhaps elves used them to injure people and cattle Compare with the following excerpt from a ode by William Collins br br Because of elves association with illness in the twentieth century most scholars imagined that elves in the Anglo Saxon tradition were small invisible demonic beings causing illnesses with arrows This was encouraged by the idea that elf shot is depicted in the Eadwine Psalter in an image which became well known in this connection However this is now thought to be a misunderstanding the image proves to be a conventional illustration of God s arrows and Christian demons Rather twenty first century scholarship suggests that Anglo Saxon elves like elves in Scandinavia or the Irish Aos S were regarded as people br br Like words for gods and men the word elf is used in personal names where words for monsters and demons are not Just as lfar is associated with sir in Old Norse the Old English Wi f rstice associates elves with se whatever this word meant by the tenth century etymologically it denoted pagan gods In Old English the plural ylfe attested in Beowulf is grammatically an ethnonym a word for an ethnic group suggesting that elves were seen as people As well as appearing in medical texts the Old English word lf and its feminine derivative lbinne were used in glosses to translate Latin words for nymphs This fits well with the word lfsc ne which meant elf beautiful and is attested describing the seductively beautiful Biblical heroines Sarah and Judith br Likewise in Middle English and early modern Scottish evidence while still appearing as causes of harm and danger elves appear clearly as humanlike beings They became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of fairies and particularly with the idea of a Fairy Queen A propensity to seduce or rape people becomes increasingly prominent in the source material Around the fifteenth century evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies and replace them with changelings br br By the end of the medieval period elf was increasingly being supplanted by the French loan word fairy An example is Geoffrey Chaucer s satirical tale Sir Thopas where the title character sets out in a quest for the elf queen who dwells in the countree of the Faerie br br Evidence for elf beliefs in medieval Scandinavia outside Iceland is sparse but the Icelandic evidence is uniquely rich For a long time views about elves in Old Norse mythology were defined by Snorri Sturluson s Prose Edda which talks about svart lfar d kk lfar and lj s lfar black elves dark elves and light elves For example Snorri recounts how the svart lfar create new blond hair for Thor s wife Sif after Loki had shorn off Sif s long hair However these terms are attested only in the Prose Edda and texts based on it It is now agreed that they reflect traditions of dwarves demons and angels partly showing Snorri s paganisation of a Christian cosmology learned from the Elucidarius a popular digest of Christian thought br Scholars of Old Norse mythology now focus on references to elves in Old Norse poetry particularly the Elder Edda The only character explicitly identified as an elf in classical Eddaic poetry if any is V lundr the protagonist of V lundarkvi a However elves are frequently mentioned in the alliterating phrase sir ok lfar sir and elves and its variants This was a well established poetic formula indicating a strong tradition of associating elves with the group of gods known as the sir or even suggesting that the elves and sir were one and the same The pairing is paralleled in the Old English poem Wi f rstice and in the Germanic personal name system moreover in Skaldic verse the word elf is used in the same way as words for gods Sigvatr r arson s skaldic travelogue Austrfarav sur composed around mentions an lfabl t elves sacrifice in Edskogen in what is now southern Sweden There does not seem to have been any clear cut distinction between humans and gods like the sir then elves were presumably thought of as being humanlike and existing in opposition to the giants Many commentators have also or instead argued for conceptual overlap between elves and dwarves in Old Norse mythology which may fit with trends in the medieval German evidence br There are hints that the god Freyr was associated with elves In particular lfheimr literally elf world is mentioned as being given to Freyr in Gr mnism l Snorri Sturluson identified Freyr as one of the Vanir However the term Vanir is rare in Eddaic verse very rare in Skaldic verse and is not generally thought to appear in other Germanic languages Given the link between Freyr and the elves it has therefore long been suspected that lfar and Vanir are more or less different words for the same group of beings However this is not uniformly accepted br A kenning poetic metaphor for the sun lfr ull literally elf disc is of uncertain meaning but is to some suggestive of a close link between elves and the sun br Although the relevant words are of slightly uncertain meaning it seems fairly clear that V lundr is described as one of the elves in V lundarkvi a As his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape B vildr the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens The same idea is present in two post classical Eddaic poems which are also influenced by chivalric romance or Breton lais K tludraumur and Gullk rslj The idea also occurs in later traditions in Scandinavia and beyond so it may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition Elves also appear in a couple of verse spells including the Bergen rune charm from among the Bryggen inscriptions br br The appearance of elves in sagas is closely defined by genre The Sagas of Icelanders Bishops sagas and contemporary sagas whose portrayal of the supernatural is generally restrained rarely mention lfar and then only in passing But although limited these texts provide some of the best evidence for the presence of elves in everyday beliefs in medieval Scandinavia They include a fleeting mention of elves seen out riding in in Sturlunga saga mention of an lfabl t elves sacrifice in Korm ks saga and the existence of the euphemism ganga lfrek go to drive away the elves for going to the toilet in Eyrbyggja saga br The Kings sagas include a rather elliptical but widely studied account of an early Swedish king being worshipped after his death and being called lafr Geirsta a lfr lafr the elf of Geirsta ir and a demonic elf at the beginning of Norna Gests ttr br The legendary sagas tend to focus on elves as legendary ancestors or on heroes sexual relations with elf women Mention of the land of lfheimr is found in Heimskringla while orsteins saga V kingssonar recounts a line of local kings who ruled over lfheim who since they had elven blood were said to be more beautiful than most men According to Hr lfs saga kraka Hrolfr Kraki s half sister Skuld was the half elven child of King Helgi and an elf woman lfkona Skuld was skilled in witchcraft sei r Accounts of Skuld in earlier sources however do not include this material The i reks saga version of the Nibelungen Niflungar describes H gni as the son of a human queen and an elf but no such lineage is reported in the Eddas V lsunga saga or the Nibelungenlied The relatively few mentions of elves in the chivalric sagas tend even to be whimsical br In his Rerum Danicarum fragmenta written mostly in Latin with some Old Danish and Old Icelandic passages Arngr mur J nsson explains the Scandinavian and Icelandic belief in elves called Allffuafolch br Both Continental Scandinavia and Iceland have a scattering of mentions of elves in medical texts sometimes in Latin and sometimes in the form of amulets where elves are viewed as a possible cause of illness Most of them have Low German connections br br The Old High German word alp is attested only in a small number of glosses It is defined by the Althochdeutsches W rterbuch as a nature god or nature demon equated with the Fauns of Classical mythology regarded as eerie ferocious beings As the mare he messes around with women Accordingly the German word Alpdruck literally elf oppression means nightmare There is also evidence associating elves with illness specifically epilepsy br In a similar vein elves are in Middle High German most often associated with deceiving or bewildering people in a phrase that occurs so often it would appear to be proverbial die elben der alp trieget mich the elves elf are is deceiving me The same pattern holds in Early Modern German This deception sometimes shows the seductive side apparent in English and Scandinavian material most famously the early thirteenth century Heinrich von Morungen s fifth Minnesang begins Von den elben wirt entsehen vil manic man S bin ich von gr zer liebe ents n full many a man is bewitched by elves thus I too am bewitched by great love Elbe was also used in this period to translate words for nymphs br In later medieval prayers Elves appear as a threatening even demonic force For example some prayers invoke God s help against nocturnal attacks by Alpe Correspondingly in the early modern period elves are described in north Germany doing the evil bidding of witches Martin Luther believed his mother to have been afflicted in this way br As in Old Norse however there are few characters identified as elves It seems likely that in the German speaking world elves were to a significant extent conflated with dwarves Middle High German getwerc Thus some dwarves that appear in German heroic poetry have been seen as relating to elves In particular nineteenth century scholars tended to think that the dwarf Alberich whose name etymologically means elf powerful was influenced by early traditions of elves br br From around the Late Middle Ages the word elf began to be used in English as a term loosely synonymous with the French loan word fairy in elite art and literature at least it also became associated with diminutive supernatural beings like Puck hobgoblins Robin Goodfellow the English and Scots brownie and the Northumbrian English hob br However in Scotland and parts of northern England near the Scottish border beliefs in elves remained prominent into the nineteenth century James VI of Scotland and Robert Kirk discussed elves seriously elf beliefs are prominently attested in the Scottish witchcraft trials particularly the trial of Issobel Gowdie and related stories also appear in folktales There is a significant corpus of ballads narrating stories about elves such as Thomas the Rhymer where a man meets a female elf Tam Lin The Elfin Knight and Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight in which an Elf Knight rapes seduces or abducts a woman and The Queen of Elfland s Nourice a woman is abducted to be a wet nurse to the elf queen s baby but promised that she might return home once the child is weaned br br In Scandinavian folklore many humanlike supernatural beings are attested which might be thought of as elves and partly originate in medieval Scandinavian beliefs However the characteristics and names of these beings have varied widely across time and space and they cannot be neatly categorised These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from the Old Norse lfr However in modern languages traditional terms related to lfr have tended to be replaced with other terms Things are further complicated because when referring to the elves of Old Norse mythology scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word lfr The following table summarises the situation in the main modern standard languages of Scandinavia br br The elves of Norse mythology have survived into folklore mainly as females living in hills and mounds of stones The Swedish lvor were stunningly beautiful girls who lived in the forest with an elven king br The elves could be seen dancing over meadows particularly at night and on misty mornings They left a circle where they had danced called lvdanser elf dances or lvringar elf circles and to urinate in one was thought to cause venereal diseases Typically elf circles were fairy rings consisting of a ring of small mushrooms but there was also another kind of elf circle In the words of the local historian Anne Marie Hellstr m br br on lake shores where the forest met the lake you could find elf circles They were round places where the grass had been flattened like a floor Elves had danced there By Lake Tisnaren I have seen one of those It could be dangerous and one could become ill if one had trodden over such a place or if one destroyed anything there br If a human watched the dance of the elves he would discover that even though only a few hours seemed to have passed many years had passed in the real world Humans being invited or lured to the elf dance is a common motif transferred from older Scandinavian ballads br Elves were not exclusively young and beautiful In the Swedish folktale Little Rosa and Long Leda an elvish woman lvakvinna arrives in the end and saves the heroine Little Rose on the condition that the king s cattle no longer graze on her hill She is described as a beautiful old woman and by her aspect people saw that she belonged to the subterraneans br br Elves have a prominent place in several closely related ballads which must have originated in the Middle Ages but are first attested in the early modern period Many of these ballads are first attested in Karen Brahes Folio a Danish manuscript from the s but they circulated widely in Scandinavia and northern Britain They sometimes mention elves because they were learned by heart even though that term had become archaic in everyday usage They have therefore played a major role in transmitting traditional ideas about elves in post medieval cultures Indeed some of the early modern ballads are still quite widely known whether through school syllabuses or contemporary folk music They therefore give people an unusual degree of access to ideas of elves from older traditional culture br The ballads are characterised by sexual encounters between everyday people and humanlike beings referred to in at least some variants as elves the same characters also appear as mermen dwarves and other kinds of supernatural beings The elves pose a threat to the everyday community by lure people into the elves world The most famous example is Elveskud and its many variants paralleled in English as Clerk Colvill where a woman from the elf world tries to tempt a young knight to join her in dancing or to live among the elves in some versions he refuses and in some he accepts but in either case he dies tragically As in Elveskud sometimes the everyday person is a man and the elf a woman as also in Elveh j much the same story as Elveskud but with a happy ending Herr Magnus og Bj rgtrolden Herr T nne af Als Herr B smer i elvehjem or the Northern British Thomas the Rhymer Sometimes the everyday person is a woman and the elf is a man as in the northern British Tam Lin The Elfin Knight and Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight in which the Elf Knight bears away Isabel to murder her or the Scandinavian Harpans kraft In The Queen of Elfland s Nourice a woman is abducted to be a wet nurse to the elf queen s baby but promised that she might return home once the child is weaned br br In folk stories Scandinavian elves often play the role of disease spirits The most common though the also most harmless case was various irritating skin rashes which were called lvabl st elven puff and could be cured by a forceful counter blow a handy pair of bellows was most useful for this purpose Sk lgropar a particular kind of petroglyph pictogram on a rock found in Scandinavia were known in older times as lvkvarnar elven mills because it was believed elves had used them One could appease the elves by offering a treat preferably butter placed into an elven mill br In order to protect themselves and their livestock against malevolent elves Scandinavians could use a so called Elf cross Alfkors lvkors or Ellakors which was carved into buildings or other objects It existed in two shapes one was a pentagram and it was still frequently used in early th century Sweden as painted or carved onto doors walls and household utensils to protect against elves The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate This second kind of elf cross was worn as a pendant in a necklace and to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver from nine different sources of inherited silver In some locations it also had to be on the altar of a church for three consecutive Sundays br br In Iceland expressing belief in the hulduf lk hidden people elves that dwell in rock formations is still relatively common Even when Icelanders do not explicitly express their belief they are often reluctant to express disbelief A and study by the University of Iceland s Faculty of Social Sciences revealed that many would not rule out the existence of elves and ghosts a result similar to a survey by Erlendur Haraldsson The lead researcher of the study Terry Gunnell stated Icelanders seem much more open to phenomena like dreaming the future forebodings ghosts and elves than other nations Whether significant numbers of Icelandic people do believe in elves or not elves are certainly prominent in national discourses They occur most often in oral narratives and news reporting in which they disrupt house and road building In the analysis of Valdimar Tr Hafstein narratives about the insurrections of elves demonstrate supernatural sanction against development and urbanization that is to say the supernaturals protect and enforce religious values and traditional rural culture The elves fend off with more or less success the attacks and advances of modern technology palpable in the bulldozer Elves are also prominent in similar roles in contemporary Icelandic literature br Folk stories told in the nineteenth century about elves are still told in modern Denmark and Sweden Still they now feature ethnic minorities in place of elves in essentially racist discourse In an ethnically fairly homogeneous medieval countryside supernatural beings provided the Other through which everyday people created their identities in cosmopolitan industrial contexts ethnic minorities or immigrants are used in storytelling to similar effect br br Early modern Europe saw the emergence for the first time of a distinctive elite culture while the Reformation encouraged new skepticism and opposition to traditional beliefs subsequent Romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites The effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in England and Germany with developments in each country influencing the other In Scandinavia the Romantic movement was also prominent and literary writing was the main context for continued use of the word elf except in fossilised words for illnesses However oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century br Elves entered early modern elite culture most clearly in the literature of Elizabethan England Here Edmund Spenser s Faerie Queene used fairy and elf interchangeably of human sized beings but they are complex imaginary and allegorical figures Spenser also presented his own explanation of the origins of the Elfe and Elfin kynd claiming that they were created by Prometheus Likewise William Shakespeare in a speech in Romeo and Juliet has an elf lock tangled hair being caused by Queen Mab who is referred to as the fairies midwife Meanwhile A Midsummer Night s Dream promoted the idea that elves were diminutive and ethereal The influence of Shakespeare and Michael Drayton made the use of elf and fairy for very small beings the norm and had a lasting effect seen in fairy tales about elves collected in the modern period br br Early modern English notions of elves became influential in eighteenth century Germany The Modern German Elf m and Elfe f was introduced as a loan word from English in the s and was prominent in Christoph Martin Wieland s translation of A Midsummer Night s Dream br As German Romanticism got underway and writers started to seek authentic folklore Jacob Grimm rejected Elf as a recent Anglicism and promoted the reuse of the old form Elb plural Elbe or Elben In the same vein Johann Gottfried Herder translated the Danish ballad Elveskud in his collection of folk songs Stimmen der V lker in Liedern as Erlk nigs Tochter The Erl king s Daughter it appears that Herder introduced the term Erlk nig into German through a mis Germanisation of the Danish word for elf This in turn inspired Goethe s poem Der Erlk nig However Goethe added another new meaning as the German word Erle does not mean elf but black alder the poem about the Erlenk nig is set in the area of an alder quarry in the Saale valley in Thuringia Goethe s poem then took on a life of its own inspiring the Romantic concept of the Erlking which was influential on literary images of elves from the nineteenth century on br br In Scandinavia too in the nineteenth century traditions of elves were adapted to include small insect winged fairies These are often called elves lvor in modern Swedish alfer in Danish lfar in Icelandic although the more formal translation in Danish is feer Thus the alf found in the fairy tale The Elf of the Rose by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen is so tiny he can have a rose blossom for home and wings that reached from his shoulders to his feet Yet Andersen also wrote about elvere in The Elfin Hill The elves in this story are more alike those of traditional Danish folklore who were beautiful females living in hills and boulders capable of dancing a man to death Like the huldra in Norway and Sweden they are hollow when seen from the back br br English and German literary traditions both influenced the British Victorian image of elves which appeared in illustrations as tiny men and women with pointed ears and stocking caps An example is Andrew Lang s fairy tale Princess Nobody illustrated by Richard Doyle where fairies are tiny people with butterfly wings In contrast elves are small people with red stocking caps These conceptions remained prominent in twentieth century children s literature for example Enid Blyton s The Faraway Tree series and were influenced by German Romantic literature Accordingly in the Brothers Grimm fairy tale Die Wichtelm nner literally the little men the title protagonists are two tiny naked men who help a shoemaker in his work Even though Wichtelm nner are akin to beings such as kobolds dwarves and brownies the tale was translated into English by Margaret Hunt in as The Elves and the Shoemaker This shows how the meanings of elf had changed and was in itself influential the usage is echoed for example in the house elf of J K Rowling s Harry Potter stories In his turn J R R Tolkien recommended using the older German form Elb in translations of his works as recorded in his Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings Elb Elben was consequently introduced in German translation of The Lord of the Rings repopularising the form in German br br With industrialisation and mass education traditional folklore about elves waned however as the phenomenon of popular culture emerged elves were re imagined in large part based on Romantic literary depictions and associated medievalism br As American Christmas traditions crystallized in the nineteenth century the poem A Visit from St Nicholas widely known as Twas the Night before Christmas characterized St Nicholas himself as a right jolly old elf However it was his little helpers inspired partly by folktales like The Elves and the Shoemaker who became known as Santa s elves the processes through which this came about are not well understood but one key figure was a Christmas related publication by the German American cartoonist Thomas Nast Thus in the US Canada UK and Ireland the modern children s folklore of Santa Claus typically includes small nimble green clad elves with pointy ears long noses and pointy hats as Santa s helpers They make the toys in a workshop located in the North Pole The role of elves as Santa s helpers has continued to be popular as evidenced by the success of the popular Christmas movie Elf br br The fantasy genre in the twentieth century grew out of nineteenth century Romanticism in which nineteenth century scholars such as Andrew Lang and the Grimm brothers collected fairy stories from folklore and in some cases retold them freely br A pioneering work of the fantasy genre was The King of Elfland s Daughter a novel by Lord Dunsany The Elves of Middle earth played a central role in Tolkien s legendarium notably The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing Tolkien s writing had such influence that in the s and afterwards elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien s novels became staple non human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role playing games Post Tolkien fantasy elves which feature not only in novels but also in role playing games such as Dungeons Dragons are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans with sharper senses and perceptions as well They are said to be gifted in magic mentally sharp and lovers of nature art and song They are often skilled archers A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears br In works where elves are the main characters such as The Silmarillion or Wendy and Richard Pini s comic book series Elfquest elves exhibit a similar range of behaviour to a human cast distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers However where narratives are more human centered as in The Lord of the Rings elves tend to sustain their role as powerful sometimes threatening outsiders Despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games scholars have found that elves in these works continue to have a subtle role in shaping the real life identities of their audiences For example elves can function to encode real world racial others in video games or to influence gender norms through literature br br Beliefs in humanlike supernatural beings are widespread in human cultures and many such beings may be referred to as elves in English br br Elfish beings appear to have been a common characteristic within Indo European mythologies In the Celtic speaking regions of
