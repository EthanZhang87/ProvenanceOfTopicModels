from Jerusalem the eternal and undivided capital of Israel Mor Dionysius John Kawak archbishop of the Syriac Orthodox Church and other representatives of that Oriental Orthodox denomination were in attendance at an official dinner for the museum s opening br When the museum opened to the public on Saturday November the lines outside were short Some exhibits bustled with visitors while others were nearly empty and the museum was not at capacity br br br Reception br Historians Kelly Gannon and Kimberly Wagner evaluated the museum as a testament to the power of Evangelical impulses tempered by a desire to legitimate the Bible as a centerpiece of conversation in American life They conclude br br There is much that makes this museum great The design of the space is stunning and well thought out Likewise the impressiveness of the technology cannot be overstated Finally the collection is notable for its size and breadth Yet despite all of this MOTB remains a confusing amalgamation of historical and biblical scholarship Evangelical influence and the desire to be a modern attraction While MOTB s intent is not necessarily proselytization its aims and purpose are often obscured by unspoken ideological and theological battles raging just under the surface With all of the forces pulling at Museum of the Bible it loses its sense of identity and risks becoming an Evangelical tourist attraction though it has the potential to be much more br At first the museum came under criticism for the original wording of its mission which described an Evangelistic purpose of the museum namely to inspire confidence in the absolute authority and reliability of the Bible A later statement shifted away from that language A revised mission statement reads We exist to invite all people to engage with the Bible We invite Biblical exploration through museum exhibits and scholarly pursuits br The current mission statement reads Museum of the Bible is a global innovative educational institution whose purpose is to invite all people to engage with the transformative power of the Bible br Lawrence Schiffman an authority on the Dead Sea Scrolls and professor of Hebrew and Jewish studies at New York University stated with respect to the Museum of the Bible br br The overarching narrative is the impact of the Bible its own internal history of how it came together spread and was passed on It exudes one of the best things about art culture in this country Protestant Catholic Jewish Ethiopic Orthodox all of them are here There s a message of shared culture and respect that the museum exudes Everyone who comes here is going to go out with that message br With its many engaging and interactive elements the Museum of the Bible has been described by Philip Kennicott as a new standard for how this country s museums fuse entertainment and education He went on to say that the Museum creates for its guests a cultural experience bringing together history art architecture theater and music br John Knutsen assistant director of the St Thomas More Institute and coordinator for evangelization and adult faith formation wrote a review of the museum for The Catholic Herald Knutsen wrote Far from offering a shallow presentation the Museum of the Bible is cultured erudite and remarkably diverse br In contrast to these comments Biblical scholars Joel Baden of Yale Divinity School and Candida Moss of University of Birmingham who wrote the book Bible Nation The United States of Hobby Lobby expressed concerns about the museum s mission saying They have misled the public at large by promoting a curriculum and a museum that tell only the story that the Greens want to tell without acknowledging that scholars and experts have spent decades indeed centuries laboring to provide very different accounts of the Bible and its history br After spending many hours while writing the book with museum founder Steve Green and president Cary Summers they concluded br br It s not really a museum of the Bible it s a museum of American Protestantism Their whole purpose is to show this country as a Christian country governed by Christian morality br Their three minute promo is fascinating demonstration of this problem At least half of it is a reenactment of American history which has no bearing on the Bible the signing of the Declaration of Independence for example or the Revolutionary War The worry is that the museum portrays a story of the Bible that culminates in Protestantism and America Baden br In contrast Christopher Rollston a professor at George Washington University and expert on the Old Testament was pleased with the museum s efforts to be quite historical in the wordings of the displays that they have adding that they have made it clear that they re willing to listen to scholars critiques br John Fea associate professor of American history at Messiah College and chair of the history department said It s hard to see this as anything other than an attempt to try to bring Christian values in the Bible s teachings as understood by Evangelical Protestants like the Greens into the center of American political life and American cultural life However the Catholic theologian Thomas L McDonald writing in the National Catholic Register praised the abundance of material dedicated to the history of the Bible with respect to Catholicism br br In the museum brought its traveling Verbum Domini exhibit to the Vatican which helped forge relationships with the Vatican Museums and Vatican Library A similar exhibit was mounted in Philadelphia during the visit of Pope Francis continuing the museum s process of courting Catholic leaders and press The result is a permanent space on the first floor of the museum for rotating exhibits from the Vatican Pre Reformation books and illuminated manuscripts displays of Catholic architecture and art the role of monks and nuns and discussions of Catholic saints and scholars are all in the mix br A blog article in The Economist criticized the Museum of the Bible for focusing on Protestant Jewish and Roman Catholic views but ignoring the views of Eastern Orthodox Christianity and not mentioning the impact of the Bible on Islam or taking into account the opinions of scholars who do not consider that the Bible contains a coherent story Biblical scholars have also accused the Museum of the Bible as normalizing a Bible that authorizes white evangelical dominion br br br Hobby Lobby smuggling scandal br br Shipments of artifacts imported by Hobby Lobby in and were seized by US customs agents The artifacts largely clay bullae and cuneiform tablets from ancient Iraq had in some cases been declared as tile samples Federal investigation culminated in a civil forfeiture action United States of America v Approximately Four Hundred Fifty Ancient Cuneiform Tablets and Approximately Three Thousand Ancient Clay Bullae after which Hobby Lobby agreed to forfeit and return more than artifacts and to pay of a fine of million The artifacts in question had likely been looted from Iraq Hobby Lobby was found to have used couriers that had willfully used methods to conceal the provenance of the allegedly stolen items The museum released a statement that these artifacts were never owned by the Museum of the Bible and were never intended to be part of their collection In the items were returned to Iraq and the company paid a million fine br Scott Thumma a dean and professor of sociology of religion at Hartford Seminary defended Hobby Lobby during the smuggling controversy Thuma stated Many of the collections of our great national museums and universities are full of the very objects that Hobby Lobby is being fined for smuggling and are seldom required to return or pay compensation br In October officials from the British Egypt Exploration Society a nonprofit organization that manages the Papyri Project alleged that Oxford academic Dirk Obbink engaged in the theft and sale of at least ancient Bible fragments to the Green family the Hobby Lobby owners who operate a Bible museum and charitable organization in Washington The museum said it will return the fragments to the Egypt Exploration Society and Oxford University br The Museum of the Bible s board chairman Steve Green who is also president of the Hobby Lobby stores announced the museum will be returning over eleven thousand artifacts to Egypt and Iraq The collection includes thousands of papyrus scraps and ancient clay pieces Green admitted I knew little about the world of collecting The criticism of the museum resulting from my mistakes was justified Manchester University papyrologist Roberta Mazza stated that the Green family poured millions on the legal and illegal antiquities market without having a clue about the history the material features cultural value fragilities and problems of the objects br This return includes the Gilgamesh Dream Tablet containing part of the Epic of Gilgamesh which was discovered in Iraq in sold by the Jordanian Antiquities Association to an antiquities dealer in and sold again by an auction house to Hobby Lobby in for million The auction house lied about how the artifact had entered the market claiming it had been on the market in the United States for decades In September federal authorities seized the tablet and in May a civil complaint was filed to forfeit it In July the United States Department of Justice announced it had seized the Gilgamesh tablet from Hobby Lobby for repatriation to Iraq Acting U S Attorney Jacquelyn M Kasulis for the Eastern District of New York stated This office is committed to combating the black market sale of cultural property and the smuggling of looted artifacts Hobby Lobby failed to follow expert advice on antiquities collecting which has resulted in multiple seizures and fines br br br Dead Sea Scrolls forgeries br Founder Steve Green donated Dead Sea Scrolls parchment fragments to the museum collection for its opening When the museum catalog was released to the public however several outside experts expressed concern that the museum had not adequately accounted for the fragments provenance Arstein Justnes a professor of biblical studies at the University of Agder in Norway declared they were outright forgeries The museum subsequently enlisted the German Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing Bundesanstalt f r Materialforschung und Pr fung to analyze the scrolls The museum kept the fragments prominently on display for its official opening while testing was still incomplete The text of display stated that scholars continue to debate the authenticity of this fragment In the museum announced that expert examination had led it to conclude that five of the sixteen fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls were forgeries and that the museum had removed them from display According to the German researchers those five showed characteristics inconsistent with ancient origin In March the museum confirmed all sixteen fragments were forgeries The forgeries are part of a group of about fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls which came onto the market in all of which are likely forgeries br In her article covering the opening of the museum for ABC News Veronica Stracqualursi recounts an interview with Christopher Rollston a professor at George Washington University specializing on the Old Testament Stracqualursi wrote that Rollston said he was particularly pleased that the museum chose to be honest about the scrolls because museums are not generally candid about artifacts potentially being forgeries br br br Gallery br br br br br br External links br br Official website br Bible museum replaces chief executive after one year Washington Post br
