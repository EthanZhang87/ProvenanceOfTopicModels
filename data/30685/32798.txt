In the history of the United Kingdom and the British Empire the Victorian era was the reign of Queen Victoria from June until her death on January Slightly different definitions are sometimes used The era followed the Georgian era and preceded the Edwardian era and its later half overlaps with the first part of the Belle poque era of continental Europe br Various liberalising political reforms took place in the UK including expanding the electoral franchise The Great Famine caused mass death in Ireland early in the period The British Empire had relatively peaceful relations with the other great powers It participated in various military conflicts mainly against minor powers The British Empire expanded during this period and was the predominant power in the world br Victorian society valued a high standard of personal conduct across all sections of society The emphasis on morality gave impetus to social reform but also placed restrictions on certain groups liberty Prosperity rose during the period but debilitating undernutrition persisted Literacy and childhood education became near universal in Great Britain for the first time Whilst some attempts were made to improve living conditions slum housing and disease remained a severe problem br The period saw significant scientific and technological development Britain was advanced in industry and engineering in particular but somewhat undeveloped in art and education Great Britain s population increased rapidly while Ireland s fell sharply br br br Terminology and periodisation br br In the strictest sense the Victorian era covers the duration of Victoria s reign as Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from her accession on June after the death of her uncle William IV until her death on January after which she was succeeded by her eldest son Edward VII Her reign lasted years and seven months a longer period than any of her predecessors The term Victorian was in contemporaneous usage to describe the era The era has also been understood in a more extensive sense as a period that possessed sensibilities and characteristics distinct from the periods adjacent to it in which case it is sometimes dated to begin before Victoria s accession typically from the passage of or agitation for during the s the Reform Act which introduced a wide ranging change to the electoral system of England and Wales Definitions that purport a distinct sensibility or politics to the era have also created scepticism about the worth of the label Victorian though there have also been defences of it br Michael Sadleir was insistent that in truth the Victorian period is three periods and not one He distinguished early Victorianism the socially and politically unsettled period from to and late Victorianism from onwards with its new waves of aestheticism and imperialism from the Victorian heyday mid Victorianism to He saw the latter period as characterised by a distinctive mixture of prosperity domestic prudery and complacency what G M Trevelyan called the mid Victorian decades of quiet politics and roaring prosperity br br br Politics diplomacy and war br br The Reform Act which made various changes to the electoral system including expanding the franchise had been passed in The franchise was expanded again by the Second Reform Act in The Third Reform Act in introduced a general principle of one vote per household All these acts and others simplified the electoral system and reduced corruption Historian Bruce L Kinzer describes these reforms as putting the United Kingdom on the path towards becoming a democracy The traditional aristocratic ruling class attempted to maintain as much influence as possible while gradually allowing the middle and working classes a role in politics However all women and a large minority of men remained outside the system into the early th century br br Cities were given greater political autonomy and the labour movement was legalised From to the Potato Famine caused mass starvation disease and death in Ireland sparking large scale emigration The Corn Laws were repealed in response to this Across the British Empire reform included rapid expansion the complete abolition of slavery in the African possessions and the end of transportation of convicts to Australia Restrictions on colonial trade were loosened and responsible i e semi autonomous government was introduced in some territories br Throughout most of the th century Britain was the most powerful country in the world The period from to known as the Pax Britannica was a time of relatively peaceful relations between the world s great powers This is particularly true of Britain s interactions with the others The only war in which the British Empire fought against another major power was the Crimean War from to There were various revolts and violent conflicts within the British Empire and Britain participated in wars against minor powers It also took part in the diplomatic struggles of the Great Game and the Scramble for Africa br In Queen Victoria married her German cousin Prince Albert of Saxe Coburg and Gotha The couple had nine children who themselves married into various royal families and the queen thus became known as the grandmother of Europe In Albert died Victoria went into mourning and withdrew from public life for ten years In with republican sentiments growing in Britain she began to return to public life In her later years her popularity soared as she became a symbol of the British Empire Queen Victoria died on January br br br Society and culture br br br Family life br The Victorian era saw a rapidly growing middle class who became an important cultural influence to a significant extent replacing the aristocracy as British society s dominant class A distinctive middle class lifestyle developed that influenced what society valued as a whole Increased importance was placed on the value of the family and the idea that marriage should be based on romantic love gained popularity A clear separation was established between the home and the workplace which had often not been the case before The home was seen as a private environment where housewives provided their husbands with a respite from the troubles of the outside world Within this ideal women were expected to focus on domestic matters and to rely on men as breadwinners Women had limited legal rights in most areas of life and a feminist movement developed Parental authority was seen as important but children were given legal protections against abuse and neglect for the first time towards the end of the period Access to education increased rapidly during the th century State funded schools were established in England and Wales for the first time Education became compulsory for pre teenaged children in England Scotland and Wales Literacy rates increased rapidly and had become nearly universal by the end of the century Private education for wealthier children boys and more gradually girls became more formalised over the course of the century br br br Religion and social issues br The growing middle class and strong evangelical movement placed great emphasis on a respectable and moral code of behaviour This included features such as charity personal responsibility controlled habits child discipline and self criticism As well as personal improvement importance was given to social reform Utilitarianism was another philosophy that saw itself as based on science rather than on morality but also emphasised social progress An alliance formed between these two ideological strands The reformers emphasised causes such as improving the conditions of women and children giving police reform priority over harsh punishment to prevent crime religious equality and political reform in order to establish a democracy The political legacy of the reform movement was to link the nonconformists part of the evangelical movement in England and Wales with the Liberal Party This continued until the First World War The Presbyterians played a similar role as a religious voice for reform in Scotland br Religion was politically controversial during this era with Nonconformists pushing for the disestablishment of the Church of England Nonconformists comprised about half of church attendees in England in and gradually the legal discrimination that had been established against them outside of Scotland was removed Legal restrictions on Roman Catholics were also largely removed The number of Catholics grew in Great Britain due to conversions and immigration from Ireland Secularism and doubts about the accuracy of the Old Testament grew among people with higher levels of education Northern English and Scottish academics tended to be more religiously conservative whilst agnosticism and even atheism though its promotion was illegal gained appeal among academics in the south Historians refer to a Victorian Crisis of Faith a period when religious views had to readjust to accommodate new scientific knowledge and criticism of the Bible br br br Popular culture br A variety of reading materials grew in popularity during the period including novels women s magazines children s literature and newspapers Much literature including chapbooks was distributed on the street Music was also very popular with genres such as folk music broadsides music halls brass bands theater music and choral music having mass appeal What is now called classical music was somewhat undeveloped compared to parts of Europe but did have significant support Many sports were introduced or popularised during the Victorian era They became important to male identity Examples included cricket football rugby tennis and cycling The idea of women participating in sport did not fit well with the Victorian view of femininity but their involvement did increase as the period progressed For the middle classes many leisure activities such as table games could be done in the home while domestic holidays to rural locations such as the Lake District and Scottish Highlands were increasingly practical The working classes had their own culture separate from that of their richer counterparts various cheaper forms of entertainment and recreational activities provided by philanthropy Trips to resorts such as Blackpool were increasingly popular towards the end of period Initially the industrial revolution increased working hours but over the course of the th century a variety of political and economic changes caused them to fall back down to and in some cases below pre industrial levels creating more time for leisure br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Economy industry and trade br br Before the Industrial Revolution daily life had changed little for hundreds of years The th century saw rapid technological development with a wide range of new inventions This led Great Britain to become the foremost industrial and trading nation of the time Historians have characterised the mid Victorian era as Britain s Golden Years with national income per person increasing by half This prosperity was driven by increased industrialisation especially in textiles and machinery along with exports to the empire and elsewhere The positive economic conditions as well as a fashion among employers for providing welfare services to their workers led to relative social stability The Chartist movement for working class men to be given the right to vote which had been prominent in the early Victorian period dissipated Government involvement in the economy was limited Only in the post World War II period around a century later did the country experience substantial economic growth again But whilst industry was well developed education and the arts were mediocre Wage rates continued to improve in the later th century real wages after taking inflation into account were per cent higher in compared to Much of the money was saved as the number of depositors in savings banks rose from in to million in and their deposits from million to over million br br br Child labour br br Children had always played a role in economic life but exploitation of their labour became especially intense during the Victorian era Children were put to work in a wide range of occupations but particularly associated with this period are factories Employing children had advantages as they were cheap had limited ability to resist harsh working conditions and could enter spaces too small for adults Some accounts exist of happy upbringings involving child labour but conditions were generally poor Pay was low punishments severe work was dangerous and disrupted children s development often leaving them too tired to play even in their free time Early labour could do lifelong harm even in the s and s the elderly people of industrial towns were noted for their often unusually short stature deformed physiques and diseases associated with unhealthy working conditions Reformers wanted the children in school in only about per cent of the children in London had any schooling By the s around half of the children in England and Wales were in school not including Sunday school From the Factory Act onwards attempts were made to get child labourers into part time education though this was often difficult to achieve Only in the s and s did children begin to be compelled into school Work continued to inhibit children s schooling into the early th century br br br Housing and public health br br th century Britain saw a huge population increase accompanied by rapid urbanisation stimulated by the Industrial Revolution In the census more than three out of every four people were classified as living in an urban area compared to one in five a century earlier Historian Richard A Soloway wrote that Great Britain had become the most urbanized country in the West The rapid growth in the urban population included the new industrial and manufacturing cities as well as service centres such as Edinburgh and London Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure P Kemp says this was usually of advantage to tenants Overcrowding was a major problem with seven or eight people frequently sleeping in a single room Until at least the s sanitation was inadequate in areas such as water supply and disposal of sewage This all had a negative effect on health especially that of the impoverished young For instance of the babies born in Liverpool in only per cent survived to age Conditions were particularly bad in London where the population rose sharply and poorly maintained overcrowded dwellings became slum housing Kellow Chesney wrote of the situation br br Hideous slums some of them acres wide some no more than crannies of obscure misery make up a substantial part of the metropolis In big once handsome houses thirty or more people of all ages may inhabit a single room br Hunger and poor diet was a common aspect of life across the UK in the Victorian period especially in the s but the mass starvation seen in the Great Famine in Ireland was unique Levels of poverty fell significantly during the th century from as much as two thirds of the population in to less than a third by However s studies suggested that almost of the urban population lived in a state of desperation lacking the food necessary to maintain basic physical functions Attitudes towards the poor were often unsympathetic and they were frequently blamed for their situation In that spirit the Poor Law Amendment Act had been deliberately designed to punish them and would remain the basis for welfare provision into the th century While many people were prone to vices not least alcoholism historian Bernard A Cook argues that the main reason for th century poverty was that typical wages for much of the population were simply too low Barely enough to provide a subsistence living in good times let alone save up for bad br Improvements were made over time to housing along with the management of sewage and water eventually giving the UK the most advanced system of public health protection anywhere in the world The quality and safety of household lighting improved over the period with oil lamps becoming the norm in the early s gas lighting in the s and electric lights beginning to appear in the homes of the richest by the end of the period Medicine advanced rapidly during the th century and germ theory was developed for the first time Doctors became more specialised and the number of hospitals grew The overall number of deaths fell by about The life expectancy of women increased from around to and to for men In spite of this the mortality rate fell only marginally from per thousand in to by the end of the century Urbanisation aided the spread of diseases and squalid living conditions in many places exacerbated the problem The population of England Scotland and Wales grew rapidly during the th century Various factors are considered contributary to this including a rising fertility rate though it was falling by the end of the period the lack of a catastrophic pandemic or famine in the island of Great Britain during the th century for the first time in history improved nutrition and a lower overall mortality rate Ireland s population shrank significantly mostly due to emigration and the Great Famine br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Knowledge br br br Science br br The professionalisation of scientific study began in parts of Europe following the French Revolution but was slow to reach Britain William Whewell coined the term scientist in to refer to those who studied what was generally then known as natural philosophy but it took a while to catch on Having been previously dominated by amateurs with a separate income the Royal Society admitted only professionals from onwards The British biologist Thomas Henry Huxley indicated in that it remained difficult to earn a living as a scientist alone Scientific knowledge and debates such as that about Charles Darwin s On the Origin of Species which sought to explain biological evolution by natural selection gained a high profile in the public consciousness Simplified and at times inaccurate popular science was increasingly distributed through a variety of publications which caused tension with the professionals There were significant advances in various fields of research including statistics elasticity refrigeration natural history electromagnetism and logic br br br Industry br Known as the workshop of the world Britain was uniquely advanced in technology in the mid th century Engineering having developed into a profession in the th century gained new profile and prestige in this period The Victorian era saw methods of communication and transportation develop significantly In William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone invented the first telegraph system This system which used electrical currents to transmit coded messages quickly spread across Britain appearing in every town and post office A worldwide network developed towards the end of the century In an American patented the telephone A little over a decade later telephones were in service in Britain Multiple switchboards were installed in every major town and city Guglielmo Marconi developed early radio broadcasting at the end of the period The railways were important economically in the Victorian era allowing goods raw materials and people to be moved around stimulating trade and industry They were also a major employer and industry in their own right br br br Moral standards br br Expected standards of personal conduct changed in around the first half of the th century with good manners and self restraint becoming much more common Historians have suggested various contributing factors such as Britain s major conflicts with France during the early th century meaning that the distracting temptations of sinful behaviour had to be avoided in order to focus on the war effort and the evangelical movement s push for moral improvement There is evidence that the expected standards of moral behaviour were reflected in action as well as rhetoric across all classes of society For instance an analysis suggested that less than of working class couples cohabited before marriage br Historian Harold Perkin argued that the change in moral standards led by the middle of the th century to diminished cruelty to animals criminals lunatics and children in that order Legal restrictions were placed on cruelty to animals Restrictions were placed on the working hours of child labourers in the s and s Further interventions took place throughout the century to increase the level of child protection Use of the death penalty also decreased Crime rates fell significantly in the second half of the th century Sociologist Christie Davies linked this change to attempts to morally educate the population especially at Sunday schools br br br Sexual behavior br Contrary to popular belief Victorian society understood that both men and women enjoyed copulation Chastity was expected of women whilst attitudes to male sexual behaviour were more relaxed The development of police forces led to a rise in prosecutions for illegal sodomy in the middle of the th century Male sexuality became a favourite subject of medical researchers study For the first time all male homosexual acts were outlawed Concern about sexual exploitation of adolescent girls increased during the period especially following the white slavery scandal which contributed to the increasing of the age of consent from to br At a time when job options for women were limited and generally low paying some women particularly those without familial support took to prostitution to support themselves Attitudes in public life and among the general population to prostitution varied Evidence about prostitutes situation also varies One contemporary study argues that the trade was a short term stepping stone to a different lifestyle for many women while another more recent study argues they were subject to physical abuse financial exploitation state persecution and difficult working conditions Due to worries about venereal disease especially among soldiers women suspected of prostitution were for a period between the s and s subject to spot compulsory examinations for sexually transmitted infections and detainment if they were found to be infected This caused a great deal of resentment among women in general due to the principle underlying the checks that women had to be controlled in order to be safe for sexual use by men and the checks were opposed by some of the earliest feminist campaigning br br br See also br th century London br Political and diplomatic history of the Victorian era br Society and culture of the Victorian era br Theatre in the Victorian
