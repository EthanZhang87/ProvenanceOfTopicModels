Room to Roam is the fifth studio album by the Waterboys released by Ensign Records on October It continued the folk rock sound of s Fisherman s Blues but was less of a commercial success reaching on the Billboard Top after its release in October Critical response continues to be mixed AllMusic describes it both as not quite as musically successful as Fisherman s Blues but also as a Celtic rock classic The front and back covers were designed by Simon Fowler based upon photography by Stefano Giovannini and Sean Jackson br Room to Roam is named after a passage in a George MacDonald book Phantastes The cover photography was done by Simon Fowler and designed by Anni Siggins br The album was recorded at Spiddal House in Galway where the last recording sessions from the preceding album Fisherman s Blues had been recorded Room to Roam would be the last of the Waterboys folk rock sound until the release of Universal Hall in Fiddler Steve Wickham who had been a large inspiration for the change to that sound for Fisherman s Blues left the band shortly before Room to Roam was released The Waterboys briefly toured with a sound more akin to their early Big Music rock sound before disbanding Room to Roam was remastered in and released with a bonus disc of additional tracks from the original sessions br Following the box set of outtakes and bonus songs of the Fisherman s Blues sessions assembled in the Fisherman s Box Mike Scott produced a box set of material from the recording sessions in Spiddal The CD set CDs and DVD were issued as The Magnificent Seven The Waterboys Fisherman s Blues Room to Roam Band in late The box set contained songs many of them previously unreleased br br br Background br Upon its release Room to Roam was considered something of a commercial and critical disappointment Speaking of the album to Melody Maker in Scott said Room to Roam is my favourite album Everything I was trying to say is on that album I was disappointed it got received the way it did I like it a lot If you listen to it in terms of the first four Waterboys albums it falls down but if you listen to it on its own terms it stands up high In a interview with the same magazine Scott continued to defend the album commenting Of all my records if I put it on I have to listen to the whole thing all the way through Maybe I m just the only guy who actually understands the record He did however express regret that the songs were not recorded live in the studio a lot of overdubbing was used in the recording process He also felt that some of the songs although good suffered from the wrong arrangements and also felt the album s running order was a mistake stating I wish the album had started with the first three songs on side two If the album had opened with Islandman it would have had a lot more punch to it and maybe made more sense to people br br br Songs br br A Life of Sundays which was more of a rock music song than the rest of the album s tracks and contained a small part of Yellow Submarine reached on Billboard s Modern Rock singles chart br Islandman anthropomorphises Great Britain and Ireland as the speaker describes locations from these places as parts of the human body The lyrics offer some comments about the places that Scott had recently lived in the placements he chooses Scotland he sings is my dreaming head Ireland is my Heart but London sprawls across my rump br The Raggle Taggle Gypsy is a traditional folk ballad which according to Nick Tosches tells the story of a true th century love affair The song s appearance on Room to Roam popularized it and it has since been recorded by other Irish folk musicians as well as by Carlos N ez on Os Amores Libres in with Scott The recording was also emblematic of the band s sound for Fisherman s Blues and Room to Roam in the same fashion that the single The Big Music came to describe the group s sound for the first three albums The official Waterboys website refers to the Waterboys during this period as the Raggle Taggle band br How Long Will I Love You was released as a single in Ireland On the inch and cassette versions of the single an alternative version of When Will We Be Married a traditional song that had appeared on Fisherman s Blues was the B side On the inch and compact disc releases of the single were also a Ray Charles song Come Live with Me The song s lyrics are a simple proclamation of undying love from the speaker How long will I love you As long as stars are above you and longer if I can br Spring Comes to Spiddal is an oddity compared to other Waterboys songs The song which refers to Spiddal where much of Fisherman s Blues and all of Room to Roam were recorded is arranged in a style that is a blend of folk music and New Orleans style marching band music The lyrics are a straightforward description of the town s inhabitants enjoying the season of spring br The words Further up further in are spoken by the character Aslan in The Last Battle by Christian fantasist C S Lewis one of Scott s sources of inspiration The lyrics describe a Joseph Campbell style hero s journey to meet a king Specifically one verse describes travelling to the end of the world which is a place not a time in Waterboys lyrics and meeting the king there which is essentially the ending of Voyage of the Dawn Treader by Lewis Another verse of the song describes a classic image of The Fool from the tarot br The lyrics for Room to Roam are found in the books Lilith and Phantastes by the Scottish fantasist George MacDonald br br br Track listing br
