The Royal Shakespeare Company RSC is a major British theatre company based in Stratford upon Avon Warwickshire England The company employs over staff and opens around productions a year The RSC plays regularly in London Stratford upon Avon and on tour across the UK and internationally br The company s home is in Stratford upon Avon where it has redeveloped its Royal Shakespeare and Swan theatres as part of a million Transformation project The theatres re opened in November having closed in br As well as the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries the RSC produces new work from living artists br br br Company history br br br The early years br There have been theatrical performances in Stratford upon Avon since at least Shakespeare s day though the first recorded performance of a play written by Shakespeare himself was in when Parson Joseph Greene master of Stratford Grammar School organised a charitable production to fund the restoration of Shakespeare s funerary monument John Ward s Birmingham based company the Warwickshire Company of Comedians agreed to perform it A surviving copy of the playbill records that the company performed Othello The first building erected to commemorate Shakespeare was David Garrick s Jubilee Pavilion in and there have been at least buildings used to perform Shakespeare s plays since br The first permanent commemorative building to Shakespeare s works in the town was a theatre built in in the gardens of New Place but has long since been demolished The RSC s history began with the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre which was the brainchild of a local brewer Charles Edward Flower He donated a acre ha site by the River Avon and in launched an international campaign to build a theatre in the town of Shakespeare s birth The theatre a Victorian Gothic building seating just over people opened on April with a performance of Much Ado About Nothing a title which gave ammunition to several critics br The Memorial a red brick Gothic cathedral designed by Dodgshun and Unsworth of Westminster was unkindly described by Bernard Shaw as an admirable building adaptable to every purpose except that of a theatre From under the direction of William Bridges Adams and after a slow start its resident New Shakespeare Company became one of the most prestigious in Britain The theatre received a royal charter of Incorporation in which gave it status br On the afternoon of March when a new season was about to commence rehearsals smoke was seen Fire broke out and the mass of half timbering chosen to ornament the interior provided dry tinder By the following morning the theatre was a blackened shell The company transferred its Shakespeare festivals to a converted local cinema Fund raising began for the rebuilding of the theatre with generous donations arriving from philanthropists in America br In January following an open competition year old Elisabeth Scott was unanimously appointed architect for the new theatre which became the first important work erected in the United Kingdom from the designs of a female architect George Bernard Shaw commented that her design was the only one that showed any theatre sense Her modernist plans for an art deco structure came under fire from many directions but the new building was opened triumphantly on William Shakespeare s birthday April Later it came under the direction of Sir Barry Jackson in Anthony Quayle from to and Glen Byam Shaw with an impressive roll call of actors Scott s building with some minor adjustments to the stage remained in constant use until when it was closed for a major refit of the interior br Timeline br New Shakespeare Memorial Theatre opens abutting the remains of the old br Chartered name of the corporation and the Stratford theatre becomes Royal Shakespeare br The Other Place opened created from a prefabricated former store rehearsal room in Stratford br The Swan Theatre opened created from the shell of the Memorial Theatre br Purpose built new Other Place designed by Michael Reardon opens br September The vision for the renewal of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre transformation is announced br July The Courtyard Theatre opens with a staging of Michael Boyd s Histories br November The Royal Shakespeare and Swan Theatres re open following their transformation br March The Other Place was reinstated as a seat studio theatre br br br The RSC br br br Foundation and history br In while still the director designate of the Memorial Theatre Peter Hall announced that the formation of a permanent company would be a primary objective David Addenbrooke wrote of Hall s belief that Shakespeare more than any other dramatist needed a style a tradition and unity of direction and acting On January Hall s first policy statement as director also proposed the acquisition of a second theatre in London to be used as a city outlet for selected Stratford productions The RSC was formally established on March with the royal announcement that the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre would henceforth be known as the Royal Shakespeare Theatre and the company as the Royal Shakespeare Company br The critic Michael Billington summarising these events wrote In the twenty nine year old Peter Hall formally took charge at Stratford upon Avon and set about turning a star laden six month Shakespeare festival into a monumental year round operation built around a permanent company a London base and contemporary work from home and abroad Looking back it is difficult to realise just how radical Hall s dream was at the time or indeed how much opposition there was to the creation of what became officially known in March as the Royal Shakespeare Company br John Barton had been appointed associate director in January and was followed in by Michel Saint Denis Peter Brook and Clifford Williams who joined the company as resident directors John Bury was appointed head of design in The repertoire was also widened to take in modern work and classics other than Shakespeare br In strong opposition to the establishment of a London base for the RSC came from the Royal National Theatre which led by Viscount Chandos and Laurence Olivier wished to be the sole subsidised company operating in London Following a deal with Prince Littler managing director of Associated Theatre Properties the RSC established the Aldwych Theatre as its London base for productions transferred from Stratford to London its stage redesigned to match the RST s apron stage br Twenty years later in the summer of the company took up London residence in both the Barbican Theatre and The Pit studio space in the Barbican Centre under the auspices of the City of London The RSC was closely involved in the design of these two venues In it left the Barbican after a series of allegedly poor seasons partly because the then artistic director Adrian Noble wanted to develop the company s touring performances His decision means the company has no regular London home br br br Innovation and growth br The RSC had first tackled its need for a small auditorium in At the insistence of Sir Trevor Nunn who had taken over as artistic director in the company hired The Place off the Euston Road in London and constructed its own theatre space for an audience of seated on raked wooden benches Two seasons of plays were staged in and none suitable for the Aldwych In December Buzz Goodbody the company s first female director drew up a plan for what would become The Other Place studio theatre in Stratford designed by Michael Reardon to seat people which opened to a first and highly successful season in The name chosen for the new studio space was favoured within the company because it implied an alternative theatre but also because it is a quotation from Hamlet br In August Nunn staged Macbeth with a minimalist set at The Other Place playing for hours minutes without an interval The small nearly round stage focused attention on the psychological dynamics of the characters Both Ian McKellen in the title role and Judi Dench as Lady Macbeth received exceptionally favourable reviews The production transferred to London opening at the Donmar Warehouse in September before its further transfer to the larger Young Vic venue for a two month season It was also recorded for transmission by Thames Television In members of the RSC voted Dench s performance the greatest by an actress in the history of the company br Summing up this triumphant period The Guardian critic Michael Billington later wrote In the RSC struck gold This was in fact the perihelion of Trevor Nunn s ten year reign as the company s sole Artistic Director and Chief Executive in he began to share power with Terry Hands In London the company opened a new studio space at the Donmar Warehouse with plays by Barker Taylor Bond and Brecht Its Aldwych repertory combined the usual Stratford transfers with Nichol s Privates on Parade Ibsen s Pillars of the Community and Brecht s The Days of the Commune At the Royal Shakespeare Theatre Terry Hands and actor Alan Howard had a marathon year working on Henry V a virtually uncut Henry VI part Henry VI part and Henry VI part and Coriolanus And the action at The Other Place included Jonson Ford Musset Gems and Rudkin No other company in the world could match that output for quantity and quality br Nunn and Hands were joint artistic directors of the RSC when the company opened The Swan its third theatre in Stratford The Swan Theatre also designed by Michael Reardon has a deep thrust stage and a galleried intimate capacity auditorium The space was to be dedicated to playing the works of Shakespeare s contemporaries the works of European writers and the occasional work of Shakespeare The theatre was launched on May with a production of The Two Noble Kinsmen by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher not published until and thought to be Shakespeare s last work for the stage It was directed by Barry Kyle br br br Costumes and props br The RSC s costume department is the largest in house costume making workshop in British theatre and world renowned In the RSC raised over million for a project to update the costume and prop department Alistair McArthur head of costume called the old working space Dickensian and added If we knew there was rain coming we d have to clear everything off the table the night before br The prop makers design and make many of their own props for the many productions A Prop Shop in Stratford upon Avon is the studio in which most of the props are made br br br Troubled times br Nunn who had been appointed to follow Hall s tenure at the National Theatre in ceded his RSC executive directorship in to his co artistic director Terry Hands who bore the brunt of media hostility during a difficult few years for the company Hands took the decision to suspend the RSC s residency at The Barbican Theatre and The Pit during the winter season of thus vacating the capital for the first time in years This was seen as essential if the RSC was to secure an increase in subsidy from the Arts Council br Shortly after that decision Adrian Noble returned to the RSC to take over from Hands as artistic director and chief executive The company had serious funding problems Noble s decision to sever all RSC connections with the Barbican Centre funded by the Corporation of the City of London was widely condemned and towards the end of his tenure things began to go terribly wrong partly through his pursuit and support of the so called Project Fleet a radical scheme aimed at rescuing the RSC from its financial crisis by replacing the Royal Shakespeare Theatre with a crowd pleasing Shakespeare Village and streamlining the company s performance structure and ensemble principle br br br A st century renaissance br None of Noble s plans came to fruition He left the job an unhappy man in March Michael Boyd then assumed control of the RSC now burdened with a deficit of million By a combination of artistic excellence and quiet husbandry including a year long Complete Works of Shakespeare Festival begun in April in collaboration with other theatre companies plus a financially successful London season at the Novello Theatre in Boyd slowly rebuilt the company s fortunes and reputation br In he launched the long awaited Stratford theatre redevelopments including construction of the temporary Courtyard Theatre while work was in progress designed to house his RSC Histories cycle before its transfer to the Roundhouse in London in Talking of these achievements with typical modesty he told the Evening Standard in December The Man Who Remade the RSC There was a bit of gardening to do but we are now beginning to show signs of walking the walk The Histories ensemble went on to win three Olivier awards in In addition that same year the RSC commissioned a completely new edition of Shakespeare s First Folio titled William Shakespeare Complete Works and published by Modern Library br To provide balance Simon Trowbridge in A Royal Shakespeare Company Book published in is highly critical of aspects of the Boyd years including his decision to redevelop the Royal Shakespeare Theatre as a second Swan Theatre br The RSC is the sole British member theatre of the Union of the Theatres of Europe br In March the RSC launched a manifesto Stand up for Shakespeare a campaign to promote a positive experience of Shakespeare for children and young people The tenets of this manifesto Do It on Your Feet See It Live Start It Earlier form the basis of the work of the Education department br In the RSC opened a new suite of education spaces on Waterside br In BP began to subsidised the RSC s ticket scheme for to year olds br In summer the company undertook a residency in Park Avenue Armory New York running a series of performances and an accompanying education programme in partnership with the NYC Department of Education br In the RSC produced the World Shakespeare Festival a celebration of Shakespeare as the world s playwright working with UK and international arts organisations and including the Globe

from the Arts Council England raised through the National Lottery Funding was also received from the Gatsby Charitable Foundation The Backstage Trust and from public donations this is the final phase of the Transformation project br Live from Stratford upon Avon a new project to broadcast the company s productions in cinemas around the world and stream them into schools was announced in May The project began with Shakespeare s Richard II starring David Tennant in November and followed up with Henry IV parts and and The Two Gentlemen of Verona in br In February Artistic Director Gregory Doran

Theatre it marked the th anniversary of Shakespeare s Death It involved a collection of Shakespeare scenes and monologues with appearances from David Tennant Catherine Tate Dame Judi Dench Benedict Cumberbatch and even one from Prince Charles br In June the actor Mark Rylance resigned from the RSC over its sponsorship deal with oil company BP br In October the RSC announced that it would be ending its partnership with BP at the end of year following criticism of its association with the oil company A week before school students threatened to boycott the theatre company if it did not sever links with the firm A spokesperson for the RSC explained that Young people are now saying clearly to us that the BP sponsorship is putting a barrier between them and their wish to engage with
