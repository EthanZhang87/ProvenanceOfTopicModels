According to Greek mythology the Chimera Chimaera Chim ra or Khimaira ky MEER kih Ancient Greek X romanized Ch maira lit she goat was a monstrous fire breathing hybrid creature from Lycia Asia Minor composed of different animal parts Typically it is depicted as a lion with a goat s head protruding from its back and a tail ending with a snake s head Some representations also include dragon s wings It was an offspring of Typhon and Echidna and a sibling of monsters like Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra br The term chimera has come to describe any mythical or fictional creature with parts taken from various animals to describe anything composed of disparate parts or perceived as wildly imaginative implausible or dazzling In other words a chimera can be any hybrid creature br In figurative use derived from the mythological meaning chimera refers to an unrealistic or unrealisable wild foolish or vain dream notion or objective br br br Family br br According to Hesiod the Chimera s mother was a certain ambiguous she which may refer to Echidna in which case the father would presumably be Typhon though possibly unlikely the Hydra or even Ceto was meant instead However the mythographers Apollodorus citing Hesiod as his source and Hyginus both make the Chimera the offspring of Echidna and Typhon Hesiod also has the Sphinx and the Nemean lion as the offspring of Orthus and another ambiguous she often understood as probably referring to the Chimera although possibly instead to Echidna or again even Ceto br br br Description br br Homer described the Chimera in the Iliad saying that she was of divine stock not of men in the fore part a lion in the hinder a serpent and in the midst a goat breathing forth in terrible wise the might of blazing fire Hesiod and Apollodorus gave similar descriptions a three headed creature with a lion in front a fire breathing goat in the middle and a serpent in the rear br br br Killed by Bellerophon br br According to Homer the Chimera who was reared by Araisodarus the father of Atymnius and Maris Trojan warriors killed by Nestor s sons Antilochus and Trasymedes was a bane to many men As told in the Iliad the hero Bellerophon was ordered by the king of Lycia to slay the Chimera hoping the monster would kill Bellerophon Still the hero trusting in the signs of the gods succeeded in killing the Chimera Hesiod adds that Bellerophon had help in killing the Chimera saying her did Pegasus and noble Bellerophon slay br Apollodorus gave a more complete account of the story Iobates the king of Lycia had ordered Bellerophon to kill the Chimera who had been killing cattle and had devastated the country since he thought that the Chimera would instead kill Bellerophon for it was more than a match for many let alone one But the hero mounted his winged horse Pegasus which had sprung from the blood of the Medusa and soaring on high shot down the Chimera from the height br br br Iconography br br Although the Chimera was according to Homer situated in foreign Lycia her representation in the arts was wholly Greek An autonomous tradition that did not rely on the written word was represented in the visual repertory of the Greek vase painters The Chimera first appeared early in the repertory of the proto Corinthian pottery painters providing some of the earliest identifiable mythological scenes that may be recognized in Greek art After some early hesitation the Corinthian type was fixed in the s BC the variations in the pictorial representations suggest multiple origins to Marilyn Low Schmitt The fascination with the monstrous devolved by the end of the seventh century into a decorative Chimera motif in Corinth while the motif of Bellerophon on Pegasus took on a separate existence alone A separate Attic tradition where the goats breathe fire and the animal s rear is serpentine begins with the confidence that Marilyn Low Schmitt is convinced that there must be unrecognized or undiscovered local precursors Two vase painters employed the motif so consistently they were given the pseudonyms the Bellerophon Painter and the Chimaera Painter br br br Similar creatures br br A fire breathing lioness was one of the earliest solar and war deities in Ancient Egypt representations from years prior to the Greeks and influences are feasible The lioness represented the war goddess and protector of both cultures that would unite as Ancient Egypt Sekhmet was one of the dominant deities in upper Egypt and Bast in lower Egypt As the divine mother and more especially as protector for Lower Egypt Bast became strongly associated with Wadjet the patron goddess of Lower Egypt br In Etruscan civilization the Chimera appears in the Orientalizing period that precedes Etruscan Archaic art The Chimera appears in Etruscan wall paintings of the fourth century BC br In Indus civilization are pictures of the Chimera in many seals There are different kinds of Chimera composed of animals from the Indian subcontinent It is not known what the Indus people called the Chimera br Although the Chimera of antiquity was forgotten in Medieval art chimerical figures appear as embodiments of the deceptive even satanic forces of raw nature They were depicted with a human face and a scaly tail as in Dante s vision of Geryon in Inferno xvii hybrid monsters more akin to the Manticore of Pliny s Natural History viii provided iconic representations of hypocrisy and fraud well into the seventeenth century through a symbolic representation in Cesare Ripa s Iconological br br br Classical sources br The myths of the Chimera may be found in the Bibliotheca of Pseudo Apollodorus book the Iliad book by Homer the Fabulae and by Hyginus the Metamorphoses book VI by Ovid IX and the Theogony ff by Hesiod br Virgil in the Aeneid book employs Chimaera for the name of a gigantic ship of Gyas in the ship race with possible allegorical significance in contemporary Roman politics br br br Hypothesis about origin br br Pliny the Elder cited Ctesias and quoted Photius identifying the Chimera with an area of permanent gas vents that still may be found by hikers on the Lycian Way in southwest Turkey Called in Turkish Yanarta flaming rock the area contains some two dozen vents in the ground grouped in two patches on the hillside above the Temple of Hephaestus approximately km north of ral near ancient Olympos in Lycia The vents emit burning methane thought to be of metamorphic origin The fires of these were landmarks in ancient times and were used for navigation by sailors br br The Neo Hittite Chimera from Carchemish dated BC which is now housed in the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations is believed to be a basis for the Greek legend It differs however from the Greek version in that a winged body of a lioness also has a human head rising from her shoulders br br br Use for Chinese mythological creatures br br Some western scholars of Chinese art starting with Victor Segalen use the word chimera generically to refer to winged leonine or mixed species quadrupeds such as bixie tianlu and even qilin br br br In popular culture br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br Apollodorus
