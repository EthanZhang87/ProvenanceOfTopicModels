An Experiment in Criticism is a book by C S Lewis in which he proposes that the quality of books should be measured not by how they are written but by how often they are re read To do this the author describes two kinds of readers The unliterary reader tends not to reread the same book while the literary reader does He suggests the categorization of books as either highbrow or lowbrow is deficient in that it fails to appreciate those qualities which have merited re reading br br br Outline br In the book Lewis outlines some of the differences between his two types of readers For example one characteristic of a unliterary reader is the argument I ve read it before which is a conclusive reason not to read a book In contrast literary readers reread books many times savouring certain passages and attempting to glean more from subsequent readings br Lewis also argues that judging books by whether they are lowbrow or highbrow is not necessarily fruitful many lowbrow books prove to be valuable to a literary reader willing to approach without prejudgment He noted that books classified as lowbrow such as science fiction are also capable of inducing a passion to re read and imparting experience which changes a reader s worldview Lewis suggests that books which are capable of doing this may prove to have enduring merit regardless of their genre He encourages us to avoid judging the literary merit of books based on traditional criteria br br br br br br External links br An Experiment in Criticism at Faded Page Canada br The Complete Review s review of An Experiment in Criticism
