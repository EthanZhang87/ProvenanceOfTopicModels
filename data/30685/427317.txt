approaching the edge and Eustace trying to pull her back falls over the edge Aslan appears and saves Eustace by blowing him on a magical wind stream to Narnia He charges Jill with helping Eustace find King Caspian X s son Prince Rilian of Narnia who disappeared some years earlier He gives Jill four Signs to guide them on their quest and then blows Jill into Narnia where Eustace is already waiting by a great castle They watch as an elderly and frail man takes ship and sails from the harbour To Eustace s dismay they then learn that the elderly man is actually King Caspian by failing to greet him they have missed the first Sign years have passed since Eustace was last in Narnia even though less than a year has passed in his world They also learn that Caspian has sailed off to visit again the lands they had sailed to when he and Eustace were young although many Narnians believe that he has set off to seek Aslan in order to ask who can be the next King of Narnia when he dies Caspian is obviously deteriorating with old age and his people fear that he will not live for much longer br Caspian s Lord Regent Trumpkin the dwarf now very elderly and deaf provides Jill and Eustace with rooms in Cair Paravel but on the advice of Glimfeather the Owl they make no mention of their quest Glimfeather summons them to a Parliament of his fellow talking owls who explain that Prince Rilian disappeared a decade earlier while searching for a large green serpent that had killed his mother br Jill and Eustace are flown to the marshes on the northern edge of Narnia where they meet their guide Puddleglum a gloomy but stalwart Marsh wiggle They journey toward the giant lands north of Narnia Hungry and suffering from exposure they meet the Lady of the Green Kirtle accompanied by a silent knight in black armour She encourages them to proceed northward to Harfang the castle of the Gentle Giants who she says would be glad to have them at their Autumn Feast Jill and Eustace overcome at the thought of comfort and warmth are eager to go only Puddleglum argues against the journey to Harfang After a long journey in harsh weather and braving a mysterious chasm in a driving snowstorm they are welcomed at Harfang br From the castle the three see that in the snowstorm they had blundered through the ruins of a giant city in the valley below thereby missing Aslan s second Sign They also see the words Under Me engraved on the road which is the third Sign Discovering from a cookbook in the kitchen that they are the main course for the Autumn Feast they make a narrow escape from Harfang Following the Sign they take shelter in a cave under the ruined city where they fall down a long dark slope into Underland br They are found by an army of underground dwelling earthmen who take them aboard a boat across the subterranean Sunless Sea to the city ruled by the Lady of the Green Kirtle She herself is away but her prot g a young man greets the travellers pleasantly He explains that he suffers from nightly psychotic episodes and during these episodes he must by the Lady s orders be bound to a silver chair for if he is released he will turn into a deadly green serpent and kill everyone in sight The three travellers determine to witness the youth in his torment as they sense it could be the key to their quest br When the young man is tied to his chair his ravings seem instead to indicate desperation to escape an enchanted captivity After several threats the youth finally begs the three to release him in the name of Aslan Recognizing this as the fourth Sign they hesitantly do so believing that he could indeed be Prince Rilian The young man immediately destroys the silver chair Free from enchantment he thanks them and declares that he is indeed the vanished Prince Rilian kept underground by the Lady of the Green Kirtle as part of her plot to conquer Narnia br The Green Lady returns and tries to bewitch them all into forgetting who they are but the barefoot Puddleglum stamps out the enchantress s magical fire and breaks her spell The enraged Lady transforms herself into a green serpent and Rilian kills her with the help of Eustace and Puddleglum realizing that the Green Lady was herself the serpent who killed his mother Rilian leads the travellers to escape from Underland The gnomes who had also been magically enslaved by the Lady are now freed by her death and joyfully return to their home even deeper in the earth a land called Bism One of them shows Rilian s party a route to the surface and Rilian returns to Cair Paravel as King Caspian is returning home Caspian is reunited with his long lost son but dies just afterwards Rilian is then declared King of Narnia amid the weeping crowd br Aslan appears and congratulates Eustace and Jill on achieving their goal then returns them to the stream in his country where Jill first met him The body of King Caspian appears in the stream and Aslan instructs Eustace to drive a thorn into the lion s paw Eustace obeys and Aslan s blood flows over the dead King who is revived and returned to youth Aslan promises Eustace and Jill that while they have to return to their own world for a while they will one day return to Aslan s Country to stay He then allows Caspian to accompany Eustace and Jill back to their own world for a brief time where they drive off the bullies before Caspian returns to Aslan s Country Experiment House becomes a well managed school and Eustace and Jill remain good friends br Back in Narnia Rilian buries his father and mourns him The kingdom goes on to have many happy years but Puddleglum often pointed out that bright mornings brought on wet afternoons and that you couldn t expect good times to last br br br Main

during their arrival from Aslan s eastern country he helps them by bringing them to a Parliament of Owls where the history of Rilian is explained and then by helping to carry them to meet Puddleglum His speech often rhymes with the onomatopoeic call of owls to whoo There s something magic about you two I saw you arrive you flew br br br Commentary br br In Chapter IV of the book an owl speculates that the Lady of the Green Kirtle the enchantress of the Underworld may be one of the same crew as the White Witch from The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe and The Magician s Nephew Some readers have suggested that she may in fact be the White Witch brought back to life The cast of characters introduced by later editors seems to promote this but it is not supported by Lewis s text The Lady of the Green Kirtle is a were snake and it is never implied in any of the books that Jadis or the White Witch possess this attribute See the Lady of the Green Kirtle for more discussion br The manner of Rilian s confinement to a chair recalls the imprisonment of Theseus and Pirithous in the Underworld when discovered there by Heracles on his twelfth and final labour the abduction of Cerberus br br br
