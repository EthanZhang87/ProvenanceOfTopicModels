informs him that he had only been gone days despite his seemingly long journey br br br Style br The novel is presented in a fragmentary stream of consciousness style designed to evoke the experience of dreaming Significantly only the hero Anodos is given a name and the descriptions of his experience are kept deliberately vague In this way MacDonald is able to explore the adult unconscious mind that eludes logical patterns and separations br br br Publication history br Phantastes was first published by Smith Elder Co in London in br The edition was illustrated by the Pre Raphaelite painter Arthur Hughes br The book was reprinted in paperback by Ballantine Books as the fourteenth volume of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in br br br Reception br br C S Lewis wrote of his first reading of Phantastes at age sixteen That night my imagination was in a certain sense baptized the rest of me not unnaturally took longer I had not the faintest notion what I had let myself in for by buying Phantastes br J R R Tolkien mentioned MacDonald in his essay On Fairy Stories br The Ballantine Adult Fantasy series editor Lin Carter wrote that MacDonald frankly had no ear for writing verses at all and the intrusion of his saccharine rhymes injured rather than enhanced the strength and clearness of the book He omitted almost all MacDonald s songs and poems from the reprint br br br br br
