bold power In she won the Russell Loines Award for Poetry for this same book of poems Although much of her work during this period reflected her politics as a member of the American Communist Party this volume of poetry was much more than implied by the title and contained forty five poems written in traditional and free verse that were related to serious topics of the time such as the Spanish Civil War the inequalities of class structure and male female relationship issues Davidman s style in these revealed the influence of Walt Whitman s Leaves of Grass br She was employed by Metro

controversial movie column reviewing Hollywood movies in a manner described as merciless in her criticisms Her acclaimed first novel Anya was published in Between and she was employed as a book

marriage Gresham wrote his most famous work Nightmare Alley in while Davidman did freelance work and cared for the house and children br The marriage was marked by difficulties that included financial problems as well as her husband s alcoholism and infidelities Gresham sometimes had drunken outbursts once smashing his guitar on a chair Davidman wrote that her husband had telephoned her one day in spring telling her that he was having a nervous breakdown and did not know when he would return home Afterwards she suffered from a defeated emotional state She had an experience that she described as for the first time my pride was forced to admit that I was not after all the master of my fate All my defenses all the walls of arrogance and cocksureness and self love behind which I had hid from God went down momentarily and God came in When Gresham did return home the couple began to look to religion for answers Davidman at first studied Judaism but decided to study all religions and concluded that the Redeemer who had made himself known whose personality I would have recognized among ten thousand He was Jesus Through their religious studies the couple in particular began to read and be influenced by the books of C S Lewis br When Gresham received a large sum for the movie rights to Nightmare Alley the family moved to an old mansion with acreage in the New York countryside where Davidman began to write her second novel Weeping Bay and Gresham also started his second novel Limbo Tower In they became members of the Pleasant Plains Presbyterian Church Gresham had at first similar Christian convictions as Joy but soon rejected them he continued to have extramarital affairs and developed an interest in tarot cards and the I Ching Both experimented with L Ron Hubbard s

friendship had developed between his younger brother and Davidman whom he described as a Christian convert of Jewish race medium height good figure horn rimmed specs quite extraordinarily uninhibited

a letter from Gresham that he and her cousin were having an affair and he wanted a divorce Her cousin Ren e Rodriguez had moved into the Gresham home and was keeping house for the family while she was away Davidman intended to try to save the marriage but she agreed to a divorce after a violent encounter with Gresham who had resumed drinking He married Rodriguez when the divorce became final in August br Confessing to be a complete Anglomaniac Davidman returned to England with her sons in November Cynthia Haven speculates that the activities of HUAC might have been a factor in her decision to emigrate and not return given her political affiliations in the past Davidman found a flat in London and enrolled David and Douglas at Dane Court Preparatory School but she soon ran into financial difficulties when Gresham stopped sending money for support Lewis paid the school fees and found Davidman and her sons a house in Oxford close to The Kilns Lewis originally regarded her only as an agreeable intellectual companion and personal friend Warren Lewis wrote For Jack the attraction was at first undoubtedly intellectual Joy was the only woman whom he had met who had a brain which matched his own in suppleness in width of interest and in analytical grasp and above all in humour and a sense of fun br br She was my daughter and my mother my pupil and my teacher my subject and my sovereign and always holding all these in solution my trusty comrade friend shipmate fellow soldier My mistress but at the same time all that any man friend and I have good ones has ever been to me Perhaps more C S Lewis br Lewis began to ask for Davidman s opinion and criticism when he was writing and she served as the inspiration for Orual the central character in Till We Have Faces Other

England with a preface by C S Lewis It sold copies double that of US sales br In Davidman s visitor s visa was not renewed by the Home Office requiring that she and her sons return to America Lewis

marriage took place at the register office St Giles Oxford on April br The couple continued to live separately after the civil marriage In October Davidman was walking across her kitchen when she tripped over the telephone wire and fell to the floor thereby breaking her left upper leg At the Churchill Hospital Oxford she was diagnosed with incurable cancer with bone metastases from breast carcinoma It was at this time that Lewis recognised that he had fallen in love with her realising how despondent he would feel to lose her He wrote to a friend new beauty and new tragedy have entered my life You would be surprised or perhaps you would not to know how much of a strange sort of happiness and even gaiety there is between us Davidman underwent several operations and radiation treatment for the cancer In March Warren Lewis wrote in his diary One of the most painful days of my life Sentence of death has been passed on Joy and the end is only a matter of time br br The relationship between Davidman and C S Lewis had developed to the point that they sought a Christian marriage This was not straightforward in the Church of England at the time because she was divorced but a friend and Anglican priest the Reverend Peter Bide performed the ceremony at Davidman s hospital bed on March The marriage did not win wide approval among Lewis s social circle and some of his friends and colleagues avoided the new couple br Upon leaving the hospital a week later she was taken to The Kilns and soon enjoyed a remission from the cancer She helped Lewis with his writing

condition worsened quickly upon return from the trip and she died on July br As a widower Lewis wrote A Grief Observed which he published under the pseudonym of N W Clerk describing his feelings and
