Marionette Theatre by Heinrich von Kleist the works of William Blake and most important John Milton s Paradise Lost from which the trilogy derives its title In his introduction he adapts a famous description of Milton by Blake to quip that he Pullman is of the Devil s party and does know it br Critics have compared the trilogy with C S Lewis s The Chronicles of Narnia which Pullman despises and also with such fantasy books as Bridge to Terabithia by Katherine Paterson and A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L Engle br br br Awards and recognition br The first volume Northern Lights won the Carnegie Medal for children s fiction in the UK in In the judges of the CILIP Carnegie Medal for children s literature selected it as one of the ten most important children s novels of the previous

included Northern Lights The Golden Compass in its list of the Best Young Adult Books of All Time In November the BBC listed His Dark Materials on its list of the most influential novels br br br Christian opposition br br His Dark Materials has occasioned controversy primarily among some Christian groups br Cynthia Grenier in the Catholic Culture said In the world of Pullman God Himself the Authority is a merciless tyrant His Church is an instrument of oppression and true heroism consists of overthrowing both William A Donohue of the Catholic League described Pullman s trilogy as atheism for kids Pullman said of Donohue s call for a boycott Why don t we trust readers Oh it causes me to shake my head with sorrow that such nitwits could be loose in the world br In a November interview Pullman was asked to respond to the Catholic Herald calling his books the stuff of nightmares and worthy of the bonfire He replied My response to that was to ask the publishers to print it in the next book which they did I think it s comical it s just laughable The original remark in Catholic Herald which was there are numerous candidates that seem to me to be far more worthy of the bonfire than Harry Potter was written in the context of parents in South Carolina pressing their Board of Education to ban the Harry Potter books br Pullman expressed surprise over what he considered to be a relatively low level of criticism for His Dark Materials on religious grounds saying I ve been surprised by how little criticism I ve got Harry Potter s been taking all the flak Meanwhile I ve been flying under the radar saying things that are far more subversive than anything poor old Harry has said My books are about killing God Others support this interpretation arguing that the series while clearly anticlerical is also anti theological because the death of God is represented as a fundamentally unimportant question br Pullman found support from some other Christians most notably from Rowan Williams the former archbishop of Canterbury spiritual head of the Anglican Communion who argued that Pullman s attacks focus on the constraints and dangers of dogmatism and the use of religion to oppress not on Christianity itself Williams also recommended the His Dark Materials series of books for inclusion and discussion in Religious Education classes and stated that To see large school parties in the audience of the Pullman plays at the National Theatre is vastly encouraging Pullman and Williams took part in a National Theatre platform debate a few days later to discuss myth religious experience and its representation in the arts br br br Related works br br br Lyra s Oxford br br The novella Lyra s Oxford takes place two years after the timeline of The Amber Spyglass A

The filmmakers obscured the explicitly Biblical character of the Authority to avoid offending viewers Weitz declared that he would not do the same for the planned sequels Whereas The Golden Compass had to be introduced to the public carefully he said the religious themes in the second and third books can t be minimised without destroying the spirit of these books I will not be involved with any
