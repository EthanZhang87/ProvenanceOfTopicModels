Historical fantasy is a category of fantasy and genre of historical fiction that incorporates fantastic elements such as magic into a more realistic narrative There is much crossover with other subgenres of fantasy those classed as Arthurian Celtic or Dark Ages could just as easily be placed in historical fantasy Stories fitting this classification generally take place prior to the th century br Films of this genre may have plots set in biblical times or classical antiquity They often have plots based very loosely on mythology or legends of Greek Roman history or the surrounding cultures of the same era br br br Overview br Historical fantasy usually takes one of four common approaches br br Magic mythical creatures such as dragons or other supernatural elements such as magic rings co exist invisibly with the mundane world with the majority of people being unaware of it In this it has a close similarity to contemporary fantasy This commonly overlaps with the secret history trope Alternatively the author s narrative shows or implies that by the present day magic will have retreated from the world or been hidden to all but a few initiates so as to allow history to revert to the familiar version we know An example of this can be found in Lord Dunsany s The Charwoman s Shadow which takes place in Spain but which ends with the magician in it removing himself and all creatures of romance from the world thereby ending the Golden Age br It also can include an alternative history in which the past or present has been significantly changed when an actual historical event turned out differently br The story takes place in a secondary world with specific and recognizable parallels to a known place or places and a definite historical period rather than taking the geographic and historical mix and match favoured by other works of secondary world fantasy However many if not most works by fantasy authors derive ideas and inspiration from real events making the borders of this approach unclear br Historical fantasy may also be set in a fictional world which resembles a period from history but is not that actual history br All four approaches have overlapped in the subgenre of steampunk commonly associated with science fiction literature However not all steampunk fantasy belongs to the historical fantasy subgenre br br br Subgenres br br br Arabian fantasy br br After Antoine Galland s translation of One Thousand and One Nights became popular in Europe many writers wrote fantasy based on Galland s romantic image of the Middle East and North Africa Early examples included the satirical tales of Anthony Hamilton and Zadig by Voltaire English language work in the Arabian fantasy genre includes Rasselas by Samuel Johnson The Tales of the Genii by James Ridley Vathek by William Thomas Beckford George Meredith s The Shaving of Shagpat Khaled by F Marion Crawford and James Elroy Flecker s Hassan br In the late s interest in the subgenre revived with Hasan by Piers Anthony This was followed by several other novels reworking Arabian legend the metafictional The Arabian Nightmare by Robert Irwin Diana Wynne Jones children s novel Castle in the Air Tom Holt s humorous Djinn Rummy and Hilari Bell s Fall of a Kingdom br br br Celtic fantasy br Celtic fantasy has links to historical fantasy and Celtic historical fiction Celtic historical fantasy includes such works as Katharine Kerr s Deverry series or Teresa Edgerton s Green Lion trilogy These works are loosely based on ancient Celtic cultures The separate folklore of Ireland Wales and Scotland has sometimes been used indiscriminately sometimes with great effect as in Paul Hazel s Finnbranch trilogy Yearwood Undersea and Winterking other writers have distinguished between the three to use a single source br Notable works inspired by Irish mythology included James Stephens The Crock of Gold Lord Dunsany s The Curse of the Wise Woman Flann O Brien s humorous At Swim Two Birds Pat O Shea s The Hounds of the Morrigan and novels by Peter Tremayne Morgan Llywelyn and Gregory Frost br The Welsh tradition has been particularly influential which has to do with its connection to King Arthur and its collection in a single work the epic Mabinogion One influential retelling of this was the fantasy work of Evangeline Walton The Island of the Mighty The Children of Llyr The Song of Rhiannon and Prince of Annwn A notable amount of fiction has been written in the Welsh area of Celtic fantasy other notable authors of Welsh Celtic fantasy include Kenneth Morris John Cowper Powys Vaughan Wilkins Lloyd Alexander Alan Garner and Jenny Nimmo br Scottish Celtic fantasy is less common but James Hogg John Francis Campbell The Celtic Dragon Myth Fiona MacLeod William Sharp George Mackay Brown and Deborah Turner Harris all wrote material based on Scottish myths and legends br Fantasy based on the Breton folklore branch of Celtic mythology does not often appear in the English language However several noted writers have utilized such material Robert W Chambers The Demoiselle d Ys from The King in Yellow and A Merritt in Creep Shadow both drew on the Breton legend of the lost city of Ys while The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun by J R R Tolkien is a narrative poem based on the Breton legend of the Corrigan br br br Classical fantasy br Classical fantasy is a subgenre of historical fantasy based on the Greek and Roman myths Symbolism from classical mythology is enormously influential on Western culture but it was not until the th century that it was used in the context of literary fantasy Richard Garnett The Twilight of the Gods and Other Tales revised and John Kendrick Bangs Olympian Nights used the Greek myths for satirical purposes br th century writers who made extensive use of the subgenre included John Erksine who continued the satirical tradition of classical fantasy in such works as The Private Life of Helen of Troy and Venus the Lonely Goddess Eden Phillpotts used Greek myths to make philosophical points in such fantasies as Pan and the Twins and Circe s Island Jack Williamson s The Reign of Wizardry Unknown Worlds is an adventure story based on the legend of Theseus Several of Thomas Burnett Swann s novels draw on Greek and Roman myth including Day of the Minotaur The Firebrand by Marion Zimmer Bradley and Olympic Games by Leslie What are both classical fantasy tales with feminist undertones Guy Gavriel Kay who has made a career out of historical fantasy set his two novels in The Sarantine Mosaic series in a parallel world heavily mirroring Justinian I s Byzantium br br br Fantasy of manners br br Fantasy of manners aka mannerpunk is a subgenre that takes place within a strict elaborate and hierarchical social
