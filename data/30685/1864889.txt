Cosmology from Ancient Greek cosmos the universe the world and logia study of is a branch of physics and metaphysics dealing with the nature of the universe the cosmos The term cosmology was first used in English in in Thomas Blount s Glossographia and in taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff in Cosmologia Generalis Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological religious and esoteric literature and traditions of creation myths and eschatology In the science of astronomy cosmology is concerned with the study of the chronology of the universe br Physical cosmology is the study of the observable universe s origin its large scale structures and dynamics and the ultimate fate of the universe including the laws of science that govern these areas It is investigated by scientists including astronomers and physicists as well as philosophers such as metaphysicians philosophers of physics and philosophers of space and time Because of this shared scope with philosophy theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non scientific propositions and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be tested Physical cosmology is a sub branch of astronomy that is concerned with the universe as a whole Modern physical cosmology is dominated by the Big Bang Theory which attempts to bring together observational astronomy and particle physics more specifically a standard parameterization of the Big Bang with dark matter and dark energy known as the Lambda CDM model br Theoretical astrophysicist David N Spergel has described cosmology as a historical science because when we look out in space we look back in time due to the finite nature of the speed of light br br br Disciplines br br Physics and astrophysics have played central roles in shaping our understanding of the universe through scientific observation and experiment Physical cosmology was shaped through both mathematics and observation in an analysis of the whole universe The universe is generally understood to have begun with the Big Bang followed almost instantaneously by cosmic inflation an expansion of space from which the universe is thought to have emerged billion years ago Cosmogony studies the origin of the universe and cosmography maps the features of the universe br In Diderot s Encyclop die cosmology is broken down into uranology the science of the heavens aerology the science of the air geology the science of the continents and hydrology the science of waters br Metaphysical cosmology has also been described as the placing of humans in the universe in relationship to all other entities This is exemplified by Marcus Aurelius s observation that a man s place in that relationship He who does not know what the world is does not know where he is and he who does not know for what purpose the world exists does not know who he is nor what the world is br br br Discoveries br br br Physical cosmology br br Physical cosmology is the branch of physics and astrophysics that deals with the study of the physical origins and evolution of the universe It also includes the study of the nature of the universe on a large scale In its earliest form it was what is now known as celestial mechanics the study of the heavens Greek philosophers Aristarchus of Samos Aristotle and Ptolemy proposed different cosmological theories The geocentric Ptolemaic system was the prevailing theory until the th century when Nicolaus Copernicus and subsequently Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei proposed a heliocentric system This is one of the most famous examples of epistemological rupture in physical cosmology br Isaac Newton s Principia Mathematica published in was the first description of the law of universal gravitation It provided a physical mechanism for Kepler s laws and also allowed the anomalies in previous systems caused by gravitational interaction between the planets to be resolved A fundamental difference between Newton s cosmology and those preceding it was the Copernican principle that the bodies on Earth obey the same physical laws as all celestial bodies This was a crucial philosophical advance in physical cosmology br Modern scientific cosmology is widely considered to have begun in with Albert Einstein s publication of his final modification of general relativity in the paper Cosmological Considerations of the General Theory of Relativity although this paper was not widely available outside of Germany until the end of World War I General relativity prompted cosmogonists such as Willem de Sitter Karl Schwarzschild and Arthur Eddington to explore its astronomical ramifications which enhanced the ability of astronomers to study very distant objects Physicists began changing the assumption that the universe was static and unchanging In Alexander Friedmann introduced the idea of an expanding universe that contained moving matter br br In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology one long standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax the Great Debate to with early cosmologists such as Heber Curtis and Ernst pik determining that some nebulae seen in telescopes were separate galaxies far distant from our own While Heber Curtis argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes Mount Wilson astronomer Harlow Shapley championed the model of a cosmos made up of the Milky Way star system only This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the Great Debate on April at the meeting of the U S National Academy of Sciences in Washington D C The debate was resolved when Edwin Hubble detected Cepheid Variables in the Andromeda Galaxy in and Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way br Subsequent modelling of the universe explored the possibility that the cosmological constant introduced by Einstein in his paper may result in an expanding universe depending on its value Thus the Big Bang model was proposed by the Belgian priest Georges Lema tre in which was subsequently corroborated by Edwin Hubble s discovery of the redshift in and later by the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson in These findings were a first step to rule out some of many alternative cosmologies br Since around several dramatic advances in observational cosmology have transformed cosmology from a largely speculative science into a predictive science with precise agreement between theory and observation These advances include observations of the microwave background from the COBE WMAP and Planck satellites large new galaxy redshift surveys including dfGRS and SDSS and observations of distant supernovae and gravitational lensing These observations matched the predictions of the cosmic inflation theory a modified Big Bang theory and the specific version known as the Lambda CDM model This has led many to refer to modern times as the golden age of cosmology br In the BICEP collaboration claimed that they had detected the imprint of gravitational waves in the cosmic microwave background However this result was later found to be spurious the supposed evidence of gravitational waves was in fact due to interstellar dust br On December at the Planck meeting in Ferrara Italy astronomers reported that the universe is billion years old and composed of atomic matter dark matter and dark energy br br br Religious or mythological cosmology br br Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological religious and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology Creation myths are found in most religions and are typically split into five different classifications based on a system created by Mircea Eliade and his colleague Charles Long br br Types of Creation Myths based on similar motifs br Creation ex nihilo in which the creation is through the thought word dream or bodily secretions of a divine being br Earth diver creation in which a diver usually a bird or amphibian sent by a creator plunges to the seabed through a primordial ocean to bring up sand or mud which develops into a terrestrial world br Emergence myths in which progenitors pass through a series of worlds and metamorphoses until reaching the present world br Creation by the dismemberment of a primordial being br Creation by the splitting or ordering of a primordial unity such as the cracking of a cosmic egg or a bringing order from chaos br br br Philosophy br br Cosmology deals with the world as the totality of space time and all phenomena Historically it has had quite a broad scope and in many cases was found in religion Some questions about the Universe are beyond the scope of scientific inquiry but may still be interrogated through appeals to other philosophical approaches like dialectics Some questions that are included in extra scientific endeavors may include br br What is the origin of the universe What is its first cause if any Is its existence necessary see monism pantheism emanationism and creationism br What are the ultimate material components of the universe see mechanism dynamism hylomorphism atomism br What is the ultimate reason if any for the existence of the universe Does the cosmos have a purpose see teleology br Does the existence of consciousness have a role in the existence of reality How do we know what we know about the totality of the cosmos Does cosmological
