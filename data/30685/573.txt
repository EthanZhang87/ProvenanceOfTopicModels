Alchemy from Arabic al k miy from Ancient Greek khume a is an ancient branch of natural philosophy a philosophical and protoscientific tradition that was historically practised in China India the Muslim world and Europe In its Western form alchemy is first attested in a number of pseudepigraphical texts written in Greco Roman Egypt during the first few centuries AD br Alchemists attempted to purify mature and perfect certain materials Common aims were chrysopoeia the transmutation of base metals e g lead into noble metals particularly gold the creation of an elixir of immortality and the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to result from the alchemical magnum opus Great Work The concept of creating the philosophers stone was variously connected with all of these projects br Islamic and European alchemists developed a basic set of laboratory techniques theories and terms some of which are still in use today They did not abandon the Ancient Greek philosophical idea that everything is composed of four elements and they tended to guard their work in secrecy often making use of cyphers and cryptic symbolism In Europe the th century translations of medieval Islamic works on science and the rediscovery of Aristotelian philosophy gave birth to a flourishing tradition of Latin alchemy This late medieval tradition of alchemy would go on to play a significant role in the development of early modern science particularly chemistry and medicine br Modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects despite criticisms by scholars such as Eric J Holmyard and Marie Louise von Franz that they should be understood as complementary The former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry medicine and charlatanism and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred The latter interests historians of esotericism psychologists and some philosophers and spiritualists The subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts br br br Etymology br br The word alchemy comes from old French alquemie alkimie used in Medieval Latin as alchymia This name was itself adopted from the Arabic word al k miy The Arabic al k miy in turn was a borrowing of the Late Greek term kh me a also spelled khumeia and kh m a with al being the Arabic definite article the Together this association can be interpreted as the process of transmutation by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form Several etymologies have been proposed for the Greek term The first was proposed by Zosimos of Panopolis rd th centuries who derived it from the name of a book the Khemeu Hermann Diels argued in that it rather derived from used to describe metallic objects formed by casting br Others trace its roots to the Egyptian name k me hieroglyphic khmi meaning black earth which refers to the fertile and auriferous soil of the Nile valley as opposed to red desert sand According to the Egyptologist Wallis Budge the Arabic word al k miya actually means the Egyptian science borrowing from the Coptic word for Egypt k me or its equivalent in the Mediaeval Bohairic dialect of Coptic kh me This Coptic word derives from Demotic km itself from ancient Egyptian kmt The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour black Egypt was the black Land by contrast with the red Land the surrounding desert br br br History br Alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents These traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships One can distinguish at least three major strands which appear to be mostly independent at least in their earlier stages Chinese alchemy centered in China Indian alchemy centered on the Indian subcontinent and Western alchemy which occurred around the Mediterranean and whose center shifted over the millennia from Greco Roman Egypt to the Islamic world and finally medieval Europe Chinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoism and Indian alchemy with the Dharmic faiths In contrast Western alchemy developed its philosophical system mostly independent of but influenced by various Western religions It is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin or to what extent they influenced each other br br br Hellenistic Egypt br br The start of Western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and Hellenistic Egypt where the city of Alexandria was a center of alchemical knowledge and retained its pre eminence through most of the Greek and Roman periods Following the work of Andr Jean Festugi re modern scholars see alchemical practice in the Roman Empire as originating from the Egyptian goldsmith s art Greek philosophy and different religious traditions Tracing the origins of the alchemical art in Egypt is complicated by the pseudepigraphic nature of texts from the Greek alchemical corpus The treatises of Zosimos of Panopolis the earliest historically attested author fl c AD can help in situating the other authors Zosimus based his work on that of older alchemical authors such as Mary the Jewess Pseudo Democritus and Agathodaimon but very little is known about any of these authors The most complete of their works The Four Books of Pseudo Democritus were probably written in the first century AD br Recent scholarship tends to emphasize the testimony of Zosimus who traced the alchemical arts back to Egyptian metallurgical and ceremonial practices It has also been argued that early alchemical writers borrowed the vocabulary of Greek philosophical schools but did not implement any of its doctrines in a systematic way Zosimos of Panopolis wrote in the Final Abstinence also known as the Final Count Zosimos explains that the ancient practice of tinctures the technical Greek name for the alchemical arts had been taken over by certain demons who taught the art only to those who offered them sacrifices Since Zosimos also called the demons the guardians of places hoi kat t pon phoroi and those who offered them sacrifices priests hier a it is fairly clear that he was referring to the gods of Egypt and their priests While critical of the kind of alchemy he associated with the Egyptian priests and their followers Zosimos nonetheless saw the tradition s recent past as rooted in the rites of the Egyptian temples br Mythology Zosimos of Panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to Pharaonic Egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class though there is little to no evidence for his assertion Alchemical writers used Classical figures from Greek Roman and Egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation These included the pantheon of gods related to the Classical planets Isis Osiris Jason and many others br The central figure in the mythology of alchemy is Hermes Trismegistus or Thrice Great Hermes His name is derived from the god Thoth and his Greek counterpart Hermes Hermes and his caduceus or serpent staff were among alchemy s principal symbols According to Clement of Alexandria he wrote what were called the forty two books of Hermes covering all fields of knowledge The Hermetica of Thrice Great Hermes is generally understood to form the basis for Western alchemical philosophy and practice called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners These writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era br Technology The dawn of Western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy extending back to BC Many writings were lost when the Roman emperor Diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in Alexandria AD Few original Egyptian documents on alchemy have survived most notable among them the Stockholm papyrus and the Leyden papyrus X Dating from AD they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones cleaning and fabricating pearls and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver These writings lack the mystical philosophical elements of alchemy but do contain the works of Bolus of Mendes or Pseudo Democritus which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements Between the time of Bolus and Zosimos the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a Hermetic art br Philosophy Alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of Pythagoreanism Platonism Stoicism and Gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemy s character An important example of alchemy s roots in Greek philosophy originated by Empedocles and developed by Aristotle was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth air water and fire According to Aristotle each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed The four elements of the Greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter not quantitative as our modern elements are True alchemy never regarded earth air water and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present day sense of the word The four elements are simply the primary and most general qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form Later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept br Alchemy coexisted alongside emerging Christianity Lactantius believed Hermes Trismegistus had prophesied its birth St Augustine later affirmed this in the th and th centuries but also condemned Trismegistus for idolatry Examples of Pagan Christian and Jewish alchemists can be found during this period br Most of the Greco Roman alchemists preceding Zosimos are known only by pseudonyms such as Moses Isis Cleopatra Democritus and Ostanes Others authors such as Komarios and Chymes we only know through fragments of text After AD Greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors By the middle of the th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline It was at that time that Khalid Ibn Yazid sparked its migration from Alexandria to the Islamic world facilitating the translation and preservation of Greek alchemical texts in the th and th centuries br br br Byzantium br Greek alchemy was preserved in medieval Byzantine manuscripts after the fall of Egypt and yet historians have only relatively recently begun to pay attention to the study and development of Greek alchemy in the Byzantine period br br br India br br The nd millennium BC text Vedas describe a connection between eternal life and gold A considerable knowledge of metallurgy has been exhibited in a third century AD text called Arthashastra which provides ingredients of explosives Agniyoga and salts extracted from fertile soils and plant remains Yavakshara such as saltpetre nitre perfume making different qualities of perfumes are mentioned granulated refined Sugar Buddhist texts from the nd to th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold According to some scholars Greek alchemy may have influenced Indian alchemy but there are no hard evidences to back this claim br The th century Persian chemist and physician Ab Rayh n B r n who visited Gujarat as part of the court of Mahmud of Ghazni reported that they br br have a science similar to alchemy which is quite peculiar to them which in Sanskrit is called Ras yana and in Persian Rasav tam It means the art of obtaining manipulating Rasa nectar mercury and juice This art was restricted to certain operations metals drugs compounds and medicines many of which have mercury as their core element Its principles restored the health of those who were ill beyond hope and gave back youth to fading old age br The goals of alchemy in India included the creation of a divine body Sanskrit divya deham and immortality while still embodied Sanskrit j van mukti Sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur that are homologized with the semen of the god iva and the menstrual blood of the goddess Dev br Some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the Kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of Matsyendranath Other early writings are found in the Jaina medical treatise Kaly ak rakam of Ugr ditya written in South India in the early th century br Two famous early Indian alchemical authors were N g rjuna Siddha and Nityan tha Siddha N g rjuna Siddha was a Buddhist monk His book Rasendramangalam is an example of Indian alchemy and medicine Nityan tha Siddha wrote Rasaratn kara also a highly influential work In Sanskrit rasa translates to mercury and N g rjuna Siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold br Scholarship on Indian alchemy is in the publication of The Alchemical Body by David Gordon White br A modern bibliography on Indian alchemical studies has been written by White br The contents of Sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in G Jan Meulenbeld s History of Indian Medical Literature The discussion of these works in HIML gives a summary of the contents of each work their special features and where possible the evidence concerning their dating Chapter of HIML Various works on rasa stra and ratna stra or Various works on alchemy and gems gives brief details of a further six hundred and fifty five treatises In some cases Meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles br A great deal remains to be discovered about Indian alchemical literature The content of the Sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy br br br Islamic world br br After the fall of the Roman Empire the focus of alchemical development moved to the Islamic World Much more is known about Islamic alchemy because it was better documented indeed most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations The word alchemy itself was derived from the Arabic word al k miy The early Islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy Platonic and Aristotelian thought which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science continued to be assimilated during the late th and early th centuries through Syriac translations and scholarship br In the late ninth and early tenth centuries the Arabic works attributed to J bir ibn Hayy n Latinized as Geber or Geberus introduced a new approach to alchemy Paul Kraus who wrote the standard reference work on Jabir put it as follows br br To form an idea of the historical place of Jabir s alchemy and to tackle the problem of its sources it is advisable to compare it with what remains to us of the alchemical literature in the Greek language One knows in which miserable state this literature reached us Collected by Byzantine scientists from the tenth century the corpus of the Greek alchemists is a cluster of incoherent fragments going back to all the times since the third century until the end of the Middle Ages br The efforts of Berthelot and Ruelle to put a little order in this mass of literature led only to poor results and the later researchers among them in particular Mrs Hammer Jensen Tannery Lagercrantz von Lippmann Reitzenstein Ruska Bidez Festugi re and others could make clear only few points of detail br The study of the Greek alchemists is not very encouraging An even surface examination of the Greek texts shows that a very small part only was organized according to true experiments of laboratory even the supposedly technical writings in the state where we find them today are unintelligible nonsense which refuses any interpretation br br It is different with Jabir s alchemy The relatively clear description of the processes and the alchemical apparati the methodical classification of the substances mark an experimental spirit which is extremely far away from the weird and odd esotericism of the Greek texts The theory on which Jabir supports his operations is one of clearness and of an impressive unity More than with the other Arab authors one notes with him a balance between theoretical teaching and practical teaching between the ilm and the amal In vain one would seek in the Greek texts a work as systematic as that which is presented for example in the Book of Seventy br Islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism The most influential author in this regard was arguably Jabir Jabir s ultimate goal was Takwin the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory up to and including human life He analysed each Aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness coldness dryness and moistness According to Jabir in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior For example lead was externally cold and dry while gold was hot and moist Thus Jabir theorized by rearranging the qualities of one metal a different metal would result By this reasoning the search for the philosopher s stone was introduced to Western alchemy Jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substance s name in Arabic when treated with various transformations held correspondences to the element s physical properties br The elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with Jabir His original system consisted of seven elements which included the five classical elements aether air earth fire and water in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals sulphur the stone which burns which characterized the principle of combustibility and mercury which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties Shortly thereafter this evolved into eight elements with the Arabic concept of the three metallic principles sulphur giving flammability or combustion mercury giving volatility and stability and salt giving solidity The atomic theory of corpuscularianism where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles also has its origins in the work of Jabir br From the th to th centuries alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical Muslim chemists including Alkindus Ab al Rayh n al B r n Avicenna and Ibn Khaldun In particular they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals br From the th century onwards many materials and practices originally belonging to Indian alchemy Rasayana were assimilated in the Persian texts written by Muslim scholars br br br East Asia br br Researchers have found evidence that Chinese alchemists and philosophers discovered complex mathematical phenomena that were shared with Arab alchemists during the medieval period Discovered in BC China the magic square of three was propagated to followers of Ab M s J bir ibn ayy n at some point over the proceeding several hundred years Other commonalities shared between the two alchemical schools of thought include discrete naming for ingredients and heavy influence from the natural elements The silk road provided a clear path for the exchange of goods ideas ingredients religion and many other aspects of life with which alchemy is intertwined br br Whereas European alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals Chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine The philosopher s stone of European alchemists can be compared to the Grand Elixir of Immortality sought by Chinese alchemists In the hermetic view these two goals were not unconnected and the philosopher s stone was often equated with the universal panacea therefore the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears br As early as AD Ge Hong documented the use of metals minerals and elixirs in early Chinese medicine Hong identified three ancient Chinese documents titled Scripture of Great Clarity Scripture of the Nine Elixirs and Scripture of the Golden Liquor as texts containing fundamental alchemical information He also described alchemy along with meditation as the sole spiritual practices that could allow one to gain immortality or to transcend In his work Inner Chapters of the Book of the Master Who Embraces Spontaneous Nature AD Hong argued that alchemical solutions such as elixirs were preferable to traditional medicinal treatment due to the spiritual protection they could provide In the centuries following Ge Hong s death the emphasis placed on alchemy as a spiritual practice among Chinese Daoists was reduced In AD Tao Hongjing refuted Hong s statement that alchemy is as important a spiritual practice as Shangqing meditation While Hongjing did not deny the power of alchemical elixirs to grant immortality or provide divine protection he ultimately found the Scripture of the Nine Elixirs to be ambiguous and spiritually unfulfilling aiming to implement more accessible practising techniques br In the early s Neidan also known as internal alchemy was adopted by Daoists as a new form of alchemy Neidan emphasized appeasing the inner gods that inhabit the human body by practising alchemy with compounds found in the body rather than the mixing of natural resources that was emphasized in early Dao alchemy For example saliva was often considered nourishment for the inner gods and did not require any conscious alchemical reaction to produce The inner gods were not thought of as physical presences occupying each person but rather a collection of deities that are each said to represent and protect a specific body part or region Although those who practised Neidan prioritized meditation over external alchemical strategies many of the same elixirs and constituents from previous Daoist alchemical schools of thought continued to be utilized in tandem with meditation Eternal life remained a consideration for Neidan alchemists as it was believed that one would become immortal if an inner god were to be immortalized within them through spiritual fulfilment br Black powder may have been an important invention of Chinese alchemists It is said that the Chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a potion for eternal life Described in th century texts and used in fireworks in China by the th century it was used in cannons by From China the use of gunpowder spread to Japan the Mongols the Muslim world and Europe Gunpowder was used by the Mongols against the Hungarians in and in Europe by the th century br Chinese alchemy was closely connected to Taoist forms of traditional Chinese medicine such as Acupuncture and Moxibustion In the early Song dynasty followers of this Taoist idea chiefly the elite and upper class would ingest mercuric sulfide which though tolerable in low levels led many to suicide Thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the Taoist heavens the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favour of external sources the aforementioned Tai Chi Chuan mastering of the qi etc Chinese alchemy was introduced to the West by Obed Simon Johnson br br br Medieval Europe br br The introduction of alchemy to Latin Europe may be dated to February with the completion of Robert of Chester s translation of the Liber de compositione alchemiae Book on the Composition of Alchemy from an Arabic work attributed to Khalid ibn Yazid Although European craftsmen and technicians pre existed Robert notes in his preface that alchemy here still referring to the elixir rather than to the art itself was unknown in Latin Europe at the time of his writing The translation of Arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in th century Toledo Spain through contributors like Gerard of Cremona and Adelard of Bath Translations of the time included the Turba Philosophorum and the works of Avicenna and Muhammad ibn Zakariya al Razi These brought with them many new words to the European vocabulary for which there was no previous Latin equivalent Alcohol carboy elixir and athanor are examples br Meanwhile theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism thereby priming Europe for the influx of alchemical thought The th century St Anselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a Christian context In the early th century Peter Abelard followed Anselm s work laying down the foundation for acceptance of Aristotelian thought before the first works of Aristotle had reached the West In the early th century Robert Grosseteste used Abelard s methods of analysis and added the use of observation experimentation and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations Grosseteste also did much work to reconcile Platonic and Aristotelian thinking br Through much of the th and th centuries alchemical knowledge in Europe remained centered on translations and new Latin contributions were not made The efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists In the th century Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon were the most notable of these their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in Aristotelian terms Albertus Magnus a Dominican friar is known to have written works such as the Book of Minerals where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like Hermes Trismegistus pseudo Democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time Albertus critically compared these to the writings of Aristotle and Avicenna where they concerned the transmutation of metals From the time shortly after his death through to the th century more than alchemical tracts were misattributed to him a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist Likewise alchemical texts have been attributed to Albert s student Thomas Aquinas br Roger Bacon a Franciscan friar who wrote on a wide variety of topics including optics comparative linguistics and medicine composed his Great Work Latin Opus Majus for Pope Clement IV as part of a project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time While alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemy s connections to soteriology and Christian theology Bacon s writings integrated morality salvation alchemy and the prolongation of life His correspondence with Clement highlighted this noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy Like the Greeks before him Bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres He noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of Aristotle the natural philosophers and all Latin writers of his time The practical confirmed the theoretical and Bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine In later European legend he became an archmage In particular along with Albertus Magnus he was credited with the forging of a brazen head capable of answering its owner s questions br Soon after Bacon the influential work of Pseudo Geber sometimes identified as Paul of Taranto appeared His Summa Perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods It was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur mercury theory and the unusual clarity with which they were described By the end of the th century alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief Adepts believed in the macrocosm microcosm theories of Hermes that is to say they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body for example if one could learn the secret of purifying gold one could use the technique to purify the human soul They believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated Finally the alchemists practised their art they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated Their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that man s soul was divided within himself after the fall of Adam By purifying the two parts of man s soul man could be reunited with God br In the th century alchemy became more accessible to Europeans outside the confines of Latin speaking churchmen and scholars Alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves Dante Piers Plowman and Chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars Pope John XXII s edict Spondent quas non exhibent forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo alchemists Roman Catholic Inquisitor General Nicholas Eymerich s Directorium Inquisitorum written in associated alchemy with the performance of demonic rituals which Eymerich differentiated from magic performed in accordance with scripture This did not however lead to any change in the Inquisition s monitoring or prosecution of alchemists In Henry IV of England banned the practice of multiplying metals although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically and a number were granted by Henry VI and Edward IV These critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy which continued with an increasingly Christian tone The th century saw the Christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of Petrus Bonus John of Rupescissa and in works written in the name of Raymond Lull and Arnold of Villanova br br Nicolas Flamel is a well known alchemist to the point where he had many pseudepigraphic imitators Although the historical Flamel existed the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in br A common idea in European alchemy in the medieval era was a metaphysical Homeric chain of wise men that link ed heaven and earth that included ancient pagan philosophers and other important historical figures br br br Renaissance and early modern Europe br br During the Renaissance Hermetic and Platonic foundations were restored to European alchemy The dawn of medical pharmaceutical occult and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed br In the late th century Marsilio Ficino translated the Corpus Hermeticum and the works of Plato into Latin These were previously unavailable to Europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that Bacon had declared absent Renaissance Humanism and Renaissance Neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel br Esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult Hermeticism fusing it with magic astrology and Christian cabala A key figure in this development was German Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa who received his Hermetic education in Italy in the schools of the humanists In his De Occulta Philosophia he attempted to merge Kabbalah Hermeticism and alchemy He was instrumental in spreading this new blend of Hermeticism outside the borders of Italy br Paracelsus Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim cast alchemy into a new form rejecting some of Agrippa s occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia Paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote Many have said of Alchemy that it is for the making of gold and silver For me such is not the aim but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines br His hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and Nature the macrocosm He took an approach different from those before him using this analogy not in the manner of soul purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them Iatrochemistry refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by Paracelsus br John Dee July December followed Agrippa s occult tradition Although better known for angel summoning divination and his role as astrologer cryptographer and consultant to Queen Elizabeth I Dee s alchemical Monas Hieroglyphica written in was his most popular and influential work His writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the Hermetic axiom As above so below During the th century a short lived supernatural interpretation of alchemy became popular including support by fellows of the Royal Society Robert Boyle and Elias Ashmole Proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosopher s stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels br Entrepreneurial opportunities were common for the alchemists of Renaissance Europe Alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining medical services and the production of chemicals medicines metals and gemstones Rudolf II Holy Roman Emperor in the late th century famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in Prague including Dee and his associate Edward Kelley King James IV of Scotland Julius Duke of Brunswick L neburg Henry V Duke of Brunswick L neburg Augustus Elector of Saxony Julius Echter von Mespelbrunn and Maurice Landgrave of Hesse Kassel all contracted alchemists John s son Arthur Dee worked as a court physician to Michael I of Russia and Charles I of England but also compiled the alchemical book Fasciculus Chemicus br br Although most of these appointments were legitimate the trend of pseudo alchemical fraud continued through the Renaissance Betr ger would use sleight of hand or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage Legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as Michael Maier and Heinrich Khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations distinguishing themselves from the con artists False alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud br The terms chemia and alchemia were used as synonyms in the early modern period and the differences between alchemy chemistry and small scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day There were important overlaps between practitioners and trying to classify them into alchemists chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic For example Tycho Brahe an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations had a laboratory built at his Uraniborg observatory research institute Michael Sendivogius Micha S dziw j a Polish alchemist philosopher medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around Sendivogious taught his technique to Cornelius Drebbel who in applied this in a submarine Isaac Newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy see Isaac Newton s occult studies than he did to either optics or physics Other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include Robert Boyle and Jan Baptist van Helmont Their Hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science br br br Later modern period br br The decline of European alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for ancient wisdom Although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the th century alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years and in fact may have reached its peak in the th century As late as James Price claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold Early modern European alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories practices and purposes Scholastic and anti Aristotelian Paracelsian and anti Paracelsian Hermetic Neoplatonic mechanistic vitalistic and more plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof br Robert Boyle pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations He assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data Boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out the wind characteristics the position of the Sun and Moon and the barometer reading all just in case they proved to be relevant This approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the th and th centuries based on revolutionary discoveries and ideas of Lavoisier and John Dalton br Beginning around a rigid distinction began to be drawn for the first time between alchemy and chemistry By the s alchemy was now restricted to the realm of gold making leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud In order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure to which alchemy was being subjected academic writers during the th century scientific Enlightenment attempted to divorce and separate the new chemistry from the old practices of alchemy This move was mostly successful and the consequences of this continued into the th th and st centuries br During the occult revival of the early th century alchemy received new attention as an occult science The esoteric or occultist school that arose during the th century held the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense less than as a practical tradition or protoscience This interpretation claimed that the obscure language of the alchemical texts which th century practitioners were not always able to decipher were an allegorical guise for spiritual moral or mystical processes br Two seminal figures during this period were Mary Anne Atwood and Ethan Allen Hitchcock who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy Both rebuffed the growing successes of chemistry developing a completely esoteric view of alchemy Atwood wrote No modern art or chemistry notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims has any thing in common with Alchemy Atwood s work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including Eliphas Levi Arthur Edward Waite and Rudolf Steiner Hitchcock in his Remarks Upon Alchymists attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state In Baron Carl Reichenbach published his studies on Odic force a concept with some similarities to alchemy but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion br In Louis Cattiaux published the Message Retrouv a work that was at once philosophical mystical and highly influenced by alchemy In his lineage many researchers including Emmanuel and Charles d Hooghvorst are updating alchemical studies in France and Belgium br br br Women br Several women appear in the earliest history of alchemy Michael Maier names four women who were able to make the philosophers stone Mary the Jewess Cleopatra the Alchemist Medera and Taphnutia Zosimos sister Theosebia later known as Euthica the Arab and Isis the Prophetess also played roles in early alchemical texts br The first alchemist whose name we know was Mary the Jewess c A D Early sources claim that Mary or Maria devised a number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry Her best known advances were in heating and distillation processes The laboratory water bath known eponymously especially in France as the bain marie is said to have been invented or at least improved by her Essentially a double boiler it was and is used in chemistry for processes that required gentle heating The tribikos a modified distillation apparatus and the kerotakis a more intricate apparatus used especially for sublimations are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her Although we have no writing from Mary herself she is known from the early fourth century writings of Zosimos of Panopolis After the Greco Roman period women s names appear less frequently in alchemical literature br Towards the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of the Renaissance due to the emergence of print women were able to access the alchemical knowledge from texts of the preceding centuries Caterina Sforza the Countess of Forl and Lady of Imola is one of the few confirmed female alchemists after Mary the Jewess As she owned an apothecary she would practice science and conduct experiments in her botanic gardens and laboratories Being knowledgeable in alchemy and pharmacology she recorded all of her alchemical ventures in a manuscript named Experimenti Experiments The manuscript contained more than four hundred recipes covering alchemy as well as cosmetics and medicine One of these recipes was for the water of talc Talc which makes up talcum powder is a mineral which when combined with water and distilled was said to produce a solution which yielded many benefits These supposed benefits included turning silver to gold and rejuvenation When combined with white wine its powder form could be ingested to counteract poison Furthermore if that powder was mixed and drunk with white wine it was said to be a source of protection from any poison sickness or plague Other recipes were for making hair dyes lotions lip colours There was also information on how to treat a variety of ailments from fevers and coughs to epilepsy and cancer In addition there were instructions on producing the quintessence or aether an elixir which was believed to be able to heal all sicknesses defend against diseases and perpetuate youthfulness She also wrote about creating the illustrious philosophers stone br Some women known for their interest in alchemy were Catherine de Medici the Queen of France and Marie de Medici the following Queen of France who carried out experiments in her personal laboratory Also Isabella d Este the Marchioness of Mantua made perfumes herself to serve as gifts Due to the proliferation in alchemical literature of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works however it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women This contributed to a broader pattern in which male authors credited prominent noblewomen for beauty products with the purpose of appealing to a female audience For example in Ricettario galante Gallant Recipe Book the distillation of lemons and roses was attributed to Elisabetta Gonzaga the duchess of Urbino In the same book Isabella d Aragona the daughter of Alfonso II of Naples is accredited for recipes involving alum and mercury Ippolita Maria Sforza is even referred to in an anonymous manuscript about a hand lotion created with rose powder and crushed bones br As the sixteenth century went on scientific culture flourished and people began collecting secrets During this period secrets referred to experiments and the most coveted ones were not those which were bizarre but the ones which had been proven to yield the desired outcome In this period the only book of secrets ascribed to a woman was I secreti della signora Isabella Cortese The Secrets of Signora Isabella Cortese This book contained information on how to turn base metals into gold medicine and cosmetics However it is rumoured that a man Girolamo Ruscelli was the real author and only used a female voice to attract female readers br In the nineteenth century Mary Anne Atwood s A Suggestive Inquiry into the Hermetic Mystery marked the return of women during the occult revival br br br Modern historical research br The history of alchemy has become a recognized subject of academic study As the language of the alchemists is analysed historians are becoming more aware of the connections between that discipline and other facets of Western cultural history such as the evolution of science and philosophy the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities kabbalism spiritualism Rosicrucianism and other mystic movements Institutions involved in this research include The Chymistry of Isaac Newton project at Indiana University the University of Exeter Centre for the Study of Esotericism EXESESO the European Society for the Study of Western Esotericism ESSWE and the University of Amsterdam s Sub department for the History of Hermetic Philosophy and Related Currents A large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica in Amsterdam br Journals which publish regularly on the topic of Alchemy include Ambix published by the Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry and Isis published by the History of Science Society br br br Core concepts br br Western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born Concepts were imported from Neoplatonism and earlier Greek cosmology As such the classical elements appear in alchemical writings as do the seven classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity Similarly the gods of the Roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature The concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are central to the theory of the philosopher s stone br br br Magnum opus br br The Great Work of Alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colours br br nigredo a blackening or melanosis br albedo a whitening or leucosis br citrinitas a yellowing or xanthosis br rubedo a reddening purpling or iosis br br br Modernity br Due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature and the th century diffusion of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry the general understanding of alchemy in the th and th centuries was influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations Those focusing on the exoteric such as historians of science Lawrence M Principe and William R Newman have interpreted the Decknamen or code words of alchemy as physical substances These scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts At the opposite end of the spectrum focusing on the esoteric scholars such as Florin George C lian and Anna Marie Roos who question the reading of Principe and Newman interpret these same Decknamen as spiritual religious or psychological concepts br New interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated sometimes merging in concepts from New Age or radical environmentalism movements Groups like the Rosicrucians and Freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism Since the Victorian revival of alchemy occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice involving the self transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances which has contributed to a merger of magic and alchemy in popular thought br br br Esoteric interpretations of historical texts br In the eyes of a variety of modern esoteric and Neo Hermetic practitioners alchemy is primarily spiritual In this interpretation transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation purification and perfection br According to this view early alchemists such as Zosimos of Panopolis c AD highlighted the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul This approach is held to have continued in the Middle Ages as metaphysical aspects substances physical states and material processes are supposed to have been used as metaphors for spiritual entities spiritual states and ultimately transformation In this sense the literal meanings of Alchemical Formulas hid a spiritual philosophy In the Neo Hermeticist interpretation both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea are held to symbolize evolution from an imperfect diseased corruptible and ephemeral state toward a perfect healthy incorruptible and everlasting state so the philosopher s stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible Applied to the alchemist the twin goal symbolized their evolution from ignorance to enlightenment and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal In texts that are believed to have been written according to this view the cryptic alchemical symbols diagrams and textual imagery of late alchemical works are supposed to contain multiple layers of meanings allegories and references to other equally cryptic works which must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning br In his Alchemical Catechism Th odore Henri de Tschudi suggested that the usage of the metals was symbolic br br br Psychology br Alchemical symbolism has been important in analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung Jung was initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images but after being given a copy of The Secret of the Golden Flower a Chinese alchemical text translated by his friend Richard Wilhelm he discovered a direct correlation or parallel between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner symbolic images coming up in his patients dreams visions or fantasies He observed these alchemical images occurring during the psychic process of transformation a process that Jung called individuation Specifically he regarded the conjuring up of images of gold or Lapis as symbolic expressions of the origin and goal of this process of individuation Together with his alchemical mystica soror mystical sister Jungian Swiss analyst Marie Louise von Franz Jung began collecting old alchemical texts compiled a lexicon of key phrases with cross references and pored over them The volumes of work he wrote shed new light onto understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemy s popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites are brought into contact and inner and outer spirit and matter are reunited in the hieros gamos or divine marriage His writings are influential in general psychology but especially to those who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces archetypes that comprise all psychic life br Both von Franz and Jung have contributed significantly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture Among the volumes Jung wrote on alchemy his magnum opus is Volume of his Collected Works Mysterium Coniunctionis br br br Literature br br Alchemy has had a long standing relationship with art seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment Literary alchemy appears throughout the history of English literature from Shakespeare to J K Rowling and also the popular Japanese manga Fullmetal Alchemist Here characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus In the th century Chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of the late Sir Terry Pratchett Another literary work taking inspiration from the alchemical tradition is the novel The Alchemist by Brazilian writer Paulo Coelho br Visual artists have had a similar relationship with alchemy While some used it as a source of satire others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work Music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers In the last hundred years alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction film television novels comics and video games br br br Science br br One goal of alchemy the transmutation of base substances into gold is now known to be impossible by means of traditional chemistry but possible by other physical means Although not financially worthwhile gold was synthesized in particle accelerators as early as br br br See also br br br Notes br br br br br br Citations br br br Sources used br
