Contemporary fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy set in the present day It is perhaps most popular for its subgenres Occult detective fiction urban fantasy Low Fantasy Supernatural Fiction and Paranormal fiction Several authors note that in contemporary fantasy magical or fantastic elements are separate or secret from the mundane world br br The term is used to describe stories set in the putative real world often referred to as consensus reality in contemporary times in which magic and magical creatures exist but are not commonly seen or understood as such either living in the interstices of our world or leaking over from alternate worlds br Frances Sinclair determining what to call fantasy set in our known world contrasts contemporary fantasy with magical realism She notes that in contemporary fantasy magical elements are often kept secret from most people and notes the amount of young adult fantasy in the subgenre In contrast Sinclair points out that in magical realism the impossible can occur without comment and the relationship between reader and narrator may be stronger br Brian Stableford attempts to narrowly define the genre excluding portal fantasy and fantasy in which the magical entity is a blatant anomaly He arrives at a definition of fantasy set in the mundane world often including an elaborate secret history He notes that much contemporary fantasy is set in rural settings but also notes the subgenre of urban fantasy and that both children s fiction and literary fiction often fall within this genre br The Encyclopedia of Fantasy similarly suggests that the mundane and fantastic are contrasted within the genre The Encyclopedia s definition includes portal fantasy in which transition between the two realms occurs regularly as well as several other subgenres it cites Peter S Beagle s Lila the Werewolf as a classic of the type It also notes that in many contemporary fantasies the fantastic colonizes the mundane home Greg Bechtel agrees with the Encyclopedia saying the sub genre explicitly depicts the collision of the contemporary world with a world of magic and spirits He notes the distinction between this genre and magical realism crediting Greer Watson but says that there can be overlap br Grzegorz Trebicki describes contemporary fantasy works set in our primary world in which the textual reality has been enriched by various fantastical elements usually borrowed from particular mythologies or folk traditions He says that such works are usually driven by genre conventions other than mythical archetypes br The term has also been equated with Paranormal Fantasy due to the frequency of paranormal characters werewolves vampires wizards fairies etc br br Camille Bacon Smith uses the term to describe fantasy stories set in the time they were written and provides H P Lovecraft and Fritz Leiber s novel Conjure Wife as examples She states that contemporary fantasy belongs to the Gothic tradition of Bram Stoker s Dracula and Poe s The Fall of the House of Usher noting also that contemporary fantasy has been a part of the genre since its beginning She notes that the genre was less popular by the s considering it supplanted by New Wave and Celtic Twilight books Bacon Smith credits Terri Windling s introduction of Borderland as a key event in improving interest in the genre also noting the earlier influence of Anne Rice s Interview With The Vampire which she says has a contemporary background br br In his preface to That Hideous Strength one of the earlier works falling within this subgenre C S Lewis explained why when writing a tale about magicians devils pantomime animals and planetary angels he chose to start it with a detailed depiction of narrow minded academic politics at a provincial English university and the schemes of crooked real estate developers br br I am following the traditional fairy tale We do not always notice its method because the cottages castles woodcutters and petty kings with which a fairy tale opens have become for us as remote as the witches and ogres to which it proceeds But they were not remote at all to the men who first made and enjoyed the tales br The same is true for many later works in the genre which often begin with a seemingly normal scene of modern daily life to then disclose supernatural and magical beings and events hidden behind the scenes br In an analysis of religion in modern fantasy Sylvia Kelso notes a market shift from high fantasy toward contemporary fantasy also explaining that paranormal subgenres have branched from contemporary fantasy especially ones centered on vampires and werewolves Kelso notes that contemporary fantasy is more willing to draw on religious themes than high fantasy This has been influenced by its openness to vampires and other traditionally evil supernatural beings which encourages writers to use Christianity to create villains such as demons However other books and series draw on other religions and traditions br br br Novels in which modern characters travel into other worlds and all the magical action takes place there except for the portal required to transport them are not considered contemporary fantasy Also contemporary fantasy is generally distinguished from horror fiction that mixes contemporary settings and fantastic elements by the overall tone emphasizing joy or wonder rather than fear or dread br The contemporary fantasy and low fantasy genres can overlap as both are set in the real world There are differences however Low fantasies are set in the real world but not necessarily in the modern age in which case they would not be contemporary fantasy br There is a considerable overlap between contemporary fantasy and urban fantasy br br Examples are grouped by author ordered by initial
