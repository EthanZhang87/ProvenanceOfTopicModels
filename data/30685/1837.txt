As a literary device or artistic form an allegory is a narrative or visual representation in which a character place or event can be interpreted to represent a meaning with moral or political significance Authors have used allegory throughout history in all forms of art to illustrate or convey complex ideas and concepts in ways that are comprehensible or striking to its viewers readers or listeners br Writers and speakers typically use allegories to convey semi hidden or complex meanings through symbolic figures actions imagery or events which together create the moral spiritual or political meaning the author wishes to convey Many allegories use personification of abstract concepts br br br Etymology br br First attested in English in the word allegory comes from Latin allegoria the latinisation of the Greek allegor a veiled language figurative literally speaking about something else which in turn comes from allos another different and agoreuo to harangue to speak in the assembly which originates from agora assembly br br br Types br Northrop Frye discussed what he termed a continuum of allegory a spectrum that ranges from what he termed the naive allegory of the likes of The Faerie Queene to the more private allegories of modern paradox literature br In this perspective the characters in a naive allegory are not fully three dimensional for each aspect of their individual personalities and of the events that befall them embodies some moral quality or other abstraction the author has selected the allegory first and the details merely flesh it out br br br Classical allegory br The origins of allegory can be traced at least back to Homer in his quasi allegorical use of personifications of e g Terror Deimos and Fear Phobos at Il f The title of first allegorist however is usually awarded to whoever was the earliest to put forth allegorical interpretations of Homer This approach leads to two possible answers Theagenes of Rhegium whom Porphyry calls the first allegorist Porph Quaest Hom Schrad or Pherecydes of Syros both of whom are presumed to be active in the th century B C E though Pherecydes is earlier and as he is often presumed to be the first writer of prose The debate is complex since it demands we observe the distinction between two often conflated uses of the Greek verb all gore n which can mean both to speak allegorically and to interpret allegorically br In the case of interpreting allegorically Theagenes appears to be our earliest example Presumably in response to proto philosophical moral critiques of Homer e g Xenophanes fr Diels Kranz Theagenes proposed symbolic interpretations whereby the Gods of the Iliad actually stood for physical elements So Hephestus represents Fire for instance for which see fr A in Diels Kranz Some scholars however argue that Pherecydes cosmogonic writings anticipated Theagenes allegorical work illustrated especially by his early placement of Time Chronos in his genealogy of the gods which is thought to be a reinterpretation of the titan Kronos from more traditional genealogies br In classical literature two of the best known allegories are the Cave in Plato s The Republic Book VII and the story of the stomach and its members in the speech of Menenius Agrippa Livy ii br Among the best known examples of allegory Plato s Allegory of the Cave forms a part of his larger work The Republic In this allegory Plato describes a group of people who have lived chained in a cave all of their lives facing a blank wall a b The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them and begin to ascribe forms to these shadows using language to identify their world c a According to the allegory the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality until one of them finds his way into the outside world where he sees the actual objects that produced the shadows He tries to tell the people in the cave of his discovery but they do not believe him and vehemently resist his efforts to free them so they can see for themselves e a This allegory is on a basic level about a philosopher who upon finding greater knowledge outside the cave of human understanding seeks to share it as is his duty and the foolishness of those who would ignore him because they think themselves educated enough br In Late Antiquity Martianus Capella organized all the information a fifth century upper class male needed to know into an allegory of the wedding of Mercury and Philologia with the seven liberal arts the young man needed to know as guests Also the Neoplatonic philosophy developed a type of allegorical reading of Homer and Plato br br br Biblical allegory br Other early allegories are found in the Hebrew Bible such as the extended metaphor in Psalm of the Vine and its impressive spread and growth representing Israel s conquest and peopling of the Promised Land Also allegorical is Ezekiel and wherein the capture of that same vine by the mighty Eagle represents Israel s exile to Babylon br Allegorical interpretation of the Bible was a common early Christian practice and continues For example the recently re discovered Fourth Commentary on the Gospels by Fortunatianus of Aquileia has a comment by its English translator The principal characteristic of Fortunatianus exegesis is a figurative approach relying on a set of concepts associated with key terms in order to create an allegorical decoding of the text br br br Medieval allegory br br Allegory has an ability to freeze the temporality of a story while infusing it with a spiritual context Mediaeval thinking accepted allegory as having a reality underlying any rhetorical or fictional uses The allegory was as true as the facts of surface appearances Thus the Papal Bull Unam Sanctam presents themes of the unity of Christendom with the pope as its head in which the allegorical details of the metaphors are adduced as facts on which is based a demonstration with the vocabulary of logic Therefore of this one and only Church there is one body and one head not two heads as if it were a monster If then the Greeks or others say that they were not committed to the care of Peter and his successors they necessarily confess that they are not of the sheep of Christ This text also demonstrates the frequent use of allegory in religious texts during the Mediaeval Period following the tradition and example of the Bible br In the late th century the enigmatic Hypnerotomachia with its elaborate woodcut illustrations shows the influence of themed pageants and masques on contemporary allegorical representation as humanist dialectic conveyed them br The denial of medieval allegory as found in the th century works of Hugh of St Victor and Edward Topsell s Historie of Foure footed Beastes London and its replacement in the study of nature with methods of categorisation and mathematics by such figures as naturalist John Ray and the astronomer Galileo is thought to mark the beginnings of early modern science br br br Modern allegory br Since meaningful stories are nearly always applicable to larger issues allegories may be read into many stories which the author may not have recognized This is allegoresis or the act of reading a story as an allegory Examples of allegory in popular culture that may or may not have been intended include the works of Bertolt Brecht and even some works of science fiction and fantasy such as The Chronicles of Narnia by C S Lewis br The story of the apple falling onto Isaac Newton s head is another famous allegory It simplified the idea of gravity by depicting a simple way it was supposedly discovered It also made the scientific revelation well known by condensing the theory into a short tale br br br Poetry and fiction br br While allegoresis may make discovery of allegory in any work not every resonant work of modern fiction is allegorical and some are clearly not intended to be viewed this way According to Henry Littlefield s article L Frank Baum s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz may be readily understood as a plot driven fantasy narrative in an extended fable with talking animals and broadly sketched characters intended to discuss the politics of the time Yet George MacDonald emphasized in that A fairy tale is not an allegory br J R R Tolkien s The Lord of the Rings is another example of a well known work mistakenly perceived as allegorical as the author himself once stated I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence I much prefer history true or feigned with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers I think that many confuse applicability with allegory but one resides in the freedom of the reader and the other in the purposed domination of the author br Tolkien specifically resented the suggestion that the book s One Ring which gives overwhelming power to those possessing it was intended as an allegory of nuclear weapons He noted that had that been his intention the book would not have ended with the Ring being destroyed but rather with an arms race in which various powers would try to obtain such a Ring for themselves Then Tolkien went on to outline an alternative plot for Lord of The Rings as it would have been written had such an allegory been intended and which would have made the book into a dystopia While all this does not mean Tolkien s works may not be treated as having allegorical themes especially when reinterpreted through postmodern sensibilities it at least suggests that none were conscious in his writings This further reinforces the idea of forced allegoresis as allegory is often a matter of interpretation and only sometimes of original artistic intention br Like allegorical stories allegorical poetry has two meanings a literal meaning and a symbolic meaning br Some unique specimens of allegory can be found in the following works br br Edmund Spenser The Faerie Queene The several knights in the poem actually stand for several virtues br William Shakespeare The Tempest an allegory of the civilisation barbarism binary as it pertains to colonialism br John Bunyan The Pilgrim s Progress The journey of the protagonists Christian and Evangelist symbolises the ascension of the soul from earth to Heaven br Nathaniel Hawthorne Young Goodman Brown The Devil s Staff symbolises defiance of God The characters names such as Goodman and Faith ironically serve as paradox in the conclusion of the story br Nathaniel Hawthorne The Scarlet Letter The letter represents self reliance from America s Puritan and conformity br George Orwell Animal Farm The pigs stand for political figures of the Russian Revolution br L szl Krasznahorkai The Melancholy of Resistance and the film Werckmeister Harmonies It uses a circus to describe an occupying dysfunctional government br Edgar Allan Poe The Masque of the Red Death The story can be read as an allegory for humans inability to escape death br Arthur Miller The Crucible The Salem witch trials are thought to be an allegory for McCarthyism and the blacklisting of Communists in the United States of America br Shel Silverstein The Giving Tree The book has been described as an allegory about relationships between parents and children between romantic partners or between humans and the environment br br br Art br Some elaborate and successful specimens of allegory are to be found in the following works arranged in approximate chronological order br br Ambrogio
