Theurgy from Greek theourg a also known as divine magic is one of two major branches of the magical arts the other being practical magic or thaumaturgy Theurgy describes the ritual practices associated with the invocation or evocation of the presence of one or more deities especially with the goal of achieving henosis uniting with the divine and perfecting oneself br br br Definitions br Proclus c theurgy is a power higher than all human wisdom embracing the blessings of divination the purifying powers of initiation and in a word all the operations of divine possession br Keith Thomas Spiritual magic or theurgy was based on the idea that one could reach God in an ascent up the scale of creation made possible by a rigorous course of prayer fasting and devotional preparation br Pierre A Riffard Theurgy is a type of magic It consists of a set of magical practices performed to evoke beneficent spirits in order to see them or know them or in order to influence them for instance by forcing them to animate a statue to inhabit a human being such as a medium or to disclose mysteries br br br Neoplatonism br br Theurgy means divine working The first recorded use of the term is found in the mid second century neoplatonist work the Chaldean Oracles Fragment des Places Paris For the theourgo do not fall under the fate governed herd The source of Western theurgy can be found in the philosophy of late neoplatonists especially Iamblichus Although the neoplatonists are often considered pagan polytheists they embraced a form of monism br In late neoplatonism the spiritual universe is regarded as a series of emanations from the One From the One emanated the Divine Mind Nous and in turn from the Divine Mind emanated the World Soul Psyche Neoplatonists insisted that the One is absolutely transcendent and in the emanations nothing of the higher was lost or transmitted to the lower which remained unchanged by the lower emanations br For Plotinus and Porphyry the emanations are as follows br br To Hen The One Deity without quality sometimes called The Good br Nous Mind The Universal consciousness from which proceeds br Psych Soul Including both individual and world soul leading finally to br Physis Nature br Plotinus urged contemplations for those who wished to perform theurgy the goal of which was to reunite with the Divine called henosis Therefore his school resembles a school of meditation or contemplation br br br Iamblichus br Iamblichus a student of Anatolius and Porphyry the latter himself was a student of Plotinus taught a more ritualized method of theurgy that involved invocation and religious as well as magical ritual Iamblichus believed theurgy was an imitation of the gods and in his major work On the Mysteries of the Egyptians Chaldeans and Assyrians he described theurgic observance as ritualized cosmogony that endowed embodied souls with the divine responsibility of creating and preserving the cosmos br Iamblichus analysis was that the transcendent cannot be grasped with mental contemplation because the transcendent is supra rational Theurgy is a series of rituals and operations aimed at recovering the transcendent essence by retracing the divine signatures through the layers of being Education is important for comprehending the scheme of things as presented by Aristotle Plato and Pythagoras The theurgist works like with like at the material level with physical symbols at the higher level with mental and purely spiritual practices Starting with correspondences of the divine in matter the theurgist eventually reaches the level where the soul s inner divinity unites with the One br br br Emperor Julian br The Emperor Julian embraced neoplatonic philosophy and worked to replace Christianity with a version of neoplatonic paganism Because of his untimely death and the hold mainstream Christianity had over the empire at the time this was ultimately unsuccessful but he did produce several works of philosophy and theology including a popular hymn to the sun In his theology Helios the sun was the ideal example of the perfection of the gods and light a symbol of divine emanation He also held the mother goddess Cybele in high esteem br Julian favored ritual theurgy with an emphasis on sacrifice and prayer He was heavily influenced by Iamblichus ideas br br br In Western esotericism br br br Esoteric Christianity br Esoteric Christianity accepts theurgy as a tradition that could greatly benefit a person The main feat of Esoteric Christianity is to learn the mysteries of God see Raziel and to rise to higher consciousness in the understanding of God s relationship to individual consciousness Theurgy in the esoteric tradition uses this knowledge to heighten one s own spiritual nature Some branches of Esoteric Christianity hold that if an Esoteric Christian Rosicrucian or Theosopher practices it they could potentially rise to the degree of Magus or Adept after a certain level of spiritual attainment In a traditional and magical sense theurgy is seen as the opposite of Goetia even though many argue that they overlap br br br Radical orthodoxy br John Milbank founder of radical orthodoxy asserts that theology encourages a theurgy which aims at a liberation of nature from terror and distress and at a fully harmonious and beautiful interaction between humans and the natural world He continues by stating that theology equally encourages a theurgy which is a social work of maximising democratic participation and socialist sharing br br br Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn br br Some organizations such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn teach a type of theurgy that would help one ascend spiritually as well as understand the true nature of the self and its relation to the Divine and the Universe This tradition holds that theurgists are usually solitary practitioners who seek the divine light alone Theurgy in this hermetic sense stresses the need for the individual to separate and analyze the individual components that constitute everyday consciousness and reunite them in a way that changes one s personal awareness into a state that understands and partakes in spiritual grace br br br See also br Astral religion Worship of stars and other heavenly bodies as deitiesPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets br Body of light Hermetic
