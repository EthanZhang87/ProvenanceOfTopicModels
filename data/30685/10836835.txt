id: 10836835
In fairy tales a donor is a character who tests the hero and sometimes other characters as well and provides magical assistance to the hero upon their success br The fairy godmother is a well known form of this character Many other supernatural patrons feature in fairy tales these include various kinds of animals and the spirit of a dead mother br br br In fairy tale and legend br In his analysis of fairy tales Vladimir Propp identified this role as the donor and listed it as one of the seven roles found in fairy tales Before giving the hero magical support or advice the donor may also test the hero by questioning him setting him tasks or making requests of him Then the donor may directly give the hero a magical agent advise him on how to find one or offer to act on his behalf If the character itself acts on behalf of the hero it also takes on the role of helper in Propp s analysis Because a donor is defined by acts other characters may fill the role even the villain a boy escaping a witch may steal her magical handkerchief making the witch an involuntary donor Conversely the donor of Rumpelstiltskin converts himself into the villain by demanding the heroine s baby as the price of his work br In Grimm s Fairy Tales the hero often meets the vital helper in the woods in liminal areas between other realms br When more than one character attempts the tasks such as when the youngest son sets out last all of them commonly met the donor It is through failing the test that the older sons are marked out as not being the hero only the youngest son passes the test and receives the aid br There may be three donors distinguished by the fact that the first two are unable to help and so send him on to the next A common motif as in Farmer Weathersky is that one can consult all the beasts then next all the fish then third all the birds and only then can the hero discover what is needed In other cases each of the three may give the hero or heroine something but only the third has the information necessary for them br br br Types of donors br br The characters of donors are numerous Fairy godmothers were added to Sleeping Beauty by Perrault no such figures appeared in his source Sole Luna e Talia by Giambattista Basile In the Grimm Brothers variant of Cinderella the protagonist is aided not by her fairy godmother but by her dead mother as is the heroine of the Finnish variant The Wonderful Birch A great variety of other figures may also take this place In Vasilissa the Beautiful the heroine is aided by a wooden doll that her dying mother had given her in Rushen Coatie by a red calf sent to her by her dead mother a calf that can continue to aid her after its death in Katie Woodencloak by a mysterious dun bull in Tattercoats by a gooseherd who is her friend for a long time before his mysterious powers are revealed In East of the Sun and West of the Moon the heroine is given vital gifts by three old women she meets on the way br Heroes seldom have actual fairy godmothers but similar figures are common In The Golden Bird the hero is aided by a fox whose advice he takes in The Red Ettin by a fairy not his godmother in Puddocky by an enchanted frog that takes pity on him in Prince Ring by an enchanted dog in Fair Brow and The Bird Grip by a dead man whom he had aided in The Horse Gullfaxi and the Sword Gunnfoder in an unusual reversal by his stepmother br In American fiction there has long been a tradition for the white protagonist to be aided by a Magical Negro who often possesses special insight or mystical powers br The hero may also meet up with several extraordinary men who will help him as in The Fool of the World and the Flying Ship How the Hermit helped to win the King s Daughter Long Broad and Sharpsight and The King Of Lochlin s Three Daughters Each one has an ability such as seeing things miles off hearing things miles off an extraordinary shot the ability to drink a river or others that allow them to fulfill the hero s tasks br Talking animals are often the hero s helpers perhaps more than any other type The most common motivation of the animals is gratitude after protection receiving food or less commonly settling a quarrel between several animals In another variation featured in The Three Enchanted Princes and The Death of Koschei the Deathless the hero s three sisters have been married to animals These prove to be shape shifted men who aid their brother in law in a variant of tale types Because of its retelling by Perrault Puss in Boots is among the best known animal helpers although in other variants of the tale the hero or heroine is helped sometimes by a fox and occasionally by other animals Horses as in The Firebird and Princess Vasilisa F t Frumos with the Golden Hair The Magician s Horse The Princess on the Glass Hill and Ferdinand the Faithful and Ferdinand the Unfaithful are popular in the oral tradition several tale types normally feature a horse almost as important as the hero br This magical helper is often long faithful to the hero the hero may fail many times after the initial test often by not respecting the helper s advice In The Golden Bird the fox declares that the hero does not deserve his help after his disobedience but still aids him br br br
