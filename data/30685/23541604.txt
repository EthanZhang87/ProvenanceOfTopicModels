Fantasy cartography fictional map making or geofiction is a type of map design that visually presents an imaginary world or concept or represents a real world geography in a fantastic style Fantasy cartography usually manifests from worldbuilding and often corresponds to narratives within the fantasy and science fiction genres Stefan Ekman says a regular map re presents what is already there a fictional map is often primary to create the map means largely to create the world of the map br Whilst cartographic fantasy has been popularized by novels of these genres it has also become a standalone hobby and artistic pursuit Cartographic fantasy has its historic origins in mythology philosophy literature and natural sciences Although typically geographical cartographic fantasy can include planetary galactic and cosmological maps conceptual maps and speculative maps Fantasy maps are created and presented across different media such as books television shows movies video games tabletop games and websites and are characterized by aesthetics themes and styles associated with the world or concept they are portraying The increased popularity of geofiction and worldbuilding has led to and been supported by the emergence of design programs tailored to creative cartographers br br br History br br br Early history br The roots of the history of fantasy cartography are shared with the independent histories of both cartography and fantasy as well as the general history of the visualization of ideas br br br Middle ages br Cartographers of the Middle Ages did not see their profession as purely making accurate representations of geography Often their maps were crafted as much as works of art as tools for navigating incorporating imagery and symbolism from mythology folklore and fantasy stories br An early example of cartography created without intending to present a geographical reality is Dante s Hell By the late fifteenth century numerous illustrations inspired by Dante Alighieri s Divine Comedy had been published based on descriptions from the text Dante s Hell has continued to be the subject of fantasy cartographers for centuries br In Thomas More published his Utopia accompanied by a map of the island This map inspired artistic cartographers over the sixteenth century to iterate the original br br br Enlightenment and discovery br In the latter half of the th century the Bible began to be printed with internal maps as a product of the Protestant movement and the Geneva reforms This may have contributed to the increased popularity of text accompanying maps and stirred the public imagination towards producing maps for fiction br Fiction inspired by the Age of Discovery and the Age of Enlightenment also brought with it a romanticization of explorative cartography and surveying Several classic stories from the era included maps as an important element of the reader s experience Among the most popular of these map accompanied fictional texts from the time are Jonathan Swift s Gulliver s Travels and Robert Louis Stevenson s Treasure Island br br John Bunyan s The Pilgrim s Progress included both A Mapp Shewing the Order Causes of Salvation and Damnation and The Road from the City of Destruction to the Eternal City br br br Modern history br The most influential fantasy cartographer is J R R Tolkien whose maps of Middle earth prefacing The Lord of the Rings have been called the most influential example to date one that encouraged other writers and their publishers to include cartographic images In his book Here Be Dragons Exploring Fantasy Maps and Settings Ekman says In modern fantasy especially high fantasy maps are considered common enough to be almost obligatory mainly because of the maps J R R Tolkien included in The Lord of the Rings br Before Tolkien another text that brought fantastic worlds into the zeitgeist was The Wonderful Wizard of Oz written by L Frank Baum and the corresponding musical fantasy film The Wizard of Oz The world of Oz was mapped by Baum in br br br Types br There are many types of maps within cartographic fantasy which can be classified by genre scope and

Heroic fantasy br br Heroic fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy in which events occur in a world where magic is prevalent and modern technology is non existent The setting may be entirely fictitious in nature or based upon earth with some additions Unlike dark fiction it provides a setting in which all men are strong all women beautiful all life adventurous and all problems simple This means that

Munster s Europa Regina is a good example of this a map design that presents Europe as a majestic queen br br br Pedagogical or simulative br Fantasy maps can be used as cartographic aids to teach or simulate situations In the Cold War a U S Army cryptologist Lambros D Callimahos developed a training exercise war game for code breakers simulating the invasion of Cuba In this program the fantasy

two hundred fantasy books This survey sought to answer common questions about the prevalence features and characteristics of fantasy cartography within the genre Here are some of those findings br br Of the surveyed books contained at least one map Of these books had one map had two and had more than two maps br In a survey of the fantasy maps within the fantasy books the main subject matter or content of the maps were of a primary world a secondary world an imaginary city one or more buildings br The same survey showed that maps were orientated differently of were orientated north were orientated northeast to northwest did not specify an cardinal orientation Of the maps included a compass rose as a feature br br br Cartographic software br With the increased popularity of professional and recreational cartographic fantasy the demand for computer programs to streamline the process has increased too Two leaders in the budding industry are Wonderdraft and Inkarnate br Some software programs can create random terrain using fractal algorithms Sophisticated programs can apply geologic effects such as tectonic plate movement and erosion the resulting world can be rendered in great detail providing a degree of realism to the result br br br br br br Further reading br Ekman Stefan Here be dragons exploring fantasy maps and settings Middletown Conn Wesleyan
