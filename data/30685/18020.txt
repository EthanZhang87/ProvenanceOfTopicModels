title: Lost city
id: 18020
A lost city is an urban settlement that fell into terminal decline and became extensively or completely uninhabited with the consequence that the site s former significance was no longer known to the wider world The locations of many lost cities have been forgotten but some have been rediscovered and studied extensively by scientists Recently abandoned cities or cities whose location was never in question might be referred to as ruins or ghost towns Smaller settlements may be referred to as abandoned villages The search for such lost cities by European explorers and adventurers in Africa the Americas and Southeast Asia from the th century onwards eventually led to the development of archaeology br Lost cities generally fall into two broad categories those where all knowledge of the city s existence was forgotten before it was rediscovered and those whose memory was preserved in myth legend or historical records but whose location was lost or at least no longer widely recognized br br Cities may become lost for a variety of reasons including natural disasters economic or social upheaval or war br The Incan capital city of Vilcabamba was destroyed and depopulated during the Spanish conquest of Peru in The Spanish did not rebuild the city and the location went unrecorded and was forgotten until it was rediscovered through a detailed examination of period letters and documents br Troy was a city located in northwest Anatolia in what is now Turkey It is best known for being the focus of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle and especially in the Iliad one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer Repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt the city slowly declined and was abandoned in the Byzantine era Buried by time the city was consigned to the realm of legend until the location was first excavated in the s br Other settlements are lost with few or no clues to their abandonment For example Malden Island in the central Pacific was deserted when first visited by Europeans in but the remains of temples and other structures on the island indicate that a population of Polynesians had lived there for perhaps several generations in the past Typically this lack of information is due to a lack of surviving written or oral histories and a lack of archaeological data as in the case of the remote and fairly unknown Malden Island br br With the development of archaeology and the application of modern techniques many previously lost cities have been rediscovered br Machu Picchu is a pre Columbian Inca site situated on a mountain ridge above the Urubamba Valley in Peru Often referred to as the Lost City of the Incas it is perhaps the most familiar icon of the Inca World Machu Picchu was built around at the height of the Inca Empire It was abandoned just over years later in as a belated result of the Spanish Conquest It is possible that most of its inhabitants died from smallpox introduced by travelers before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the area In Melchor Arteaga led the explorer Hiram Bingham to Machu Picchu which had been largely forgotten by everybody except the small number of people living in the immediate valley Nevertheless Peruvian explorer and farmer Agust n Liz rraga predated this discovery by years having found the Inca site on July He left a charcoal inscription bearing the words A Liz rraga br Helike was an ancient Greek city that sank at night in the winter of BCE The city was located in Achaea Northern Peloponnesos two kilometres stadia from the Corinthian Gulf The city was thought to be legend until when it was rediscovered in the Helike Delta In the Greek archaeologist Dora Katsonopoulou launched the Helike Project to locate the site of the lost city In in collaboration with the University of Patras a
