of Professor Kirke br During a game of hide and seek Lucy discovers a wardrobe and hides inside only to find that she has entered a magical winter world She encounters a faun named Mr Tumnus who tells her she is in Narnia Tumnus lulls Lucy to sleep by playing a flute lullaby when she wakes up he explains that he had intended to betray her to the White Witch who has cursed Narnia to eternally experience winter and never Christmas any humans encountered are to be brought to her Instead Tumnus sends Lucy back home through the wardrobe where she finds that hardly any time has passed in the real world br Lucy later returns through the wardrobe Edmund follows her but meets the White Witch and tells her about Tumnus The Witch offers him Turkish delight and kingship if he brings his siblings to her In the real world Lucy tells Peter and Susan of Narnia but Edmund spitefully betrays her by pretending that Lucy has simply imagined it Professor Kirke however suggests Lucy is telling the truth br After accidentally breaking a window the siblings flee the housekeeper through the wardrobe and enter Narnia Peter snaps at Edmund for lying about Lucy and forces him to apologize to her They discover that the Witch has taken Tumnus They meet talking beavers who say Aslan plans to return and regain control of Narnia and that there is a prophecy that when two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve sit on the thrones of Cair Paravel the Witch s reign will end br Edmund sneaks off to visit the Witch but she is furious that he came without his siblings She sends wolves led by Maugrim to find the children and Edmund is imprisoned where he meets Tumnus The children and beavers escape and the Witch turns Tumnus to stone br Peter Lucy Susan and the beavers encounter Father Christmas a sign that the Witch s power is weakening He gives them tools to defend themselves Lucy receives a dagger and a cordial that can heal any injury Susan a magical horn and a bow with a quiver of arrows and Peter a sword and shield After evading the Witch s wolves the group reaches Aslan s camp where he is revealed to be a lion Two wolves ambush Lucy and Susan but Peter kills Maugrim Aslan s troops chase the fleeing wolf scout and rescue Edmund br The Witch journeys to Aslan s camp to claim Edmund as a traitor but Aslan secretly offers himself instead That night Lucy and Susan see the Witch kill Aslan at the Stone Table and deploy an army to slaughter his troops Edmund encourages Peter to take command In the morning both armies clash in battle Aslan is resurrected citing magic beyond the Witch s understanding and takes Susan and Lucy to the Witch s castle to free the petrified prisoners Edmund is mortally wounded after breaking the witch s wand with his sword while saving Peter but reinforcements arrive and Aslan kills the Witch Edmund is healed by Lucy s cordial and the Pevensies are crowned King Peter the Magnificent Queen Susan the Gentle King Edmund the Just and Queen Lucy the Valiant br Fifteen years later the siblings now adults pursue a white stag They encounter the lamppost that Lucy first saw when she entered Narnia They cross back through the wardrobe and since hardly any time in their world has passed since they left they become children again Professor Kirke asks why they were in the wardrobe Peter says he wouldn t believe them and he responds Try me br In a mid credit scene Lucy attempts to use the wardrobe again but Professor Kirke tells her he has also tried and they will probably return to Narnia when they least expect it br br br Cast br br The radio announcer that Peter listens to on the rainy day near the beginning of the film is played by Douglas Gresham co producer of the movie and C S Lewis s stepson Keynes voice broke during filming so some of his voice track had to be re looped by his sister Soumaya Mr Pevensie is only glimpsed in a photo which Edmund tries to retrieve during the bombing which is of Sim Evan Jones s father br With the exception of Tilda Swinton who was the first choice to play Jadis the White Witch casting was a long process Beginning in Adamson went through audition tapes met children and workshopped before coming down to the final four actors for the Pevensies Moseley and Popplewell came from the very start of casting whilst Henley and Keynes were cast relatively late Moseley was cast because casting director Pippa Hall remembered she cast him as an extra in Cider with Rosie He beat boys to the role of Peter and quit school to learn all his lines br Aslan s voice was a contention point Brian Cox was originally cast in the role on December but Adamson changed his mind Liam Neeson sought out the role and was announced as the voice on July br br br Production br br br Pre production br During the early s producers Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy were planning a film version They could not find a space in Britain to shoot the film during and their plans to set the film in modern times made Douglas Gresham oppose the film in addition to his feeling that technology had yet to catch up Perry Moore began negotiations with the C S Lewis estate in On December Walden Media announced that they had acquired the rights to The Chronicles of Narnia br The success of Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone prompted the producers to feel they could make a faithful adaptation of the novel set in Britain Harry Potter came along and all those cultural or geographical lines were broken Mark Johnson explained When The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe was being developed at Paramount the imperative was to set it in the U S and it just doesn t hold It s not the book Guillermo del Toro turned down the offer to direct due to his commitment on Pan s Labyrinth Following an Academy Award win for Shrek director Andrew Adamson began adapting the source material with a page treatment based on his memories of the book As such the film begins with the Luftwaffe bombing and concludes with an enormous battle although they do not take up as much time in the novel br In the novel the battle is not seen until Aslan Susan Lucy and their reinforcements arrive This was changed in the movie because Adamson said he could vividly remember a huge battle an example of how Lewis left a lot to the readers imagination Other small changes include the reason all four children come to Narnia in that an accident breaks a window and forces them to hide Tumnus also never meets Edmund until the end of the novel Minor details were added to the Pevensies such as their mother s name Helen being the actual first name of Georgie Henley s mother Finchley as the home of the Pevensies was inspired by Anna Popplewell who actually is from Finchley Adamson also changed the circumstances in which Lucy first comes into Narnia He felt it was more natural that she first see the wardrobe while looking for a hide and seek hiding place rather than just chance upon it exploring the house The film also hints at Professor Kirke s role in The Magician s Nephew such as the engravings on the wardrobe when it is a simple one in the novel and the Professor s surprise and intrigue when Peter and Susan mention Lucy s discovery in the wardrobe When Lewis wrote the novel it was the first of the series and the back story later outlined by the subsequent books in the series did not exist Additionally in the novel the father of the Pevensie children is in London with their mother but in the film their father is fighting in the war as Lucy states to Mr Tumnus when they first meet in Narnia br br br Weta Workshop head Richard Taylor cited Hieronymus Bosch s The Garden of Earthly Delights as an inspiration on the film He felt Narnia had to be less dark and gritty than their depiction of Middle earth in The Lord of the Rings because it is a new world Many of Weta s creature designs were designed for digital creation so when Howard Berger and KNB FX inherited the practical effects work they had to spend three months retooling approved designs for animatronics Berger s children would comment and advise upon his designs they suggested the White Witch s hair be changed from black to blonde which Berger concurred with as he realized Swinton s wig looked too Gothic br br br Filming br Principal photography began in New Zealand on June shooting in primarily chronological order Adamson did this in order to naturally create a sense of mature development from his young actors which mirrored their real life development Georgie Henley and Skandar Keynes were never shown the set before filming scenes of their characters entering Narnia nor had Henley seen James McAvoy in his Mr Tumnus costume before shooting their scenes together br The first scene shot was at the former RNZAF Base Hobsonville for the railway scene Afterwards they shot the Blitz scene which Adamson called their first formal day of shooting br The filmmakers asked permission to bring in twelve reindeer to New Zealand to pull the White Witch s sled They were denied by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry citing the potentially deadly Q fever from which the North American reindeer population suffers as the reason However ten wolves and wolf hybrids were allowed in for filming in Auckland To replace the denied live reindeer Mark Rappaport s Creature Effects Inc created four animatronic reindeer that were used in shots where the deer were standing in place The reindeer were designed with replaceable skins to get the most usage brown for those of Father Christmas and white for those of the White Witch br The cast and crew spent their time in New Zealand in Auckland before moving in November to the South Island Shooting locations in the South Island included Flock Hill in Canterbury the area known as Elephant Rocks near Duntroon in North Otago which was transformed into Aslan s camp The castle scene was filmed in Purakaunui Bay in the Catlins district not far from the most southern point in New Zealand br They filmed in the Czech Republic Prague and esk v carsko National Park Slovenia and Poland after the Christmas break before wrapping in February br br br Post production br The film was edited by Jim May and Sim Evan Jones Jones states that he really liked the problem solving that one can do with editing According to Sim The way you can just take stuff and sort it out and be the keeper of the story without having to interact with actors crew and reign drew him to film editing br Jim May had worked at several visual effects facilities Boss Film ILM and Sony Pictures Imageworks and eventually moved into feature editorial as the visual effects editor in the cutting room br br br Music br br The soundtrack was composed by Harry Gregson Williams who had previously worked with Adamson on Shrek and Shrek In addition there are three original songs in the film Can t Take It In by Imogen Heap Wunderkind by Alanis Morissette and Winter Light by Tim Finn Evanescence lead singer Amy Lee also wrote a song for the film but it was not included in the soundtrack br The soundtrack was recorded at Abbey Road Studios London England and in Los Angeles California Gregson Williams employed the piece Hollywood Studio Symphony Orchestra along with a member choir mostly members of the Bach Choir and numerous other solo musicians such as electric violinist Hugh Marsh and vocalist Lisbeth Scott at his Wavecrest Studio He composed the original score and then spent late September through early November conducting the Hollywood Orchestra and overseeing the recording of the English choir For colour he employed instruments used in ancient folk music and to underscore critical dramatic moments he added choral textures and occasionally a solo voice The score includes instances of electronic music br The soundtrack received two Golden Globe Award nominations Best Original Score and Best Original Song for Wunderkind br EMI also released a compilation soundtrack entitled Music Inspired by The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe was released in September The album features songs by contemporary Christian music artists such as Bethany Dillon Kutless and Nichole Nordeman It released Waiting for the World to Fall by Jars of Clay as a single The album went on to win the Special Event Album of the Year at the GMA Music Awards br Another song inspired by the movie is Lazy Sunday also known as The Narnia rap by the Lonely Island and Chris Parnell The song and its music video was released as a comedy sketch in a episode of the TV show Saturday Night Live The song and its video are both a spoof of hardcore rap songs In Lazy Sunday Parnell and Lonely Island member Andy Samberg rap about among other things going to see The Chronicles of Narnia at an afternoon matinee The joke is that the song s lyrics are not typical for hardcore rap which normally depicts scenes of crime and violence Samberg himself describes Lazy Sunday as two guys rapping about very lame sensitive stuff Both the song and its video became an overnight hit surprising its creators Lazy Sunday is credited with helping revive Saturday Night Live which was stagnant in the years before the song s release Several bootleg copies of Lazy Sunday were uploaded to the video sharing YouTube which had only launched earlier in the year where they were very popular and gained a combined total of five million views a very large number for an online video at the time The video s popularity brought widespread attention to YouTube and kick started the site s success quickly becoming the most popular video website on the internet and one of the most popular websites overall remaining so as of the early s br br br Reception br br
