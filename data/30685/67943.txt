a reputation as one of the greatest Shakespearean performers He declined the honour of a knighthood but was appointed CBE in and became a CH in br Scofield received the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for portraying Sir Thomas More in the Broadway production of A Man for All Seasons Four years later he won the Academy Award for Best Actor when he reprised the role in the film adaptation making him one of eleven to receive a Tony and Academy Award for the same role He received the Primetime Emmy Award for Male of the Species br He garnered acclaim for his roles in films such as The Train King Lear A Delicate Balance Henry V and Hamlet He portrayed Mark Van Doren in the historical drama Quiz Show for which he earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor For his role as Thomas Danforth in the film adaptation of The Crucible he received the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role br br Paul Scofield was born on January in Edgbaston Birmingham Warwickshire England the son of Mary and Edward Harry Scofield When Scofield was a few weeks old his family moved to Hurstpierpoint Sussex where his father became headmaster at the Hurstpierpoint Church of England School Scofield told his biographer Garry O Connor that his upbringing was divided His father was an Anglican and his mother a Roman Catholic Baptised into his mother s faith Scofield said some days we were little Protestants and on others we were all devout little Catholics He added A lack of direction in spiritual matters is still with me br Scofield recalls I was a dunce at school But at the age of twelve I went to Varndean School at Brighton where I discovered Shakespeare They did one of his plays every year and I lived just for that In Scofield wrote I don t have a psychological approach to acting fundamentally I have an intuitive approach For me the totally intellectual approach is never satisfactory What matters to me is whether I like the play for one thing and for another whether I can recognize and identify myself with the character I m to play In Scofield left school at the age of seventeen and began training at the Croydon Repertory Theatre Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War Scofield arrived for a physical examination and was ruled unfit for service in the British Army He later recalled They found I had crossed toes I was unable to wear boots I was deeply ashamed br br Scofield began his stage career in with a debut performance in American playwright Eugene O Neill s Desire Under the Elms at the Westminster Theatre and was soon being compared to Laurence Olivier He played at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre From there he went to the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford where he starred in Walter Nugent Monck s revival of Pericles Prince of Tyre br In Scofield appeared as Hamlet at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford alongside a then unknown Claire Bloom as Ophelia Scofield s performance was so highly praised that it caused him to be dubbed The Hamlet of his generation He was also Bassanio in The Merchant of Venice with Bloom as an Attendee J C Trewin commented He is simply a timeless Hamlet None could forget Scofield s pathos the face folded in grief at When you are desirous to be blessed I ll blessing beg of you We have known many correct almost formal Hamlets aloof from Elsinore Scofield was ever a prisoner within its bounds the world had many confines wards and dungeons Denmark being one of the worst br John Harrison Director of the Leeds Playhouse later recalled of Scofield s Hamlet Get thee to a nunnery so often delivered with rage or scorn he says so gently You have visions of quiet and prayer A future for Ophelia In her later book Leaving a Doll s House A Memoir Claire Bloom recalls that during the production she had a very serious crush on Scofield As Scofield was happily married and the father of a son Bloom hoped only to be flirted with and taken some notice of But Scofield never so much as glanced at Bloom or any of the other pretty actresses in the cast Unusually the production had two Hamlets Scofield and Robert Helpmann took turns playing the title role and Bloom later recalled I could never make up my mind which of my two Hamlets I found the more devastating the openly homosexual charismatic Helpmann or the charming shy young man from Sussex br Scofield s versatility at the height of his career is exemplified by his starring roles in theatrical productions as diverse as the musical Expresso Bongo and Peter Brook s celebrated production of King Lear Brook wrote in his memoir Threads of Time The door at the back of the set opened and a small man entered He was wearing a black suit steel rimmed glasses and holding a suitcase For a moment we wondered who this stranger was and why he was wandering onto our stage Then we realised that it was Paul transformed His tall body had shrunk he had become insignificant The new character now possessed him entirely br br One of the highlights of Scofield s career in modern theatre is the role of Sir Thomas More in Robert Bolt s A Man for All Seasons which opened in July Scofield later referred to the part as the only time my intuition for the part has failed me Theatre reviewers published very harsh criticism of Scofield s performance at first which forced him to start from scratch and just work on facts making myself totally faithful to what was on the page After realizing I had to find the way the man would feel then I was able to find the way he should sound and the vital importance of conveying complete sincerity and humility when playing a man of spiritual depth Scofield successfully developed a means of performing as Thomas More through trial and error br Austrian American filmmaker Fred Zinnemann later recalled of seeing the play onstage It dealt with the sixteenth century English statesman Thomas More beheaded on the orders of his King Henry VIII for refusing to sanction his marriage to Anne Boleyn With Paul Scofield in the lead the play was a powerful emotional experience It dramatized the nation s unquestioning submission to the absolute power of the king in stark contrast to More whose last words before the execution were I die the Kings good servant but God s first br When Fred Zinnemann was first approached about directing the film adaptation of A Man For All Seasons by Columbia Pictures executive Mike Frankovich in and enthusiastically agreed the studio did not wish to cast Scofield as the lead Preferring a more internationally bankable cast the studio desired either Laurence Olivier or Richard Burton as Thomas More Alec Guinness as Cardinal Wolsey and Peter O Toole as King Henry VIII Both Zinnemann and screenwriter Robert Bolt disagreed however but still went through the motions of meeting with Olivier and then informing him politely that he had not been chosen Scofield who was cast after Columbia grudgingly fell in with Zinnemann s wishes later recalled I was surprised and honoured to be chosen for the film being almost unknown in the movie world My own task was unaltered except that I now focused on my thoughts on to a camera instead of an audience br Even though defying the studio s casting wishes forced him to film A Man For All Seasons on a shoestring budget Fred Zinnemann felt very differently about Scofield and later recalled of the film shoot For the first few days the crew did their usual work very well the way they would have done any job but on the third day when Scofield made his speech about the majesty of the law they were suddenly mesmerized by the magic of those words and they remained that way throughout the rest of the filming So totally did Paul convey the scope of More s character that for months afterwards I couldn t help but look at him in awe as a saint rather than an actor br br In Scofield acted in the John Frankenheimer war film The Train alongside Burt Lancaster The film is set in August during World War II it pits French Resistance member Paul Labiche Lancaster against German Colonel Franz von Waldheim Scofield who is attempting to move stolen art masterpieces by train to Germany The film received positive acclaim and was ranked as one of the best films by the National Board of Review br Writing in Scofield explained Output in the theatre requires greater energy than anything else I know Doubt of one s energy is the worst of all One s output in the theatre requires energy of a sort that is never a factor in family life Family energy generates itself Social life outside the family can be exhausting I don t care much for social life with people in the theatre I m rather good at being with people when I want to make the effort but I m bad at listening to people when I know what they re going to say It isn t very interesting and on the whole it s very draining The interesting thing in the theatre is the work and working with people I usually like the people in the work but I can t go on with them outside the work as long as most actors can And when I m working on a part I m thinking about it all the time going over all the possibilities in my mind I like to be alone when I m working br In a career devoted chiefly to the classical theatre Scofield starred in many Shakespeare plays and played the title role in Ben Jonson s Volpone in Peter Hall s production for the Royal National Theatre In a interview Scofield explained One of the great strengths of the theatre is that it is ephemeral It does exist only in what you remember and you can t check up on it afterwards and think That s not as good as I remember If any performance I ve ever given stays in someone s mind that s so much more exciting than being able to put it on the video and play it again It s not that I don t want to take risks the opposite is true in fact But the more you know about acting the more you re aware of the pitfalls and the more nerve racking it becomes When I was young I wasn t nervous at all Even doing Hamlet I just had a go br Scofield also appeared as Charles Dyer in Dyer s play Staircase staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company in Laurie in John Osborne s A Hotel in Amsterdam and Antonio Salieri in the original stage production of Peter Shaffer s Amadeus He was subsequently the voice of the Dragon in another play by Robert Bolt a children s drama The Thwarting of Baron Bolligrew Expresso Bongo Staircase and Amadeus were filmed with other actors but Scofield starred in the screen version of King Lear Other major screen roles include the art obsessed Wehrmacht Colonel von Waldheim in The Train Strether in a TV adaptation of Henry James s novel The Ambassadors and Tobias in Edward Albee s A Delicate Balance br br Scofield was cast in the lead role of Sir Randolph Nettleby in the film The Shooting Party but was forced to withdraw due to an injury he suffered on set According to the DVD extras documentary for the film Scofield and the other male lead actors were to come into shot on a horse drawn shooting brake driven by the renowned film horse master George Mossman as the first shot of the first day of filming As they turned the first corner the plank that Mossman was standing on broke in two and he was hurled forward and down falling between the sets of wheels and taking the reins with him He was struck by a horse s hoof and concussed The horses shied and broke into a gallop Actor Rupert Frazer admitted that he was the first to jump off landing safely but bruised Out of control the horses turned to the right when confronted by a stone wall causing the shooting brake to roll completely catapulting the actors into a pile of scaffolding that had been stacked next to the wall Robert Hardy stood up and realised to his amazement that he was unhurt He looked across to see Edward Fox stand up turn completely green and collapse in a heap having broken five ribs and his shoulder blade He noticed that Scofield was lying very still on the ground and I saw that his shin bone was sticking out through his trousers As the film takes place in October during the partridge shooting season the filmmakers had to make a choice whether to delay filming for a year or re cast The Shooting Party schedule was ultimately changed to allow James Mason to take over the part of Sir Randolph Nettleby six weeks later Scofield s broken leg also deprived him of the part of O Brien in Nineteen Eighty Four in which he was replaced by Richard Burton br Helen Mirren who appeared with Scofield in the film When the Whales Came said He aspires to the soul rather than the character He has no sense of personal ambition He s one of our great great actors We re lucky to have him Scofield also portrayed the Ghost in Franco Zeffirelli s film adaptation of Hamlet alongside Mel Gibson in the title role Despite being an A list actor at the time Gibson who had grown up idolising Scofield compared the experience of performing Shakespeare alongside him to being thrown into the ring with Mike Tyson Scofield on the other hand never felt similarly intimidated and later recalled about working with Gibson Not the actor you d think would make an ideal Hamlet but he had enormous integrity and intelligence Scofield portrayed Professor Moroi in the film of J nos Ny ri s If Winter Comes for BBC Television poet Mark Van Doren in Robert Redford s film Quiz Show and Deputy Governor Thomas Danforth in Nicholas Hytner s film adaptation of Arthur Miller s The Crucible br br Paul Scofield married actress Joy Mary Parker on May They had met while he played Hamlet to her Ophelia Scofield later said Joy and I simply decided to be married We were both of age and were determined Any doubts from our families were overruled and they were the usual ones too young etc We had a week out at the end of The Moon Is Down tour married during that week and went straight into the Whitehall Theatre br Paul and Joy Scofield had two children Martin born who became a senior lecturer in English and American literature at the University of Kent and Sarah born When asked by Garry O Connor how he wished to be remembered Scofield responded If you have a family that is how to be remembered When O Connor asked about his seventieth birthday Scofield replied Birthdays are a bore really It s true I do like my fallow times I hate missing anything that might be happening outside on a summer evening something in the garden Filmmaker Michael Winner accordingly described Paul and Joy Scofield as one of the few very happily married couples I ve ever met br Scofield died from leukaemia on March at the age of at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton East Sussex England His memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey on the first anniversary of his death His wife Joy died four years later on November aged br br Scofield was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire CBE in the New Year Honours When Scofield was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for A Man for All Seasons he declined to travel to Los Angeles to attend the ceremony When Scofield won the award his leading lady Wendy Hiller whom Fred Zinnemann had cast as Lady Alice More for being particularly marvelous at doing a slow burn went up on stage to receive the Award Statue on Scofield s behalf According to his biographer Garry O Connor Scofield always kept his Oscar Statue put away in the corner of his workroom Scofield explained Although it was nice to get it s not decorative really I suppose that s why I don t display it But if anyone wants to see it I ll get it out br Scofield was subsequently nominated as Best Supporting Actor for Quiz Show His many theatrical accolades include a Tony Award for A Man for All Seasons In Scofield became the sixth performer to win the Triple Crown of Acting winning an Emmy Award for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for Male of the Species He accomplished this in only seven years which is still a record He was also one of only eleven actors to win both the Tony and the Oscar for the same role on stage and film for A Man for All Seasons Scofield declined the honour of a knighthood on three occasions but was appointed CBE in and became a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in In the Hamburg based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded Scofield its annual Shakespeare Prize In he was awarded the honorary degree of D Litt by the University of Oxford br When asked the reason for his decision to decline the knighthood Scofield responded I have every respect for people who are offered a knighthood and accept it gratefully It is just not an aspect of life that I would want Gary O Connor described being knighted as The kind of honour from which Scofield instinctively recoiled Never the actor before the part he plays In a poll of actors of the Royal Shakespeare Company including Ian McKellen Donald Sinden Janet Suzman Ian Richardson Antony Sher and Corin Redgrave acclaimed Scofield s Lear as the greatest Shakespearean performance ever Scofield appeared in many radio dramas for BBC Radio
