A villain also known as a black hat or bad guy the feminine form is villainess is a stock character whether based on a historical narrative or one of literary fiction Random House Unabridged Dictionary defines such a character as a cruelly malicious person who is involved in or devoted to wickedness or crime scoundrel or a character in a play novel or the like who constitutes an important evil agency in the plot The antonym of a villain is a hero br The villain s structural purpose is to serve as the opposition of the hero character and their motives or evil actions drive a plot along In contrast to the hero who is defined by feats of ingenuity and bravery and the pursuit of justice and the greater good a villain is often defined by their acts of selfishness evilness arrogance cruelty and cunning displaying immoral behavior that can oppose or pervert justice br br br Etymology br br The term villain first came into English from the Anglo French and Old French vilain which is further derived from the Late Latin word villanus which referred to those bound to the soil of the villa and worked on an equivalent of a plantation in Late Antiquity in Italy or Gaul br Vilain later shifted to villein which referred to a person of a less than knightly status implying a lack of chivalry and politeness All actions that were unchivalrous or evil such as treachery or rape eventually fell under the identity of belonging to a villain in the modern sense of the word Additionally villein became used as a term of abuse and eventually took on its modern meaning br The landed aristocracy of Middle Age Europe used politically and linguistically the Middle English descendant of villanus meaning villager styled as vilain or vilein with the meaning a person of uncouth mind and manners As the common equating of manners with morals gained in strength and currency the connotations worsened so that the modern word villain is no unpolished villager but is instead among other things a deliberate scoundrel or criminal br At the very same time the medieval expression vilein or vilain is closely influenced by the word vile referring to something wicked or worthless br From the late th century vile meant morally repugnant morally flawed corrupt wicked of no value of inferior quality disgusting foul ugly degrading humiliating of low estate without worldly honor or esteem from Anglo French ville Old French vil from Latin vilis cheap worthless of low value br Although the relation of these terms became intertwined at some later in time it is unknown when this happened br br br Classical literature br In classical literature the villain character is not always the same as those that appear in modern and postmodern incarnations as the lines of morality are often blurred to imply a sense of ambiguity or affected by historical context and cultural ideas Often the delineation of heroes and villains in this literature is left unclear That said there are some exceptions to this such as Grendel from Beowulf who is unambiguously evil br William Shakespeare modelled the villain archetype to be three dimensional in characteristics and gave way to the complex nature that villains showcase in modern literature For instance he wrote Shylock as a sympathetic character However Shakespeare s incarnations of historical figures were influenced by the propaganda pieces coming from Tudor sources and his works often showed this bias and discredited their reputation For example Shakespeare famously portrayed Richard III as a hideous monster who destroyed his family out of spite Shakespeare also had Iago in Othello and Antonio in The Tempest be completely void of redeeming traits br br br Folk and fairy tales br br br Russian fairy tales br In an analysis of Russian fairy tales Vladimir Propp concluded that the majority of stories had only eight dramatis personae one being the villain This analysis has been widely applied to non Russian tales The actions that fell into a villain s sphere were br br a story initiating villainy where the villain caused harm to the hero or his family br a conflict between the hero and the villain either a fight or other competition br pursuing the hero after he has succeeded in winning the fight or obtaining something from the villain br When a character displays these traits it is not necessarily tropes specific to the fairy tale genre but it does imply that the one who performs certain acts to be the villain The villain therefore can appear twice in a story to fulfill certain roles once in the opening of the story and a second time as the person sought out by the hero br When a character has only performed actions or displayed traits that coincide with Vladimir Propp s analysis that character can be identified as a pure villain Folklore and fairy tale villains can also play a myriad of roles that can influence or drive a story forward In fairy tales villains can perform an influential role for example a witch who fought the hero and ran away and who lets the hero follow her is also performing the task of guidance and thus acting as a helper br Propp also proposed another two archetypes of the villain s role within the narrative in which they can portray themselves as villainous in a more general sense The first is the false hero This character is always villainous presenting a false claim to be the hero that must be rebutted for the happy ending Examples of characters who display this trait and interfere with the success of a tale s hero are the Ugly Stepsisters in Cinderella who chopped off parts of their feet to fit in the shoe br Another role for the villain would be the dispatcher who sends the hero on their quest At the beginning of the story their request may appear benevolent or innocent but the dispatcher s real intentions might be to send the hero on a journey in the hopes of being rid of them br The roles and influences that villains can have over a narrative can also be transferred over to other characters to continue their role in the narrative through another character The legacy of the villain is often transferred through that of bloodlines family or a devoted follower For example if a dragon played the role of a villain but was killed by the hero another character such as the dragon s sister might take on the legacy of the previous villain and pursue the hero out of revenge br br br Villain archetypes br The fairy tale genre utilises villains as key components to push the narrative forward and influence the hero s journey These while not as rounded as those that appear in other forms of literature are what is known as archetypes The archetypal villain is a common occurrence within the genre and come under different categories that have different influences on the protagonist and the narrative br br br False donor br The false donor is a villain who utilises trickery to achieve their ends Often the false donor will pose as a benevolent figure or influence on the protagonist or those associated with them to present them with a deal The deal will present a short term solution or benefit for whoever accepts it and in return benefit the villain in the long term During the story s climax the hero often has to find a way to rectify the agreement in order to defeat the villain or achieve the happy ending br Similarly the devil archetype is one that also makes an offer to the protagonist or someone associated with them and appeals to their needs and desires However the devil archetype does not hide their intentions from the protagonist The subsequent story often follows the protagonist s journey to try and annul the agreement before any damage can be done br br br Beast br The beast is a character who relies on their instincts and ability to cause destruction to achieve their ends The evil intentions of their actions are often easily identified as they act without concern for others or their wellbeing or subtlety The rampaging villain can take the form of a very powerful individual or a rampaging beast but is still one of the more dangerous villain archetypes due to their affinity for destruction br br br Authority figure br The authority figure is one that has already attained a level of command and power but always craves more They are often driven by their desire for material wealth distinguished stature or great power and appear as a monarch corporate climber or other powerful individual Their end goal is often the total domination of their corporation nation or world through mystical means or political manipulation Often this villain is defeated by their own greed pride or arrogance br br br Traitor br The traitor is a villain who emphasizes the traits of trickery manipulation and deception to achieve their goals which is often to offer or supply information to the protagonist s opposition to halt them on their journey often in exchange for their own freedom or safety The traitor s goals are not always evil but the actions they commit to reach their goal can be considered inherently evil br br br Animated villains br Animation is home to several different villains Winsor McCay in How a Mosquito Operates had a cartoon mosquito torment a human being and in Walt Disney created Pete as an antagonist for the Alice Comedies with Pete later becoming an antagonist of Mickey Mouse and his friends and the first Disney villain Fleischer Studios later had Bluto as the antagonist of the Popeye cartoons Hanna Barbera created Tom as an antagonist of Jerry Likewise the Looney Tunes had villains like Elmer Fudd Yosemite Sam Marvin the Martian and Blacque Jacque Shellacque br In Disney made the movie Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and it had the Evil Queen as its antagonist Since then Disney made a lot of animated movies with villains based on fairy tale villains Disney Villains became a major part of that franchise br Saturday morning cartoons also had villains like Dick Dastardly and Snidely Whiplash Since then cartoon villains have had a reputation for being one dimensional br In modern animation animated villains that are more significant and fleshed out have become increasingly common as cartoons have begun to be favored by adults Shows such as Adventure Time Gravity Falls and Rick and Morty range from child to adult cartoons but are all watched by a largely older audience br br br Animated villain controversies br It is sometimes alleged that villains in animated works such as Disney movies often embody stereotypes in a more direct way than live action villains That their character design is based on caricatures of racist antisemitic and or homophobic stereotypes with exaggerated features That female animated villains are portrayed in ways that feed into misogynistic ideas and traditional gender roles br br br Allegations of misogyny br Sattar Sharmin and Sanyat Tania have argued that animated villains frequently fall into two categories women who exhibit societally undesirable traits or men displaying feminine traits In the case of men with feminine traits this may stem from both a homophobic and misogynistic point of view which is further discussed below br As for female villains who are portrayed with displeasing characteristics not only are they crafted to look unattractive but their motivations for becoming evil are rooted in very trivial matters Debra Bradley s survey on Disney films discovered that of female villains such as the evil queen and Lady Tremaine are influenced by jealousy vanity whereas only of male villains are driven by these same factors Rather the men such as Hades and Captain Hook have motives grounded in wealth and power giving in to masculine stereotypes and signifying an attachment to the patriarchy br Additionally in animation there is a history of mothers and grandmothers being posed as the villains of many stories Neil Gaiman s Coraline presents this phenomenon through the idea of the other mother In Coraline the Other Mother is a loving caring parent who welcomes Coraline to a new life helping in the face of troubles back home By glorifying this other mother the story paints Coraline s real mother as negligent in turn causing her to be the villain of the story Disney films also take on the motherly stereotypes in their villains br Other female villains are portrayed as hyper sexual and powerful beings that are used to juxtapose the beauty or physical characteristics of the heroine for example the Lady Tremaine and stepsisters in Cinderella Male villains also hold several traits that are characteristically feminine Characters like Jafar Aladdin and Hades Hercules have features such as shaded eyelids and accentuated facial features similar to those typically associated with femininity br br br Allegations of homophobic stereotypes br br Zachary Doiron has argued that animated villains are based on homophobic stereotypes As an example he brings up is effeminate men sometimes referred to by subject experts as sissy villains where their mannerisms represent stereotypes relating to gay men Another example is the depiction of masculine women which emulates drag queens or butch lesbians Adelia Brown makes a similar allegation about Ursula from The Little Mermaid Ursula is closely modelled after the famous drag queen Divine with her heavy makeup hair styled in a mohawk and her nails painted bright red Her goal throughout the film is to become queen and disrupt the coupling of Ariel and Prince Eric both of which connect villainy to drag queens suggesting that there is inherent evil in those who do drag br br br Villainous foil br br Villains in fiction commonly function in the dual role of adversary and foil to a story s heroes In their role as an adversary the villain serves as an obstacle the hero must struggle to overcome In their role as a foil they exemplify characteristics that are diametrically opposed to those of the hero creating a contrast distinguishing heroic traits from villainous ones br Other have pointed out that many acts of villains have a hint of wish fulfillment which makes some readers or viewers identify with them as characters more strongly than with the heroes Because of this a convincing villain must be given a characterization that provides a motive for doing wrong as well as being a worthy adversary to the hero As put by film critic Roger Ebert Each film is only as good as its villain Since the heroes and the gimmicks tend to repeat from film to film only a great villain can transform a good try into a triumph br br br Portraying and employing villains in fiction br The actor Tod Slaughter typically portrayed villainous characters on both stage and screen in a melodramatic manner with mustache twirling eye rolling leering cackling and hand rubbing br br br Villains in film br In Thomas Edison and Alfred Clark made The Execution of Mary Stuart depicting Mary Queen of Scots being decapitated It describes neither Mary nor her executioner as villains though at the time it was deemed so realistic that audience members believed an actual woman had been beheaded in the making of that film In Georges M li s made a horror film titled The House of the Devil which had The Devil as an antagonist Edison s The Great Train Robbery released in had the bandits who rob the train as its villains In there was a feature length adaptation of Les Mis rables with Javert as a villain and in Otis Turner had a Wicked Witch as the villain of a short film adaptation of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz In Lois Weber made a movie of The Merchant of Venice with Phillips Smalley as a villainous Shylock br The movie The Birth of a Nation has Northern carpetbaggers inciting black violence as its villains The movie Leagues Under the Sea has a man named Charles Denver as its villain In the same year Snow White had Queen Brongomar as a villain The movie The Ten Commandments has the main character s brother be a villain due to his commitment to breaking all of the Ten Commandments In Walt Disney s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs had the Evil Queen as a villain In The Wizard of Oz had Wicked Witch of the West as its villain In the s serial films about superheroes introduced supervillains as characters like Dr Dana in Batman The movie Samson and Delilah has Hedy Lamarr as the villainous Delilah and George Sanders as the villainous Prince of Gaza br In Byron Haskin made a movie of The War of the Worlds Like the book it has Martians as villains br Cecil B DeMille s remake of The Ten Commandments had two main villains Ramesses II played by Yul Brynner and Dathan played by Edward G Robinson It also had Nefertari be a Lady Macbeth figure egging Ramesses on br In the movie Spartacus had Marcus Licinius Crassus as its villain In the same year the movie Psycho had Norman Bates as a villainous protagonist The movie To Kill a Mockingbird like the book had Bob Ewell as its villain Other s movies like The Guns of Navarone and The Great Escape had Nazis as their villains br Beginning with Dr No in every James Bond movie has had a villain br There were also villains in s children s movies For instance Dalmatians and the Batman both had villains The former having Cruella de Vil and the latter being the first time comic book supervillains were adapted to film br In the s and early s the Star Wars movies introduced Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine br Several s movies also had villains like Khan in Star Trek John Kreese in The Karate Kid and its sequels Skynet in the Terminator movies Biff Tannen in the Back to the Future movies The Joker in Batman and Dark Helmet in Spaceballs br Several iconic s movies have also had villains like General Mandible in Antz Dennis Nedry in Jurassic Park Edgar in Men in Black Van Pelt in Jumanji Rameses in The Prince of Egypt Carrigan in Casper and Shan Yu in Mulan The Star Wars prequels also introduced several villains in addition to those the franchise already had br Early s movies like the Spider Man trilogy The Dark Knight Trilogy the Harry Potter films The Lord of the Rings movies and Avatar all had villains like Green Goblin Two Face Lord Voldemort Saruman and Miles Quaritch br In the s the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the DC Extended Universe have had several notable supervillains such as Thanos and General Zod br br br Female villain br br The term villain is the universal term for characters who pose as catalysts for certain ideals that readers or observers find immoral but the term villainess is often used to highlight specific traits that come with their female identity separating them in some aspects from their male counterparts The use of the female villain or villainess is often to highlight the traits that come specifically with the character and the abilities they possess that are exclusive to them For example one of the female villain s greatest weapons is her alluring beauty The perversion of inherently female traits in storytelling also alludes to the demonic display of the succubus and their affinity for utilizing their beauty as a weapon a trait utilized by many female villains throughout modern fiction and mythology However this is not always the case As seen often in animated films female villains are portrayed with ugly appearances to contrast the beauty of the protagonist in turn associating unattractiveness with evil This paints female villains in a negative light compared to their heroine counterparts and showcases the duality of the female villain character br br br Use of the term villain to describe historical figures and real life people br The ethical dimension of history poses the problem of judging those who acted in the past and at times tempts scholars and historians to construct a world of black and white in which the terms hero and villain are used arbitrary and with the pass of time become interchangeable These binaries of course are reflected to varying degrees in endless movies novels and other fictional and non fictional narratives br As processes of globalization connect the world cultures with different historical trajectories and political traditions will need to find ways to work together not only economically but also politically In this evolving framework of globalization tradition according to political theorists like Edmund Burke historical figures perceived and evaluated as either positive or negative become the embodiment of national political cultures that may collude or collide against one another br The usage of villain to describe a historical figure dates back to Tudor propaganda pieces of which ended up influencing William Shakespeare s portrayal of Richard III as a spiteful and hunchback tyrant br br br Sympathetic villain br br The sympathetic villain or anti villain is one with the typical traits of a villainous character but differs in their motivations Their intention to cause chaos or commit evil actions is driven by an ambiguous motivation or is not driven by an intent to cause evil Their intentions may coincide with the ideals of a greater good or even a desire to make the world a better place but their actions are inherently evil in nature An anti villain is the opposite of an anti hero While the anti hero often fights on the side of good but with questionable or selfish motives the anti villain plays a villain s game but for a noble cause in a way that the audience or other characters can sympathize with They may be more noble or heroic than an anti hero but the means to achieve their ends are often considered exploitative immoral unjust or simply evil Characters who fall into this category are often created with the intention of humanizing them making them more relatable to the reader viewer by posing the how and why behind their motivations rather than simply creating a one dimensional character Because of their motives many of these types of villains are commonly nicknamed as anti villains br br American writer Brad Warner has argued that only cartoon villains cackle with glee while rubbing their hands together and dream of ruling the world in the name of all that is wicked and bad American writer Ben Bova recommends to writers that their works not contain villains He states in his Tips for writers In the real world there are no villains No one actually sets out to do evil Fiction mirrors life Or more accurately fiction serves as a lens to focus on what they know in life and bring its realities into sharper clearer understanding for us There are no villains cackling and rubbing their hands in glee as they contemplate their evil deeds There are only people with problems struggling to solve them br Following up on Bova s point American writer David Lubar adds that the villain may be driven by greed neuroses or the conviction that his cause is just but he s driven by something not unlike the things that drive a hero br br br See also br br br br br br External links br Quotations related to Villain at Wikiquote br Media related to Villains at Wikimedia Commons
