Children s literature or juvenile literature includes stories books magazines and poems that are created for children Modern children s literature is classified in two different ways genre or the intended age of the reader from picture books for the very young to young adult fiction br Children s literature can be traced to traditional stories like fairy tales that have only been identified as children s literature in the eighteenth century and songs part of a wider oral tradition that adults shared with children before publishing existed The development of early children s literature before printing was invented is difficult to trace Even after printing became widespread many classic children s tales were originally created for adults and later adapted for a younger audience Since the fifteenth century much literature has been aimed specifically at children often with a moral or religious message Children s literature has been shaped by religious sources like Puritan traditions or by more philosophical and scientific standpoints with the influences of Charles Darwin and John Locke The late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries are known as the Golden Age of Children s Literature because many classic children s books were published then br br br Definition br There is no single or widely used definition of children s literature It can be broadly defined as the body of written works and accompanying illustrations produced in order to entertain or instruct young people The genre encompasses a wide range of works including acknowledged classics of world literature picture books and easy to read stories written exclusively for children and fairy tales lullabies fables folk songs and other primarily orally transmitted materials or more specifically defined as fiction non fiction poetry or drama intended for and used by children and young people xvii One writer on children s literature defines it as all books written for children excluding works such as comic books joke books cartoon books and non fiction works that are not intended to be read from front to back such as dictionaries encyclopedias and other reference materials However others would argue that children s comics should also be included Children s Literature studies has traditionally treated comics fitfully and superficially despite the importance of comics as a global phenomenon associated with children br The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children s Literature notes that the boundaries of genre are not fixed but blurred Sometimes no agreement can be reached about whether a given work is best categorized as literature for adults or children Some works defy easy categorization J K Rowling s Harry Potter series was written and marketed for children but it is also popular among adults The series extreme popularity led The New York Times to create a separate bestseller list for children s books br Despite the widespread association of children s literature with picture books spoken narratives existed before printing and the root of many children s tales go back to ancient storytellers Seth Lerer in the opening of Children s Literature A Reader s History from Aesop to Harry Potter says This book presents a history of what children have heard and read The history I write of is a history of reception br br br History br Early children s literature consisted of spoken stories songs and poems used to educate instruct and entertain children br It was only in the eighteenth century with the development of the concept of childhood that a separate genre of children s literature began to emerge with its own divisions expectations and canon x xi The earliest of these books were educational books books on conduct and simple ABCs often decorated with animals plants and anthropomorphic letters br In French historian Philippe Ari s argues in his book Centuries of Childhood that the modern concept of childhood only emerged in recent times He explains that children were in the past not considered as greatly different from adults and were not given significantly different treatment As evidence for this position he notes that apart from instructional and didactic texts for children written by clerics like the Venerable Bede and lfric of Eynsham there was a lack of any genuine literature aimed specifically at children before the th century br Other scholars have qualified this viewpoint by noting that there was a literature designed to convey the values attitudes and information necessary for children within their cultures such as the Play of Daniel from the twelfth century Pre modern children s literature therefore tended to be of a didactic and moralistic nature with the purpose of conveying conduct related educational and religious lessons br br br Early modern Europe br br During the seventeenth century the concept of childhood began to emerge in Europe Adults saw children as separate beings innocent and in need of protection and training by the adults around them The English philosopher John Locke developed his theory of the tabula rasa in his An Essay Concerning Human Understanding In Locke s philosophy tabula rasa was the theory that the human mind is at birth a blank slate without rules for processing data and that data is added and rules for processing are formed solely by one s sensory experiences A corollary of this doctrine was that the mind of the child was born blank and that it was the duty of the parents to imbue the child with correct notions Locke himself emphasized the importance of providing children with easy pleasant books to develop their minds rather than using force to compel them Children may be cozen d into a knowledge of the letters be taught to read without perceiving it to be anything but a sport and play themselves into that which others are whipp d for He also suggested that picture books be created for children br In the nineteenth century a few children s titles became famous as classroom reading texts Among these were the fables of Aesop and Jean de la Fontaine and Charles Perraults s Tales of Mother Goose The popularity of these texts led to the creation of a number of nineteenth century fantasy and fairy tales for children which featured magic objects and talking animals br Another influence on this shift in attitudes came from Puritanism which stressed the importance of individual salvation Puritans were concerned with the spiritual welfare of their children and there was a large growth in the publication of good godly books aimed squarely at children Some of the most popular works were by James Janeway but the most enduring book from this movement still read today especially in modernised versions is The Pilgrim s Progress by John Bunyan br Chapbooks pocket sized pamphlets that were often folded instead of being stitched were published in Britain illustrated by woodblock printing these inexpensive booklets reprinted popular ballads historical re tellings and folk tales Though not specifically published for children at this time young people enjoyed the booklets as well Johanna Bradley says in From Chapbooks to Plum Cake that chapbooks kept imaginative stories from being lost to readers under the strict Puritan influence of the time br br Hornbooks also appeared in England during this time teaching children basic information such as the alphabet and the Lord s Prayer These were brought from England to the American colonies in the mid seventeenth century br The first such book was a catechism for children written in verse by the Puritan John Cotton Known as Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes it was published in appearing both in England and Boston Another early book The New England Primer was in print by and used in schools for years The primer begins with The young Infant s or Child s morning Prayer and evening prayer It then shows the alphabet vowels consonants double letters and syllables before providing a religious rhyme of the alphabet beginning In Adam s fall We sinned all and continues through the alphabet It also contained religious maxims acronyms spelling help and other educational items all decorated by woodcuts br In the Pentamerone from Italy became the first major published collection of European folk tales Charles Perrault began recording fairy tales in France publishing his first collection in They were not well received among the French literary society who saw them as only fit for old people and children In John Amos Comenius in Bohemia published the informative illustrated Orbis Pictus for children under six learning to read It is considered to be the first picture book produced specifically for children br The first Danish children s book was The Child s Mirror by Niels Bredal in an adaptation of a courtesy book by the Dutch priest Erasmus A Pretty and Splendid Maiden s Mirror an adaptation of a German book for young women became the first Swedish children s book upon its publication Sweden published fables and a children s magazine by br In Italy Giovanni Francesco Straparola released The Facetious Nights of Straparola in the s Called the first European storybook to contain fairy tales it eventually had separate stories and written for an adult audience Giulio Cesare Croce also borrowed from some stories children enjoyed for his books br Russia s earliest children s books primers appeared in the late sixteenth century An early example is ABC Book an alphabet book published by Ivan Fyodorov in The first picture book published in Russia Karion Istomin s The Illustrated Primer appeared in Peter the Great s interest in modernizing his country through Westernization helped Western children s literature dominate the field through the eighteenth century Catherine the Great wrote allegories for children and during her reign Nikolai Novikov started the first juvenile magazine in Russia br br br Origins of the modern genre br br The modern children s book emerged in mid th century England A growing polite middle class and the influence of Lockean theories of childhood innocence combined to create the beginnings of childhood as a concept In an article for the British Library professor MO Grenby writes in the s a cluster of London publishers began to produce new books designed to instruct and delight young readers Thomas Boreman was one Another was Mary Cooper whose two volume Tommy Thumb s Pretty Song Book is the first known nursery rhyme collection But the most celebrated of these pioneers is John Newbery whose first book for the entertainment of children was A Little Pretty Pocket Book br Widely considered the first modern children s book A Little Pretty Pocket Book was the first children s publication aimed at giving enjoyment to children containing a mixture of rhymes picture stories and games for pleasure Newbery believed that play was a better enticement to children s good behavior than physical discipline and the child was to record his or her behaviour daily The book was child sized with a brightly colored cover that appealed to children something new in the publishing industry Known as gift books these early books became the precursors to the toy books popular in the nineteenth century Newbery was also adept at marketing this new genre According to the journal The Lion and the Unicorn Newbery s genius was in developing the fairly new product category children s books through his frequent advertisements and his clever ploy of introducing additional titles and products into the body of his children s books Professor Grenby writes Newbery has become known as the father of children s literature chiefly because he was able to show that publishing children s books could be a commercial success br br The improvement in the quality of books for children and the diversity of topics he published helped make Newbery the leading producer of children s books in his time He published his own books as well as those by authors such as Samuel Johnson and Oliver Goldsmith the latter may have written The History of Little Goody Two Shoes Newbery s most popular book br Another philosopher who influenced the development of children s literature was Jean Jacques Rousseau who argued that children should be allowed to develop naturally and joyously His idea of appealing to a children s natural interests took hold among writers for children Popular examples included Thomas Day s The History of Sandford and Merton four volumes that embody Rousseau s theories Furthermore Maria and Richard Lovell Edgeworth s Practical Education The History of Harry and Lucy urged children to teach themselves br Rousseau s ideas also had great influence in Germany especially on German Philanthropism a movement concerned with reforming both education and literature for children Its founder Johann Bernhard Basedow authored Elementarwerk as a popular textbook for children that included many illustrations by Daniel Chodowiecki Another follower Joachim Heinrich Campe created an adaptation of Robinson Crusoe that went into over printings He became Germany s outstanding and most modern writer for children According to Hans Heino Ewers in The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children s Literature It can be argued that from this time the history of European children s literature was largely written in Germany br br The Brothers Grimm preserved and published the traditional tales told in Germany They were so popular in their home country that modern realistic children s literature began to be looked down on there This dislike of non traditional stories continued there until the beginning of the next century In addition to their collection of stories the Grimm brothers also contributed to children s literature through their academic pursuits As professors they had a scholarly interest in the stories striving to preserve them and their variations accurately recording their sources br A similar project was carried out by the Norwegian scholars Peter Christen Asbj rnsen and J rgen Moe who collected Norwegian fairy tales and published them as Norwegian Folktales often referred to as Asbj rnsen and Moe By compiling these stories they preserved Norway s literary heritage and helped create the Norwegian written language br Danish author and poet Hans Christian Andersen traveled through Europe and gathered many well known fairy tales and created new stories in the fairy tale genre br In Switzerland Johann David Wyss published The Swiss Family Robinson in with the aim of teaching children about family values good husbandry the uses of the natural world and self reliance The book became popular across Europe after it was translated into French by Isabelle de Montolieu br E T A Hoffmann s tale The Nutcracker and the Mouse King was published in in a German collection of stories for children Kinder M rchen It is the first modern short story to introduce bizarre odd and grotesque elements in children s literature and thereby anticipates Lewis Carroll s tale Alice s Adventures in Wonderland There are not only parallels concerning the content the weird adventures of a young girl in a fantasy land but also the origin of the tales as both are dedicated and given to a daughter of the author s friends br br br Golden age br The shift to a modern genre of children s literature occurred in the mid th century didacticism of a previous age began to make way for more humorous child oriented books more attuned to the child s imagination The availability of children s literature greatly increased as well as paper and printing became widely available and affordable the population grew and literacy rates improved br Tom Brown s School Days by Thomas Hughes appeared in and is considered to be the founding book in the school story tradition However it was Lewis Carroll s fantasy Alice s Adventures in Wonderland published in in England that signaled the change in writing style for children to an imaginative and empathetic one Regarded as the first English masterpiece written for children and as a founding book in the development of fantasy literature its publication opened the First Golden Age of children s literature in Britain and Europe that continued until the early s The fairy tale absurdity of Wonderland has solid historical ground as a satire of the serious problems of the Victorian era Lewis Carroll is ironic about the prim and all out regulated life of the golden Victorian century One other noteworthy publication was Mark Twain s book Tom Sawyer which was one of the first boy books intended for children but enjoyed by both children and adults alike These were classified as such for the themes they contained consisting of fighting and work Another important book of that decade was The Water Babies A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby by Rev Charles Kingsley which became extremely popular

s writer in Persian was Mehdi Azar Yazdi His award winning work Good Stories for Good Children is a collection of stories derived from the stories in Classical Persian literature re written for children br br br Nigeria br br Originally for centuries stories were told by Africans in their native languages many being told during social gatherings Stories varied between mythic narratives dealing with creation and basic proverbs showcasing human wisdom These narratives were passed down from generation to generation orally Since its independence in Nigeria has witnessed a rise in the production of children s literature by its people the past three decades contributing the most to the genre Most children s books depict the African culture and lifestyle and trace their roots to traditional folktales riddles and proverbs Authors who have produced such works include Chinua Achebe Cyprian Ekwensi Amos Tutuola Flora Nwapa and Buchi Emecheta Publishing companies also aided in the development of children s literature br br br Classification br Children s literature can be divided into categories either according to genre or the intended age of the reader br br br By genre br A literary genre is a category of literary compositions Genres may be determined by technique tone content or length According to Anderson there are six categories of children s literature with some significant subgenres br br Picture books including concept books that teach the alphabet or counting for example pattern books and wordless books br Traditional literature including folktales which convey the legends customs superstitions and beliefs of people in previous civilizations This genre can be further broken into sub genres myths fables legends and fairy tales br Fiction including fantasy realistic fiction mystery science fiction and historical fiction br Non fiction which can include narrative non fiction which is a true story written in the style of a novel br Biography and autobiography br Poetry and verse which can include novels written entirely in verse br br br By age category br The criteria for these divisions are vague and books near a borderline may be classified either way Books for younger children tend to be written in simple language use large print and have many illustrations Books for older children use increasingly complex language normal print and fewer if any illustrations The categories with an age range are these br br Picture books appropriate for pre readers or children ages br Early reader books appropriate for children ages These are often designed to help children build their reading skills and help them make the transition to becoming independent readers br Chapter books appropriate for children ages br Middle grade fiction appropriate for children ages br Young adult fiction appropriate for children ages br br br Illustration br br Pictures have always accompanied children s stories A papyrus from Byzantine Egypt shows illustrations accompanied by the story of Hercules labors Modern children s books are illustrated in a way that is rarely seen in adult literature except in graphic novels Generally artwork plays a greater role in books intended for younger readers especially pre literate children Children s picture books often serve as an accessible source of high quality art for young children Even after children learn to read well enough to enjoy a story without illustrations they like their elders continue to appreciate the occasional drawings found in chapter books br According to Joyce Whalley in The International Companion Encyclopedia of Children s Literature an illustrated book differs from a book with illustrations in that a good illustrated book is one where the pictures enhance or add depth to the text Using this definition the first illustrated children s book is considered to be Orbis Pictus which was published in by the Moravian author Comenius Acting as a kind of encyclopedia Orbis Pictus had a picture on every page followed by the name of the object in Latin and German It was translated into English in and was used in homes and schools around Europe and Great Britain for many years br br Early children s books such as Orbis Pictus were illustrated by woodcut and many times the same image was repeated in a number of books regardless of how appropriate the illustration was for the story Newer processes including copper and steel engraving were first used in the s One of the first uses of Chromolithography a way of making multi colored prints in a children s book was demonstrated in Struwwelpeter published in Germany in English illustrator Walter Crane refined its use in children s books in the late th century br Another method of creating illustrations for children s books was etching used by George Cruikshank in the s By the s top artists were illustrating for children including Crane Randolph Caldecott Kate Greenaway and John Tenniel Most pictures were still black and white and many color pictures were hand colored often by children The Essential Guide to Children s Books and Their Creators credits Caldecott with The concept of extending the meaning of text beyond literal visualization br Twentieth century artists such as Kay Nielson Edmund Dulac and Arthur Rackham produced illustrations that are still reprinted today Developments in printing capabilities were reflected in children s books After World War II offset lithography became more refined and painter style illustrations such as Brian Wildsmith s were common by the s br Illustrators of Children s Books Horn Book an extensively detailed four volume work by Louise Payson Latimer Bertha E Mahony and Beulah Folmsbee catalogs illustrators of children s books over two centuries br br br Scholarship br Professional organizations dedicated publications individual researchers and university courses conduct scholarship on children s literature Scholarship in children s literature is primarily conducted in three different disciplinary fields literary studies cultural studies literature and language departments and humanities library and information science and education Wolf et al br Typically children s literature scholars from literature departments in universities English German Spanish etc departments cultural studies or in the humanities conduct literary analysis of books This literary criticism may focus on an author a thematic or topical concern genre period or literary device and may address issues from a variety of critical stances poststructural postcolonial New Criticism psychoanalytic new historicism etc Results of this type of research are typically published as books or as articles in scholarly journals br The field of Library and Information Science has a long history of conducting research related to children s literature br Most educational researchers studying children s literature explore issues related to the use of children s literature in classroom settings They may also study topics such as home use children s out of school reading or parents use of children s books Teachers typically use children s literature to augment classroom instruction br br br Translation of children s literature br Translation of children s literature can emerge in various forms and necessitates to have a comprehension of the children s inner worlds and developmental factors Hollindale in takes the attention on the experimental dynamic imaginative interactive and unstable nature of childness Considering that the translation is carried out for children consequently requires to the necessities of the youngest readers and thus the target text can be expected to involve considering effective content creativity the simplest of expression and linguistic playfulness br Beyond age considerations in the translation of children s literature the translators are supposed to comprehend the changing status and essence of youth cultures This arises from the phenomena that works translated for children can be fictions fundamentally produced both for adults and children consisting of genres such as romances fables and fairytales Besides adults might be present in literary works for children as the disguise of a didactic narrator or ironic asides This can have the power to change the implicit adult child relationship in the source text The visuals play an important role in children s literature for younger audience and these visuals might consist of comics graphic novels and picture books Therefore the translators are required to have an understanding of typography visual coding and stylization br Accordingly comprehending the multi medial nature of children s literature and grasping how to compose text and images for promoting active child readers are fundamental for translators to produce effective target texts Scholars such as Oittinen suggests that translators of children s literature would benefit from having a specialized training in arts along with translation studies Puurtinen and Kreller highlights other aspects such as of sound narrative structure syntactic alterations and textual elements like repetition and rhyme and they suggest these components possess crucial roles in translating children s literature It can be said that these suggestions are being further on through critical developments such as edited volumes reviews and collections in the field opening the path for future research directions br br br Distribution br br The US reported revenue of USD billion from children s books in followed by Germany USD billion the UK USD million Spain USD million and France USD million br br br Literary criticism br Controversies often emerge around the content and characters of prominent children s books Well known classics that remain popular throughout decades commonly become criticized by critics and readers as the values of contemporary culture change Critical analysis of children s literature is common through children s literary journals as well as published collections of essays contributed to by psychoanalysts scholars and various literary critics such as Peter Hunt br br br Debate over controversial content br A widely discussed and debated topic by critics and publishers in the children s book industry is whether outdated and offensive content specifically racial stereotypes should be changed in new editions Others argue instead that original content should remain but that publishers should add information to guide parents in conversations with their children about the problematic elements of the particular story Some see racist stereotypes as cultural artifacts that should be preserved In The Children s Culture Reader scholar Henry Jenkins references Herbert R Kohl s essay Should We Burn Babar which raises the debate whether children should be educated on how to think critically towards oppressive ideologies rather than ignore historical mistakes Jenkins suggests that parents and educators should trust children to make responsible judgments br Some books have been altered in newer editions and significant changes can be seen such as illustrator Richard Scarry s book Best Word Book Ever and Roald Dahl s book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory In other cases classics have been rewritten into updated versions by new authors and illustrators Several versions of Little Black Sambo have been remade as more appropriate and without prejudice br br br Stereotypes racism and cultural bias br br Popular classics such as The Secret Garden Pippi Longstocking Peter Pan The Chronicles of Narnia and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory have been criticized for their racial stereotyping br The academic journal Children s Literature Review provides critical analysis of many well known children s books In its th volume the journal discusses the cultural stereotypes in Belgian cartoonist Herge s Tintin series in reference to its depiction of people from the Congo br After the scramble for Africa which occurred between the years of and there was a large production of children s literature which attempted to create an illusion of what life was like for those who lived on the African continent This was a simple technique in deceiving those who only relied on stories and secondary resources Resulting in a new age of books which put a gloss on imperialism and its teachings at the time Thus encouraging the idea that the colonies who were part of the African continent were perceived as animals savages and inhuman like Therefore needing cultured higher class Europeans to share their knowledge and resources with the locals Also promoting the idea that the people within these places were as exotic as the locations themselves Examples of these books include br br Lou lou chez les negres Lou Lou among the blacks br Baba Di ne et Morceau de Sucre br Babar series promoting the French civilizing mission br Tintin au Congo Tintin goes to teach lessons in Congo about their country Belgium br The Five Chinese Brothers written by Claire Huchet Bishop and illustrated by Kurt Wiese has been criticized for its stereotypical caricatures of Chinese people Helen Bannerman s The Story of Little Black Sambo and Florence Kate Upton s The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg have also been noted for their racist and controversial depictions The term sambo a racial slur from the American South caused a widespread banning of Bannerman s book Author Julius Lester and illustrator Jerry Pinkney revised the story as Sam and the Tigers A New Telling of Little Black Sambo making its content more appropriate and empowering for ethnic minority children Feminist theologian Eske Wollrad claimed Astrid Lindgren s Pippi Longstocking novels have colonial racist stereotypes urging parents to skip specific offensive passages when reading to their children Criticisms of the novel The Secret Garden by author Frances Hodgson Burnett claim endorsement of racist attitudes toward black people through the dialogue of main character Mary Lennox Hugh Lofting s The Story of Doctor Dolittle has been accused of white racial superiority by implying through its underlying message that an ethnic minority person is less than human br The picture book The Snowy Day written and illustrated by Ezra Jack Keats was published in and is known as the first picture book to portray an African American child as a protagonist Middle Eastern and Central American protagonists still remain underrepresented in North American picture books According to the Cooperative Children s Books Center CCBC at University of Wisconsin Madison which has been keeping statistics on children s books since the s in out of children s books received by the CCBC that year only were about Africans or African Americans Additionally only of the books were written by Africans or African Americans In his interview in the book Ways of Telling Conversations on the Art of the Picture Book Jerry Pinkney mentioned how difficult it was to find children s books with black children as characters In the literary journal The Black Scholar Bettye I Latimer has criticized popular children s books for their renditions of people as almost exclusively white and notes that Dr Seuss books contain few ethnic minority people The popular school readers Fun with Dick and Jane which ran from the s until the s are known for their whitewashed renditions of the North American nuclear family as well as their highly gendered stereotypes The first black family did not appear in the series until the s thirty years into its run br Writer Mary Renck Jalongo In Young Children and Picture Books discusses damaging stereotypes of Native Americans in children s literature stating repeated depictions of indigenous people as living in the s with feathers and face paint cause children to mistake them as fictional and not as people that still exist today The depictions of Native American people in Laura Ingalls Wilder s Little House on the Prairie and J M Barrie s Peter Pan are widely discussed among critics Wilder s novel based on her childhood in America s midwest in the late s portrays Native Americans as racialized stereotypes and has been banned in some classrooms In her essay Somewhere Outside the Forest Ecological Ambivalence in Neverland from The Little White Bird to Hook writer M Lynn Byrd describes how the natives of Neverland in Peter Pan are depicted as uncivilized valiant fighters unafraid of death and are referred to as redskins which is now considered a racial slur br br br Imperialism and colonialism br The presence of empire as well as pro colonialist and imperialist themes in children s literature have been identified in some of the most well known children s classics of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries br In the French illustrator Jean de Brunhoff s picture book Histoire de Babar le petit elephant The Story of Babar The Little Elephant prominent themes of imperialism and colonialism have been noted and identified as propaganda An allegory for French colonialism Babar easily assimilates himself into the bourgeois lifestyle It is a world where the elephants who have adapted themselves dominate the animals who have not yet been assimilated into the new and powerful civilization H A Rey and Margret Rey s Curious George first published in has been criticized for its blatant slave and colonialist narratives Critics claim the man with the yellow hat represents a colonialist poacher of European descent who kidnaps George a monkey from Africa and sends him on a ship to America Details such as the man in colonialist uniform and Curious George s lack of tail are points in this argument In an article The Wall Street Journal interprets it as a barely disguised slave narrative Rudyard Kipling the author of Just So Stories and The Jungle Book has also been accused of colonial prejudice attitudes Literary critic Jean Webb among others has pointed out the presence of British imperialist ideas in The Secret Garden Colonialist ideology has been identified as a prominent element in Peter Pan by critics br br br Gender roles and representation of women br Some of the earliest children s stories that contain feminist themes are Louisa May Alcott s Little Women and Frank L Baum s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz With many women of this period being represented in children s books as doing housework these two books deviated from this pattern Drawing attention to the perception of housework as oppressive is one of the earliest forms of the feminist movement Little Women a story about four sisters is said to show power of women in the home and is seen as both conservative and radical in nature The character of Jo is observed as having a rather contemporary personality and has even been seen as a representation of the feminist movement It has been suggested that the feminist themes in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz result from influence of Baum s mother in law Matilda Gage an important figure in the suffragist movement Baum s significant political commentary on capitalism and racial oppression are also said to be part of Gage s influence Examples made of these themes is the main protagonist Dorothy who is punished by being made to do housework Another example made of positive representations of women is in Finnish author Tove Jansson s Moomin series which features strong and individualized female characters In recent years there has been a surge in the production and availability of feminist children s literature as well as a rise in gender neutrality in children s literature br In addition to perpetuating stereotypes about appropriate behavior and occupations for women and girls children s books frequently lack female characters entirely or include them only as minor or unimportant characters In the book Boys and Girls Forever Reflections on Children s Classics scholar Alison Lurie says most adventure novels of the th century with few exceptions contain boy protagonists while female characters in books such as those by Dr Seuss would typically be assigned the gender specific roles of receptionists and nurses The Winnie the Pooh characters written by A A Milne are primarily male with the exception of the character Kanga who is a mother to Roo Even animals and inanimate objects are usually identified as being male in children s books The near absence of significant female characters is paradoxical because of the role of women in creating children s literature According to an article published in the Guardian in by Allison Flood Looking at almost children s books published between and the study led by Janice McCabe a professor of sociology at Florida State University found that males are central characters in of children s books published each year with just having female central characters Male animals are central characters in of books per year the study found while female animals star in only br On the one hand Growing up with Dick and Jane highlights the heterosexual nuclear family and also points out the gender specific duties of the mother father brother and sister while Young Children and Picture Books on the other hand encourages readers to avoid books with women who are portrayed as inactive and unsuccessful as well as intellectually inferior and subservient to their fellow male characters to avoid children s books that have repressive and sexist stereotypes for women br In her book Children s Literature From the fin de si cle to the new millennium professor Kimberley Reynolds claims gender division stayed in children s books prominently until the s She also says that capitalism encourages gender specific marketing of books and toys For example adventure stories have been identified as being for boys and domestic fiction intended for girls Publishers often believe that boys will not read stories about girls but that girls will read stories about both boys and girls therefore a story that features male characters is expected to sell better The interest in appealing to boys is also seen in the Caldecott awards which tend to be presented to books that are believed to appeal to boys Reynolds also says that both boys and girls have been presented by limited representations of appropriate behaviour identities and careers through the illustrations and text of children s literature She argues girls have traditionally been marketed books that prepare them for domestic jobs and motherhood Conversely boys are prepared for leadership roles and war During the th century more than children s picture books were published in the U S during that time male characters outnumbered female characters by more than to and male animals outnumbered female animals by to No children s picture book that featured a protagonist with an identifiable gender contained only female characters br I m Glad I m a Boy I m Glad I m a Girl by Whitney Darrow Jr was criticized for narrow career depictions for both boys and girls The book informs the reader that boys are doctors policemen pilots and presidents while girls are nurses meter maids stewardesses and first ladies br Nancy F Cott once said that gender matters that is it matters that human beings do not appear as neuter individuals that they exist as male or female although this binary is always filtered through human perception I should add that when I say gender I am talking about meaning I am talking about something in which interpretation is already involved br In her book La sua barba non poi cos blu Immaginario collettivo e violenza misogina nella fiaba di Perrault translated into Spanish Su barba no era tan azul and winner of the first international CIRSE award Angela Articoni analyzes the fairy tale Bluebeard dwelling on the sentence pronounced by the protagonist to convince herself to accept marriage an expression that recites to repeat the women victims of violence who hope to be able to redeem their prince charming br br br Effect on early childhood development br Bruno Bettelheim in The Uses of Enchantment uses psychoanalysis to examine the impact that fairy tales have on the developing child Bettelheim states the unconscious mind of a child is affected by the ideas behind a story which shape their perception and guides their development Likewise author and illustrator Anthony Browne contends the early viewing of an image in a picture book leaves an important and lasting impression on a child According to research a child s most crucial individual characteristics are developed in their first five years Their environment and interaction with images in picture books have a profound impact on this development and are intended to inform a child about the world br Children s literature critic Peter Hunt argues that no book is innocent of harbouring an ideology of the culture it comes from Critics discuss how an author s ethnicity gender and social class inform their work Scholar Kimberley Reynolds suggests books can never be neutral as their nature is intended as instructional and by using its language children are embedded with the values of that society Claiming childhood as a culturally constructed concept Reynolds states that it is through children s literature that a child learns how to behave and to act as a child should according to the expectations of their culture She also attributes capitalism in certain societies as a prominent means of instructing especially middle class children in how to behave The image of childhood is said to be created and perpetuated by adults to affect children at their most susceptible age Kate Greenaway s illustrations are used as an example of imagery intended to instruct a child in the proper way to look and behave In Roberta Seelinger Trites s book Disturbing the Universe Power and Repression in Adolescent Literature she also argues adolescence is a social construct established by ideologies present in literature In the study The First R How Children Learn About Race and Racism researcher Debra Ausdale studies children in multi ethnic daycare centres Ausdale claims children as young as three have already entered into and begun experimenting with the race ideologies of the adult world She asserts racist attitudes are assimilated using interactions children have with books as an example of how children internalize what they encounter in real life br br br Benefits of children s books br Children s books are critical to child development especially at preschool ages Children have had limited engagement in social contexts at this age Reading books will help them to prepare for future social interactions and real life situations because reading helps language cognitive social and emotional development br Children s books increase language development by introducing new vocabulary and helping children to learn about using language in context Children are also exposed to various words and sentence structures when reading Moreover children s books enhance children s cognitive development in memory attention and imagination Reading allows them to relate to their experience and understanding to make meaning of the sensory message which is how the brain understands the world around them Children s books also benefit children s social and emotional development Reading books help personal development and self understanding by presenting situations and characters with which our own can be compared Children s books often present topics that children can relate to such as love empathy family affection and friendship Reading those books helps children to understand emotion and helps them transfer their learning to social contexts br br br Awards br Many noted awards for children s literature exist in various countries parts of the world or for specific languages br br Africa In Africa The Golden Baobab Prize runs an annual competition for African writers of children s stories It is one of the few
