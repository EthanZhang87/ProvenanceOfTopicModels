id: 69113415
Magical creatures are an important aspect of the fictional world of Narnia contained within The Chronicles of Narnia book series and connected media originally created by C S Lewis Throughout the seven books of the series the protagonists encounter a variety of these creatures as they travel throughout Narnia and the surrounding lands and seas including Archenland Calormen and the Great Eastern Ocean br Much of Lewis Narnian mythology references Greek Norse Arthurian and Christian mythologies among others As a member of the Inklings literary group Lewis was a contemporary of other authors of fiction such as J R R Tolkien and as such they held much discourse regarding different approaches to world building br Some magical creatures are simply larger talking versions of real animals such as beavers bears mice and wolves Other magical creatures are traditional figures associated with various mythologies such as fauns satyrs centaurs and dryads Lewis mythology also includes various deities and species of his own creation br br br Background br At the time C S Lewis wrote The Chronicles of Narnia he was a devout Christian Much of this is reflected through the books which prominently utilize allegories to retell biblical stories in this fantastical setting Perhaps most prominently Lewis wrote the character of Aslan to reflect the figure Jesus Christ mirroring the same journey of a sacrificial death and resurrection as found in the Gospels Tolkien and others have criticized Lewis work as merely a thinly veiled allegory though supporters argue that his work is much more nuanced than it may initially appear br In addition to the prominent Christian message that he sought to present Lewis brings in figures from Greco Roman and Norse mythology Turkish tradition and even specific European folk characters such as Father Christmas br br br List of creatures br br br Centaurs br Centaurs are creatures with the upper torso of a human and the lower legs and body of a horse just as they appear in Greek mythology Unlike most of their counterparts in the Greek myths which are portrayed as wild violent lustful and intoxicated Narnian centaurs are always seen in a positive light more in line with the unique Greek figure Chiron Throughout the books they are seen as wise prophets sages and loyal courtiers Typically they are highly skilled in astronomy and divination using this ability to read the stars and tell of future events In addition they are usually proficient warriors using their great size and strength to their advantage Centaurs are viewed as some of the most majestic and powerful creatures in Narnia and as such fellow Narnians place a great deal of respect on any member of this species br Centaurs appear in five out of seven books in the Chronicles of Narnia series two out of three Disney movie adaptations and other assorted television specials and series based on the works of C S Lewis br In The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe four centaurs are listed among the ranks of Aslan s loyal army described as looking like part English farm horse and part giant from the perspective of the Pevensie children Notably they are all part of the task force sent to help rescue Edmund from the White Witch and all four later participate in the climactic battle against her In addition at least two more appear as stone statues in the White Witch s castle and they are rescued and restored by Aslan as reinforcements for the main army In the Disney film adaptation Aslan s army is much larger than the book with dozens of centaurs both male and female participating in the battle against the White Witch The film also introduces Oreius portrayed by Patrick Kake who is featured prominently as the field leader of the army until the Pevensies arrive Similar to the books Oreius leads a team to help rescue Edmund from the White Witch and he later helps Peter organize the troops in the wake of Aslan s temporary death During the battle Oreius and a rhino hold off the entire enemy army in order to buy time so that Peter and the others can fall back with Oreius getting turned into stone by the White Witch after killing her minotaur general At the Pevensies coronation Oreius can be seen in the crowd apparently restored by Aslan offscreen br Centaurs take their most prominent role in Prince Caspian in the form of Glenstorm and his three sons as part of the Narnian resistance against the Telmarine occupation Glenstorm operates as one of the primary supporters of Prince Caspian as his abilities as a prophet and astronomer make him aware of the coming conflict and Caspian s position as the rightful king based on the movement of the heavenly bodies Tarva and Alambil Glenstorm s stance helps alleviate much of the skepticism from the other Narnians at the Council of Dancing Lawn Later Glenstorm acts as one of Peter s marshals in the latter s duel with Miraz Cornell John portrayed Glenstorm in the Disney film adaptation br In The Silver Chair a centaur healer named Cloudbirth is referenced and two unnamed centaurs provide more insight into the nature of the species These two allow Eustace and Jill to ride them an honor that had and would never be replicated again in the entirety of Narnian history due to the prideful nature of centaurs As the four talk the children learn that centaurs possess both a human and horse digestive system so they require double the sustenance large meals particularly breakfast and long hours of grazing On their journey through Narnia they teach the Eustace and Jill about herbs and roots planets the nine names of Aslan with their meanings and other philosophical subjects br In The Horse and His Boy an unnamed centaur prophesies about the baby Prince Cor one day saving the kingdom of Archenland setting up those very events when someone kidnaps the infant to prevent this from occurring br Centaurs do not appear in any capacity in The Magician s Nephew They are not included in the account of the Creation of Narnia by Aslan so it is unknown at what point they came into existence No doubt Aslan had something to do with their creation as they are all fiercely loyal to him for the rest of the series without exception br In The Last Battle the centaur Roonwit is one of the last remaining loyal subjects to the throne of the Narnian king Tirian Roonwit is the only one initially aware that the ape Shift has allied with the Calormenes and set up a false Aslan basing this on the terrible signs he sees in the skies Tirian tasks Roonwit with gathering those still loyal but Roonwit is slain by Calormen archers Farsight the eagle delivers his final message that all world s draw to an end and that a noble death is a most precious treasure br br br Dragons br Dragons are fire breathing reptiles with bat shaped wings that reside within the different areas of Narnia br In The Voyage of the Dawn Treader Eustace Scrubb discovers the treasure horde of an old sick dragon on one of the islands and he watches as it collapses and dies Eustace sleeps on the treasure and in the morning he finds that he has been transformed into a dragon himself Aslan was able to restore him to normal through an extremely painful process of removing the layers of reptilian scales br In The Silver Chair some dragons were shown sleeping in Underland In The Last Battle these same dragons were awoken on the last day of Narnia and started uprooting all vegetation alongside the giant lizards and the salamanders before rapidly growing old and dying as Narnia ceased to exist br br br Dryads br Dryads and other nature spirits are featured throughout the series Dryads are spirits of the trees and naiads are spirits of water When the Telmarines arrive in Narnia magical creatures are hunted down and the dryads retreat deep within their trees to the point that it is only Aslan who has the ability to wake them A similar process occurs when the Calormenes invade Narnia at the end of time br br br Dwarfs br Referred to as Sons of Earth by Aslan dwarfs are broadly divided into two varieties Red Dwarfs and Black Dwarfs These distinctions are given due to their respective hair colors though there are differences in their personalities as well br br The Red Dwarfs are kind and loyal to Aslan br The Black Dwarfs tend to be more hostile and selfish siding with the White Witch during her rule in the Age of Winter br Both varieties are skilled miners blacksmiths and carpenters in keeping with their title Sons of Earth They are also deadly proficient archers Notable individuals included Trumpkin the Red Dwarf a skeptic who aided Caspian s resistance against the Telmarines and eventually came to truly believe in Aslan and Nikabrik the Black Dwarf who attempted to convince Caspian to try and resurrect the White Witch before the Pevensies arrive and intervene br br br Fauns br Similar to the changes made for the centaurs Lewis tames down the half man half goat fauns from their lustful intoxicated counterparts in Greco Roman mythology though they are still known for enjoying spirited parties in the woods to dance with the dryads Mr Tumnus has the designation of being the first magical creature featured in the series in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Tumnus was also the first character that Lewis came up with while brainstorming the series br br br Giants br Giants are large human shaped creatures that range in size from ten to fifty feet br In The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe some giants are on the side of Aslan while others are on the side of the White Witch One giant named Rumblebuffin was turned to stone by the White Witch and was restored by Aslan He later helped out the reinforcements during the First Battle of Beruna where he used his club on some of the White Witch s minions while also stepping on some of them br In Prince Caspian a giant named Wimbleweather helped Prince Caspian in the Narnians fight with the Telmarines br In The Silver Chair some Narnian giants got lost trying to find Prince Rilian The tribe of giants that live in Ettinsmoor were described as being moronic disorganized and speak an incomprehensible language Further north are the giants of Harfang who are more organized and speak a comprehensible language br br br Marsh wiggles br An original creation by Lewis Marsh wiggles are frog like humanoids that are known for being gloomy cynical creatures who live in distant swamps The most notable individual in the series was Puddleglum who aided Eustace and Jill in their journey in The Silver Chair to save Caspian s lost son br br br Satyrs br Satyrs are creatures that are half human and half goat similar to fauns save for more reddish fur and longer horns In the film satyrs are shown to be more bestial in appearance than fauns covered in fur and having goat like heads while still remaining humanoid in stature br br br Sea serpents br Sea serpents and other massive aquatic monsters are rumored to inhabit the vast oceans to the east of the mainland though most regard these tales as mere superstitions of drunk sailors and pirates However the crew of the Dawn Treader were notably attacked by a large sea serpent that almost destroyed the ship confirming that much of the ocean had yet to be discovered br br br Stars br Narnia has a vast array of star arranged in different constellations than the ones found on Earth Each of the stars are actually powerful sentient beings created by Aslan The exact extent of their strength and knowledge is unknown Some stars can give up this status and take on a mortal form such as the magician Coriakin Others still travel to Earth and retain their abilities such as Ramandu and his daughter Ramandu s daughter in turn would give up her heavenly status and marry King Caspian and the two would have a son Rilian She was killed by the poison of the Lady of the Green Kirtle br At the end of time the stars all return to Earth at the blow of Father Time s horn permanently darkening the night sky br br br Unicorns br Unicorns only appear a couple of times throughout the Narnia mythos Most notably Jewel the unicorn is one of the last remaining loyal subjects of Aslan during the events of The Last Battle and he is King Tirian s closest friend br In the film adaptation of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Peter rides a unicorn into battle before it is wounded by Black Dwarf archers br br br Witches br Two prominent Witches appear in the series br br First Jadis the White Witch infamously took control of Narnia for one hundred years Jadis originally ruled as the Empress of Charn as detailed in The Magician s Nephew Appearing as a tall powerful woman Mr Beaver describes her as a descendant of Lilith Adam s first wife who was also a Jinn She is seen to possess superhuman strength and later comes into possession of a magic wand that can turn living things to stone Jadis tricks Edmund Pevensie into betraying his siblings and this betrayal leads to her presumed victory by killing Aslan who sacrificed himself to allow Edmund to go free However Aslan return from the dead citing Deep Magic and Jadis is killed by him in the First Battle of Beruna br Second the Lady of the Green Kirtle possesses the ability to shapeshift into a green serpent that kills King Caspian s wife and kidnaps his son Artwork made for the books after Lewis death seemed to indicate that the Green Lady and the White Witch were the same person though nothing in Lewis notes supports this The Green Lady does possess powerful abilities of seduction and enchantment with various magic powders and instruments She is eventually killed by the combined efforts of the kidnapped Prince Rilian Eustace Scrubb Jill Pole and Puddleglum the Marsh wiggle br br br Miscellaneous br The following races are not in the sections above br br br Jadis army br In The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe many evil creatures are listed as

magical creatures from Narnia though one of their descendants Caspian X would reclaim the throne and establish peace br br br Talking animals br In The Magician s Nephew Lewis presents the creation account for the world of Narnia by the great lion Aslan who was the first talking animal As one of the final stages of creation Aslan calls forth animals from the ground similar to the biblical story Later Aslan grants some of these animals the ability to speak as he does Throughout the series a number of these talking animals are involved in the storyline primarily as allies to Aslan and the protagonists though some such as the ape Shift operate as antagonists Broadly speaking talking animals can be divided into three categories Avian Mammal and Reptile there are no known talking fish amphibians or invertebrates br In addition to their linguistic capacity talking animals are also designated as being larger in size their non speaking counterparts For example in Prince Caspian the talking mouse Reepicheep is described as being two to three feet tall while standing on his hind legs br Talking animals can permanently lose their ability to speak under certain circumstances During the Telmarine occupation of Narnia magical creatures were hunted down and many talking animals retreated and devolved into dumb beasts One such bear was encountered by the Pevensie children and the red dwarf Trumpkin During the events of The Last Battle a talking cat named Ginger was allied with Shift and the Calormenes In a demonstration of power Ginger enters a stable to pretend to talk to the conglomerate god Tashlan not realizing that Tash himself was inside The incident scares Ginger so badly he flees from the stable and hysterically climbs a tree where the surrounding crowd notice that he visibly shrinks in size and screams nonsense until he reverts to a normal cat a dumb beast br br br Notable individuals br Powerful individuals and deities also make the land of Narnia their home
