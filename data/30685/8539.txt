id: 8539
A devil is the personification of evil as it is conceived in various cultures and religious traditions It is seen as the objectification of a hostile and destructive force Jeffrey Burton Russell states that the different conceptions of the devil can be summed up as a principle of evil independent from God an aspect of God a created being turning evil a fallen angel and a symbol of human evil br Each tradition culture and religion with a devil in its mythos offers a different lens on manifestations of evil The history of these perspectives intertwines with theology mythology psychiatry art and literature developing independently within each of the traditions It occurs historically in many contexts and cultures and is given many different names Satan Lucifer Beelzebub Mephistopheles Iblis and attributes it is portrayed as blue black or red it is portrayed as having horns on its head and without horns and so on While depictions of the devil are usually taken seriously there are times when it is treated less seriously when for example devil figures are used in advertising and on candy wrappers br br The Modern English word devil derives from the Middle English devel from the Old English d ofol that in turn represents an early Germanic borrowing of the Latin diabolus This in turn was borrowed from the Greek di bolos slanderer from diab llein to slander from di across through and b llein to hurl probably akin to the Sanskrit gurate he lifts up br br In his book The Devil Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity Jeffrey Burton Russell discusses various meanings and difficulties that are encountered when using the term devil He does not claim to define the word in a general sense but he describes the limited use that he intends for the word in his book limited in order to minimize this difficulty and for the sake of clarity In this book Russell uses the word devil as the personification of evil found in a variety of cultures as opposed to the word Satan which he reserves specifically for the figure in the Abrahamic religions br In the Introduction to his book Satan A Biography Henry Ansgar Kelly discusses various considerations and meanings that he has encountered in using terms such as devil and Satan etc While not offering a general definition he describes that in his book whenever diabolos is used as the proper name of Satan he signals it by using small caps br The Oxford English Dictionary has a variety of definitions for the meaning of devil supported by a range of citations Devil may refer to Satan the supreme spirit of evil or one of Satan s emissaries or demons that populate Hell or to one of the spirits that possess a demoniac person devil may refer to one of the malignant deities feared and worshiped by heathen people a demon a malignant being of superhuman powers figuratively devil may be applied to a wicked person or playfully to a rogue or rascal or in empathy often accompanied by the word poor to a person poor devil br br In the Bah Faith a malevolent superhuman entity such as a devil or satan is not believed to exist However these terms do appear in the Bah writings where they are used as metaphors for the lower nature of man Human beings are seen to have free will and are thus able to turn towards God and develop spiritual qualities or turn away from God and become immersed in their self centered desires Individuals who follow the temptations of the self and do not develop spiritual virtues are often described in the Bah writings with the word satanic The Bah writings also state that the devil is a metaphor for the insistent self or lower self which is a self serving inclination within each individual Those who follow their lower nature are also described as followers of the Evil One br br In Christianity evil is incarnate in the devil or Satan a fallen angel who is the primary opponent of God Some Christians also considered the Roman and Greek deities to be devils br Christianity describes Satan as a fallen angel who terrorizes the world through evil is the antithesis of truth and shall be condemned together with the fallen angels who follow him to eternal fire at the Last Judgment br In mainstream Christianity the devil is usually referred to as Satan This is because Christian beliefs in Satan are inspired directly by the dominant view of Second Temple Judaism recorded in the Enochian books as expressed practiced by Jesus and with some minor variations Some modern Christians consider the devil to be an angel who along with one third of the angelic host the demons rebelled against God and has consequently been condemned to the Lake of Fire He is described as hating all humanity or more accurately creation opposing God spreading lies and wreaking havoc on their souls br br Satan is traditionally identified as the serpent who convinced Eve to eat the forbidden fruit thus Satan has often been depicted as a serpent In the Bible the devil is identified with the dragon and the old serpent seen in the Book of Revelation as has the prince of this world in the Gospel of John and the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience in the Epistle to the Ephesians and the god of this world in Corinthians He is also identified as the dragon in the Book of Revelation and the tempter of the Gospels br Beelzebub is originally the name of a Philistine god more specifically a certain type of Baal from Ba al Zeb b lit Lord of Flies but is also used in the New Testament as a synonym for the devil A corrupted version Belzeboub appears in The Divine Comedy Inferno XXXIV br In other non mainstream Christian beliefs e g the beliefs of the Christadelphians the word satan in the Bible is not regarded as referring to a supernatural personal being but to any adversary and figuratively refers to human sin and temptation br br In the Book of Wisdom the devil is represented as the one who brought death into the world The Second Book of Enoch contains references to a Watcher called Satanael describing him as the prince of the Grigori who was cast out of heaven and an evil spirit who knew the difference between what was righteous and sinful br In the Book of Jubilees Satan rules over a host of angels Mastema who induced God to test Abraham through the sacrifice of Isaac is identical with Satan in both name and nature The Book of Enoch contains references to Sathariel thought also to be Sataniel and Satan el The similar spellings mirror that of his angelic brethren Michael Raphael Uriel and Gabriel previous to his expulsion from Heaven br br Gnostic and Gnostic influenced religions postulate the idea that the material world is inherently evil The One true God is remote beyond the material universe therefore this universe must be governed by an inferior imposter deity This deity was identified with the deity of the Old Testament by some sects such as the Sethians and the Marcions Tertullian accuses Marcion of Sinope that he br held that the Old Testament was a scandal to the faithful and accounted for it by postulating that Jehovah was a secondary deity a demiurgus who was god in a sense but not the supreme God he was just rigidly just he had his good qualities but he was not the good god who was Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ John Arendzen in the Catholic Encyclopedia mentions that Eusebius accused Apelles the nd century AD Gnostic of considering the Inspirer of Old Testament prophecies to be not a god but an evil angel These writings commonly refer to the Creator of the material world as a demiurgus to distinguish him from the One true God Some texts such as the Apocryphon of John and On the Origin of the World not only demonized the Creator God but also called him by the name of the devil in some Jewish writings Samael br br In the th century in Europe the Cathars who were rooted in Gnosticism dealt with the problem of evil and developed ideas of dualism and demonology The Cathars were seen as a serious potential challenge to the Catholic church of the time The Cathars split into two camps The first is absolute dualism which held that evil was completely separate from the good God and that God and the devil each had power The second camp is mitigated dualism which considers Lucifer to be a son of God and a brother to Christ To explain this they used the parable of the prodigal son with Christ as the good son and Lucifer as the son that strayed into evilness The Catholic Church responded to dualism in AD in the Fourth Lateran Council saying that God created everything from nothing and the devil was good when he was created but he made himself bad by his own free will In the Gospel of the Secret Supper Lucifer just as in prior Gnostic systems appears as a demiurge who created the material world br br In Islam the principle of evil is expressed by two terms referring to the same entity Shaitan meaning astray distant or devil and Iblis Iblis is the proper name of the devil representing the characteristics of evil Iblis is mentioned in the Quranic narrative about the creation of humanity When God created Adam he ordered the angels to prostrate themselves before him All did but Iblis refused and claimed to be superior to Adam out of pride Quran Therefore pride but also envy became a sign of unbelief in Islam Thereafter Iblis was condemned to Hell but God granted him a request to lead humanity astray knowing the righteous would resist Iblis attempts to misguide them In Islam both good and evil are ultimately created by God But since God s will is good the evil in the world must be part of God s plan Actually God allowed the devil to seduce humanity Evil and suffering are regarded as a test or a chance to prove confidence in God Some philosophers and mystics emphasized Iblis himself as a role model of confidence in God because God ordered the angels to prostrate themselves Iblis was forced to choose between God s command and God s will not to praise someone else than God He successfully passed the test yet his disobedience caused his punishment and therefore suffering However he stays patient and is rewarded in the end br Muslims hold that the pre Islamic jinn tutelary deities became subject under Islam to the judgment of God and that those who did not submit to the law of God are devils br Although Iblis is often compared to the devil in Christian theology Islam rejects the idea that Satan is an opponent of God and the implied struggle between God and the devil Iblis might either be regarded as the most monotheistic or the greatest sinner but remains only a creature of God Iblis did not become an unbeliever due to his disobedience but because of attributing injustice to God that is by asserting that the command to prostrate himself before Adam was inappropriate There is no sign of angelic revolt in the Quran and no mention of Iblis trying to take God s throne and Iblis s sin could be forgiven at anytime by God According to the Quran Iblis s disobedience was due to his disdain for humanity a narrative already occurring in early New Testament apocrypha br As in Christianity Iblis was once a pious creature of God but later cast out of Heaven due to his pride However to maintain God s absolute sovereignty Islam matches the line taken by Irenaeus instead of the later Christian consensus that the devil did not rebel against God but against humanity Further although Iblis is generally regarded as a real bodily entity he plays a less significant role as the personification of evil than in Christianity Iblis is merely a tempter notable for inciting humans into sin by whispering into humans minds wasw s akin to the Jewish idea of the devil as yetzer hara br On the other hand Shaitan refers unilaterally to forces of evil including the devil Iblis then he causes mischief Shaitan is also linked to humans psychological nature appearing in dreams causing anger or interrupting the mental preparation for prayer Furthermore the term Shaitan also refers to beings who follow the evil suggestions of Iblis Furthermore the principle of shaitan is in many ways a symbol of spiritual impurity representing humans own deficits in contrast to a true Muslim who is free from anger lust and other devilish desires br In Muslim culture devils are believed to be hermaphrodite creatures created from hell fire with one male and one female thigh By that they procreate without another mate It is generally believed that devils can harm the souls of humans through their whisperings While whisperings tempt humans to sin the devils might enter the hearth qalb of an individual If the devils take over the soul of a person this would render them aggressive or insane In extreme cases the alterings of the soul are believed to have effect on the body matching its spiritual qualities br br In contrast to Occidental philosophy the Sufi idea of seeing Many as One and considering the creation in its essence as the Absolute leads to the idea of the dissolution of any dualism between the ego substance and the external substantial objects The rebellion against God mentioned in the Quran takes place on the level of the psyche that must be trained and disciplined for its union with the spirit that is pure Since psyche drives the body flesh is not the obstacle to humans but rather an unawareness that allows the impulsive forces to cause rebellion against God on the level of the psyche Yet it is not a dualism between body psyche and spirit since the spirit embraces both psyche and corporeal aspects of humanity Since the world is held to be the mirror in which God s attributes are reflected participation in worldly affairs is not necessarily seen as opposed to God The devil activates the selfish desires of the psyche leading the human astray from the Divine Thus it is the I that is regarded as evil and both Iblis and Pharao are present as symbols for uttering I in ones own behavior Therefore it is recommended to use the term I as little as possible It is only God who has the right to say I since it is only God who is self subsistent Uttering I is therefore a way to compare oneself to God regarded as shirk br br Salafi strands of Islam commonly emphasize a dualistic worldview contrasting believers and unbelievers and featuring the devil as the enemy of the faithful who tries to lead them astray from God s path Even though the devil will eventually be defeated by God he remains a serious and dangerous opponent of humans While in classical hadiths the demons Shayateen and the jinn are responsible for impurity and capable of endangering human souls in Salafi thought it is the devil himself who lies in wait for believers always striving to lure them away from God The devil is regarded as an omnipresent entity permanently inciting humans into sin but can be pushed away by remembering the name God The devil is regarded as an external entity threatening the everyday life of the believer even in social aspects of life Thus for example it is the devil who is responsible for Western emancipation br br Yahweh the god in pre exilic Judaism created both good and evil as stated in Isaiah I form the light and create darkness I make peace and create evil I the Lord do all these things The devil does not exist in Jewish scriptures However the influence of Zoroastrianism during the Achaemenid Empire introduced evil as a separate principle into the Jewish belief system which gradually externalized the opposition until the Hebrew term satan developed into a specific type of supernatural entity changing the monistic view of Judaism into a dualistic one Later Rabbinic Judaism rejected the Enochian books written during the Second Temple period under Persian influence which depicted the devil as an independent force of evil besides God After the apocalyptic period references to Satan in the Tanakh are thought to be allegorical br br In Mandaean mythology Ruha fell apart from the World of Light and became the queen of the World of Darkness also referred to as Sheol She is considered evil and a liar sorcerer and seductress She gives birth to Ur also referred to as Leviathan He is portrayed as a large ferocious dragon or snake and is considered the king of the World of Darkness Together they rule the underworld and create the seven planets and twelve zodiac constellations Also found in the underworld is Krun the greatest of the five Mandaean Lords of the underworld He dwells in the lowest depths of creation and his epithet is the mountain of flesh Prominent infernal beings found in the World of Darkness include lilith nalai vampire niuli hobgoblin latabi devil gadalta ghost satani Satan and various other demons and evil spirits br br In Manichaeism God and the devil are two unrelated principles God created good and inhabits the realm of light while the devil also called the prince of darkness created evil and inhabits the kingdom of darkness The contemporary world came into existence when the kingdom of darkness assaulted the kingdom of light and mingled with the spiritual world At the end the devil and his followers will be sealed forever and the kingdom of light and the kingdom of darkness will continue to co exist eternally never to commingle again br Hegemonius th century CE accuses that the Persian prophet Mani founder of the Manichaean sect in the rd century CE identified Jehovah as the devil god which created the world and said that he who spoke with Moses the Jews and the priests is the Prince of Darkness not the god of truth br br Among the Tengristic myths of central Asia Erlik refers to a devil like figure as the ruler of Tamag Hell who was also the first human According to one narrative Erlik and God swam together over the primordial waters When God was about to create the Earth he sent Erlik to dive into the waters and collect some mud Erlik hid some inside his mouth to later create his own world But when God commanded the Earth to expand Erlik got troubled by the mud in his mouth God aided Erlik to spit it out The mud carried by Erlik gave place to the unpleasant areas of the world Because of his sin he was assigned to evil In another variant the creator god is identified with Ulgen Again Erlik appears to be the first human He desired to create a human just as Ulgen did thereupon Ulgen reacted by punishing Erlik casting him into the Underworld where he becomes its ruler br According to Tengrism there is no death meaning that when life comes to an end it is merely a transition into the invisible world As the ruler of Hell Erlik enslaves the souls who are damned to Hell Further he lurks on the souls of those humans living on Earth by causing death disease and illnesses At the time of birth Erlik sends a Kormos to seize the soul of the newborn following him for the rest of his life in an attempt to seize his soul by hampering misguiding and injuring him When Erlik succeeds in destroying a human s body the Kormos sent by Erlik will try take him down into the Underworld However a good soul will be brought to Paradise by a Yayutshi sent by Ulgen Some shamans also made sacrifices to Erlik for gaining a higher rank in the Underworld if they should be damned to Hell br br According to Yazidism there is no entity that represents evil in opposition to God such dualism is rejected by Yazidis and evil is regarded as nonexistent Yazidis adhere to strict monism and are prohibited from uttering the word devil and from speaking of anything related to Hell br br br Zoroastrianism probably introduced the first idea of the devil a principle of evil independently existing apart from God In Zoroastrianism good and evil derive from two ultimately opposed forces The force of good is called Ahura Mazda and the destructive spirit in the Avestan language is called Angra Mainyu The Middle Persian equivalent is Ahriman They are in eternal struggle and neither is all powerful especially Angra Mainyu is limited to space and time in the end of time he will be finally defeated While Ahura Mazda creates what is good Angra Mainyu is responsible for every evil and suffering in the world such as toads and scorpions br Iranian Zoroastrians also considered the Daeva as devil creature because of this in the Shahnameh it is mentioned as both Ahriman Div Persian romanized Ahriman Div as a devil br br A non published manuscript of Spinoza s Ethics contained a chapter Chapter XXI on the devil where Spinoza examined whether the devil may exist or not He defines the devil as an entity which is contrary to God However if the devil is the opposite of God the devil would consist of Nothingness which does not exist br In a paper called On Devils he writes that we can a priori find out that such a thing cannot exist Because the duration of a thing results in its degree of perfection and the more essence a thing possess the more lasting it is and since the devil has no perfection at all it is impossible for the devil to be an existing thing Evil or immoral behaviour in humans such as anger hate envy and all things for which the devil is blamed for could be explained without the proposal of a devil Thus the devil does not have any explanatory power and should be dismissed Occam s razor br Regarding evil through free choice Spinoza asks how it can be that Adam would have chosen sin over his own well being Theology traditionally responds to this by asserting it is the devil who tempts humans into sin but who would have tempted the devil According to Spinoza a rational being such as the devil must have been could not choose his own damnation The devil must have known his sin would lead to doom thus the devil was not knowing or the devil did not know his sin will lead to doom thus the devil would not have been a rational being Spinoza deducts a strict determinism in which moral agency as a free choice cannot exist br br In Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone Immanuel Kant uses the devil as the personification of maximum moral reprehensibility Deviating from the common Christian idea Kant does not locate the morally reprehensible in sensual urges Since evil has to be intelligible only when the sensual is consciously placed above the moral obligation can something be regarded as morally evil Thus to be evil the devil must be able to comprehend morality but consciously reject it and as a spiritual being Geistwesen having no relation to any form of sensual pleasure It is necessarily required for the devil to be a spiritual being because if the devil were also a sensual being it would be possible that the devil does evil to satisfy lower sensual desires and does not act from the mind alone The devil acts against morals not to satisfy sensual lust but solely for the sake of evil As such the devil is unselfish for he does not benefit from his evil deeds br However Kant denies that a human being could ever be completely devilish Kant admits that there are devilish vices ingratitude envy and malicious joy i e vices that do not bring any personal advantage but a person can never be completely a devil In his Lecture on Moral Philosophy Kant gives an example of a tulip seller who was in possession of a rare tulip but when he learned that another seller had the same tulip he bought it from him and then destroyed it instead of keeping it for himself If he had acted according to his sensual urges the seller would have kept the tulip for himself to make a profit but not have destroyed it Nevertheless the destruction of the tulip cannot be completely absolved from sensual impulses since a sensual joy or relief still accompanies the destruction of the tulip and therefore cannot be thought of solely as a violation of morality br Kant further argues that a spiritual devil would be a contradiction If the devil would be defined by doing evil the devil had no free choice in the first place But if the devil had no free choice the devil could not have been held accountable for his actions since he had no free will but was only following his nature br br Honorifics or styles of address used to indicate devil figures br br Opinion polls show that belief in the devil in Western countries is more common in the United States br br where it is more common among the
