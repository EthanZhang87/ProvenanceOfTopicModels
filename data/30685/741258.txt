br Christian elements br br Lewis himself an expert on allegory did not consider The Chronicles of Narnia allegory He saw them as suppositional answering the question What might Christ become like if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours This is not allegory at all Martindale Root While not allegorical Narnia does present significant parallels with elements from Christianity br There are similarities between Peter Pevensie and St Peter who was one of Jesus s original twelve disciples Like St Peter who was given that name from Christ Peter Pevensie is given the name Sir Peter Wolfsbane by Aslan As the traditional first Bishop of Rome St Peter and his successors are primus inter pares or first among equals with the other leaders of the church Similarly Peter Pevensie is given the title of High King Lastly the biblical St Peter according to Catholic tradition was given the keys to the kingdom of heaven and Peter Pevensie shut the door locking it with a golden key sealing the destroyed Narnia after the judgment in The Last Battle Hinten pp br br br Portrayals br In the
