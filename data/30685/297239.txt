The Hero with a Thousand Faces first published in is a work of comparative mythology by Joseph Campbell in which the author discusses his theory of the mythological structure of the journey of the archetypal hero found in world myths br Since the publication of The Hero with a Thousand Faces Campbell s theory has been consciously applied by a wide variety of modern writers and artists Filmmaker George Lucas acknowledged Campbell s theory in mythology and its influence on the Star Wars films br The Joseph Campbell Foundation and New World Library issued a new edition of The Hero with a Thousand Faces in July as part of the Collected Works of Joseph Campbell series of books audio and video recordings In Time named it among the most influential books written in English since br br br Summary br Campbell explores the theory that mythological narratives frequently share a fundamental structure The similarities of these myths brought Campbell to write his book in which he details the structure of the monomyth He calls the motif of the archetypal narrative the hero s adventure In a well known passage from the introduction to The Hero with a Thousand Faces Campbell summarizes the monomyth br br A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man br In laying out the monomyth Campbell describes a number of stages or steps along this journey The hero s adventure begins in the ordinary world He must depart from the ordinary world when he receives a call to adventure With the help of a mentor the hero will cross a guarded threshold leading him to a supernatural world where familiar laws and order do not apply There the hero will embark on a road of trials where he is tested along the way The archetypal hero is sometimes assisted by allies As the hero faces the ordeal he encounters the greatest challenge of the journey Upon rising to the challenge the hero will receive a reward or boon Campbell s theory of the monomyth continues with the inclusion of a metaphorical death and resurrection The hero must then decide to return with this boon to the ordinary world The hero then faces more trials on the road back Upon the hero s return the boon or gift may be used to improve the hero s ordinary world in what Campbell calls the application of the boon br While many myths do seem to follow the outline of Campbell s monomyth there is some variance in the inclusion and sequence of some of the stages Still there is an abundance of literature and folklore that follows the motif of the archetypal narrative paralleling the more general steps of Departure sometimes called Separation Initiation and Return Departure deals with the hero venturing forth on the quest including the call to adventure Initiation refers to the hero s adventures that will test him along the way The last part of the monomyth is the Return which follows the hero s journey home br Campbell studied religious spiritual mythological and literary classics including the stories of Osiris Prometheus the Buddha Moses Mohammed and Jesus The book cites the similarities of the stories and references them as he breaks down the structure of the monomyth br The book includes a discussion of the hero s journey by using the Freudian concepts popular in the s and s Campbell s theory incorporates a mixture of Jungian archetypes unconscious forces and Arnold van Gennep s structuring of rites of passage rituals to provide some illumination The hero s journey continues to influence artists and intellectuals in contemporary arts and culture suggesting a basic usefulness for Campbell s insights beyond mid th century forms of analysis br br br Background br Campbell used the work of early th century theorists to develop his model of the hero see also structuralism including Freud particularly the Oedipus complex Carl Jung archetypal figures and the collective unconscious and Arnold Van Gennep Van Gennep contributed the concept of there being three stages of The Rites of Passage Campbell translated this into Separation Initiation and Return He also looked to the work of psychoanalyst Otto Rank and ethnographers James George Frazer and Franz Boas br Campbell was a noted scholar of James Joyce having co authored A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake with Henry Morton Robinson Campbell borrowed the term monomyth from Joyce s Finnegans Wake In addition Joyce s Ulysses was also highly influential in the structuring of the archetypal motif br br br Publishing history br br The book was originally published by the Bollingen Foundation through Pantheon Press as the

Bliss Mythology and Personal Transformation a book drawn from Campbell s late lectures and workshops he says about artists and the monomyth br br Artists are magical helpers Evoking symbols and motifs that connect us to our deeper selves they can help us along the heroic journey of our own lives br The artist is meant to put the objects of this world together in such a way that through them you will experience that light that radiance which is the light of our consciousness and which all things both hide and when properly looked upon reveal br The hero s journey is one of the universal patterns through which that radiance shows brightly What I think is that a good life is one hero journey after another Over and over again you are called to the realm of adventure you are called to new horizons Each time there is the same problem do I dare And then if you do dare the dangers are there and the help also and the fulfillment or the fiasco There s always the possibility of a fiasco

with a Thousand Faces and found myself thinking if this is true I don t want to know I really would rather not know this stuff I d rather do it because it s true and because I accidentally wind up
