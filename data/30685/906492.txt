The Harry Potter fandom is the community of fans of the Harry Potter books and films who participate in entertainment activities that revolve around the series such as reading and writing fan fiction creating and soliciting fan art engaging in role playing games socialising on Harry Potter based forums and more The fandom interacts online as well as offline through activities such as fan conventions participating in cosplay tours of iconic landmarks relevant to the books and production of the films and parties held for the midnight release of each book and film br By the fourth Harry Potter book the legions of fans had grown so large that considerable security measures were taken to ensure that no copy of book was leaked before the official release date Harry Potter is considered one of the few four quadrant multi generation spanning franchises that exist today despite Rowling s original marketing of the books to tweens and teens br br br Pottermania br br Pottermania is an informal term first used around describing the craze Harry Potter fans have had over the series Fans held midnight parties to celebrate the release of the final four books at bookstores which stayed open on the night leading into the date of the release In Entertainment Weekly listed the midnight release of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as one of Entertainment s Top Moments of the previous years br Diehard fans of the series are called Potterheads Some even theme their weddings around Harry Potter A Bridal Guide featured two real weddings soon before the release of the final film which quickly spread through the fandom via Facebook Twitter and Tumblr br The craze over the series was referenced in Lauren Weisberger s novel The Devil Wears Prada as well as its film adaptation In the story the protagonist Andrea Sachs is ordered to retrieve two copies of the next instalment in the series for her boss s twins before they are published so that they can be privately flown to France where the twins and their mother are on holiday br Some celebrity fans of Harry Potter include Lily Allen Guillermo del Toro Ariana Grande Stephen King Keira Knightley Jennifer Lawrence Evanna Lynch Barack Obama Simon Pegg ASAP Rocky Seth Rogen and Matt Smith br br br Fan sites br There are many fan web sites about Harry Potter on the Internet the oldest ones dating to about or One of the most famous sites allows fans of the book an opportunity to be sorted into a house themselves J K Rowling has an open relationship with her fan base and since periodically hands out a fan site award on her official web site The first site to receive the award was Immeritus a fan site mostly devoted to Sirius Black and about which Rowling wrote I am so proud of the fact that a character whom I always liked very much though he never appeared as much more than a brooding presence in the books has gained a passionate fan club br In after Immeritus Rowling bestowed the honour upon four sites The first was Godric s Hollow for some time however the site s domain name was occupied by advertisers and its content was lost and there is no further record on Rowling s site that Godric s Hollow ever received the award although in the website came back online again albeit with a lot of content missing The next site was the Harry Potter Lexicon an online encyclopedia Rowling has admitted to visiting while writing away from home rather than buying a copy of her books in a store She called it for the dangerously obsessive my natural home The third site of was MuggleNet a web site featuring the latest news in the Potter world among editorials forums and a podcast Rowling wrote when giving the award It s high time I paid homage to the mighty MuggleNet and listed all the features she loved including the pretty much exhaustive information on all books and films The last site was HPANA the first fan site Rowling ever visited faster off the mark with Harry Potter news than any other site Rowling knows and fantastically user friendly br In only The Leaky Cauldron was honoured In Rowling s words it is about the worst kept secret on this website that I am a huge fan of The Leaky Cauldron which she calls a wonderfully well designed mine of accurate information on all things Harry Potter On another occasion Rowling has called the Leaky Cauldron her favourite fan site In the Brazilian website Potterish was the only site honoured in recognition of its style its Potter expertise and its responsible reporting br In May Harry Potter Fan Zone received the award Rowling recognised the insightful editorials as well as praised the site for its young and dedicated staff In December the award went to The Harry Potter Alliance a campaign that seeks to end discrimination genocide poverty AIDS global warming and other real world Dark Arts relating these problems to the books Rowling called the project extraordinary and most inspirational and paralleled its mission to the values for which Dumbledore s Army fought in the books In an article about her in Time magazine Rowling expressed her gratefulness at the site s successful work raising awareness and sign up levels among anti genocide coalitions br At one time Warner Bros which owns the rights to Harry Potter and its affiliates tried to shut down the sites The unsuccessful attempt eventually led to their inviting the webmasters of the top sites to premieres of the films and tours of the film sets because of their close connection with the fans Warner Bros executives have acknowledged that many fans are disappointed that certain elements of the books are left out but not trying to avoid criticism bringing the fan sites into the process is what we feel is really important br These fan sites contain news updates into the world of the books films and film cast members through the use of forums image galleries or video galleries They also host user submitted creations such as fan art or fan fiction br br br Podcasts br The Harry Potter fandom has embraced podcasts as a regular often weekly insight to the latest discussion in the fandom Apple Inc has featured two of the podcasts MuggleCast and PotterCast Both have reached the top spot of iTunes podcast rankings and have been polled one of the top favorite podcasts At the Podcast Awards when MuggleCast and PotterCast each received two nominations for the same two categories the two podcasts teamed up and requested listeners vote for PotterCast in the Best Entertainment category and MuggleCast in the People s Choice category Both podcasts won these respective categories br MuggleCast hosted by MuggleNet staffers was created in August not long after the release of Half Blood Prince Topics of the first show focused on Horcruxes R A B the Goblet of Fire film which was due for release two months later and the website DumbledoreIsNotDead com Since then MuggleCast has held chapter by chapter discussions character analyses and a discussion on a theory of the week MuggleCast has also added humour to their podcast with segments like Spy on Spartz where the hosts would call MuggleNet webmaster Emerson Spartz and reveal his current location or activity with the listening audience British staff member Jamie Lawrence tells a British joke of the week and host Andrew Sims reads an email sent to MuggleNet with a strange request or incoherent talk dubbed Huh Email of the Week MuggleCast is currently the highest rated Harry Potter podcast on the Internet The MuggleCast website will continue to serve as a resource for other Harry Potter fans who want to rediscover the franchise br PotterCast was released less than two weeks after MuggleCast s first episode Produced by The Leaky Cauldron it differed from MuggleCast with a more structured program including various segments and involvement of more people on the Leaky Cauldron staff compared to MuggleCast It also was the first Potter podcast to produce regular interviews with people directly involved with the books and films The first show featured interviews with Stuart Craig art director of the films as well as Bonnie Wright who plays Ginny Weasley PotterCast has also interviewed Matthew Lewis the actor who portrays Neville Longbottom Evanna Lynch Luna Lovegood Jamie Waylett Vincent Crabbe Rupert Grint Ron Weasley Chris Columbus Alfonso Cuar n Mike Newell directors of the first four films Arthur A Levine and Cheryl Klein editors of the books at Scholastic and Rowling herself br The two sites are friendly rivals and have aired several combined episodes which they call The Leaky Mug a separate podcast released on a separate feed from time to time Live joint podcasts have been held in New York City Las Vegas and California From time to time hosts on one podcast will appear on their counterpart br Other notable Harry Potter podcasts include br br Harry Potter and the Sacred Text in which the books are read as if they were a religious text br Witch Please which looks at the books through a feminist lens br Potterotica in which actors read Harry Potter fan fiction aloud br Potterless a comedy podcast in which an adult man reads the books for the first time and tries to predict future plot points br br br Fan fiction br br Rowling has backed fan fiction stories on the Internet stories written by fans that involve Harry Potter or other characters in the books A March study showed that Harry Potter is the most searched for fan fiction subject online Some fans will use canon established in the books to write stories of past and future events in the Harry Potter world others write stories that have little relation to the books other than the characters names and the settings in which the fan fiction takes place On FanFiction Net there are over while Archive of Our Own has over fan fictions on Harry Potter as of August There are numerous websites devoted solely to Harry Potter fan fiction Of these according to rankings on Alexa com HarryPotterFanfiction com has grown to be the most popular br A well known work of fan fiction is The Shoebox Project created by two LiveJournal users Over people subscribe to the story so that they are alerted when new posts update the story The authors works including this project were featured in an article in The Wall Street Journal discussing the growth in popularity of fandoms br The current most reviewed piece of fanfiction with over reviews is All The Young Dudes by someone using the pseudonym of MsKingBean br In the popular bad fanfic My Immortal was posted on FanFiction Net by user Tara Gilesbie It was deleted by the site s administrators in but not before amassing over eight thousand negative reviews It spawned a number of YouTube spoofs and a number of imitators created sequels claiming to be the original Tara br In a web based novel James Potter and the Hall of Elders Crossing was written by a computer animator named George Lippert The book was written as a supplement to fill the void after Deathly Hallows and received eventual approval from Rowling herself br Rowling has said I find it very flattering that people love the characters that much She has adopted a positive position on fan fiction unlike authors such as Anne McCaffrey or Anne Rice who discourage fans from writing about their books and have asked sites like FanFiction Net to remove all stories of their works requests honored by the site However Rowling has been alarmed by pornographic or sexually explicit material clearly not meant for kids according to Neil Blair an attorney for her publisher The attorneys have sent cease and desist letters to sites that host adult material br Potter fan fiction also has a large following in the slash fiction genre stories which feature sexual relationships that do not exist in the books shipping often portraying homosexual pairings Famous pairings include Harry with Draco Malfoy or Cedric Diggory and Remus Lupin with Sirius Black Harry Potter slash has eroded some of the antipathy towards underage sexuality in the wider slash fandom br Tracey T Proctor a moderator of FictionAlley org a Harry Potter fan fiction website said I don t really get into the children s aspect of it but rather the teachers the adult characters I read someone once who said If she didn t want us fantasizing about her characters she needs to stop having these handsome men portraying them And that s the truth It s very hard not to look at Alan Rickman Professor Severus Snape and Jason Isaacs Lucius Malfoy and not get erotic thoughts I have some fan fiction at Fiction Alley You want to write stories about the characters that J K is not writing about their love lives that you don t see in the book br In November Jason Isaacs who played Lucius Malfoy in the Potter films said that he had read fan fiction about his character and gets a huge kick out of the more far out stuff br br br Discussion br Prior to the publication of Deathly Hallows much of the energy of the Potter fandom was devoted to speculation and debate about upcoming plot and character developments To this end clues from the earlier books and deliberate hints from J K Rowling in interviews and on her website were heavily scrutinised by fans In particular fan essays were published on websites such as Mugglenet the world famous editorials the Harry Potter Lexicon and The Leaky Cauldron Scribbulus project among others offering theories comment and analysis on all aspects of the series The Yahoo discussion list Harry Potter for Grown Ups founded in is also noteworthy for its detailed criticism and discussion of the Harry Potter books br Speculation intensified with the July publication of Half Blood Prince and the detailed post publication interview given by Rowling to Mugglenet and The Leaky Cauldron Notably DumbledoreIsNotDead com sought to understand the events of the sixth book in a different way Rowling later confirmed however on August that Dumbledore was in fact dead humorously apologising to the website as she did so A collection of essays Who Killed Albus Dumbledore What Really Happened in Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince Six Expert Harry Potter Detectives Examine the Evidence was published by Zossima Press in November Contributors included the Christian author John Granger and Joyce Odell of Red Hen Publications whose own website contains numerous essays on the Potterverse and fandom itself br In in advance of the arrival of the seventh Potter novel five MuggleNet staff members co authored the reference book Mugglenet Com s What Will Happen in Harry Potter Who Lives Who Dies Who Falls in Love and How Will the Adventure Finally End an anthology of unofficial fan predictions while early in Leaky launched HarryPotterSeven com featuring roundups and predictions from some of the most knowledgeable fans online including Steve Vander Ark of the Lexicon Late additions to the fan scene prior to the publication of Deathly Hallows included BeyondHogwarts com the successor to DumbledoreIsNotDead com which billed itself as the only ongoing online Harry Potter fan conference as well as Book co uk which offered a hypothetical evidence based synopsis of the seventh novel To this day debate and reaction to the novels and films continues on web forums including Mugglenet s Chamber of Secrets community and TLC s Leaky Lounge br br br Fan film and television br br A Italian fan made prequel to the series Voldemort Origins of the Heir depicts the story of Tom Riddle s rise to power The teaser trailer was released on in June receiving exceeded thirty million views in less than hours on Facebook The full movie was later released on YouTube on January receiving over twelve million views in ten days br Hermione Granger and the Quarter Life Crisis is an online TV series focused on Hermione Granger s life after Hogwarts In the show Granger cast as a black woman played by Ashley Romans has broken up with Ron Weasley and moved to Los Angeles to reevaluate her life and choices br A Vulture Works fan made film James Potter and the Heir of the Sword starts with the epilogue of Deathly Hallows Jealous of the relationship between Scorpius Malfoy and Albus Severus Potter Albus brother James is in conflict with Scorpius to be the best brother while the prophecy of King Arthur s Monster which occurs every years hits Hogwarts br br br Conventions br br Fan conventions have been another way that the fandom has congregated Conventions such as Prophecy LeakyCon Infinitus Azkatraz and Ascendio have maintained an academic emphasis hosting professional keynote speakers as well as keeping the atmosphere playful and friendly They have featured prominent members of the fandom such as Jennie Levine owner of SugarQuill net Phoenix Rising Melissa Anelli current webmaster of The Leaky Cauldron Phoenix Rising Leakycon Sue Upton former Senior Editor of the Leaky Cauldron Prophecy Heidi Tandy founder of Fiction Alley Prophecy Paul and Joe DeGeorge of the wizard rock band Harry and the Potters along with several other more well known Wizard Rock bands such as The Remus Lupins The Parselmouths Ministry of Magic and The Whomping Willows see below Prophecy Leakycon Andrew Slack founder of The Harry Potter Alliance and StarKid the cast of the fan made musicals A Very Potter Musical A Very Potter Sequel and A Very Potter Senior Year br Still the conventions try to attract the fandom with other fun filled Potter centric activities often more interactive such as wizarding chess water Quidditch a showing of the Harry Potter films or local cultural immersions Live podcasts are often recorded during these events and live Wizard Rock shows have become a fairly large part of recent conventions Members of the Harry Potter cast have been brought in for the conferences actors such as Evanna Lynch Luna Lovegood and Christopher Rankin Percy Weasley along with several others have appeared to give live Q A sessions and keynote presentations about the series br In addition to fandom specific programming LeakyCon and have hosted LitDays as well as incorporating the many fandoms Harry Potter fans have branched into since the ending of the series LitDays are full of programming with authors agents and editors A few key examples are John Green author of the young adult novels The Fault in Our Stars and Looking for Alaska Scott Westerfeld author of the Uglies series and Leviathan and David Levithan author of Nick Norah s Infinite Playlist and The Lover s Dictionary br These conventions are now incorporating the recently opened theme park The Wizarding World of Harry Potter into their itinerary built inside Universal s Island of Adventure in Orlando Florida At the Harry Potter fan conventions Infinitus LeakyCon and Ascendio special events were held at the theme park dedicated to the series These are after hours events for convention attendees who purchased tickets to experience and explore the park by themselves The event included talks given by creators of the park free food and butterbeer and live wizard rock shows inside the park br br br Festivals br In addition to conventions Harry Potter fandom has further expanded to town festivals including the Chestertown Harry Potter Festival Maryland the Chestnut Hill Harry Potter Festival Philadelphia Edgerton s Harry Potter Festival Wisconsin and the Spellbound Festival Michigan Ontario New York among others The Chestnut Hill event had been held annually for seven years until when it was rebranded under a more general Witches and Wizards theme following a cease and desist letter from Warner Bros br br br Ship debates br br In the fandom the word ship and its derivatives like shipping or shipper are commonly used as shorthand for the word relationship The Harry Potter series generated ship debates with supporters of the prospective relationship between Harry Potter and his close female friend Hermione Granger at odds with supporters of Hermione ending up instead with Ron Weasley close friend of both as well as supporters of Harry ending up with Ginny Weasley Ron s younger sister br An interview with Rowling conducted by fansite webmasters Emerson Spartz MuggleNet and Melissa Anelli The Leaky Cauldron shortly after the book s release proved to be controversial During the interview Spartz commented that Harry Hermione shippers were delusional to which Rowling chuckled though making it clear that she did not share the sentiment and that the Harry Hermione fans were still valued members of her readership This incident resulted in an uproar among Harry Hermione shippers The uproar was loud enough to merit an article in the San Francisco Chronicle br br Rowling s attitude towards the shipping phenomenon has varied between amused and bewildered to frustrated as she revealed in that interview She explained Well you see I m a relative newcomer to the world of shipping because for a long time I didn t go on the net and look up Harry Potter A long time Occasionally I had to because there were weird news stories or something that I would have to go and check because I was supposed to have said something I hadn t said I had never gone and looked at fan sites and then one day I did and oh my god Five hours later or something I get up from the computer shaking slightly all laugh What is going on And it was during that first mammoth session that I met the shippers and it was a most extraordinary thing I had no idea there was this huge underworld seething beneath me br In a later posting on MuggleNet Spartz explained My comments weren t directed at the shippers who acknowledged that Harry Hermione was a long shot but loved the idea of them together It was directed at the militant shippers who insisted that there was overwhelming canon proof and that everyone else was too blind to see it You were delusional you saw what you wanted to see and you have no one to blame for that but yourselves br Rowling has continued to make references less humorous and more to the severity of the shipper conflicts In one instance she has joked about trying to think of ways of proving to Emerson when inviting him for the aforementioned interview that it was really her and not some angry Harry Hermione shipper trying to lure him down a dark alleyway br Rowling stated in a interview with Wonderland magazine that she thought that realistically Ron and Hermione had too much fundamental incompatibility She stated that Ron and Hermione were written together as a form of wish fulfillment as way to reconcile a relationship she herself was once in She went on to say that perhaps with marriage counselling Ron and Hermione would have been all right She also went on to say in a talk at Exeter University that Harry s love for Ginny is true thereby denying any potential canon relationship between Harry and Hermione br br br Other relationships br On a less intense scale other relationships have been doted upon in the fandom from suggestive hints or explicit statements throughout canon such as those between Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson Harry s parents James Potter and Lily Evans Rubeus Hagrid and Olympe Maxime or Percy Weasley and Penelope Clearwater or Rose Granger Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy A potential relationship between Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood was originally dispelled by Rowling though she later retracted this and said she noticed a slight attraction between them in Deathly Hallows br Some couples besides Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermione have been explicitly stated in the series Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour are married in Deathly Hallows after dating throughout Half Blood Prince In Half Blood Prince Nymphadora Tonks keeps her feelings for Remus Lupin to herself but remains depressed when he refuses her advances he feels that his being a werewolf would not create a safe relationship Tonks professes her love for him at the end of the book and she and Lupin have been married by the beginning of Deathly Hallows and have a son Teddy later in the book Other couples such as Harry and Draco or Lupin and Sirius Black are favourites among fans who read fan fiction about them There is also debate about Lily and Severus vs James br br br Roleplaying games br br Roleplaying is a central feature of the Harry Potter fandom There are two primary forms internet based roleplay and live action roleplay or LARP br LARPing often involves re enacting or creating an original Quidditch team Match rules and style of play vary among fandom events but they are generally kept as close as possible to the sport envisioned by Rowling The Lumos symposium included a Quidditch tournament played in water More common are ground based games such as the handball style developed by USA Team Handball and featured at the MuggleNet sponsored Spellbound event as well as the Muggle Quidditch style played intramurally at Millikin University at left This version of quidditch has grown past intramural play is far from LARPing and has an international governing body the IQA br Internet based roleplay tries to simulate the Hogwarts experience Many sites are forum based emphasizing taking classes taught by staff members in order for the players to earn points for their respective houses Some internet based roleplay sites go more in depth into canon and storylines and do not specifically rely on posting as the only method for gaining house points while others have expanded to include activities such as Quidditch dueling and board wide plots Hogwarts school net est for example is a forum based roleplaying game which allows players to take classes engage in extracurriculars and also has many options for adult characters in St Mungos the Daily Prophet and the Ministry of Magic br saw the launch of World of Hogwarts a completely free MMORPG Harry Potter roleplaying game in Second Life set ten years after the Battle of Hogwarts Here roleplayers can create an avatar and interact with other students attend lessons organized by other roleplayers play Quidditch sit for their exams earn and lose points for their house visit Hogsmeade Diagon Alley and the Forbidden Forest get a job at the Ministry of Magic explore several secret passages within the castle and even immerse themselves into intricate and well composed storyline plots that have through time grown into the canon rules of the game br A website created by ISO Interactive called the Chamber of Chat is a free online interactive virtual world under a MMO format Although not a full MMORPG format Chamber of Chat is set up with D virtual chatrooms and avatars where fans can socially interact with each other in Pictionary and Harry Potter Trivial games or participate in discussion groups about Harry Potter or Film media or perform plays as a theater group to other fans as audience They hold special community

place among the SmartFoxServer Showcase Chamber of Chat is an MMO community inspired to the magic worlds of the Harry Potter saga The application is a great example of integration between Director Shockwave client and SmartFoxServer PRO Chamber of Chat has been a long time associated branch of The Leaky network and although as part of the network with The Leaky Cauldron Pottercast and Ask Peeves search engine it was ranked number two behind Indiana Jones s TheRaider Net out of essential fansites of The Best of the Web by Entertainment Weekly in December br Other sites use modified versions of phpBB that allow for a certain level of interactive roleplaying and are what is commonly referred to as forum based roleplaying Interactive gaming can include player versus player features a form of currency for making purchases in stores and non player characters such as monsters that must be fought to gain levels and experience points However these features are more prevalent in games that are not forum based Advancement in such games is usually dependent on live chat multiplayer cooperation and fighting as opposed to taking classes or simply posting to earn points for one s house like at Hogwarts players in forum based games are sometimes sorted into a different group distinguishing different values within a person br br br Landmarks tours br br Some travel agencies have organised a subdivision to create tours specifically highlighting iconic landmarks in the world of Harry Potter HP Fan Trips offered by Beyond Boundaries Travel since in conjunction with fan site HPANA was designed by and for fans of the series and tours noteworthy Potter related locations in the United Kingdom Since they have exclusively chartered steam locomotive Olton Hall the locomotive used in the films as the Hogwarts Express as well as the carriages labeled as such and seen in the movies The travel agency Your Man in Europe began hosting Magical Tours in in conjunction with fan site MuggleNet They offer four different tours through England and Scotland br br These tours primarily feature locations used for shooting in the films though some trips include a Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh which was once Nicholson s Cafe where Rowling wrote much of the manuscript for Harry Potter and the Philosopher s Stone and Edinburgh Castle where Rowling read from the sixth book on the night of its release to an audience of children Filming locations visited include Alnwick Castle where some exterior locations of Hogwarts are shot places in Fort William Scotland Glen Nevis Scotland the Glenfinnan viaduct Christ Church Cathedral in Oxford and the Cloisters located within New College Oxford br br br Wizard rock br br Wizard music sometimes shorthanded as Wrock is a musical movement dating from in Massachusetts with Harry and the Potters though it has grown internationally and has expanded to at least bands Wrock bands mostly consist of young musicians that write and perform songs about the Harry Potter universe and these songs are often written from the point of view of a particular character in the books usually the character who features in the band s name If they are performing live they may also cosplay or dress as that character br In contrast to mainstream bands that have some songs incorporating literary references among a wider repertoire of music notably Led Zeppelin to The Lord of the Rings wizard rock bands take their inspiration entirely from the Harry Potter universe In preserving the promotion of reading too bands like to perform in libraries bookstores and schools The bands have also performed at the fan conventions br br br Documentaries br br br We Are Wizards br We Are Wizards is a feature length documentary by Josh Koury

la magia de una generaci n is a Spanish documentary based on the Harry Potter franchise It covers the franchise s influence on a generation of young people and deals with the multiple values such as friendship love courage and respect which are reflected in the books Numerous professionals in psychology and pedagogy who have studied the significance of the franchise appear The film was released in and has screened in film festivals around Spain br br br Health br In Dr Howard J Bennett coined the term Hogwarts headache in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine shortly after the release of the longest book in the series Order of the Phoenix He described it as a mild condition a tension headache possibly accompanied by neck or wrist pains caused by unhealthily long reading sessions of Harry Potter The symptoms resolved themselves within days of finishing the book His prescription of taking reading breaks was rejected by two of the patients on which he discovered this headache br Researchers at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford found in that the admission rate of children with traumatic injuries to the city s ERs plummeted on the publication weekends of both Order of the Phoenix and Half Blood Prince This was due to the volume of children reading Harry Potter rather than engaging in riskier outdoor activities such as riding of bicycles and scooters climbing trees or playing sports The study was led by Dr Stephen Gwilym whose paper hypothesized that there is a place for a committee of safety conscious talented writers who could produce high quality books for the purpose of injury prevention noting a potential problem with this strategy Obviously if children are always in reading books and not outside getting exercise there is a long term risk of obesity rickets and lack of sunlight br br br See also br br Muggle br br br br br Waters G Mithrandir A Ultimate Unofficial Guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter analysis of Books Niles IL Wizarding
