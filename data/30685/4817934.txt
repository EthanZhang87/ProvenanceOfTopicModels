described by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History where he reports travelers stories from encounters or sightings of Monopods in India Pliny remarks that they are first mentioned by Ctesias in his book Indika India a record of the view of Persians of India which only remains in fragments Pliny describes Monopods like this br br He Ctesias speaks also of another race of men who are known as Monocoli who have only one leg but are able to leap with surprising agility The same people are also called Sciapodae because they are in the habit of lying on their backs during the time of the extreme heat and protect themselves from the sun by the shade of their feet br Philostratus mentions Skiapodes in his Life of Apollonius of Tyana which was cited by Eusebius in his Treatise Against Hierocles Apollonius of Tyana believes the Skiapodes live in India and Ethiopia and asks the Indian sage Iarkhas about their existence br St Augustine mentions the Skiopodes in The City of God Book Chapter entitled Whether Certain Monstrous Races of Men Are Derived From the Stock of Adam or Noah s Sons and mentions that it is uncertain whether such creatures exist br br br Medieval literature br Reference to the legend continued into the Middle Ages for example with Isidore of Seville in his Etymologiae where he writes br br The race of Sciopodes are said to live in Ethiopia they have only one leg and are wonderfully speedy The Greeks call them shade footed ones because when it is hot they lie on their backs on the ground and are shaded by the great size of their foot br The Hereford

Ruck the Monopods cited existence in India refers to the Vedic Aja Ekapad Not born Single foot an epithet for Soma Since Soma is a botanical deity the single foot would represent the stem of an entheogenic plant or fungus br John of Marignolli provides another explanation of these creatures Quote from his travels from India br br The truth is that no such people do exist as nations though there may be an individual monster here and there Nor is there any people at all such as has been invented who have but one foot which they use to shade themselves withal But as all the Indians commonly go naked they are in the habit of carrying a thing like a little tent roof on a cane handle which they open out at will as a protection against sun or rain This they call a chatyr I brought one to Florence with me And this it is which the poets have converted into a foot br br br Fiction br br br Chronicles of Narnia br C S Lewis features monopods in the book The Voyage of the Dawn
