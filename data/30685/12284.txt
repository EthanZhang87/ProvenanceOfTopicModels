id: 12284
A grimoire also known as a book of spells magic book or a spellbook is a textbook of magic typically including instructions on how to create magical objects like talismans and amulets how to perform magical spells charms and divination and how to summon or invoke supernatural entities such as angels spirits deities and demons In many cases the books themselves are believed to be imbued with magical powers The only contents found in a grimoire would be information on spells rituals the preparation of magical tools and lists of ingredients and their magical correspondences In this manner while all books on magic could be thought of as grimoires not all magical books should be thought of as grimoires br While the term grimoire is originally European and many Europeans throughout history particularly ceremonial magicians and cunning folk have used grimoires the historian Owen Davies has noted that similar books can be found all around the world ranging from Jamaica to Sumatra He also noted that in this sense the world s first grimoires were created in Europe and the ancient Near East br br br Etymology br The etymology of grimoire is unclear It is most commonly believed that the term grimoire originated from the Old French word grammaire grammar which had initially been used to refer to all books written in Latin By the th century the term had gained its now common usage in France and had begun to be used to refer purely to books of magic Owen Davies presumed this was because many of them continued to circulate in Latin manuscripts br However the term grimoire later developed into a figure of speech among the French indicating something that was hard to understand In the th century with the increasing interest in occultism among the British following the publication of Francis Barrett s The Magus the term entered English in reference to books of magic br br br History br br br Ancient period br br The earliest known written magical incantations come from ancient Mesopotamia modern Iraq where they have been found inscribed on cuneiform clay tablets that archaeologists excavated from the city of Uruk and dated to between the th and th centuries BC The ancient Egyptians also employed magical incantations which have been found inscribed on amulets and other items The Egyptian magical system known as heka was greatly altered and expanded after the Macedonians led by Alexander the Great invaded Egypt in BC br Under the next three centuries of Hellenistic Egypt the Coptic writing system evolved and the Library of Alexandria was opened This likely had an influence upon books of magic with the trend on known incantations switching from simple health and protection charms to more specific things such as financial success and sexual fulfillment Around this time the legendary figure of Hermes Trismegistus developed as a conflation of the Egyptian god Thoth and the Greek Hermes this figure was associated with writing and magic and therefore of books on magic br The ancient Greeks and Romans believed that books on magic were invented by the Persians The st century AD writer Pliny the Elder stated that magic had been first discovered by the ancient philosopher Zoroaster around the year BC but that it was only written down in the th century BC by the magician Osthanes His claims are not however supported by modern historians br The ancient Jewish people were often viewed as being knowledgeable in magic which according to legend they had learned from Moses who had learned it in Egypt Among many ancient writers Moses was seen as an Egyptian rather than a Jew Two manuscripts likely dating to the th century both of which purport to be the legendary eighth Book of Moses the first five being the initial books in the Biblical Old Testament present him as a polytheist who explained how to conjure gods and subdue demons br Meanwhile there is definite evidence of grimoires being used by certain particularly Gnostic sects of early Christianity In the Book of Enoch found within the Dead Sea Scrolls for instance there is information on astrology and the angels In possible connection with the Book of Enoch the idea of Enoch and his great grandson Noah having some involvement with books of magic given to them by angels continued through to the medieval period br br Israelite King Solomon was a Biblical figure associated with magic and sorcery in the ancient world The st century Romano Jewish historian Josephus mentioned a book circulating under the name of Solomon that contained incantations for summoning demons and described how a Jew called Eleazar used it to cure cases of possession The book may have been the Testament of Solomon but was more probably a different work The pseudepigraphic Testament of Solomon is one of the oldest magical texts It is a Greek manuscript attributed to Solomon and was likely written in either Babylonia or Egypt sometime in the first five centuries AD over years after Solomon s death br The work tells of the building of The Temple and relates that construction was hampered by demons until the archangel Michael gave the King a magical ring The ring engraved with the Seal of Solomon had the power to bind demons from doing harm Solomon used it to lock demons in jars and commanded others to do his bidding although eventually according to the Testament he was tempted into worshiping false gods such as Moloch Baal and Rapha Subsequently after losing favour with God King Solomon wrote the work as a warning and a guide to the reader br When Christianity became the dominant faith of the Roman Empire the early Church frowned upon the propagation of books on magic connecting it with paganism and burned books of magic The New Testament records that after the unsuccessful exorcism by the seven sons of Sceva became known many converts decided to burn their own magic and pagan books in the city of Ephesus this advice was adopted on a large scale after the Christian ascent to power br br br Medieval period br In the Medieval period the production of grimoires continued in Christendom as well as amongst Jews and the followers of the newly founded Islamic faith As the historian Owen Davies noted while the Christian Church was ultimately successful in defeating pagan worship it never managed to demarcate clearly and maintain a line of practice between religious devotion and magic The use of such books on magic continued In Christianised Europe the Church divided books of magic into two kinds those that dealt with natural magic and those that dealt in demonic magic br The former was acceptable because it was viewed as merely taking note of the powers in nature that were created by God for instance the Anglo Saxon leechbooks which contained simple spells for medicinal purposes were tolerated Demonic magic was not acceptable because it was believed that such magic did not come from God but from the Devil and his demons These grimoires dealt in such topics as necromancy divination and demonology Despite this there is ample evidence that the mediaeval clergy were the main practitioners of magic and therefore the owners transcribers and circulators of grimoires while several grimoires were attributed to Popes br br One such Arabic grimoire devoted to astral magic the th century Gh yat al Hak m was later translated into Latin and circulated in Europe during the th century under the name of the Picatrix However not all such grimoires of this era were based upon Arabic sources The th century Sworn Book of Honorius for instance was like the ancient Testament of Solomon before it largely based on the supposed teachings of the Biblical king Solomon and included ideas such as prayers and a ritual circle with the mystical purpose of having visions of God Hell and Purgatory and gaining much wisdom and knowledge as a result Another was the Hebrew Sefer Raziel Ha Malakh translated in Europe as the Liber Razielis Archangeli br A later book also claiming to have been written by Solomon was originally written in Greek during the th century where it was known as the Magical Treatise of Solomon or the Little Key of the Whole Art of Hygromancy Found by Several Craftsmen and by the Holy Prophet Solomon In the th century this work had been translated into Latin and Italian being renamed the Clavicula Salomonis or the Key of Solomon br In Christendom during the medieval age grimoires were written that were attributed to other ancient figures thereby supposedly giving them a sense of authenticity because of their antiquity The German abbot and occultist Trithemius supposedly had a Book of Simon the Magician based upon the New Testament figure of Simon Magus br Similarly it was commonly believed by medieval people that other ancient figures such as the poet Virgil astronomer Ptolemy and philosopher Aristotle had been involved in magic and grimoires claiming to have been written by them were circulated However there were those who did not believe this for instance the Franciscan friar Roger Bacon c stated that books falsely claiming to be by ancient authors ought to be prohibited by law br br br Early modern period br As the early modern period commenced in the late th century many changes began to shock Europe that would have an effect on the production of grimoires Historian Owen Davies classed the most important of these as the Protestant Reformation and subsequent Catholic Counter Reformation The Witch hunts and the advent of printing The Renaissance saw the continuation of interest in magic that had been found in the Medieval period and in this period there was an increased interest in Hermeticism among occultists and ceremonial magicians in Europe largely fueled by the translation of the ancient Corpus hermeticum into Latin by Marsilio Ficino br Alongside this there was a rise in interest in the Jewish mysticism known as the Kabbalah which was spread across the continent by Pico della Mirandola and Johannes Reuchlin The most important magician of the Renaissance was Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa who widely studied occult topics and earlier grimoires and eventually published his own the Three Books of Occult Philosophy in A similar figure was the Swiss magician known as Paracelsus who published Of the Supreme Mysteries of Nature in which he emphasised the distinction between good and bad magic A third such individual was Johann Georg Faust upon whom several pieces of later literature were written such as Christopher Marlowe s Doctor Faustus that portrayed him as consulting with demons br The idea of demonology had remained strong in the Renaissance and several demonological grimoires were published including The Fourth Book of Occult Philosophy which falsely claimed to having been authored by Cornelius Agrippa and the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum which listed demons To counter this the Roman Catholic Church authorised the production of many works of exorcism the rituals of which were often very similar to those of demonic conjuration Alongside these demonological works grimoires on natural magic continued to be produced including Magia Naturalis written by Giambattista Della Porta br Iceland held magical traditions in regional work as well most remarkably the Galdrab k where numerous symbols of mystic origin are dedicated to the practitioner These pieces give a perfect fusion of Germanic pagan and Christian influence seeking splendid help from the Norse gods and referring to the titles of demons br br The advent of printing in Europe meant that books could be mass produced for the first time and could reach an ever growing literate audience Among the earliest books to be printed were magical texts The n minas were one example consisting of prayers to the saints used as talismans It was particularly in Protestant countries such as Switzerland and the German states which were not under the domination of the Roman Catholic Church where such grimoires were published br Despite the advent of print however handwritten grimoires remained highly valued as they were believed to contain inherent magical powers and they continued to be produced With increasing availability people lower down the social scale and women began to have access to books on magic this was often incorporated into the popular folk magic of the average people and in particular that of the cunning folk who were professionally involved in folk magic These works left Europe and were imported to the parts of Latin America controlled by the Spanish and Portuguese empires and the parts of North America controlled by the British and French empires br Throughout this period the Inquisition a Roman Catholic organisation had organised the mass suppression of peoples and beliefs that they considered heretical In many cases grimoires were found in the heretics possessions and destroyed In the church published the Indexes of Prohibited Books in which many grimoires were listed as forbidden including several mediaeval ones such as the Key of Solomon which were still popular br In Christendom there also began to develop a widespread fear of witchcraft which was believed to be Satanic in nature The subsequent hysteria known as The Witch hunts caused the death of around people most of whom were women Sometimes those found with grimoires particularly demonological ones were prosecuted and dealt with as witches but in most cases those accused had no access to such books Iceland which had a relatively high literacy rate proved an exception to this with a third of the witch trials held involving people who had owned grimoires By the end of the Early Modern period and the beginning of the Enlightenment many European governments brought in laws prohibiting many superstitious beliefs in an attempt to bring an end to the Witch Hunts this would invariably affect the release of grimoires br Meanwhile Hermeticism and the Kabbalah would influence the creation of a mystical philosophy known as Rosicrucianism which first appeared in the early th century when two pamphlets detailing the existence of the mysterious Rosicrucian group were published in Germany These claimed that Rosicrucianism had originated with a Medieval figure known as Christian Rosenkreuz who had founded the Brotherhood of the Rosy Cross however there was no evidence for the existence of Rosenkreuz or the Brotherhood br br br th and th centuries br The th century saw the rise of the Enlightenment a movement devoted to science and rationalism predominantly amongst the ruling classes However amongst much of Europe belief in magic and witchcraft persisted as did the witch trials in certain areas Governments tried to crack down on magicians and fortune tellers particularly in France where the police viewed them as social pests who took money from the gullible often in a search for treasure In doing so they confiscated many grimoires br Beginning in the th century a new ephemeral form of printed literature developed in France the Biblioth que bleue Many grimoires published through this circulated among a growing percentage of the populace in particular the Grand Albert the Petit Albert the Grimoire du Pape Honorius and the Enchiridion Leonis Papae The Petit Albert contained a wide variety of magic for instance dealing in simple charms for ailments along with more complex things such as the instructions for making a Hand of Glory br In the late th and early th centuries following the French Revolution of a hugely influential grimoire was published under the title of the Grand Grimoire which was considered particularly powerful because it involved conjuring and making a pact with the devil s chief minister Lucifug Rofocale to gain wealth from him A new version of this grimoire was later published under the title of the Dragon rouge and was available for sale in many Parisian bookstores Similar books published in France at this time included the Black Pullet and the Grimoirium Verum The Black Pullet probably authored in late th century Rome or France differs from the typical grimoires in that it does not claim to be a manuscript from antiquity but told by a man who was a member of Napoleon s armed expeditionary forces in Egypt br The widespread availability of printed grimoires in France despite the opposition of both the rationalists and the church soon spread to neighbouring countries such as Spain and Germany In Switzerland Geneva was commonly associated with the occult at the time particularly by Catholics because it had been a stronghold of Protestantism Many of those interested in the esoteric traveled from Roman Catholic nations to Switzerland to purchase grimoires or to study with occultists Soon grimoires appeared that involved Catholic saints one example that appeared during the th century and became relatively popular particularly in Spain was the Libro de San Cipriano or The Book of St Ciprian which falsely claimed to date from c As with most grimoires of this period it dealt with among other things how to discover treasure br br In Germany with the increased interest in folklore during the th century many historians took an interest in magic and in grimoires Several published extracts of such grimoires in their own books on the history of magic thereby helping to further propagate them Perhaps the most notable of these was the Protestant pastor Georg Conrad Horst who from to published a six volume collection of magical texts in which he studied grimoires as a peculiarity of the Medieval mindset br Another scholar of the time interested in grimoires the antiquarian bookseller Johann Scheible first published the Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses two influential magical texts that claimed to have been written by the ancient Jewish figure Moses The Sixth and Seventh Books of Moses were among the works which later spread to the countries of Scandinavia where in Danish and Swedish grimoires were known as black books and were commonly found among members of the army br In Britain new grimoires continued to be produced throughout the th century such as Ebenezer Sibly s A New and Complete Illustration of the Celestial Science of Astrology In the last decades of that century London experienced a revival of interest in the occult which was further propagated by Francis Barrett s publication of The Magus in The Magus contained many things taken from older grimoires particularly those of Cornelius Agrippa and while not achieving initial popularity upon release it gradually became an influential text br One of Barrett s pupils John Parkin created his own handwritten grimoire The Grand Oracle of Heaven or The Art of Divine Magic although it was never published largely because Britain was at war with France and grimoires were commonly associated with the French The only writer to publish British grimoires widely in the early th century was Robert Cross Smith who released The Philosophical Merlin and The Astrologer of the Nineteenth Century but neither sold well br In the late th century several of these texts including The Book of Abramelin and the Key of Solomon were reclaimed by para Masonic magical organisations such as the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Ordo Templi Orientis br br br th and st centuries br The Secret Grimoire of Turiel claims to have been written in the th century but no copy older than has been produced br A modern grimoire the Simon Necronomicon takes its name from a fictional book of magic in the stories of H P Lovecraft which was inspired by Babylonian mythology and the Ars Goetia one of the five books that make up The Lesser Key of Solomon concerning the summoning of demons The Azo tia of Andrew D Chumbley has been described by Gavin Semple as a modern grimoire br The neopagan religion of Wicca publicly appeared in the s and Gerald Gardner introduced the Book of Shadows as a Wiccan grimoire br The term grimoire commonly serves as an alternative name for a spell book or tome of magical knowledge in fantasy fiction and role playing games The most
