title: Shamanism
id: 26861
Shamanism or samanism is a religious practice that involves a practitioner shaman or saman interacting with the spirit world through altered states of consciousness such as trance The goal of this is usually to direct spirits or spiritual energies into the physical world for the purpose of healing divination or to aid human beings in some other way br Beliefs and practices categorized as shamanic have attracted the interest of scholars from a variety of disciplines including anthropologists archeologists historians religious studies scholars philosophers and psychologists Hundreds of books and academic papers on the subject have been produced with a peer reviewed academic journal being devoted to the study of shamanism br In the th century non Indigenous Westerners involved in countercultural movements such as hippies and the New Age created modern magico religious practices influenced by their ideas of various Indigenous religions creating what has been termed neoshamanism or the neoshamanic movement It has affected the development of many neopagan practices as well as faced a backlash and accusations of cultural appropriation exploitation and misrepresentation when outside observers have tried to practice the ceremonies of or represent centuries old cultures to which they do not belong br br br Terminology br br br Etymology br br The Modern English word shamanism derives from the Russian word am n which itself comes from the word sam n from a Tungusic language possibly from the southwestern dialect of the Evenki spoken by the Sym Evenki peoples or from the Manchu language The etymology of the word is sometimes connected to the Tungus root s meaning to know However Finnish ethnolinguist Juha Janhunen questions this connection on linguistic grounds The possibility cannot be completely rejected but neither should it be accepted without reservation since the assumed derivational relationship is phonologically irregular note especially the vowel quantities br Mircea Eliade noted that the Sanskrit word rama a designating a wandering monastic or holy figure has spread to many Central Asian languages along with Buddhism and could be the ultimate origin of the word shaman The word has been reported in Gandhari as amana in Tocharian A as ma in Tocharian B as am ne and in Chinese as sh m n br The term was adopted by Russians interacting with the indigenous peoples in Siberia It is found in the memoirs of the exiled Russian churchman Avvakum It was brought to Western Europe twenty years later by the Dutch traveler Nicolaes Witsen who reported his stay and journeys among the Tungusic and Samoyedic speaking Indigenous peoples of Siberia in his book Noord en Oost Tataryen Adam Brand a merchant from L beck published in his account of a Russian embassy to China a translation of his book published the same year introduced the word shaman to English speakers br Anthropologist and archeologist Silvia Tomaskova argued that by the mid s many Europeans applied the Arabic term shaitan meaning devil to the non Christian practices and beliefs of Indigenous peoples beyond the Ural Mountains She suggests that shaman may have entered the various Tungus dialects as a corruption of this term and then been told to Christian missionaries explorers soldiers and colonial administrators with whom the people had increasing contact for centuries br A female shaman is sometimes called a shamanka which is not an actual Tungus term but simply shaman plus the Russian suffix ka for feminine nouns br br br Definitions br br There is no single agreed upon definition for the word shamanism among anthropologists Thomas Downson suggests three shared elements of shamanism practitioners consistently alter consciousness the community regards altering consciousness as an important ritual practice and the knowledge about the practice is controlled br The English historian Ronald Hutton noted that by the dawn of the st century there were four separate definitions of the term which appeared to be in use br br The first of these uses the term to refer to anybody who contacts a spirit world while in an altered state of consciousness br The second definition limits the term to refer to those who contact a spirit world while in an altered state of consciousness at the behest of others br The third definition attempts to distinguish shamans from other magico religious specialists who are believed to contact spirits such as mediums witch doctors spiritual healers or prophets by claiming that shamans undertake some particular technique not used by the others Problematically scholars advocating the third view have failed to agree on what the defining technique should be br The fourth definition identified by Hutton uses shamanism to refer to the Indigenous religions of Siberia and neighboring parts of Asia According to the Golomt Center for Shamanic Studies a Mongolian organization of shamans the Evenk word shaman would more accurately be translated as priest br According to the Oxford English Dictionary a shaman SHAH men or is someone who is regarded as having access to and influence in the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits who typically enters into a trance state during a ritual and practices divination and healing The word shaman probably originates from the Tungusic Evenki language of North Asia According to Juha Janhunen the word is attested in all of the Tungusic idioms such as Negidal Lamut Udehe Orochi Nanai Ilcha Orok Manchu and Ulcha and nothing seems to contradict the assumption that the meaning shaman also derives from Proto Tungusic and may have roots that extend back in time at least two millennia The term was introduced to the west after Russian forces conquered the shamanistic Khanate of Kazan in br The term shamanism was first applied by Western anthropologists as outside observers of the ancient religion of the Turks and Mongols as well as those of the neighbouring Tungusic and Samoyedic speaking peoples Upon observing more religious traditions around the world some Western anthropologists began to also use the term in a very broad sense The term was used to describe unrelated magicoreligious practices found within the ethnic religions of other parts of Asia Africa Australasia and even completely unrelated parts of the Americas as they believed these practices to be similar to one another While the term has been incorrectly applied by cultural outsiders to many Indigenous spiritual practices the words shaman and shamanism do not accurately describe the variety and complexity that is Indigenous spirituality Each nation and tribe has its own way of life and uses terms in their own languages br Mircea Eliade writes A first definition of this complex phenomenon and perhaps the least hazardous will be shamanism technique of religious ecstasy Shamanism encompasses the premise that shamans are intermediaries or messengers between the human world and the spirit worlds Shamans are said to treat ailments and illnesses by mending the soul Alleviating traumas affecting the soul or spirit are believed to restore the physical body of the individual to balance and wholeness Shamans also claim to enter supernatural realms or dimensions to obtain solutions to problems afflicting the community Shamans claim to visit other worlds or dimensions to bring guidance to misguided souls and to ameliorate illnesses of the human soul caused by foreign elements Shamans operate primarily within the spiritual world which they believe in turn affects the human world The restoration of balance is said to result in the elimination of the ailment br br br Criticism of the term br br The anthropologist Alice Kehoe criticizes the term shaman in her book Shamans and Religion An Anthropological Exploration in Critical Thinking Part of this criticism involves the notion of cultural appropriation This includes criticism of New Age and modern Western forms of shamanism which according to Kehoe misrepresent or dilute Indigenous practices Kehoe also believes that the term reinforces racist ideas such as the noble savage br Kehoe is highly critical of Mircea Eliade s work on shamanism as an invention synthesized from various sources unsupported by more direct research To Kehoe citing practices such as drumming trance chanting entheogen and hallucinogen use spirit communication and healing as definitive of shamanism ignores the fact that they exist outside of what is defined as shamanism and even play similar roles in nonshamanic cultures for example chanting in the Abrahamic religions She argues that these expression are unique to each culture that uses them and that such practices cannot be generalized easily accurately or usefully into a global religion of shamanism Because of this Kehoe is also highly critical of the hypothesis that shamanism is an ancient unchanged and surviving religion from the Paleolithic period br The term has been criticized for its perceived colonial roots and as a tool to perpetuate perceived contemporary linguistic colonialism By Western scholars the term shamanism is used to refer to a variety of different cultures and practices around the world which can vary dramatically and may not be accurately represented by a single concept Billy Ray Belcourt an author and award winning scholar from the Driftpile Cree Nation in Canada argues that using language with the intention of simplifying culture that is diverse such as Shamanism as it is prevalent in communities around the world and is made up of many complex components works to conceal the complexities of the social and political violence that Indigenous communities have experienced at the hands of settlers Belcourt argues that language used to imply simplicity in regards to Indigenous culture is a tool used to belittle Indigenous cultures as it views Indigenous communities solely as a result of a history embroiled in violence that leaves Indigenous communities only capable of simplicity and plainness br Anthropologist Mih ly Hopp l also discusses whether the term shamanism is appropriate He notes that for many readers ism implies a particular dogma like Buddhism Catholicism or Judaism He recommends using the term shamanhood or shamanship a term used in old Russian and German ethnographic reports at the beginning of the th century for stressing the diversity and the specific features of the discussed cultures He believes that this places more stress on the local variations and emphasizes that shamanism is not a religion of sacred dogmas but linked to the everyday life in a practical way Following similar thoughts he also conjectures a contemporary paradigm shift Piers Vitebsky also mentions that despite really astonishing similarities there is no unity in shamanism The various fragmented shamanistic practices and beliefs coexist with other beliefs everywhere There is no record of pure shamanistic societies although their existence is not impossible Norwegian social anthropologist Hakan Rydving has likewise argued for the abandonment of the terms shaman and shamanism as scientific illusions br Dulam Bumochir has affirmed the above critiques of shamanism as a Western construct created for comparative purposes and in an extensive article has documented the role of Mongols themselves particularly the partnership of scholars and shamans in the reconstruction of shamanism in post post communist Mongolia This process has also been documented by Swiss anthropologist Judith Hangartner in her landmark study of Darhad shamans in Mongolia Historian Karena Kollmar Polenz argues that the social construction and reification of shamanism as a religious other actually began with the th century writings of Tibetan Buddhist monks in Mongolia and later probably influenced the formation of European discourse on Shamanism br br br History br br Shamanism is a system of religious practice Historically it is often associated with Indigenous and tribal societies and involves belief that shamans with a connection to the otherworld have the power to heal the sick communicate with spirits and escort souls of the dead to the afterlife The origins of Shamanism stem from indigenous peoples of far northern Europe and Siberia br Despite structural implications of colonialism and imperialism that have limited the ability of Indigenous peoples to practice traditional spiritualities many communities are undergoing resurgence through self determination and the reclamation of dynamic traditions Other groups have been able to avoid some of these structural impediments by virtue of their isolation such as the nomadic Tuvan with an estimated population of people surviving from this tribe Tuva is one of the most isolated Asiatic tribes in Russia where the art of shamanism has been preserved until today due to its isolated existence allowing it to be free from the influences of other major religions br br br Beliefs br br There are many variations of shamanism throughout the world but several common beliefs are shared by all forms of shamanism Common beliefs identified by Eliade are the following br br Spirits exist and they play important roles both in individual lives and in human society br The shaman can communicate with the spirit world br Spirits can be benevolent or malevolent br The shaman can treat sickness caused by malevolent spirits br The shaman can employ trances inducing techniques to incite visionary ecstasy and go on vision quests br The shaman s spirit can leave the body to enter the supernatural world to search for answers br The shaman evokes animal images as spirit guides omens and message bearers br The shaman can perform other varied forms of divination scry throw bones and sometimes foretell of future events br As Alice Kehoe notes Eliade s conceptualization of shamans produces a universalist image of Indigenous cultures which perpetuates notions of the dead or dying Indian as well as the noble savage br Shamanism is based on the premise that the visible world is pervaded by invisible forces or spirits which affect the lives of the living Although the causes of disease lie in the spiritual realm inspired by malicious spirits both spiritual and physical methods are used to heal Commonly a shaman enters the body of the patient to confront the spiritual infirmity and heals by banishing the infectious spirit br Many shamans have expert knowledge of medicinal plants native to their area and an herbal treatment is often prescribed In many places shamans learn directly from the plants harnessing their effects and healing properties after obtaining permission from the indwelling or patron spirits In the Peruvian Amazon Basin shamans and curanderos use medicine songs called icaros to evoke spirits Before a spirit can be summoned it must teach the shaman its song The use of totemic items such as rocks with special powers and an animating spirit is common br Such practices are presumably very ancient Plato wrote in his Phaedrus that the first prophecies were the words of an oak and that those who lived at that time found it rewarding enough to listen to an oak or a stone so long as it was telling the truth br Belief in witchcraft and sorcery known as brujer a in Latin America exists in many societies Other societies assert all shamans have the power to both cure and kill Those with shamanic knowledge usually enjoy great power and prestige in the community but they may also be regarded suspiciously or fearfully as potentially harmful to others br By engaging in their work a shaman is exposed to significant personal risk as shamanic plant materials can be toxic or fatal if misused Spells are commonly used in an attempt to protect against these dangers and the use of more dangerous plants is often very highly ritualized br br br Soul and spirit concepts br br Soul br Soul can generally explain more seemingly unassociated phenomena in shamanism br Healing br Healing may be based closely on the soul concepts of the belief system of the people served by the shaman It may consist of the supposed retrieving the lost soul of the ill person br Scarcity of hunted game br Scarcity of hunted game can be solved by releasing the souls of the animals from their hidden abodes Besides that many taboos may prescribe the behavior of people towards game so that the souls of the animals do not feel angry or hurt or the pleased soul of the already killed prey can tell the other still living animals that they can allow themselves to be caught and killed br Infertility of women br Infertility of women is thought to be cured by obtaining the soul of the expected child br Spirits br Spirits are invisible entities that only shamans can see They are seen as persons that can assume a human or animal body Some animals in their physical forms are also seen as spirits such as the case of the eagle snake jaguar and rat Beliefs related to spirits can explain many different phenomena For example the importance of storytelling or acting as a singer can be understood better if the whole belief system is examined A person who can memorize long texts or songs and play an instrument may be regarded as the beneficiary of contact with the spirits e g Khanty people br br br Practice br br Generally shamans traverse the axis mundi and enter the spirit world by effecting a transition of consciousness entering into an ecstatic trance either autohypnotically or through the use of entheogens or ritual performances The methods employed are diverse and are often used together br br br Music and songs br br Just like shamanism itself music and songs related to it in various cultures are diverse In several instances songs related to shamanism are intended to imitate natural sounds via onomatopoeia br Sound mimesis in various cultures may serve other functions not necessarily related to shamanism practical goals such as luring game in the hunt or entertainment Inuit throat singing br br br Initiation and learning br Shamans often claim to have been called through dreams or signs However some say their powers are inherited In traditional societies shamanic training varies in length but generally takes years br Turner and colleagues mention a phenomenon called shamanistic initiatory crisis a rite of passage for shamans to be commonly involving physical illness or psychological crisis The significant role of initiatory illnesses in the calling of a shaman can be found in the case history of Chuonnasuan who was one of the last shamans among the Tungus peoples in Northeast China br The wounded healer is an archetype for a shamanic trial and journey This process is important to young shamans They undergo a type of sickness that pushes them to the brink of death This is said to happen for two reasons br br The shaman crosses over to the underworld This happens so the shaman can venture to its depths to bring back vital information for the sick and the tribe br The shaman must become sick to understand sickness When the shaman overcomes their own sickness they believe that they will hold the cure to heal all that suffer br br br Other practices br Ecstatic dancing br Vigils br Fasting br Mariri br br br Items used in spiritual practice br Shamans may employ varying materials in spiritual practice in different cultures br br Drums The drum is used by shamans of several peoples in Siberia The beating of the drum allows the shaman to achieve an altered state of consciousness or to travel on a journey between the physical and spiritual worlds Much fascination surrounds the role that the acoustics of the drum play to the shaman Shaman drums are generally constructed of an animal skin stretched over a bent wooden hoop with a handle across the hoop br br br Roles br br Shamans have been conceptualized as those who are able to gain knowledge and power to heal in the spiritual world or dimension Most shamans have dreams or visions that convey certain messages Shamans may claim to have or have acquired many spirit guides who they believe guide and direct them in their travels in the spirit world These spirit guides are always thought to be present within the shaman although others are said to encounter them only when the shaman is in a trance The spirit guide energizes the shamans enabling them to enter the spiritual dimension Shamans claim to heal within the communities and the spiritual dimension by returning lost parts of the human soul from wherever they have gone Shamans also claim to cleanse excess negative energies which are said to confuse or pollute the soul Shamans act as mediators in their cultures Shamans claim to communicate with the spirits on behalf of the community including the spirits of the deceased Shamans believe they can communicate with both living and dead to alleviate unrest unsettled issues and to deliver gifts to the spirits br Among the Selkups the sea duck is a spirit animal Ducks fly in the air and dive in the water and are thus believed to belong to both the upper world and the world below Among other Siberian peoples these characteristics are attributed to waterfowl in general The upper world is the afterlife primarily associated with deceased humans and is believed to be accessed by soul journeying through a portal in the sky The lower world or world below is the afterlife primarily associated with animals and is believed to be accessed by soul journeying through a portal in the earth In shamanic cultures many animals are regarded as spirit animals br Shamans perform a variety of functions depending upon their respective cultures healing leading a sacrifice preserving traditions by storytelling and songs fortune telling and acting as a psychopomp guide of souls A single shaman may fulfill several of these functions br The responsibilities of a shaman may include either guiding to their proper abode the souls of the dead which may be guided either one at a time or in a group depending on the culture and the curing of ailments The ailments may be either purely physical afflictions such as disease which are claimed to be cured by gifting flattering threatening or wrestling the disease spirit sometimes trying all these sequentially and which may be completed by displaying a supposedly extracted token of the disease spirit displaying this even if fraudulent is supposed to impress the disease spirit that it has been or is in the process of being defeated so that it will retreat and stay out of the patient s body or else mental including psychosomatic afflictions such as persistent terror which is likewise believed to be cured by similar methods In most languages a different term other than the one translated shaman is usually applied to a religious official leading sacrificial rites priest or to a raconteur sage of traditional lore there may be more of an overlap in functions with that of a shaman however in the case of an interpreter of omens or of dreams br There are distinct types of shamans who perform more specialized functions For example among the Nanai people a distinct kind of shaman acts as a psychopomp Other specialized shamans may be distinguished according to the type of spirits or realms of the spirit world with which the shaman most commonly interacts These roles vary among the Nenets Enets and Selkup shamans br The assistant of an Oroqen shaman called jardalanin or second spirit knows many things about the associated beliefs He or she accompanies the rituals and interprets the behaviors of the shaman Despite these functions the jardalanin is not a shaman For this interpretative assistant it would be unwelcome to fall into a trance br br br Ecological aspect br Among the Tucano people a sophisticated system exists for environmental resources management and for avoiding resource depletion through overhunting This system is conceptualized mythologically and symbolically by the belief that breaking hunting restrictions may cause illness As the primary teacher of tribal symbolism the shaman may have a leading role in this ecological management actively restricting hunting and fishing The shaman is able to release game animals or their souls from their hidden abodes The Piaroa people have ecological concerns related to shamanism Among the Inuit the angakkuq shamans fetch the souls of game from remote places or soul travel to ask for game from mythological beings like the Sea Woman br br br Economics br The way shamans get sustenance and take part in everyday life varies across cultures In many Inuit groups they provide services for the community and get a due payment and believe the payment is given to the helping spirits An account states that the gifts and payments that a shaman receives are given by his partner spirit Since it obliges the shaman to use his gift and to work regularly in this capacity the spirit rewards him with the goods that it receives These goods however are only welcome addenda They are not enough to enable a full time shaman Shamans live like any other member of the group as a hunter or housewife Due to the popularity of ayahuasca tourism in South America there are practitioners in areas frequented by backpackers who make a living from leading ceremonies br Furthermore due to the predominant number of female shamans over males shamanism was and continues to be an integral part of women s economic liberation Shamanism often serves as an economic resource due to the requirement of payment for service This economic revenue was vital for female shamans especially those living during the Chosun Dynasty in Korea A D In a culture that disapproved of female economic autonomy the practice of shamanism allowed women to advance themselves financially and independently in a way that had not been possible for them before br br br Academic study br br br Cognitive and evolutionary approaches br There are two major frameworks among cognitive and evolutionary scientists for explaining shamanism The first proposed by anthropologist Michael Winkelman is known as the neurotheological theory According to Winkelman shamanism develops reliably in human societies because it provides valuable benefits to the practitioner their group and individual clients In particular the trance states induced by dancing hallucinogens and other triggers are hypothesized to have an integrative effect on cognition allowing communication among mental systems that specialize in theory of mind social intelligence and natural history With this cognitive integration the shaman can better predict the movement of animals resolve group conflicts plan migrations and provide other useful services br br The neurotheological theory contrasts with the by product or subjective model of shamanism developed by Harvard anthropologist Manvir Singh According to Singh shamanism is a cultural technology that adapts to or hacks our psychological biases to convince us that a specialist can influence important but uncontrollable outcomes Citing work on the psychology of magic and superstition Singh argues that humans search for ways of influencing uncertain events such as healing illness controlling rain or attracting animals As specialists compete to help their clients control these outcomes they drive the evolution of psychologically compelling magic producing traditions adapted to people s cognitive biases Shamanism Singh argues is the culmination of this cultural evolutionary process a psychologically appealing method for controlling uncertainty For example some shamanic practices exploit our intuitions about humanness Practitioners use trance and dramatic initiations to seemingly become entities distinct from normal humans and thus more apparently capable of interacting with the invisible forces believed to oversee important outcomes Influential cognitive and anthropological scientists such as Pascal Boyer and Nicholas Humphrey have endorsed Singh s approach although other researchers have criticized Singh s dismissal of individual and group level benefits br br br Ecological approaches and systems theory br Gerardo Reichel Dolmatoff relates these concepts to developments in the ways that modern science systems theory ecology new approaches in anthropology and archeology treats causality in a less linear fashion He also suggests a cooperation of modern science and Indigenous lore br br br Historical origins br Shamanic practices may originate as early as the Paleolithic predating all organized religions and certainly as early as the Neolithic period The earliest known undisputed burial of a shaman and by extension the earliest undisputed evidence of shamans and shamanic practices dates back to the early Upper Paleolithic era c BP in what is now the Czech Republic br Sanskrit scholar and comparative mythologist Michael Witzel proposes that all of the world s mythologies and also the concepts and practices of shamans can be traced to the migrations of two prehistoric populations the Gondwana type of circa years ago and the Laurasian type of circa years ago br In November researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem announced the discovery of a year old site in Israel that is perceived as one of the earliest known shaman burials The elderly woman had been arranged on her side with her legs apart and folded inward at the knee Ten large stones were placed on the head pelvis and arms Among her unusual grave goods were complete tortoise shells a human foot and certain body parts from animals such as a cow tail and eagle wings Other animal remains came from a boar leopard and two martens It seems that the woman was perceived as being in a close relationship with these animal spirits researchers noted The grave was one of at least graves at the site located in a cave in lower Galilee and belonging to the Natufian culture but is said to be unlike any other among the Epipaleolithic Natufians or in the Paleolithic period br br br Semiotic and hermeneutic approaches br A debated etymology of the word shaman is one who knows implying among other things that the shaman is an expert in keeping together the multiple codes of the society and that to be effective shamans must maintain a comprehensive view in their mind which gives them certainty of knowledge According to this view the shaman uses and the audience understands multiple codes expressing meanings in many ways verbally musically artistically and in dance Meanings may be manifested in objects such as amulets If the shaman knows the culture of their community well and acts accordingly their audience will know the used symbols and meanings and therefore trust the shamanic worker br There are also semiotic theoretical approaches to shamanism and examples of mutually opposing symbols in academic studies of Siberian lore distinguishing a white shaman who contacts sky spirits for good aims by day from a black shaman who contacts evil spirits for bad aims by night Series of such opposing symbols referred to a world view behind them Analogously to the way grammar arranges words to express meanings and convey a world also this formed a cognitive map Shaman s lore is rooted in the folklore of the community which provides a mythological mental map Juha Pentik inen uses the concept grammar of mind br Armin Geertz coined and introduced the hermeneutics or ethnohermeneutics interpretation Hopp l extended the term to include not only the interpretation of oral and written texts but that of visual texts as well including motions gestures and more complex rituals and ceremonies performed for instance by shamans Revealing the animistic views in shamanism but also their relevance to the contemporary world where ecological problems have validated paradigms of balance and protection br br br Decline and revitalization and tradition preserving movements br Traditional Indigenous shamanism is believed to be declining around the world Whalers who frequently interacted with Inuit groups are one source of this decline in that region br br In many areas former shamans ceased to fulfill the functions in the community they used to as they felt mocked by their own community or regarded their own past as deprecated and were unwilling to talk about it to ethnographers br Besides personal communications of former shamans folklore texts may narrate directly about a deterioration process For example a Buryat epic text details the wonderful deeds of the ancient first shaman Kara G rg n he could even compete with God create life steal back the soul of the sick from God without his consent A subsequent text laments that shamans of older times were stronger possessing capabilities like omnividence fortune telling even for decades in the future moving as fast as a bullet br In most affected areas shamanic practices ceased to exist with authentic shamans dying and their personal experiences dying with them The loss of memories is not always lessened by the fact the shaman is not always the only person in a community who knows the beliefs and motives related to the local shaman hood Although the shaman is often believed and trusted precisely because they accommodate to the beliefs of the community several parts of the knowledge related to the local shamanhood consist of personal experiences of the shaman or root in their family life thus those are lost with their death Besides that in many cultures the entire traditional belief system has become endangered often together with a partial or total language shift with the other people of the community remembering the associated beliefs and practices or the language at all grew old or died many folklore memories songs and texts were forgotten which may threaten even such peoples who could preserve their isolation until the middle of the th century like the Nganasan br Some areas could enjoy a prolonged resistance due to their remoteness br br Variants of shamanism among Inuit were once a widespread and very diverse phenomenon but today is rarely practiced as well as already having been in decline among many groups even while the first major ethnological research was being done e g among Inuit at the end of the th century Sagloq the last angakkuq who was believed to be able to travel to the sky and under the sea died and many other former shamanic capacities were lost during that time as well like ventriloquism and sleight of hand br The isolated location of Nganasan people allowed shamanism to be a living phenomenon among them even at the beginning of the th century the last notable Nganasan shaman s ceremonies were recorded on film in the s br After exemplifying the general decline even in the most remote areas there are revitalizations or tradition preserving efforts as a response Besides collecting the memories there are also tradition preserving and even revitalization efforts led by authentic former shamans for example among the Sakha people and Tuvans br Native Americans in the United States do not call their traditional spiritual ways shamanism However according to Richard L Allen research and policy analyst for the Cherokee Nation they are regularly overwhelmed with inquiries by and about fraudulent shamans aka plastic medicine people He adds One may assume that anyone claiming to be a Cherokee shaman spiritual healer or pipe carrier is equivalent to a modern day medicine show and snake oil vendor br There are also neoshamanistic movements which usually differ from traditional shamanistic practice and beliefs in significant ways and often have more connection to the New Age communities than traditional
