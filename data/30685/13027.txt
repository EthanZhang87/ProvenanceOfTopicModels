Jinn Arabic also romanized as djinn or anglicized as genies are invisible creatures in early pre Islamic Arabia and later in Islamic culture and beliefs br Like humans they are accountable for their deeds and can be either believers Muslims or disbelievers kafir depending on whether they accept God s guidance Since jinn are neither innately evil nor innately good Islam acknowledged spirits from other religions and could adapt them during its expansion Jinn are not a strictly Islamic concept they may represent several pagan beliefs integrated into Islam To assert a strict monotheism and the Islamic concept of tawhid oneness of God Islam denies all affinities between the jinn and God thus placing the jinn parallel to humans also subject to God s judgment and afterlife The Quran condemns the pre Islamic Arabian practice of worshipping or seeking protection from them br Although usually invisible jinn are supposed to be composed of thin and subtle bodies Arabic romanized ajs m and can change at will They favor a cockroach snake form but can also choose to appear as scorpions lizards or as humans They may even engage in sexual affairs with humans and produce offspring If they are injured by someone they usually seek revenge or possess the assailant s body requiring exorcism Jinn rarely meddle in human affairs preferring to live with their own kind in tribes similar to those of pre Islamic Arabia br Individual jinn appear on charms and talismans They are called upon for protection or magical aid often under the leadership of a king Many people who believe in jinn wear amulets to protect themselves against the assaults of the jinn sent out by sorcerers and witches A commonly held belief maintains that jinn cannot hurt someone who wears something with the name of God written upon it While some Muslim scholars in the past had ambivalent attitudes towards jinn contemporary Muslim scholarship increasingly associate jinn with idolatry br br br Etymology and translation br br Jinn is an Arabic collective noun deriving from the Semitic root JNN Arabic jann whose primary meaning is to hide or to adapt Some authors interpret the word to mean literally beings that are concealed from the senses Cognates include the Arabic majn n possessed or generally insane jannah garden eden or heaven and jan n embryo Jinn is properly treated as a plural however in Classical Arabic may also appear as j nn with the singular being jinn which the English word genie is derived from br The origin of the word jinn remains uncertain p Some scholars relate the Arabic term jinn to the Latin genius a guardian spirit of people and places in Roman religion as a result of syncretism during the reign of the Roman empire under Tiberius and Augustus p however this derivation is also disputed p Supporters argue that both Roman genii as well as Arabian jinn are considered to be lesser deities inhabiting local sanctuaries trees or springs and persons or families Aramaic ginnaya Classical Syriac with the meaning of tutelary deity p or guardian are attributed to similar functions and are another possible origin of the term jinn br Another suggestion holds that the word is of Persian origin and appeared in the form of the Avestic Jaini a wicked female spirit Jaini were among various creatures in the possibly even pre Zoroastrian mythology of peoples of Iran Wensick advocates a purely Arabic origin of the term asserting that according to the common Semitic view psychic and bodily affections are caused by spirits An object reacting upon such an affect would be an incarnation of said spirit Since these spirits are covered from the sight of humans they would have been called jinn p br The anglicized form genie is a borrowing of the French g nie also from the Latin genius It first appeared in th century translations of the Thousand and One Nights from the French where it had been used owing to its rough similarity in sound and sense and further applies to benevolent intermediary spirits in contrast to the malevolent spirits called demon and heavenly angels in literature In Assyrian art creatures ontologically between humans and divinities are also called genie br Though not a precise fit descriptive analogies that have been used for these beings in Western thought include demon spirit sprite and fairy depending on source p In turn the Arabic translation for the Greek Nymph ar sa is also used for jinn by Middle Eastern sources p Although the term spirit is frequently used it has been criticised for not capturing the corporeal nature of the jinn and that the term genie should be used instead br br br Pre Islamic era br br The exact origins of belief in jinn are not entirely clear pp Belief in jinn in the pre Islamic Arab religion is testified not only by the Quran but also by pre Islamic literature in the seventh century p Some scholars of the Middle East hold that they originated as malevolent spirits residing in deserts and unclean places who often took the forms of animals p others hold that they were originally pagan nature deities who gradually became marginalized as other deities took greater importance pp br br br Fear and veneration br Jinn were already worshipped by many Arabs during the Pre Islamic period p p Julius Wellhausen observed that jinn were often thought to inhabit or haunt desolate dark and dingy places in the desert For that reason they were held responsible for various diseases and mental illnesses p pp Emilie Savage Smith asserts that malicious jinn and good gods were distinct in pre Islamic Arabia but admits that such distinction is not absolute p In the regions north to the Hejaz Palmyra and Baalbek the terms jinni and ilah deity were often used interchangeably Julius Wellhausen likewise agrees that in pre Islamic Arabia it was assumed there are at least some friendly and helpful beings among the jinn He distinguishes between a god and a jinni not on the basis of morality but on the basis of worship the jinn are worshipped in private while the gods are worshipped in public p br Al Jahiz credits the pre Islamic Arabs with believing that the society of jinn constitutes several tribes and groups analogous to pre Islamic Arabian culture Jinn could also protect marry kidnap possess and kill people p Despite being invisible jinn are considered to have bodies ajs m as described by Zakariya al Qazwini they are among animals along with humans burdened beasts like horses cattles wild beasts birds and reptiles p Jinn are further known as shapeshifters often assuming the form of an animal favoring the form of a snake Other chthonic animals regarded as forms of jinn include scorpions and lizards Both scorpions and serpents have been venerated in the ancient Near East br When they shift into a human form however they are said to stay partly animal and are not fully human p p Although the power of jinn usually exceed those of humans it is conceivable a man could kill a jinni in single combat but they are feared for attacking without being seen Some sources even speak of killed jinn leaving behind a carcass similar to either a serpent or a scorpion pp br br br Poetry and Soothsaying br Despite that they were often feared or inspired awe the jinn were also pictured to befriend humans or have romantic feelings for them According to common Arabian belief soothsayers pre Islamic philosophers and poets were inspired by the jinn p pp br The Arabian poet al A sh d after is said to got his inspiration for his poetry by a friend named Mis al da awtu khal l Mis alan and further calls him his jinni brother akh l jinn Similarly the poet Th bit d who later converted to Islam and became known as the poet of the prophet referred to his jinni friend as his sharp sighted brother from the jinn wa akh min al jinn al ba r The relationship between jinn and humans can also be romantic in nature According to one famous Arabian story the jinni Manzur fell in love with a human woman called Habbah He is supposed to have taught her the arts of healing br The mutual relationship between jinn and humans is different than that of a jinni and a soothsayer k hin The soothsayer is presented as someone who is totally controlled by the jinni entering The soothsayer was consulted to reveal hidden information or settle disputes as it was believed the jinn speaking through them reveal hidden knowledge br br br Islam br br br Quran br br Jinn are mentioned approximately times in the Quran p exclusively in Meccan surahs The Quran assumes that the audience is familiar with the subject without elaborating on the jinn much further According to the Quran Muhammad was sent as a prophet to both human and jinn communities and prophets and messengers were sent to both communities br Throughout the Quran humans and jinn al ins wa l jinn appear frequently as a pair designating their equal status in regards of their creation and rejecting that jinn share divinity with the Creator p The term ins derives from anisa which means to be familiar with and refers to recognisable familiar human beings In contrast the term jinn refers to foreign invisible or unknown anthropomorphic beings which are nonetheless subject to the same considerations as the former p They were both created to worship God p Because they are supposed to worship God from free will they are both able for good and evil deeds p They are like humans rational beings formed of nations p br Surah al jinn is about the revelation to jinn p The same Surah mentions righteous jinn on one hand and malicious jinn on the other p The jinn can neither harm nor benefit humans for they are occupied with looking after themselves and their own place in the cosmos p This is in notable contrast to demons and devils in the Judeo Christian tradition p The Quran does not condemn the jinn as a source of harm but by mistaking them for beings deserving cultic veneration p p Jinn and humans are blamed for ascribing divine attributes to another creature i e jinn jinn to themselves and humans to the jinn p p br In the Quranic account despite their similarities there are important differences between the two species Whereas humans are made from clay or dirt jinn were created from smokeless fire Quran Quran p which is possibly the reason why they are credited with some extraordinary abilities such as invisibility transformation and ascending into the air like devils Quran p Despite some superhuman powers the jinn occupy no fundamentally different position in the Quran than humans Like humans the jinn have no knowledge of the future p Like humanity jinn face epistemic limitations regarding the hidden occult have to rely on God s messengers and face eschatological judgement p br br br Exegesis br br In Quranic interpretation the term jinn can be used in two different ways p br br a specific invisible being offspring of abu Jann considered to be along with humans thaqal n accountable for their deeds created out of fire and air Arabic m rijin min n r br any object that cannot be detected by human sensory organs including angels devils and the spiritual interior of human beings br Belief in jinn is not included among the six articles of Islamic faith as belief in angels is Nonetheless many Muslim scholars including the Hanbal scholar ibn Taymiyya and the hir scholar ibn Hazm believe they are essential to the Islamic faith since they are mentioned in the Quran p It is generally accepted by the majority of Muslim scholars that jinn can possess individuals This is considered to be part of the doctrines aqidah of the people of the Sunnah ahl as sunnah wal jammah a in the tradition of Ash ari p The Athar scholars ibn Taimiyya and ibn Qayyim agree on this matter From among the Sunni schools of theology only the M tur d s seems to debate possession Al Rustughfan deemed jinn possession impossible br Al M tur d focuses on the dynamics between jinn and humans based on Quran He states that seeking refuge among the jinn increases fear and anxiety however not because of the jinn but due to the psychological dependence of the individual towards external powers By that he refers to seeking refuge among the jinn as a form of irk due to the reliance on a created thing instead of God p br Although jinn frequently appear in hagiographic Sufi literature and their existence is never doubted they do not play any major role in Sufi cosmology Because of their similarities to humans they function neither as a model to follow like angels nor tempters of the lower self like Satan and mostly feature in poetic anecdotes br br br Jurisprudence br The jinn are obligated to follow the divine law shar a as derived from the Quran by Muslim jurists faq h Thus the jinn are considered along with humans to be mukall f Believers among the jinn are called Muslim jinn muslim l jinn br Since both creations must perform the required prayers salah Muslim jurists debated if one is allowed to perform the prayer behind a jinni Shibli cites two Hanbalite scholars who regard this as permissible without hesitation Since Muhammad was sent to jinn and humans both are mukall f and subject to the command to pray br br Because humans and jinn are capable of procreation Muslim jurists dealt with the issue of permissibility of intercourse between these two types of creatures Some ad ths though considered fabricated maw by some muhaddith hadith scholars pushed the necessity for an explanation The Hour will come when the children of jinn will become many among you br Among you are those who are expatriated mugharrab n and br this he explained meant crossed with jinn br Although there are recorded cases between human jinn relationships most Muslim jurists agree that such a relationship is not permissible Even those scholars who allowed such relationships still considered them undesirable makruh Offspring of human jinn relationships are nonetheless usually considered to be gifted and talented people with special abilities br br br Folklore br br The jinn also known as Albanian Xhindi Turkish Cin Belarusian were adopted by later Islamic culture since the Quran affirms their existence Although depictions are categorized into little tradition folklore and greater tradition official Islam for research purposes both depictions are largely the same br The Quran does not consider foreign mythological beings to be devils but entities erroneously ascribed divine power to Therefore jinn were considered a third class of invisible beings often neutral or morally ambiguous not consequently equated with devils p Islam allowed to integrate local beliefs about spirits and deities from Iran Africa Turkey and India into a monotheistic framework without demonizing them An example of this can be seen in the writings of Syed Sultan who treated Shiva and Parvati as created beings and casts the Suras and Asuras into the roles of the jinn in Islamic haggadic tradition Besides local deities the existence of purely malevolent spirits is also acknowleged Thus jinn exist alongside other mythological entities such as demons D w and fairies par br The moral attitude of the jinn is usually associated with their religion Good jinn are usually considered Muslim jinn or jinn Islam whereas unbelieving jinn were tempted by the devils shayatin and are called k fir jinn or jinn k fir Besides Islam they could also practise Christianity and Judaism Good jinn might teach people moral lessons and might be benevolent or aid spiritual persons such as shamans kam in Central Asia or spiritual healers in Senegal Mediha Esenel s studies in Anatolia mentions the belief that spiritually gifted people can act as intermediaries between humans and jinn br Most of the time jinn are believed not to interfere with humans and live mostly in desolate or abandoned places This is for example evident from the Turkish phrase n Cin top oynuyor It is only when they are angered or disturbed for example if their children are trodden upon or hot water is thrown on them that they take revenge on humans For this reason Muslims utter destur permission before doing something which might accidentally hurt jinn such as sprinkling hot water on public grounds or into bushes so present jinn are advised to leave the place p br Angered or straightforwardly evil mannered jinn could hurt people by inflicting physical damage causing illness or taking control over a human s body A human however cannot be controlled by jinn at any time The individual needs to be in a state of dha iyfah Arabic mental weakness Feelings of insecurity mental instability unhappy love and depression being tired from the soul are forms of dha iyfah In that case it is believed that an exorcism is required to save the person from the assaulting jinni To protect oneself from jinn many Muslims wear amulets with the name of God graved on Jinn are also said to be scared of iron pp and wolves p p br br br Modern and post modern era br br br Post modern literature and movies br br Jinn feature in the magical realism genre introduced into Turkish literature by Latife Tekin who uses magical elements known from pre Islamic and Islamic Anatolian lore Since the s this genre has become prominent in Turkish literature The story by Tekin deals with folkloric and religious belief in a rationalized society br Contrary to the neutral to positive depiction of jinn in Tekin s novels since jinn have become a common trope in Middle Eastern horror movies The presentation of jinn usually combines Quranic with oral and cultural beliefs about jinn Out of films have direct references to jinn as the antagonist use other sorts of demons while other types of horror such as the impending apocalypse hauntings or ghosts constitute only films The popularity of jinn as a choice of monster can best be explained by their affirmation in the Quran They are still a popular trope today A study from shows that jinn are still the favorite Horror element among teenagers Jinn further feature in Iranian horror movies br br br Prevalence of belief br Though discouraged by some teachings of modern Islam cultural beliefs about jinn remain popular among Muslim societies and their understanding of cosmology and anthropology Affirmation on the existence of jinn as sapient creatures living along with humans is still widespread in the Middle Eastern world and West Africa Mental illnesses are still often attributed to jinn possession In modern Iran evil jinn are often substituted by devils Similarly in many modern tales the term jinn is used for div demon causing a shift in meaning Nonetheless belief in jinn remains popular br According to a survey undertaken by the Pew Research Center in br br The amount of Muslims believing in jinn from Bosnia and Herzegovina is higher than the general European average although only believe in sorcery and would wear talisman for protection against jinn support offerings and appeal given to the jinn br Sleep paralysis is understood as a jinn attack by many sleep paralysis sufferers in Egypt as discovered by a Cambridge neuroscience study Jalal Simons Rudolph Jalal Hinton The study found that as many as of those who experience sleep paralysis in Egypt believe it to be an assault by the jinn Almost all of these sleep paralysis sufferers would recite verses from the Quran during sleep paralysis to prevent future jinn attacks In addition some would increase their daily Islamic prayer al h to get rid of these assaults by jinn Sleep paralysis is generally associated with great fear in Egypt especially if believed to be supernatural in origin br Similarly European patients with a Muslim background often attribute mental illnesses to jinn Most common attributations to jinn are symptoms of hallucination and psychotic symptoms but can also include mood disorders obsessive compulsive disorder OCD Capgras syndrome and epilepsy br It has been noted that not all Muslims who believe in jinn believe they can possess people Furthermore belief in possession is not limited to Muslims Contrary to the assumption that higher education is proportional to disenchantment belief in jinn possession may remain intact even after medical graduation br br br Visual art br br Although there are very few visual representations of jinn in Islamic art when they do appear it is usually related to a specific event or individual jinn br Visual representations of jinn appear in manuscripts and their existence is often implied in works of architecture by the presence of apotropaic devices like serpents which were intended to ward off evil spirits Lastly King Solomon is illustrated very often with jinn as the commander of an army that included them br br br Architectural representation br br In addition to these representations of jinn in vicinity to kingship there were also architectural references to jinn throughout the Islamic world In the Citadel of Aleppo the entrance gate Bab al Hayyat made reference to jinn in the stone relief carvings of serpents likewise the water gate at Ayyubid Harran housed two copper sculptures of jinn serving as talismans to ward off both snakes and evil jinn in the form of snakes p br Alongside these depictions of the jinn found at the Aleppo Citadel depictions of the jinn can be found in the R m Seljuk palace There are a phenomenal range of creatures that can be found on the eight pointed tiles of the Seal of Sulaym n device p Among these were the jinn that belonged among Solomon s army and as Solomon claimed to have control over the jinn so did the R m Seljuk sultan that claimed to be the Sulaym n of his time p In fact one of the most common representations of jinn are alongside or in association with King Solomon It was thought that King Solomon had very close ties to the jinn and even had control over many of them p The concept that a great and just ruler has the ability to command jinn was one that extended far past only King Solomon it was also thought that emperors such as Alexander the Great could control an army of jinn in a similar way p Given this association Jinn were often seen with Solomon in a princely or kingly context such as the small animal like jinn sitting beside King Solomon on his throne illustrated in an illuminated manuscript of Aja ib al Makhluqat by Zakariya al Qazwini written in the th century br br br In the Kit b al Bulh n br br In the Book of Wonders compiled in the th century by Abd al Hasan al Isfahani there are illustrations of various supernatural beings demons af r t jinn the evil eye devils lilith celestial spirits etc p br Each celestial spirits is referred to as a King of the Jinn represented alongside his spiritual helpers and alongside the corresponding talismanic symbols p For instance the Red King of Tuesday was depicted in the Book of Wonders as a sinister form astride a lion In the same illustration he holds a severed head and a sword because the Red King of Tuesday was aligned with Mars the god of war p Alongside that there were illustrations of the Gold King and the White King p br Aside from the seven Kings of the Jinn the Book of Wonders included an illustration of Huma Arabic or the Fever Huma was depicted as three headed and as embracing the room around him in order to capture someone and bring on a fever in them p br br br Talismanic representation br br The jinn had an indirect impact on Islamic art through the creation of talismans that were alleged to guard the bearer from the jinn and were enclosed in leather and included Qur anic verses p It was not unusual for those talismans to be inscribed with separated Arabic letters because the separation of those letters was thought to positively affect the potency of the talisman overall p An object that was inscribed with the word of Allah was thought to have the power to ward off evil from the person who obtained the object though many of these objects also had astrological signs depictions of prophets or religious narratives br br br Magical practises br br Jinn might be invoked along with demons and devils for means of sorcery incantation protection or divination Soothsayers k hin are credited with the ability to ask jinn about things of the past since their lives are believed to last longer than that of humans p br Common beliefs regarding sorcery and commanding jinn are attested in ibn al Nadim s Kit b al Fihrist p Since he locates such practises not as a branch of science or philosophy but rather in a chapter about stories and fables the author might not have believed in the efficiency on sorcery himself p He reports that the art of commanding jinn and demons is traced back to Solomon and Jamshid The first who would have practised a lawful method of incantation is supposed to be Ab Na r A mad b Hil l p Ibn Nadim explains lawful and unlawful subjugating of jinn and demons as distinct While the former controls the jinn by the power of God s divine names the latter pleases demons and devils by prohibited offerings and sinful acts p Al J i is another author who tells about another man allegedly controlling jinn and demons In the Umayyad period ibn Hil l is said to have the power to summon demons and jinn p He further claimed to have married a daughter of Satan and begotten a child p br There is evidence that subjugation of spirits jinn and demons was also cultivated by various Islamic authorities Al abas who was considered a reliable mu ad th scholar of ad th and pious ascetic wrote an extensive treatise al Sh mil f al ba r al k mil on subjugating demons and jinn p According to Zakariya al Qazwini it was well known that jinn obeyed al abas He gives an example that al abas demonstrated the jinn to the famous scholar Ghaz l who saw them as shadows on the wall p He professes that jinn only obey when the individual turns away from the temptations of creation and devoting oneself towards God p The al Sh mil gives detailed instructions for preparations of various incantations Unlike for example in the writings of al Razi the al Sh mil has no direct link to Hellenistic or Hermetic magic or philosophy p Magic was also used in the Ottoman Empire as evident from the Talismanic shirts of Murad III br Related to the occult traditions in Islamic culture is the belief in the Seven kings of the Week also known as r iya ulia higher spirits angels and r iya sufula lower spirits demons These beings are for example invoked for the preparation of Magic squares p This belief is attested by the Book of Wonders It contains artistic depictions of several supernatural beings demons jinn the evil eye fever Huma Arabic devils lilith etc Some of these beings indicate that the work connects Hebrew Christian and Islamic magical traditions The original work is attributed to al Bakhi who founded a system of astrological magic based on Neo Platonic thought Although many pages are damaged it is possible to reconstruct their meanings from Ottoman copies Each king is depicted with helpers and associated talismanic symbols br br br Comparative mythology br br In Comparative mythology scholars discuss the relationship between Islamic notions of jinn and earlier Jewish and Christian ideas of supernatural beings or preternatural creatures especially those of angels spirits and demons One question has concerned the degree to Quranic jinn might be compared to fallen angels in Christian traditions although issues with this view are that jinn are not identified as angels and that descriptions of angels do not involve their flying up the sky to eavesdrop on heavenly secrets unlike jinn who do so in Surah Patricia Crone notes that like jinn the demons of the Testament of Solomon ascend to the firmament and eavesdrop on heavenly secrets as did demons of Zoroastrian cosmology who in addition encounter a heavenly defense systems as did Islamic jinn Similar statements are also found in the Talmud Berakhot b and the th century Scolion of Theodore bar Konai br Counterparts to Quranic jinn have been identified in the Book of Jubilees where spirits created by God associated with fire having an identified leader Mastema may either aid or harm humans and suffer a similar fate as the jinn br The Shedim of the Tanakh are said to resemble jinn p Like jinn among a class of beings of Jewish mythology belief jnun shedim etc there is a tradition of ritual exorcism and negotiations that differs from that of traditional Jewish cure of spirit possession associated with ghosts Dybbuk br Jinn have also been compared to preternatural beings called gny in inscriptions from Palmyra as well as broader late antique demonologies br As with asuras in Buddhism jinn have free will and can choose paths of good or bad moral lives br br br See also br br br br br br Notes br br br Citations br br br Sources br br br Further reading br br br External links br br Etymology
