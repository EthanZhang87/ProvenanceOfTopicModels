Tolkien fandom is an international informal community of fans of the works of J R R Tolkien especially of the Middle earth legendarium which includes The Hobbit The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion The concept of Tolkien fandom as a specific type of fan subculture sprang up in the United States in the s in the context of the hippie movement to the dismay of the author Tolkien died in who talked of my deplorable cultus br A Tolkienist is someone who studies the work of J R R Tolkien this usually involves the study of the Elvish languages and Tolkienology A Ringer is a fan of The Lord of the Rings in general and of Peter Jackson s live action film trilogy in particular Other terms for Tolkien fans include Tolkienite or Tolkiendil br br Tolkien s The Hobbit a children s book was first published in and it proved popular But The Lord of the Rings first published in three volumes in and gave rise to fandom as a cultural phenomenon from the s onwards br br Tolkien fandom began within science fiction fandom soon after The Fellowship of the Ring was published in Tolkien was discussed in science fiction fanzines and amateur press association magazines apazines both as single essays like No Monroe In Lothlorien in Eric Bentcliffe s Triode and in extended threads of comment such as by Robert Lichtman in his Psi Phi Tolkien inspired costumes were worn at Worldcons from An organized Tolkien fandom organization called The Fellowship of the Ring came together in Pittcon the th World Science Fiction Convention in Pittsburgh on September England s first Tolkien fanzine was Nazgul s Bane produced by Cheslin Many fanzines had little Tolkien content but Tolkien inspired names such as Ancalagon Glamdring Lefnui Mathom Perian Ringwraith Shadowfax and so on Others had more meaningful Tolkien content Ed Meskys apazine Niekas turned into a full fledged fanzine during this era Pete Mansfield s Sword Sorcery fanzine Eldritch Dream Quest included many Tolkien items br br Foster attributes the surge of Tolkien fandom in the United States of the mid s to a combination of the hippie subculture and anti war movement pursuing mellow freedom like that of the Shire and America s cultural Anglophilia of the time fuelled by a bootleg paperback version of The Lord of the Rings published by Ace Books followed up by an authorised edition by Ballantine Books The hippie following latched onto the book giving its own spin to the work s interpretation such as the Dark Lord Sauron representing the United States military draft during the Vietnam War to the chagrin of the author who talked of a deplorable cultus and stated that Many young Americans are involved in the stories in a way that I m not but who nevertheless admitted that even the nose of a very modest idol cannot remain entirely untickled by the sweet smell of incense Fan attention became so intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number out of the public directory This embracing of the work by American s counter culture made it an easy target for mockery as in Harvard Lampoon s parody Bored of the Rings where Tom Bombadil becomes Tim Benzedrine and Bilbo Baggins becomes Dildo Bugger The Lord of the Rings acquired immense popularity in the emerging hacker culture from the mid s and the technological subcultures of scientists engineers and computer programmers It figured as one of the major inspirations of the nascent video game industry and the evolution of fantasy role playing games br br Isaac Asimov who had read The Lord of the Rings three times by Tolkien s death in September wrote a Black Widowers short story as tribute to the fellow author Nothing Like Murder mentions college students forming Tolkien societies at Columbia and elsewhere br Interest in The Lord of the Rings led to several attempts to adapt it for the film medium most of which were largely unsuccessful Filmmaker Ralph Bakshi succeeded in securing the rights to produce an animated feature film version part one of what was originally planned as a two part adaptation of the story Bakshi produced the film using among other animation techniques rotoscoping shooting a majority of the film in live action first before transferring the live footage to animation While the film had and continues to have a mixed critical reaction it was a financial success costing USD million to produce and grossing over USD million at the box office Despite this fact United Artists the film s original distributor refused to fund a sequel leaving the project incomplete br br The s saw the conclusion of The History of Middle earth series A series of minor texts by Tolkien were edited in journals such as Parma Eldalamberon and Vinyar Tengwar published by the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship since the early s In the s several encyclopedic projects have documented Tolkien s life and work in great detail such as the J R R Tolkien Encyclopedia and the twin volumes The Lord of the Rings A Reader s Companion and The J R R Tolkien Companion and Guide The dedicated journal Tolkien Studies has been appearing from br br Tolkien fandom changed in character with the release of Peter Jackson s The Lord of the Rings film trilogy between and attracting both a wide audience of existing fans book firsters and many people who had not read Tolkien s books film firsters The large audience made the artistic conception of Jackson s artists influential indeed creating a stereotyped image of Middle earth and its races of Elves Dwarves Orcs and Hobbits shared by fans and artists alike Some fans known as Tolkien tourists travel to places in New Zealand to visit sites where scenes in the films were shot br A Tolkien Reading Day held annually on March an anniversary of the fall of Barad d r was proposed by Sean Kirst a columnist at The Post Standard in Syracuse New York and launched by the Tolkien Society in br br Tolkien discussion took place in many newsgroups from the earliest days of Usenet The Tolklang mailing list was started in The alt fan tolkien and rec arts books tolkien newsgroups have been active since and respectively br Notable points of contention in online discussions surround the origin of orcs whether elves have pointy ears whether balrogs have wings and the nature of Tom Bombadil Following the announcement of Jackson s movies from online fandom became divided between Revisionists and Purists over controversy surrounding changes to the novel made for the movies such as those made to the character of Arwen and the absence of Tom Bombadil br br br One of the most prominent fansites of Jackson s movies is TheOneRing net which was popular even with the cast and crew of the film TORn as it is called was originally a small movie news site that gained in prestige as movie rumors became reality The filmmakers put special effort into winning over the fans not simply tolerating but actually actively supporting fansites for Ringers The site was founded in by a group of Tolkien fans eager for the upcoming The Lord of the Rings film trilogy who were gathering information about the film In Michael Xoanon Regina and Erica Tehanu Challis started a website using all of the information they could get related to the filming of The Lord of the Rings including exclusive spy reports from Tehanu s visit to the New Zealand set This activity first got her escorted off the set and then invited back on to take an official look around and meet director Peter Jackson In early a designer by the username of Calisuri came across the site and asked if they needed some design and technical help to grow the site and make it a central web location for other Tolkien fans Calisuri s friend Corvar who he was acquainted with from the Nightmare LPMud was brought aboard to provide server and business help Xoanon Tehanu Calisuri and Corvar then formed The One Ring Inc and are the sole owners founders of TheOneRing net br The site is unique in that there was a mutual working relationship between the crew of TheOneRing net and that of The Lord of the Rings films and later The Hobbit films This relationship enabled the site to bring its readers exclusive news from the set as when Peter Jackson emailed TheOneRing net in an effort to get his side heard when a lawsuit threatened his chance to film The Hobbit br br Like other fan sites members gather in small groups called moots form personal friendships even marriages hold extended online discussions with archives and so on In Cold Spring Press released TORn s book The People s Guide to J R R Tolkien Written by five major contributors to TheOneRing net it includes essays ranging from a spirited defense of fantasy as a genre discussions of Tolkien s views of good and evil an examination of cultural norms and more The foreword by the Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey author of The Road to Middle earth and J R R Tolkien Author of the Century says The Internet the experience of continually answering questions and receiving comments give the organizers of TheOneRing net a perspective which is uniquely broad and uniquely full of surprises some of which would have pleased Tolkien very much but which he could not have expected This was followed by More People s Guide to J R R Tolkien in Over Ringers Lord of the Rings fans from around the world came to the TheOneRing net Oscar party at the Hollywood CA American Legion on February The event was attended by Peter Jackson Fran Walsh Elijah Wood and many more of the cast and crew of The Lord of the Rings several of whom skipped the official New Line party that evening On September eleven commemorative kauri trees were planted in Willowbank Park in Wellington New Zealand Peter Jackson s home town The number eleven represented the nine members of the Fellowship of the Ring plus one each for Peter Jackson and J R R Tolkien Coincidentally eleven was the number of Oscars won by The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King Hundreds of TORn members contributed funds for the purchase of the trees as a tangible and lasting way to give thanks to Jackson and his team for their inspiring work TheOneRing net teamed up with Creation Entertainment to present The One Ring Celebration ORC in and Its sister convention Eastern LOTR Fan Gathering ELF met in the eastern U S in and These conventions included panels and signings by members of the cast such as Elijah Wood Sean Astin Dominic Monaghan Billy Boyd and John Rhys Davies In November and December TheOneRing net and Red Carpet Tours staged a cruise for nights from Auckland New Zealand to Sydney the cruise was Sydney to Auckland including several short excursions to visit locations used in the filming of The Lord of the Rings br br TheOneRing com TORc The Home of Tolkien Online is a Tolkien fan site that positions itself as catering more to the fans of Tolkien s literary works rather than Jackson s films It was founded by Jonathan Watson Ted Tschopp and David Mullich in April As of Watson has continued to run the website The site was consulted by the Tolkien scholar Kris Swank for details of the etymology of the word lintips which Tolkien used in his poem Once Upon a Time br The Encyclopedia of Arda provides a detailed online reference to Middle earth mirrored at GlyphWeb br A fan edit of the theatrical cut of The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers exists called The Two Towers The Purist Edit Most of the changes in were incorporated into The Lord of the Rings The Purist Edition a fan edit which turns the entire trilogy into an eight hour film without most of the changes br br Tolkienology is a term used by fans to describe the study of the works of J R R Tolkien treating Middle earth as a real ancient history conducting research from an in universe perspective This differs from Tolkien studies in that it ignores the real world history of composition by the author and assumes an underlying internally consistent Middle earth canon Tolkienology may include br br Tolkienian linguistics Study of the most complete languages Tolkien designed for Middle earth usually Quenya and Sindarin study of the writing systems the most known being the Tengwar and possible reconstruction for everyday use including by the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship br debate on the true nature of Tom Bombadil of balrogs etc and debate on the real motivations of characters in the stories br Genealogies of Hobbit families and kings br The accuracy of Tolkien s calendars and how can they be used today br Reconstruction of history of Elven kingdoms Arnor and Gondor Rohan or the more unknown lands br Morality issues such as whether an omnipotent omniscient and omnibenevolent Il vatar God would destroy N menor if the bad Dunlendings had any right rivalling the good Rohirrim and if Gondor committed genocides br Possible census of population about each race br Astronomic descriptions in the books moon phases positions of stars and what can be inferred about Middle earth geography from them br Strategies of wars and battles if they were right and what alternatives might have been br Possible folkloric impressions Hobbits had about places of the Shire and other whereabouts determined by translating placenames br br The studies of Tolkien s artistic languages notably Quenya and Sindarin is a field where fandom and scholarly Tolkien studies overlap The resulting friction between scholarly students of the languages focussing on their conceptual evolution and fandom oriented students taking an in universe view became visible notably in the Elfconners controversy of the late s involving among others the linguists David Salo and Carl F Hostetter the editor of Vinyar Tengwar There is a reconstructionist camp which pursues the reconstruction of unattested Elvish forms and a philological or purist camp which focusses entirely on the conscientious edition of such fragments as can be found in Tolkien s unpublished papers By its nature reconstructionism aims for a canon of correct standard Elvish Neo Eldarin while the philological study of the evolution of Tolkien s conceptions cannot assume that the languages had ever reached a complete or internally consistent final form The reconstructionist camp is represented by Salo who translated the poems in the libretto by Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens for the Music of The Lord of the Rings film series creating additional words in languages including Sindarin where necessary while the purist camp is represented by Hostetter br br Dedicated Tolkien Societies

publication was made in the s but to comply with literary censorship in Soviet Russia the work was considerably abridged and transformed The ideological danger of the book was seen in the hidden
