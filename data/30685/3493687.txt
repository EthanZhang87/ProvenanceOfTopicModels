season on the show when he and the comedy troupe were little known to even Saturday Night Live s most devout fans Samberg reported that the video greatly increased his recognizability overnight It captures a certain scrappiness about the show There s an unpolished realness to it that I think people can instantly relate to said Saturday Night Live veteran Amy Poehler By the following morning the video was a national cultural sensation Schaffer and Taccone were contacted by friends who heard the track played on radio stations and in bars and it inspired a line of T shirts released during the initial boom of popularity in the weeks after its release Bill Hader speaking about the event in on Conan O Brien s podcast recalled Samberg receiving an applause break the following week when appearing in a sketch Hader recalled None of us were angry or jealous but it was more of an envious feeling just wow did you see that We d never been that close to a thing that was a phenomenon The
