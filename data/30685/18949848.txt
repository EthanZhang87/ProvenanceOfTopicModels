or both Fan fiction ranges in length from a few sentences to novel length and can be based on fictional and non fictional media including novels movies comics television shows musical groups cartoons anime and manga and video games br Fan fiction is rarely commissioned or authorized by the original work s creator or publisher or professionally published It may infringe on the original author s copyright depending on the jurisdiction and on legal questions such as whether or not it qualifies as fair use see Legal issues with fan fiction The attitudes of authors and copyright owners of original works towards fan fiction have ranged from encouragement to indifference or disapproval and have occasionally responded with legal action br The term came into use in the th century as copyright laws began to distinguish between stories using established characters that were authorized by the copyright holder and those that were not br Fan fiction is defined by being related to its subject s canonical fictional universe either staying within those boundaries but not being part of the canon or being set in an alternative universe Thus what is considered fanon is separate from canon Fan fiction is often written and published among fans and as such does not usually cater to readers without knowledge of the original media br br The term fan fiction has been used in print as early as in the earliest known citations it refers to amateur written science fiction as opposed to pro fiction The term also appears in the Fancyclopedia an encyclopaedia of fandom jargon in which it is defined as fiction about fans or sometimes about pros and occasionally bringing in some famous characters from science fiction stories It also mentions that the term is sometimes improperly used to mean fan science fiction that is ordinary fantasy published in a fan magazine br br Before the adoption of copyright in the modern sense it was common for authors to copy characters or plots from other works For instance Shakespeare s plays Romeo and Juliet Much Ado About Nothing Othello As You Like It and The Winter s Tale were based on recent works by other authors of the time br In Alonso Fern ndez de Avellaneda wrote a sequel to Cervantes Don Quixote before he had finished and published his own second volume br br Among th century literature that has been subject to depictions not authorized by the original author include Bram Stoker s Dracula s depiction in the translated adaptation Powers of Darkness The works of Jane Austen remain among the most popular works for unauthorized adaptations with a notable example of Jane Austen fan fiction being Old Friends and New Fancies Many unauthorized stories of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle have been created including The Adventure of the Two Collaborators by J M Barrie Other notable works include The Space Machine and Morlock Night respectively based on The War of the Worlds and The Time Machine by H G Wells A New Alice in the Old Wonderland based on Alice s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll and Wide Sargasso Sea based on Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte br br The modern phenomenon of fan fiction as an expression of fandom and fan interaction was popularized and defined by the Star Trek fandom and its fanzines which were published in the s The first Star Trek fanzine Spockanalia contained some fan fiction many others followed its example These fanzines were produced using offset printing and mimeography and mailed to other fans or sold at science fiction conventions for a small fee to cover the cost of production Unlike other aspects of fandom women were the primary authors of fan fiction of Star Trek fan fiction authors were female by and by One scholar states that fan fiction fill s the need of a mostly female audience for fictional narratives that expand the boundary of the official source products offered on the television and movie screen br br Fan fiction has become more popular and widespread since the advent of the World Wide Web According to one estimate fan fiction comprises one third of all book related content on the internet In addition to traditional fanzines and conventions Usenet newsgroups and electronic mailing lists were established for fan fiction and fan discussion Online searchable archives of fan fiction were also created with these archives initially being non commercial hand tended and specific to a fandom or topic These archives were followed by non commercial automated databases In the non profit site FanFiction Net was launched which allowed anyone to upload content in any fandom The ability to self publish fan fiction in an easily accessible archive that did not require insider knowledge to join as well as the ability to review stories directly on the site led the site to quickly gain popularity br A popular example of modern fan fiction is E L James s Fifty Shades of Grey which was originally written as fan fiction for the Twilight series and featured Bella and Edward To avoid copyright infringement James changed the characters names to Ana and Christian for the purposes of her novels a practice known as pulling to publish Anna Todd s fan fiction After about the boy band One Direction secured a book and movie deal with renamed characters in A movie adaptation After was released on April br On May online retailer Amazon launched a new publishing service Kindle Worlds which allowed fan fiction of certain licensed media properties to be sold in the Kindle Store with terms including of net sales for works of words or more and for short fiction ranging from to words However this arrangement included restrictions on content copyright violations poor document formatting and use of misleading titles Amazon shut down Kindle Worlds in August br br A similar trend began in Japan in the s and s as d jinshi independently published manga and novels were published by d jin circles with many being based on existing manga anime and video game franchises Manga artists such as Shotaro Ishinomori and Fujiko Fujio formed d jin groups such as Fujio s New Manga Party Shin Manga t At the time artists used d jin groups to make their debut as professional artists This changed in the following decades as d jinshi became more popular and d jin groups formed in groups such as school clubs This culminated in with the Comiket a convention in Tokyo that helped to establish the fandom br br A study found that of account holders on FanFiction Net allowed the website to disclose their

Buffy the Vampire Slayer University of Sydney professor Catherine Driscoll commented that the genre was one of the least distinguished modes of fan production and that within fan fiction excessive attachment to or foregrounding of popular music is itself dismissed as immature and derivative br br Uberfic is a form of alternative universe in which characters physically resemble and share

picking out curtains was once used but has somewhat fallen out of use br br Also known as porn or erotica Sexually explicit or pornographic fan fiction which can be a part of a story or the entire story Historically the terms lemon or explicit pornography and lime sexually suggestive works were euphemisms used to refer to explicit material These terms were once common in the s but fell out of use before becoming popular again in December due to the censorship of adult content on Tumblr as it allowed writers to circumvent explicit terminologies that could get their work flagged by platforms like Tumblr while still being able to tag their work as explicit br br Trigger warnings are used to warn people of content in fan fiction that could be harmful or triggering for those who have dealt with traumatic situations allowing them to prepare for or avoid certain content Sometimes content warning CW is used either instead of or in addition to a trigger warning br Trigger warnings are usually used when the subject matter of a work deals with issues such as drug abuse mental illness abuse or extreme violence Archive of Our Own has codified a system of common warnings into its core tags requiring authors to either disclose or explicitly choose not to disclose if their work contains graphic violence major character death rape or underage sex br br Reviews can be posted by both anonymous and registered users on most sites which are often programmed to notify the author of new feedback This makes them a common way for readers and authors to communicate online as well as to help authors improve their writing through constructive criticism Occasionally unmoderated review systems are abused for flaming spam or trolling to prevent this an author can either disable or enable anonymous reviews depending on their preference Fan fiction has also been shown to improve literacy by allowing authors to have a wider audience for their works and encouraging people to write br Other ways that members of a fandom can participate in their community include gift exchanges and fic exchanges A gift exchange is an organized challenge in which participants create fan fiction for other participants They may research what the user receiving their gift enjoys or submissions may include a letter explaining what the recipient wants or does not want br br There is ongoing debate about to what extent fan fiction is permitted under contemporary copyright law br Some argue that fan fiction does not fall under fair use as it is derivative work The ruling by United States District Court Judge Deborah A Batts permanently prohibiting publication in the United States of a book by Ryan Cassidy a Swedish writer whose protagonist is a year old version of Holden Caulfield of The Catcher in the Rye may be seen as upholding this position regarding publishing fan fiction as the judge stated To the extent Defendants contend that Years and the character of Mr C direct parodied comment or criticism at Catcher or Holden Caulfield as opposed to Salinger himself the Court finds such contentions to be post hoc rationalizations employed through vague generalizations about the alleged naivety of the original rather than reasonably perceivable parody br Others such as the Organization for Transformative Works uphold the legality of non profit fan fiction under the fair use doctrine as it is a creative transformative process br In Lucasfilm Ltd sent out a letter to several fanzine publishers asserting Lucasfilm s copyright to all Star Wars characters and insisting that no fanzine publish pornography The letter also alluded to possible legal action that could be taken against fanzines that did not comply br The Harry Potter Lexicon is one case where the encyclopedia like website about everything in the Harry Potter series moved towards publishing and commercializing the Lexicon as a supplementary and complementary source of information to the series Rowling and her publishers levied a lawsuit against the website creator Steven Vander Ark and the publishing company RDR Books for a breach of copyright While the lawsuit did conclude in Vander Ark s favor the main issue in contention was the majority of the Lexicon copied a majority of the Series material and does not transform enough of the material to be held separately from the series itself br While the HP Lexicon case is an example of Western culture treatment of fan fiction and copyright law in China Harry Potter fan fiction is less addressed in legal conflicts but is used as a cultural and educational tool between Western and Chinese cultures More specifically while there are a number of fake Harry Potter books in China most of these books are said to be addressing concepts and issues found in Chinese culture This transformative usage of Harry Potter in fan fiction is allegedly from the desire to enhance and express value to Chinese tradition and culture br Some prominent authors have given their blessings to fan fiction notably J K Rowling By there were already almost Harry Potter fan stories on the web ranging from short stories to novel length tomes Rowling said she was flattered that people wanted to write their own stories based on her fictional characters Similarly Stephenie Meyer has put links on her website to fan fiction sites about her characters from the Twilight series The Fifty Shades trilogy was developed from a Twilight fan fiction originally titled Master of the Universe and published episodically on fan fiction websites under the pen name Snowqueen s Icedragon The piece featured characters named after Stephenie Meyer s characters in Twilight Edward Cullen and Bella Swan br However in a British law firm representing J K Rowling and Warner Bros sent a letter to webmasters requesting that adult Harry Potter fan fiction stories containing graphically violent and sexual content be removed from a prominent fan fiction website citing concerns that children might stumble upon the illicit content In response the webmasters from several websites hosting adult Harry Potter fan fiction among other types of fan fiction made claims of fair use and nonprofessional status to justify their right to continue hosting the adult content br As an example of changing views on the subject author Orson Scott Card best known for the Ender s Game series once stated on his website to write fiction using my characters is morally identical to moving into my house without invitation and throwing out my family He changed his mind completely and since has assisted fan fiction contests arguing to the Wall Street Journal that Every piece of fan fiction is an ad for my book What kind of idiot would I be to want that to disappear br However Anne Rice consistently and aggressively prevented fan fiction based on any of her fictional characters mostly those from her famous Interview with the Vampire and its sequels in The Vampire Chronicles She along with Anne McCaffrey whose stance has been changed by her son Todd McCaffrey since her death and Raymond Feist asked to have any fiction related to their series removed from FanFiction Net George R R Martin is also strongly opposed to fan fiction believing it to be copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers Sharon Lee and Steve Miller creators of the Liaden universe strongly oppose fan fiction written in their universe with Lee saying that Nobody else is going to get it right This may sound rude and elitist but honestly it s not easy for us to get it right
