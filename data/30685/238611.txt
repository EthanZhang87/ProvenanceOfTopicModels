Y kai strange apparition are a class of supernatural entities and spirits in Japanese folklore The word y kai is composed of two kanji characters that both mean suspicious doubtful and while it is regarded as deriving from the Chinese term yaoguai and involves similarly strange creatures some Japanese commentators argue that the word y kai has taken on multiple different meanings particular to a Japanese context including a large number of uniquely Japanese creatures br Y kai are also referred to as ayakashi mononoke or mamono However the two loose classes of spirits are generally thought of as highly different although some academics and Shinto practitioners acknowledge similarities within the seeming dichotomy between the natures of them and most kami which are generally thought to be relatively beneficent in comparison and class the two as ultimately the same type of spirits of nature or a mythological realm Their behavior can range from malevolent or mischievous to benevolent to humans br Y kai often have animal like features such as the kappa depicted as appearing similar to a turtle and the tengu commonly depicted with wings but may also appear humanoid in appearance such as the kuchisake onna Some y kai resemble inanimate objects such as the tsukumogami while others have no discernible shape Y kai are typically described as having spiritual or supernatural abilities with shapeshifting being the most common trait associated with them Y kai that shapeshift are known as bakemono or obake br Japanese folklorists and historians explain y kai as personifications of supernatural or unaccountable phenomena to their informants In the Edo period many artists such as Toriyama Sekien invented new y kai by taking inspiration from folk tales or purely from their own imagination Today several such y kai such as the amikiri are mistakenly thought to originate in more traditional folklore br br br Concept br The concept of y kai their causes and phenomena related to them varies greatly throughout Japanese culture and historical periods typically the older the time period the higher the number of phenomena deemed to be supernatural and the result of y kai According to Japanese ideas of animism spirit like entities were believed to reside in all things including natural phenomena and objects Such spirits possessed emotions and personalities peaceful spirits were known as nigi mitama who brought good fortune violent spirits known as ara mitama brought ill fortune such as illness and natural disasters Neither type of spirit was considered to be y kai br One s ancestors and particularly respected departed elders could also be deemed to be nigi mitama accruing status as protective spirits who brought fortune to those who worshipped them Animals objects and natural features or phenomena were also venerated as nigi mitama or propitiated as ara mitama depending on the area br Despite the existence of harmful spirits rituals for converting ara mitama into nigi mitama were performed aiming to quell maleficent spirits prevent misfortune and alleviate the fear arising from phenomena and events that otherwise had no explanation The ritual for converting ara mitama into nigi mitama was known as the chinkon lit the calming of the spirits or requiem Chinkon rituals for ara mitama that failed to achieve deification as benevolent spirits whether through a lack of sufficient veneration or through losing worshippers and thus their divinity became y kai br Over time phenomena and events thought to be supernatural became fewer and fewer with the depictions of y kai in picture scrolls and paintings beginning to standardize evolving more into caricatures than fearsome spiritual entities Elements of the tales and legends surrounding y kai began to be depicted in public entertainment beginning as early as the Middle Ages in Japan During and following the Edo period the mythology and lore of y kai became more defined and formalized br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Types br The folklorist Tsutomu Ema studied the literature and paintings

br Miscellaneous or appearance compounding more than one category br In other folklorist categorizations y kai are classified similarly to the nymphs of Greek mythology by their location or the phenomena associated with their manifestation Y kai are indexed in the book A Complete Dictionary of Japanese Folklore Sogo Nihon Minzoku Goi as follows br br Yama no ke mountains br michi no ke paths br ki no ke trees br mizu no ke water br umi no ke the sea br yuki no ke snow br oto no ke sound br d butsu no ke animals either real or imaginary br br br History br br br Ancient history br CE in the Shoku Nihongi there is the statement Shinto purification is performed because y kai appear very often in the imperial court using the word y kai to not refer to any one phenomenon in particular but to strange phenomena in general br Middle of the Heian period In The Pillow Book by Sei Sh nagon there is the statement there are tenacious mononoke as well as a statement by Murasaki Shikibu that the mononoke have become quite dreadful which are the first appearances of the word mononoke br In the Taiheiki in the fifth volume there is the statement Sagami no Nyudo was not at all frightened by y kai br br The ancient times were a period abundant in literature and folktales mentioning and explaining y kai Literature such as the Kojiki the Nihon Shoki and various Fudoki expositioned on legends from the ancient past and mentions of oni orochi among other kinds of mysterious phenomena can already be seen in them In the Heian period collections of stories about y kai and other supernatural phenomena were published in multiple volumes starting with publications such as the Nihon Ry iki and the Konjaku Monogatarish and in these publications mentions of phenomena such as Hyakki Yagy can be seen br The y kai that appear in this literature were passed on to later generations Despite the literature mentioning and explaining these y kai they were never given any visual depictions In Buddhist paintings such as the Hell Scroll Nara National Museum which came from the later Heian period there are visual expressions of the idea of oni but actual visual depictions would only come later in the Middle Ages from the Kamakura period and beyond br Yamata no Orochi was originally a local god but turned into a y kai who was slain by Susanoo Yasaburo was originally a bandit whose vengeful spirit onry turned into a poisonous snake upon death and plagued the water in a paddy but eventually became deified as the wisdom god of the well Kappa and inugami are sometimes treated as gods in one area and y kai in other areas From these examples it can be seen that among Japanese gods there are some beings that can go from god to y kai and vice versa br br br Post classical history br br Medieval Japan was a time period where publications such as emakimono Otogi z shi and other visual depictions of y kai started to appear While there were religious publications such as the Jisha Engi others such as the Otogiz shi were intended more for entertainment starting the trend where y kai became more and more seen as subjects of entertainment For examples tales of y kai extermination could be said to be a result of emphasizing the superior status of human society over y kai Publications included br br The Ooe yama Shuten doji Emaki about an oni the Zegaibou Emaki about a tengu the Tawara no T da emaki concerning serpent dragon folk oppressed by a giant centipede y kai the Tsuchigumo Zoshi about tsuchigumo and the Dojo ji Engi Emaki about a giant snake These emaki were about y kai that come from even older times br The Kitano Tenjin Engi Emaki in which Sugawara no Michizane was a lightning god who took on the form of an oni and despite attacking people after doing this he was still deified as a god in the end br The Junirui Emaki the Tamamono Soshi both about Tamamo no Mae and the Fujibukuro Soushi Emaki about a monkey These emaki told of y kai mutations of animals br The Tsukumogami Emaki which told tales of thrown away none too precious objects that come to have a spirit residing in them planning evil deeds against humans and ultimately get exorcised and sent to peace br The Hyakki Yagy Emaki depicting many different kinds of y kai all marching together br In this way y kai that were mentioned only in writing were given a visual appearance in the Middle Ages In the Otogiz shi familiar tales such as Urashima Tar and Issun b shi also appeared br The next major change in y kai came after the period of warring states in the Edo period br br br Modern history br br br Edo period br Publication of the Shokoku Hyakumonogatari a collection of tales of various monsters br Publication of the Otogi Hyakumonogatari In volumes such as Miyazu no Ayakashi volume and Unpin no Y kai volume collections of tales that seem to come from China were adapted into a Japanese setting br Publication of the Wakan Sansai Zue by Terajima Ry an a collection of tales based on the Chinese Sancai Tuhui br In the specialized dictionary Sesetsu Kojien there is an entry on y kai which stated Among the commoners in my society there are many kinds of kaiji mysterious phenomena often mispronounced by commoners as kechi Types include the cry of weasels the howling of foxes the bustling of mice the rising of the chicken the cry of the birds the pooping of the birds on clothing and sounds similar to voices that come from cauldrons and bottles These types of things appear in the Sh seiroku methods of exorcising them can be seen so it should serve as a basis br Publication of the Bakemono chakutocho by Masayoshi Kitao This was a kibyoshi diagram book of y kai but it was prefaced with the statement it can be said that the so called y kai in our society is a representation of our feelings that arise from fear and already in this era while y kai were being researched it indicated that there were people who questioned whether y kai really existed or not br It was in this era that the technology of the printing press and publication was first started to be widely used that a publishing culture developed and was frequently a subject of kibyoshi and other publications br As a result kashi hon shops that handled such books spread and became widely used making the general public s impression of each y kai fixed spreading throughout Japan For example before the Edo period there were plenty of interpretations about what the y kai were that were classified as kappa but because of books and publishing the notion of kappa became anchored to what is now the modern notion of kappa br Also including other kinds of publications other than y kai born from folk legend there were also many invented y kai that were created through puns or word plays the Gazu Hyakki Yagy by Toriyama Sekien is one example When the Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai became popular in the Edo period it is thought that one reason for the appearance of new y kai was a demand for entertaining ghost stories about y kai no one has ever heard of before resulting in some that were simply made up for the purpose of telling an entertaining story The kasa obake and the t fu koz are known examples of these br They are also frequently depicted in ukiyo e and there are artists that have drawn famous y kai like Utagawa Kuniyoshi Yoshitoshi Kawanabe Ky sai and Hokusai and there are also Hyakki Yagy books made by artists of the Kan school br br In this period toys and games like karuta and sugoroku frequently used y kai as characters Thus with the development of a publishing culture y kai depictions that were treasured in temples and shrines were able to become something more familiar to people and it is thought that this is the reason that even though y kai were originally things to be feared they have then become characters that people feel close to br br br Meiji and Taish periods br br Publication of the Seiyuu Youkai Kidan by Shibue Tamotsu It introduced folktales from Europe such as the Grimm Tales br Publication of the Y kaigaku Kogi by Inoue Enry br Performance of the kabuki play Yami no Ume Hyakumonogatari at the Kabuki za in January It was a performance in which appeared numerous y kai such as the Kasa ippon ashi skeletons yuki onna osakabe hime among others Onoe Kikugor V played the role of many of these such as the osakabe hime br Publication of the Shokubutsu Kaiko by Mitsutaro Shirai Shirai expositioned on plant y kai from the point of view of a plant pathologist and herbalist br With the Meiji Restoration Western ideas and translated western publications began to make an impact and western tales were particularly sought after Things like binb gami yakuby gami and shinigami were talked about and shinigami were even depicted in classical rakugo Although the shinigami were misunderstood as a kind of Japanese y kai or kami they actually became well known among the populace through a rakugo called Shinigami by San y tei Ench which were adoptions of European tales such as the Grimm fairy tale Godfather Death and the Italian opera Crispino e la comare Also in Ky ka Izumi and Chikuf Tobari jointedly translated Gerhart Hauptmann s play The Sunken Bell Later works of Ky ka such as Yasha ga Ike were influenced by The Sunken Bell and so it can be seen that folktales that come from the West became adapted into Japanese tales of y kai br br br Sh wa period br Since y kai have been introduced in various kinds of media they have become well known among the old the young men and women The kamishibai from before the war and the manga industry as well as the kashi hon shops that continued to exist until around the s as well as television contributed to the public knowledge and familiarity with y kai Y kai play a role in attracting tourism revitalizing local mecca regions such as T no in Iwate Prefecture where stories in Kunio Yanagita s Tono Monogatari were collected or Tottori Prefecture Shigeru Mizuki s birthplace br In this way y kai are spoken about in legends in various forms but traditional oral storytelling by the elders and the older people is rare and regionally unique situations and background in oral storytelling are not easily conveyed For example the classical y kai represented by tsukumogami can only be felt as something realistic by living close to nature such as with tanuki Japanese raccoon dogs foxes and weasels Furthermore in the suburbs and other regions even when living in a primary sector environment there are tools that are no longer seen such as the inkstone the kama a large cooking pot or the tsurube a bucket used for getting water from a well and there exist y kai that are reminiscent of old lifestyles such as the azukiarai and the dorotab br As a result even for those born in the first decade of the Sh wa period except for some who were evacuated to the countryside they would feel that those things that become y kai are not familiar and not very understandable For example in classical rakugo even though people understand the words and what they refer to they are not able to imagine it as something that could be realistic Thus the modernization of society has had a negative effect on the place of y kai in classical Japanese culture br On the other hand the y kai introduced through mass media are not limited to only those that come from classical sources like folklore and just as in the Edo period new fictional y kai continue to be invented such as scary school stories and other urban legends like kuchisake onna and Hanako san giving birth to new y kai From onwards starting with the popularity of kuchisake onna these urban legends began to be referred to in mass media as modern y kai This terminology was also used in recent publications dealing with urban legends and the researcher on y kai Bintar Yamaguchi used this especially frequently br During the s many books were published that introduced y kai through encyclopedias illustrated reference books and dictionaries as a part of children s horror books but along with the y kai that come from classics like folklore Kaidan and essays it has been pointed out by modern research that there are some mixed in that do not come from classics but were newly created Some well known examples of these are the gashadokuro and the jubokko For example Arifumi Sato is known to be a creator of modern y kai and Shigeru Mizuki a manga artist of y kai in writings concerning research about y kai pointed out that newly created y kai do exist and Mizuki himself through GeGeGe no Kitaro created about new y kai br There has been much criticism that this mixing of classical y kai with newly created y kai is making light of tradition and legends However since there have already been those from the Edo period like Sekien Toriyama who created many new y kai there is also the opinion that it is unreasonable to criticize modern creations without doing the same for classical creations too Furthermore there is a favorable view that says that introducing various y kai characters through these books nurtured creativity and emotional development of young readers of the time br br br Comparison with yaoguai br Both the Chinese yaoguai and Japanese yokai include strange supernatural beings with shapeshifting tendencies In the Chinese version of the yaoguai the emphasis is often on the first character yao which connotes bewilderment and enchantment and supernatural affliction for example their ability to take on human form in order to seduce and to enthrall human beings In the yokai the emphasis appears to be on the guai or on their monstrous and aberrant nature and anatomy Japanese yokai in popular culture often includes elements of the cute comical the goofy and the bizarre br Some creatures appear in both Chinese and Japanese folklore as yaoguai or yokai Such as the scaly water shuihu the wilderness demons denoted as chimeiwangliang and the nine tailed fox demons br Some such as the nekomata cat yokai and tanuki raccoon yokai resemble Chinese yaoguai which encompasses any number of shapeshifting animals and plants who have learnt to cultivate human form and other supernatural arts The cat yokai for example resembles the Chinese or leopard cat immortal br Yet others are uniquely Japanese such as the ambivalent and occasionally cute kappa the haradashi a goofy yokai with its belly on its face and the mumashika which are comical looking yokai with horse heads and deer bodies br br br In popular culture br br Y kai are often referred to as Japanese spirits or East Asian ghosts like the Hanako san legend or the story of the Slit mouthed girl both of which hail from Japanese legend The term y kai can also be interpreted as something strange or unusual br Lafcadio Hearn s collection of Japanese ghost stories entitled Kwaidan Stories and Studies of Strange Things includes stories of y rei and y kai such as Yuki onna and is one of the first Western publications of its kind br Y kai remain prevalent in modern works of fiction Shigeru Mizuki the manga creator of such series as GeGeGe no Kitaro and Kappa no Sanpei keeps y kai in the popular imagination Other popular works focusing on y kai include the Nurarihyon no Mago series Yu Yu Hakusho Inuyasha A Feudal Fairy Tale Yo kai Watch and the s Yokai Monsters film series which was loosely remade in as Takashi Miike s The Great Yokai War They often play major roles in Japanese fiction br br br See also br Japanese supernatural
