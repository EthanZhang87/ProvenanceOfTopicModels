The International Standard Book Number ISBN is a numeric commercial book identifier that is intended to be unique Publishers purchase or receive ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency br A different ISBN is assigned to each separate edition and variation of a publication but not to a simple reprinting of an existing item For example an e book a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different ISBN but an unchanged reprint of the hardcover edition keeps the same ISBN The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after January The method of assigning an ISBN is nation specific and varies between countries often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country br The first version of the ISBN identification format was devised in based upon the digit Standard Book Numbering SBN created in The digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization ISO and was published in as international standard ISO any digit SBN can be converted to a digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero br Privately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN The International ISBN Agency sometimes assigns ISBNs to such books on its own initiative br A separate identifier code of a similar kind the International Standard Serial Number ISSN identifies periodical publications such as magazines and newspapers The International Standard Music Number ISMN covers musical scores br br The Standard Book Number SBN is a commercial system using nine digit code numbers to identify books In British bookseller and stationers WHSmith announced plans to implement a standard numbering system for its books They hired consultants to work on their behalf and the system was devised by Gordon Foster emeritus professor of statistics at Trinity College Dublin The International Organization for Standardization ISO Technical Committee on Documentation sought to adapt the British SBN for international use The ISBN identification format was conceived in in the United Kingdom by David Whitaker regarded as the Father of the ISBN and in in the United States by Emery Koltay who later became director of the U S ISBN agency R R Bowker br The digit ISBN format was developed by the ISO and was published in as international standard ISO The United Kingdom continued to use the nine digit SBN code until ISO has appointed the International ISBN Agency as the registration authority for ISBN worldwide and the ISBN Standard is developed under the control of ISO Technical Committee Subcommittee TC SC The ISO on line facility only refers back to br br An SBN may be converted to an ISBN by prefixing the digit For example the second edition of Mr J G Reeder Returns published by Hodder in has SBN where indicates the publisher is the serial number assigned by the publisher and is the check digit By prefixing a zero this can be converted to ISBN the check digit does not need to be re calculated Some publishers such as Ballantine Books would sometimes use digit SBNs where the last three digits indicated the price of the book for example Woodstock Handmade Houses had a digit Standard Book Number of valid SBN ISBN and it cost US br Since January ISBNs have contained thirteen digits a format that is compatible with Bookland European Article Numbers which have digits br The United States with million registered ISBNs in was by far the biggest user of the ISBN identifier in followed by the Republic of Korea Germany China the UK and Indonesia Lifetime ISBNs registered in the United States are over million as of br br A separate ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation except reprintings of a publication For example an ebook audiobook paperback and hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different ISBN assigned to it The ISBN is thirteen digits long if assigned on or after January and ten digits long if assigned before An International Standard Book Number consists of four parts if it is a digit ISBN or five parts for a digit ISBN br Section of the International ISBN Agency s official user manual describes the structure of the digit ISBN as follows br br for a digit ISBN a prefix element a GS prefix so far or have been made available by GS br the registration group element language sharing country group individual country or territory br the registrant element br the publication element and br a checksum character or check digit br A digit ISBN can be separated into its parts prefix element registration group registrant publication and check digit and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces Separating the parts registration group registrant publication and check digit of a digit ISBN is also done with either hyphens or spaces Figuring out how to correctly separate a given ISBN is complicated because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits br br ISBN issuance is country specific in that ISBNs are issued by the ISBN registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language The ranges of ISBNs assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number type and size of publishers that are active Some ISBN registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from the government to support their services In other cases the ISBN registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded br A full directory of ISBN

between hyphens such as Registration groups have primarily been allocated within the prefix element The single digit registration groups within the prefix element are or for English speaking countries for French speaking countries for German speaking countries for Japan for Russian speaking countries and for People s Republic of China Example digit registration groups are and for Bhutan The allocated registration groups are and Books published in rare languages typically have longer group elements br Within the prefix element the registration group is reserved for compatibility with International Standard Music Numbers ISMNs but such material is not actually assigned an ISBN The registration groups within prefix element that have been assigned are for the United States of America for France for the Republic of Korea and for Italy br The original digit standard book number SBN had no registration group identifier but prefixing a zero to a digit SBN creates a valid digit ISBN br br The national ISBN agency assigns the registrant element cf Category ISBN agencies and an accompanying series of ISBNs within that registrant element to the publisher the publisher then allocates one of the ISBNs to each of its books In most countries a book publisher is not legally required to assign an ISBN although most large bookstores only handle publications that have ISBNs assigned to them br The International ISBN Agency maintains the details of over one million ISBN prefixes and publishers in the Global Register of Publishers This database is freely searchable over the internet br Publishers receive blocks of ISBNs with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the registration group identifier several digits for the registrant and a single digit for the publication element Once that block of ISBNs is used the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs with a different registrant element Consequently a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements There also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers br By using variable block lengths registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of ISBNs that they make to publishers For example a large publisher may be given a block of ISBNs where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element likewise countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements Here are some sample ISBN codes illustrating block length variations br br English language registration group elements are and of more than registration group elements These two registration group elements are divided into registrant elements in a systematic pattern which allows their length to be determined as follows br br A check digit is a form of redundancy check used for error detection the decimal equivalent of a binary check bit It consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number The method for the digit ISBN is an extension of that for SBNs so the two systems are compatible an SBN prefixed with a zero the digit ISBN will give the same check digit as the SBN without the zero The check digit is base eleven and can be an integer between and or an X The system for digit ISBNs is not compatible with SBNs and will in general give a different check digit from the corresponding digit ISBN so does not provide the same protection against transposition This is because the digit code was required to be compatible with the EAN format and hence could not contain the letter X br br According to the edition of the International ISBN Agency s official user manual the ISBN check digit which is the last digit of the digit ISBN must range from to the symbol X is used for and must be such that the sum of the ten digits each multiplied by its integer weight descending from to is a multiple of That is if xi is the ith digit then x must be chosen such that br br For example for an ISBN of br br Formally using modular arithmetic this is rendered br br It is also true for ISBN s that the sum of all ten digits each multiplied by its weight in ascending order from to is a multiple of For this example br br Formally this is rendered br br The two most common errors in handling an ISBN e g when typing it or writing it down are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits It can be proven mathematically that all pairs of valid ISBN s differ in at least two digits It can also be proven that there are no pairs of valid ISBN s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits these proofs are true because the ISBN is less than eleven digits long and because is a prime number The ISBN check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error i e if either of these types of error has occurred the result will never be a valid ISBN the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of However if the error were to occur in the publishing house and remain undetected the book would be issued with an invalid ISBN br In contrast it is possible for other types of error such as two altered non transposed digits or three altered digits to result in a valid ISBN although it is still unlikely br br Each of the first nine digits of the digit ISBN excluding the check digit itself is multiplied by its integer weight descending from to and the sum of these nine products found The value of the check digit is simply the one number between and which when added to this sum means the total is a multiple of br For example the check digit for an ISBN of is calculated as follows br br Adding to gives a multiple of because this is the only number between and which does so Therefore the check digit has to be and the complete sequence is ISBN If the value of br br br br br x br br br br br br br displaystyle x br br required to satisfy this condition is then an X should be used br Alternatively modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus The remainder of this sum when it is divided by i e its value modulo is computed This remainder plus the check digit must equal either or Therefore the check digit is minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo modulo Taking the remainder modulo a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is Without the second modulo operation the calculation could result in a check digit value of which is invalid Strictly speaking the first modulo is not needed but it may be considered to simplify the calculation br For example the check digit for the ISBN of is calculated as follows br br Thus the check digit is br It is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators Repeatedly adding t into s computes the necessary multiples br br The modular reduction can be done once at the end as shown above in which case s could hold a value as large as for the invalid ISBN X or s and t could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition br br Appendix of the International ISBN Agency s official user manual describes how the digit ISBN check digit is calculated The ISBN check digit which is the last digit of the ISBN must range from to and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits each multiplied by its integer weight alternating between and is a multiple of As ISBN is a subset of EAN the algorithm for calculating the check digit is exactly the same for both br Formally using modular arithmetic this is rendered br br The calculation of an ISBN check digit begins with the first twelve digits of the digit ISBN thus excluding the check digit itself Each digit from left to right is alternately multiplied by or then those products are summed modulo to give a value ranging from to Subtracted from that leaves a result from to A zero replaces a ten so in all cases a single check digit results br For example the ISBN check digit of is calculated as follows br br s br br br remainder br br br Thus the check digit is and the complete sequence is ISBN br In general the ISBN check digit is calculated as follows br Let br br Then br br This check system similar to the UPC check digit formula does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition Specifically if the difference between two adjacent digits is the check digit will not catch their transposition For instance the above example allows this situation with the followed by a The correct order contributes to the sum while if the digits are transposed followed by a the contribution of those two digits will be However and are congruent modulo and so produce the same final result both ISBNs will have a check digit of The ISBN formula uses the prime modulus which avoids this blind spot but requires more than the digits to express the check digit br Additionally if the sum of the nd th th th th and th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits st rd th th th th and th the total will always be divisible by i e end in br br A digit ISBN is converted to a digit ISBN by prepending to the ISBN and recalculating the final checksum digit using the ISBN algorithm The reverse process can also be performed but not for numbers commencing with a prefix other than which have no digit equivalent br br Publishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the ISBN check digit Publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its ISBN before publishing it that failure causes book identification problems for libraries booksellers and readers For example ISBN is shared by two books Ninja gaiden a novel based on the best selling game by Tecmo and Wacky laws both published by Scholastic br Most libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid ISBN issued by the publisher The Library of Congress catalogue contains books published with invalid ISBNs which it usually tags with the phrase Cancelled ISBN The International Union Library Catalog a k a WorldCat OCLC Online Computer Library Center system often indexes by invalid ISBNs if the book is indexed in that way by a member library br br Only the term ISBN should be used the terms eISBN and e ISBN have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided If a book exists in one or more digital e book formats each of those formats must have its own ISBN In other words each of the three separate EPUB Amazon Kindle and PDF formats of a particular book will have its own specific ISBN They should not share the ISBN of the paper version and there is no generic eISBN which encompasses all the e book formats for a title br br The barcodes on a book s back cover or inside a mass market paperback book s front cover are EAN they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an EAN for the currency and the recommended retail price For digit ISBNs the number the Bookland country code is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN formula modulo and weighting on alternating digits br Partly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories the International Organization for Standardization ISO decided to migrate to a digit ISBN ISBN The process began on January and was planned to conclude on January As of all the digit ISBNs began with As the ISBN supply is exhausted the prefix was introduced Part of the prefix is reserved for use with the Musicland code for musical scores with an ISMN The digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an M letter the bar code represents the M as a zero and for checksum purposes it counted as a All ISMNs are now thirteen digits commencing to will be used by ISBN br Publisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the and ISBNs likewise there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same Moreover the digit ISBN check digit generally is not the same as the digit ISBN check digit Because the GTIN is part of the Global Trade Item Number GTIN system that includes the GTIN the GTIN and the GTIN the digit ISBN falls within the digit data field range br Barcode format compatibility is maintained because aside from the group breaks the ISBN barcode format is identical to the EAN barcode format of existing digit ISBNs So migration to an EAN based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non book products that is compatible with existing ISBN based data with only minimal changes to information technology systems Hence many booksellers e g Barnes Noble migrated to EAN barcodes as early as March Although many American and Canadian booksellers were able to read EAN barcodes before most general retailers could not read them The upgrading of the UPC barcode system
