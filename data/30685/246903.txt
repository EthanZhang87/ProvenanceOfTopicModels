Apology br In the Koine Greek of the New Testament the Apostle Paul employs the term apologia in his trial speech to Festus and Agrippa when he says I make my defense in Acts A cognate form appears in Paul s Letter to the Philippians as he is defending the gospel in Philippians and in giving an answer in Peter br Although the term apologetics has Western primarily Christian origins and is most

Buddhism has written a book Beyond Belief providing Buddhist apologetic responses and a critique of Christian Fundamentalist doctrine Gunapala Dharmasiri wrote an apologetic critique of the Christian concept of God from a Theravadin Buddhist perspective br br br Christianity br br Christian apologetics combines Christian theology natural theology and philosophy in an attempt to present a rational basis for the Christian faith to defend the faith against objections and misrepresentation and to show that the Christian doctrine is the only world view that is faultless and consistent with all fundamental knowledge and questions br Christian apologetics has taken many forms over the centuries In the Roman Empire Christians were severely persecuted and many charges were brought against them Examples in the Bible include the Apostle Paul s address to the Athenians in the Areopagus Acts J David Cassel gives several examples Tacitus wrote that Nero fabricated charges that Christians started the burning of Rome Other charges included cannibalism due to a literal interpretation of the Eucharist and incest due to early Christians practice of addressing each other as brother and sister Paul the Apostle Justin Martyr Irenaeus and others often defended Christianity against charges that were brought to justify persecution br Later apologists have focused on providing reasons to accept various aspects of Christian belief Christian apologists of many traditions in common with Jews Muslims and some others argue for the existence of a unique and personal God Theodicy is one important

additional doctoral work in physics cosmology comparative religions and other fields Others take a more popular or pastoral approach Some prominent modern apologists are Douglas Groothuis Frederick

roots Eventually his studies in history persuaded him to become a Roman Catholic When John Henry Newman entitled his spiritual autobiography Apologia Pro Vita Sua in he was playing upon both this connotation and the more commonly understood meaning of an expression of contrition or regret br Christian apologists employ a variety of philosophical and formal approaches including ontological cosmological and teleological arguments The Christian presuppositionalist approach to apologetics uses the transcendental argument for the existence of God br Tertullian was an early Christian apologist He was born lived and died in Carthage He is sometimes known as the Father of the Latin Church He introduced the term Trinity Latin trinitas to the Christian vocabulary and probably the

demonstrate the existence of God based on evidence and reason absent divine revelation br br br Hinduism br Hindu apologetics began developing during the British colonial period A number of Indian intellectuals had become critical of the British tendency to devalue the Hindu religious tradition As a result these Indian intellectuals as well as a handful of British Indologists were galvanized to examine the roots of the religion as well as to study its vast arcana and corpus in an analytical fashion This endeavor drove the deciphering and preservation of Sanskrit Many translations of Hindu texts were produced which made them accessible to a broader reading audience br In the early th century Christian missionary Bartholom us Ziegenbalg engaged in dialogues with several Tamil speaking Malabarian Hindu priests and recorded arguments of these Hindu apologists These records include German language reports submitted to the Lutheran headquarters in Halle and letters written by the Hindu

principles in the Vedic tradition In his book The Cradle of Civilization David Frawley an American who has embraced the Vedic tradition has characterized the ancient texts of the Hindu heritage as being like pyramids of the spirit br br br Islam br br Ilm al Kal m literally science of discourse usually foreshortened to kalam and sometimes called Islamic scholastic theology is an Islamic

dedications which proceed many Early Modern plays novels and poems Eighteenth century authors such as Colley Cibber Frances Burney and William Congreve to name but a few prefaced the majority of their poetic work with such apologies In addition to the desire to defend their work the apologetic preface often suggests the author s attempt to humble his or herself before the audience br br br See also
