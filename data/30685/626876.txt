Charn is a fictional city appearing in the book The Magician s Nephew the sixth book published in C S Lewis s Chronicles of Narnia written as a prequel to The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Charn and the world of which it is the capital city are the birthplace of Jadis also known as the White Witch who later seizes control of Narnia br When visited briefly by Digory and Polly the protagonists of the novel the city is totally deserted lifeless and crumbling under a dying sun However according to Jadis the sun had been that way for eons likely predating the dynasty the city and the civilization of the world itself Rivers have dried up and neither weeds nor insects live All life in the world of Charn had been destroyed by Jadis through an evil magic spell known as the Deplorable Word In the novel the city stands as an example of the dead end that can result if a civilization succumbs to evil br During their visit Digory accidentally wakes Jadis from suspended animation and she is able to leave the world with them br br br History br According to Jadis Charn was once the greatest city of her unnamed world the wonder of the world perhaps of all worlds It was a magnificent civilization ruled by a line of magically adept emperors and empresses of whom Jadis was the last However by the time the protagonists enter the world is now a cold and desolate wasteland with no life to be seen anywhere and the city is on the brink of collapse br Magic may have been widely used in Charn Jadis referred to the common use of magic carpets for transportation Their use was apparently limited to the nobility who inherited inborn magical powers Jadis disdained Andrew Ketterley Digory s magician uncle as a petty conjurer without a drop of real magic blood in his veins saying Your kind was made an end of in my world a thousand years ago br Apparently dragons were also once abundant in Charn and in the service of the royal and noble families br The Hall of Images displays the regal history of Charn showcasing lifelike portraits of past rulers who are depicted as tall beautiful and powerful figures seated upon their thrones The sequence of these images through the expressions on their faces tells a story of a civilization that was once benevolent but degenerated into a cruel tyrannical empire The early Emperors and Empresses of Charn were kind and decent but over centuries for unexplained reasons their lineage devolved into one of malevolence corruption evil and despair seeing their subjects only as a means to an end Evidently their hunger for power was insatiable and they conquered several other realms as Jadis gloats that many great kings attempted to stand against Charn but were defeated and their names lost to history Slavery was once common in Charn as was human sacrifice The last queen of Charn was Jadis although the numerous empty thrones after hers suggest a premature end to the dynasty br As Jadis leads the children through the decaying palace she describes the cruelty of Charn and its leaders She points out dungeons and torture chambers to them and recounts that her great grandfather once invited seven hundred nobles to a banquet and slaughtered them all before they had drunk their fill for they had rebellious thoughts br When the children finally see the full extent of the city from the balcony of the royal palace it extends as far as the eye can see in any direction as if covering the entire world It is described as being full of pyramids bridges palaces and towers with a great river that had long since turned to dust Jadis recalls viewing the city while it was full of life quoting It is silent now But I have stood here when the whole air was full of the noises of Charn the trampling of feet the creaking of wheels the cracking of the whips and the groaning of slaves the thunder of chariots and the sacrificial drums beating in the temples I have stood here but that was near the end when the roar of battle went up from every street and the river of Charn ran red br br br The destruction of Charn br Jadis was responsible for the eradication of all life on Charn but blamed the destruction on her sister Jadis and her sister fought a civil war for the throne which Jadis eventually lost She claimed she had offered to spare her sister s life if she surrendered so the resulting destruction was the unnamed sister s fault Jadis obliterated her kingdom and all its people rather than relinquishing her power over them br According to Jadis s own account her sister had started a long and murderous civil war There was a solemn oath between her and the unnamed sister that neither side would use magic a pact broken by the sister who gained the advantage as a result Jadis recounts that during the civil war she poured out the blood of her armies like water but was eventually defeated In the final battle which was fought in the city itself over three days the sister defeated the last of Jadis forces br Within the ruling family of Charn there was knowledge of an evil spell the Deplorable Word which would destroy all life except the one who spoke it though the word itself was a mystery Although her ancestors had bound themselves and their descendants with oaths never to seek knowledge of this spell Jadis had sought it out and learned the word in a secret place and paid a terrible price to learn it Her sister knew Jadis had discovered the Deplorable Word but did not think Jadis would use it Facing defeat Jadis spoke the Deplorable Word which annihilated all life under the sun apart from herself br After this she put herself into an enchanted sleep in the Hall of Images During her suspended animation all water in Charn dried up and the once magnificent city crumbled into ruin br br br The waking of Jadis br The spell that bound Jadis was broken by Digory Kirke He and Polly Plummer had arrived on Charn via the Wood between the Worlds and they had explored the deserted royal palace In the room where Jadis slumbered with life sized images of her royal ancestors Kirke succumbed to temptation after having read a verse br br Make your choice adventurous Stranger Strike the bell and bide the danger Or wonder till it drives you mad What would have followed if you had br Charn s star is described as red large and cold When Digory asks Jadis about the star s appearance she asks him about his world s Sun When informed that the Sun is yellow brighter smaller and gives off a good deal more heat she remarks with sudden interest Ah so yours is a younger world br Charn and the realm in which it resided ceased to exist entirely after Jadis and the children left Later when Aslan and the children are in the Wood between the Worlds Aslan shows them that the puddle leading to Charn is dried up as the empty world has been destroyed Jadis entered Narnia with the humans from Earth and years later appears as the White Witch in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe ruling that land for years until Aslan returned and defeated her with the aid of the four Pevensie children br br br Commentary br The name Charn suggests charnel house a repository for human skeletal remains The hall of the figures of the rulers of Charn inspired by the underground grotto of mummies in King Solomon s Mines shows a progression illustrating the decline and fall of the city and its world reflecting a view of history described by G K Chesterton The deplorable word is most likely a metaphor for weapons of mass destruction which many feared would bring about the destruction of the world at the time when the novel was written br In the last chapter of the book Polly asks Aslan if humanity has yet grown as corrupt as Charn to which he replies br br Not yet But you are growing more like it It is not certain that some wicked one of your race will not find out a secret as evil as the Deplorable Word and use it to destroy all living things And soon very soon before you are an old man and an old woman great nations in your world will be ruled by tyrants who care no more for joy and justice and mercy than the Empress Jadis Let your world beware That is the warning In this paragraph Lewis may have been alluding to the tyranny despotism and corruption including Communism which had been spreading abroad Aslan s statement that before the protagonists grow old their world which is our world will be ruled by tyrants who care no more for joy and justice and mercy than Empress Jadis might be a reference to World War I and World War II This is further suggested by the fact that The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe which is set during World War II portrays Digory as the elderly Professor Kirke br br br See also br N menor br br br
