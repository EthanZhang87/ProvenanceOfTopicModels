In European folklore of the medieval and early modern periods familiars strictly familiar spirits as familiar also meant just close friend or companion and may be seen in the scientific name for dog Canis familiaris were believed to be supernatural entities interdimensional beings or spiritual guardians that would protect or assist witches and cunning folk in their practice of magic divination and spiritual insight According to records of the time those alleging to have had contact with familiar spirits reported that they could manifest as numerous forms usually as an animal but sometimes as a human or humanoid figure and were described as clearly defined three dimensional forms vivid with colour and animated with movement and sound as opposed to descriptions of ghosts with their smoky undefined form s br When they served witches they were often thought to be malevolent but when working for cunning folk they were often considered benevolent although there was some ambiguity in both cases The former were often categorized as demons while the latter were more commonly thought of and described as fairies The main purpose of familiars was to serve the witch providing protection for them as they came into their new powers br Since the th century some magical practitioners including adherents of the Neopagan religion of Wicca use the concept of familiars due to their association with older forms of magic These contemporary practitioners use pets or wildlife or believe that invisible versions of familiars act as magical aides br br br Definitions br br Pierre A Riffard proposed this definition and quotations br br A familiar spirit alter ego doppelg nger personal demon personal totem spirit companion is the double the alter ego of an individual It does not look like

medicine man sends his familiar spirit his assistant totem spirit dog spirit child or whatever the form may be to gather the information While this is occurring the man himself is in a state of receptivity in sleep or trance In modern phraseology spiritism his familiar spirit would be the control control spirit br Mircea Eliade br br The Goldi Nanai people in Siberia clearly distinguish between the tutelary spirit ayami which chooses the shaman and the helping spirits syven which are subordinate to it and are granted to the shaman by the ayami itself According to Sternberg the Goldi explain the relations between the shaman and his ayami by a complex sexual emotion Here is the report of a Goldi shaman br Once I was asleep on my sick bed when a spirit approached me It was a very beautiful woman Her figure was very slight she was no more than half an arshin cm tall Her face and attire were quite as those of one of our Gold women She said I am the ayami of your ancestors the Shamans I taught them shamaning Now I am going to teach you I love you I have no husband now you will be my husband and I shall be a wife unto you I shall give you assistant spirits You are to heal with their aid and I shall teach and help you myself Sometimes she comes under the aspect of an old woman and sometimes under that of a wolf so she is terrible to look at Sometimes she comes as a winged tiger She has given me three assistants the jarga the panther the doonto the bear and the amba the tiger They come to me in my dreams and appear whenever I summon them while shamaning If one of them refuses to come the ayami makes them obey but they say there are some who do not obey even the ayami When I am shamaning the ayami and the assistant spirits are possessing me whether big or small they penetrate me as smoke or vapour would When the ayami is within me it is she who speaks through my mouth and she does everything herself br br br Descriptions br Among those accused witches and cunning folk who described their familiar spirits there were commonly certain unifying features The historian Emma Wilby noted how the accounts of such familiars were striking for their ordinariness and naturalism despite the fact that they were dealing with supernatural entities br Familiar spirits were most commonly small animals such as cats rats dogs ferrets birds frogs toads and hares There were also cases of wasps and butterflies as well as pigs sheep and horses Familiar spirits were usually kept in pots or baskets lined with sheep s wool and fed a variety of things including milk bread meat and blood br Familiar spirits usually had names and were often given down to earth and frequently affectionate nicknames One example of this was Tom Reid who was the familiar of the cunning woman and accused witch Bessie Dunlop while other examples included Grizell and Gridigut who were the familiars of th century Huntingdonshire witch Jane Wallis br An agathion is a familiar spirit which appears in the shape of a human or an animal or even within a talisman bottle or magic ring It is strongest at midday br br br Relationship with sorcerers br br Using her studies into the role of witchcraft and magic in Britain during the Early Modern period as a starting point the historian Emma Wilby examined the relationship that familiar spirits allegedly had with the witches and cunning folk in this period br br br Meeting br In the British accounts from the early modern period at least there were three main types of encounter narrative related to how a witch or cunning person first met their familiar The first of these was that the spirit spontaneously appeared in front of the individual while they were going about their daily activities either in their home or outdoors somewhere Various examples for this are attested in the sources of the time for instance Joan Prentice from Essex England gave an account when she was interrogated for witchcraft in claiming that she was alone in her chamber and sitting upon a low stool preparing herself to bedward when her familiar first appeared to her while the Cornish cunning woman Anne Jeffries related in that hers first appeared to her when she was knitting in an arbour in our garden br The second manner in which the familiar spirit commonly appeared to magical practitioners in Britain was that they would be given to a person by a pre existing individual who was sometimes a family member and at other times a more powerful spirit For instance the alleged witch Margaret Ley from Liverpool claimed in that she had been given her familiar spirit by her mother when she died while the Leicestershire cunning woman Joan Willimot related in that a mysterious figure whom she only referred to as her master willed her to open her mouth and he would blow into her a fairy which should do her good And that she open her mouth and that presently after blowing there came out of her mouth a spirit which stood upon the ground in the shape and form of a woman br In a number of accounts the cunning person or witch was experiencing difficulty prior to the appearance of the familiar who offered to aid them As historian Emma Wilby noted their problems were primarily rooted in the struggle for physical survival the lack of food or money bereavement sickness loss of livelihood and so on and the familiar offered them a way out of this by giving them magical powers br br br Working br In some cases the magical practitioner then made an agreement or entered a pact with their familiar spirit The length of time that the witch or cunning person worked with their familiar spirit varied between a few weeks through to a number of decades In most cases the magical practitioner would conjure their familiar spirit when they needed their assistance although there are many different ways that they did this the Essex witch Joan Cunny claimed in that she had to kneel down within a circle and pray to Satan for her familiar to appear while the Wiltshire cunning woman Anne Bodenham described in that she conjured her familiars by methods learned from books In some rarer cases there were accounts where the familiars would appear at times when they were unwanted and not called upon for instance the Huntingdonshire witch Elizabeth Chandler noted in that she could not control when her two familiars named Beelzebub and Trullibub appeared to her and had prayed for a god to deliver her therefrom It was also believed that familiars helped diagnose illnesses and the sources of bewitchment and were used for divining and finding lost objects and treasures Magicians conjured them in rituals then locked them in bottles rings and stones They sometimes sold them as charms claiming the spirits would ensure success in gambling love business or whatever the customer wanted This sort of familiar was technically not illegal England s Witchcraft Act prohibited only evil and wicked spirits br br br Types br Familiars are most common in western European mythology with some scholars arguing that familiars are only present in the traditions of Great Britain and France In these areas three categories of familiars are believed to exist br br familiar spirits manifesting as humans and humanoids throughout Western Europe br divinatory spirits manifesting as animals Great Britain and France br malevolent spirits manifesting as animals only in Greece br br br Prince Rupert s dog br br During the English Civil War the Royalist general Prince Rupert was in the habit of taking his large poodle dog named Boy into battle with him Throughout the war the dog was greatly feared among the Parliamentarian forces and credited with supernatural powers As noted by Morgan the dog was apparently considered a kind of familiar At the end of the war the dog was shot allegedly with a silver bullet br br br Witch trials br Most data regarding familiars comes from the transcripts of English and Scottish witch trials held during the th th centuries The court system that labeled and tried witches was known as the Essex The Essex trial of Agnes Sampson of Nether Keith East Lothian Scotland in presents prosecution testimony regarding a divinatory familiar This case is fundamentally political trying Sampson for high treason and accusing Sampson for employing witchcraft against King James VI The prosecution asserts Sampson called familiar spirits and resolved her doubtful matter Another Essex trial is that of Hellen Clark tried in in which Clark was compelled to state that the Devil appeared as a familiar in the form of a dog br The English court cases reflect a strong relationship between State s accusations of witchcraft against those who practiced ancient indigenous traditions including the familiar animal or spirit br In some cases familiars replace children in the favour of their mothers See witchcraft and children br In colonial America animal familiars can be seen in the witch hunts that took place in Salem Massachusetts in Familiar spirits often appear in the visions of the afflicted girls Although the law that defined a witch as one who hath or consulteth with a familiar spirit had been suspended ten years earlier association with a familiar spirit was used in the Salem trials as evidence to convict suspected witches Sarah Good was said to have a yellow bird who sucked between her fingers Ann Putnam in particular was supposed to have frequently seen the yellow bird in her afflictions Tituba was said to have seen strange animals that urged her to hurt children which included a hog a black dog a red cat and a black cat During the Salem witch trials there is little account of the practice of animal familiars although one man was charged with encouraging a dog to attack by way of magical means The dog interestingly enough was tried convicted and hanged br The witch s mark added a sexual component to the familiar spirit and is often found in trial records as a way to convict a suspected witch The mark was most commonly an extra teat found somewhere on the body and was suspected to be used to suckle the familiar spirits An example of this can be seen in the Salem witch trials of For example Ann Putnam told Martha Corey that There is a yellow burd a sucking between your fore finger and midel finger I see it br br br Legacy br br br Historiography br Recent scholarship on familiars exhibits the depth and respectability absent from earlier demonological approaches The study of familiars has grown from an academic topic in folkloric journals to a general topic in popular books and journals incorporating anthropology history and other disciplines James Sharpe in The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft the Western Tradition states Folklorists began their investigations in the th Century and found that familiars figured prominently in ideas about witchcraft br In the first decades of the th century familiars are identified as niggets which are creepy crawly things that witches kept all over them br br br See also br br br br br br Citations br br br Bibliography br br br External links
