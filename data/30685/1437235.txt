An audiobook or a talking book is a recording of a book or other work being read out loud A reading of the complete text is described as unabridged while readings of shorter versions are abridgements br Spoken audio has been available in schools and public libraries and to a lesser extent in music shops since the s Many spoken word albums were made prior to the age of cassettes compact discs and downloadable audio often of poetry and plays rather than books It was not until the s that the medium began to attract book retailers and then book retailers started displaying audiobooks on bookshelves rather than in separate displays br br br Etymology br The term talking book came into being in the s with government programs designed for blind readers while the term audiobook came into use during the s when audiocassettes began to replace phonograph records In the Audio Publishers Association established the term audiobook as the industry standard br br br History br br Spoken word recordings first became possible with the invention of the phonograph by Thomas Edison in Phonographic books were one of the original applications envisioned by Edison which would speak to blind people without effort on their part The initial words spoken into the phonograph were Edison s recital of Mary Had a Little Lamb the first instance of recorded verse In a demonstration at the Royal Institution in Britain included Hey Diddle Diddle the Cat and the Fiddle and a line of Tennyson s poetry thus establishing from the very beginning of the technology an association with spoken literature br br br United States br br br Beginnings to br Many short spoken word recordings were sold on cylinder in the late th and early th century however the round cylinders were limited to about minutes each making books impractical flat platters increased to minutes but this too was impractical for longer works One early listener complained that he would need a wheelbarrow to carry around talking books recorded on discs with such limited storage capacity By the s close grooved records increased to minutes making possible longer narrative br In the American Foundation for the Blind AFB and Library of Congress Books for the Adult Blind Project established the Talking Books Program Books for the Blind which was intended to provide reading material for veterans injured during World War I and other visually impaired adults The first test recordings in included a chapter from Helen Keller s Midstream and Edgar Allan Poe s The Raven The organization received congressional approval for exemption from copyright and free postal distribution of talking books The first recordings made for the Talking Books Program in included sections of the Bible the Declaration of Independence and other patriotic documents plays and sonnets by Shakespeare and fiction by Gladys Hasty Carroll E M Delafield Cora Jarrett Rudyard Kipling John Masefield and P G Wodehouse To save costs and quickly build inventories of audiobooks Britain and the United States shared recordings in their catalogs By looking at old catalogs historian Matthew Rubery has probably identified the first British produced audiobook as Agatha Christie s The Murder of Roger Ackroyd read by Anthony McDonald in br Recording for the Blind Dyslexic RFBD later renamed Learning Ally was founded in by Anne T Macdonald a member of the New York Public Library s Women s Auxiliary in response to an influx of inquiries from soldiers who had lost their sight in combat during World War II The newly passed GI Bill of Rights guaranteed a college education to all veterans but texts were mostly inaccessible to the recently blinded veterans who did not read Braille and had little access to live readers Macdonald mobilized the women of the Auxiliary under the motto Education is a right not a privilege Members of the Auxiliary transformed the attic of the New York Public Library into a studio recording textbooks using then state of the art six inch vinyl SoundScriber phonograph discs that played approximately minutes of material per side In Macdonald established recording studios in seven additional cities across the United States br Caedmon Records was a pioneer in the audiobook business It was the first company dedicated to selling spoken work recordings to the public and has been called the seed of the audiobook industry Caedmon was formed in New York in by college graduates Barbara Holdridge and Marianne Roney Their first release was a collection of poems by Dylan Thomas as read by the author The LP s B side contained A Child s Christmas in Wales which was added as an afterthought The story was obscure and Thomas himself could not remember its title when asked what to use to fill up the B side but this recording went on to become one of his most loved works and launched Caedmon into a successful company The original recording was a selection for the United States National Recording Registry stating it is credited with launching the audiobook industry in the United States Caedmon used LP records invented in which made longer recordings more affordable and practical however most of their works were poems plays and other short works not unabridged books due to the LP s limitation of about a minute playing time combined sides br Listening Library was also a pioneering company it was one of the first to distribute children s audiobooks to schools libraries and other special markets including VA hospitals It was founded by Anthony Ditlow and his wife in in their Red Bank New Jersey home Ditlow was partially blind Another early pioneering company was Spoken Arts founded in by Arthur Luce Klein and his wife they produced over recordings and were best known for poetry and drama recordings used in schools and libraries Like Caedemon Listening Library and Spoken Arts benefited from the new technology of LPs but also increased governmental funding for schools and libraries beginning in the s and s br br br to br Though spoken recordings were popular in vinyl record format for schools and libraries into the early s the beginning of the modern retail market for audiobooks can be traced to the wide adoption of cassette tapes during the s Cassette tapes were invented in and a few libraries such as the Library of Congress began distributing books on cassette by However during the s a number of technological innovations allowed the cassette tape wider usage in libraries and also spawned the creation of new commercial audiobook market These innovations included the introduction of small and cheap portable players such as the Walkman and the widespread use of cassette decks in cars particularly imported Japanese models which flooded the market during the multiple energy crises of the decade br In the early s instructional recordings were among the first commercial products sold on cassette There were companies distributing materials on cassette with titles such as Managing and Selling Companies cassettes and Executive Seminar in Sound on a series of minute cassettes In libraries most books on cassette were still made for blind and disabled people however some new companies saw the opportunity for making audiobooks for a wider audience such as Voice Over Books which produced abridged best sellers with professional actors Early pioneers included Olympic gold medalist Duvall Hecht who in founded the California based Books on Tape as a direct to consumer mail order rental service for unabridged audiobooks and expanded their services selling their products to libraries and audiobooks gaining popularity with commuters and travelers In Henry Trentman a traveling salesman who listened to sales tapes while driving long distances had the idea to create quality unabridged recordings of classic literature read by professional actors His company the Maryland based Recorded Books followed the model of Books on Tape but with higher quality studio recordings and actors Recorded Books and Chivers Audio Books were the first to develop integrated production teams and to work with professional actors br By there were eleven audiobook publishing companies they included Caedmon Metacom Newman Communications Recorded Books Brilliance and Books on Tape The companies were small the largest had a catalog of titles Some abridged titles were being sold in bookstores such as Walden Books but had negligible sales figures many were sold by mail order subscription or through libraries However in Brilliance Audio invented a technique for recording twice as much on the same cassette thus allowing for affordable unabridged editions The technique involved recording on each of the two channels of each stereo track This opened the market to new opportunities and by September Publishers Weekly identified twenty one audiobook publishers These included new major publishers such as Harper and Row Random House and Warner Communications br has been identified as the turning point in the industry when it matured from an experimental curiosity A number of events happened the Audio Publishers Association a professional non profit trade association was established by publishers who joined to promote awareness of spoken word audio and provide industry statistic Time Life began offering members audiobooks Book of the Month club began offering audiobooks to its members as did the Literary Guild Other clubs such as the History Book Club Get Rich Club Nostalgia Book Club Scholastic club for children all began offering audiobooks Publishers began releasing religious and inspirational titles in Christian bookstores By May Publishers Weekly initiated a regular column to cover the industry By the end of the audiobook market was estimated to be a million market and audiobooks on cassette were being sold in of regional and independent bookstores surveyed by Publishers Weekly By August there were forty audiobook publishers about four times as many as in br By the middle of the s the audio publishing business grew to billion dollars a year in retail value In the Audio Publishers Association established the Audie Awards for audiobooks which is equivalent to the Oscar for the audiobook industry The nominees are announced each year by February The winners are announced at a gala banquet in May usually in conjunction with BookExpo America br br br to present br With the spread of the Internet to consumers in the s faster download speeds with broadband technologies new compressed audio formats and portable media players the popularity of audiobooks increased significantly during the late s and s In Audible pioneered the world s first mass market digital media player named The Audible Player it retailed for held hours of audio and was touted as being smaller and lighter than a Walkman the popular cassette player used at the time Digital audiobooks were a significant new milestone as they allowed listeners freedom from physical media such as cassettes and CMP sas which required transportation through the mail allowing instead instant download access from online libraries of unlimited size and portability using comparatively small and lightweight devices Audible com was the first to establish a website in from which digital audiobooks could be purchased br Another innovation was the creation of LibriVox in by Montreal based writer Hugh McGuire who posed the question on his blog Can the net harness a bunch of volunteers to help bring books in the public domain to life through podcasting Thus began the creation of public domain audiobooks by volunteer narrators By the end of LibriVox had a catalog of over works br The transition from vinyl to cassette to CD to MP CD to digital download has been documented by Audio Publishers Association in annual surveys the earlier transition from record to cassette is described in the section on the s The final year that cassettes represented greater than of total market sales was Cassettes were replaced by CDs as the dominant medium during CDs reached a peak of of sales in then began to decline in favor of digital downloads The survey found CDs accounted for nearly half of all sales meaning it was no longer the dominant medium APA did not report the digital download figures for but in CDs accounted for and digital download was The APA estimates that audiobook sales in in digital format increased by over br The resurgence of audio storytelling is widely attributed to advances in mobile technologies such as smartphones tablets and multimedia entertainment systems in cars also known as connected car platforms Audio drama recordings are also now podcast over the internet br In Bob and Debra Deyan of Deyan Audio opened the Deyan Institute of Vocal Artistry and Technology the world s first campus and school for teaching the art and technology of audiobook production br In approximately

Edison Research s national survey of American audiobook listeners ages and up found that the average number of audiobooks listened to per year increased from in to in br br br Germany br The evolution and use of audiobooks in Germany H rbuch book for listening closely parallels that of the US A special example of its use is the West German Audio Book Library for the Blind founded in Actors from the municipal theater in M nster recorded the first audiobooks for the visually impaired in an improvised studio lined with egg cartons Because trams rattled past these first productions took place at night Later texts were recorded by trained speakers in professional studios and distributed to users by mail Until the s recordings were on tape reels then later cassettes Since the offerings have been recorded in the DAISY Digital Talking Book MP standard which provides additional features for visually impaired users to both listen and navigate written material aurally br br br India br Audiobooks in India started to appear somewhat later than in the rest of the world Only by did Audiobooks gain mainstream popularity in the Indian market This is primarily due to lack of previous organized efforts on the part of publishers and authors The marketing efforts and availability of Audiobooks has made India as one of the fastest growing Audiobooks markets in the world br The lifestyle of urban Indian population and one of the highest daily commute time in the world has also helped in making Audiobooks popular in the region Business and Self Help books have widespread appeal and have been more popular than fiction non fiction This is because Audiobooks are primarily seen as an avenue for self improvement and education rather than entertainment br Audiobooks are being released in various Indian languages In Malayalam the first audio novel titled Ouija Board was released by Kathacafe in Now Indian companies are working towards Audio Books generation in the

it has disappeared due to its failure to achieve meaningful results br Nearly years later interest in mobile has increased in but there are still tasks to be solved br First Audiobook lacked a lot of policy support related to the industry and secondly Audiobook production environment infrastructure was insufficient Third research and technology development such as academia has not been active in order to continue to grow as an Audiobook industry br br br Production br Producing an audiobook consists of a narrator sitting in a recording booth reading the text while a studio engineer and a director record and direct the performance If a mistake is made the recording is stopped and the narrator reads it again With recent advancements in recording technology many audiobooks are also now recorded in home studios by narrators working independently Audiobooks produced by major publishing houses undergo a proofing and editing process after narration is recorded br Narrators are usually paid on a finished recorded hour basis meaning if it took hours to produce a hour book the narrator is paid for hours thus providing an incentive not to make mistakes Depending on the narrator they are paid US per finished hour to US as of Many narrators also work as producers and deliver fully produced audiobooks which have been edited mastered and proofed They may charge an extra per finished hour in addition to their narration fee to coordinate and pay for the post production services The overall cost to produce an audiobook can vary significantly as longer books require more studio time and more well known narrators come at a premium According to a representative at Audible the cost of recording an audiobook has fallen from around US in the late s to around US US in br br br Formats br br Audiobooks are distributed on any audio format available but primarily these are records cassette tapes CDs MP CDs downloadable digital formats e g MP mp Windows Media Audio wma Advanced Audio Coding aac and solid state preloaded digital devices in which the audio content is preloaded and sold together with a hardware device br In a German inventor introduced the Sound Book cassette system based on the Tefifon format where instead of a magnetic tape the sound was recorded on a continuous loop of grooved vinylite ribbon similar to the old track tape Even though the original Tefifon upon which it was based ran at CPS and could hold a maximum of hours one Sound Book could hold eight hours of recordings as it ran at half the speed or CPS However just like the Tefifon the format never became widespread in use br A small number of books are recorded for radio broadcast usually in abridged form and sometimes serialized Audiobooks may come as fully dramatized versions of the printed book sometimes calling upon a complete cast music and sound effects Effectively audio dramas these audiobooks are known as full cast audiobooks BBC radio stations Radio Radio and Radio Extra have broadcast such productions as the William Gibson novel Neuromancer br An audio first production is a spoken word audio work that is an original production but not based on a book Examples include Joe Hill the son of Stephen King who released a Vinyl First audiobook called Dark Carousel in It came in a LP vinyl set or as a downloadable MP but with no published text Another example includes Spin The Audiobook Musical a musical rendition of Rumpelstiltskin narrated by Jim Dale and featuring a cast of Broadway musical stars br br br Use br br Audiobooks have been used to teach children to read and

to check out audiobooks in the CD format According to the National Endowment for the Arts study Reading at Risk A Survey of Literary Reading in America audiobook listening increases general literacy br br br Listening practices br br Audiobooks are considered a valuable tool because of their format Unlike traditional books or a video program one can listen to an audiobook while doing other tasks Such tasks include doing the laundry exercising weeding and similar activities The most popular general use of audiobooks by adults is when commuting with an automobile or while traveling with public transport as an alternative to radio or music Many people listen as well just to relax or as they drift off to sleep br A recent survey released by the Audio Publishers Association found that the overwhelming majority of audiobook users listen in the car and more than two thirds of audiobook buyers described audiobooks as relaxing and a good way to multitask Another stated reason for choosing audiobooks over other formats is that an audio performance makes some books more interesting br Common practices of listening include br br Replaying Depending upon one s degree of attention and interest it is often necessary to listen to segments of an audiobook more than once to allow the material to be understood and retained satisfactorily Replaying may be done immediately or after extended periods of time br Learning People may listen to an audiobook usually an unabridged one while following along in an actual book This helps them to learn words that they may not learn correctly if they were only to read the book This can also be a very effective way to learn a new language br Multitasking Many audiobook listeners choose the format because it allows multitasking during otherwise mundane or routine tasks such as exercising crafting or cooking br Entertainment Audiobooks have become a popular form of travel entertainment for families or commuters br br br
