A rune is a letter in a set of related alphabets known as runic alphabets native to the Germanic peoples Runes were used to write Germanic languages with some exceptions before they adopted the Latin alphabet and for specialised purposes thereafter In addition to representing a sound value a phoneme runes can be used to represent the concepts after which they are named ideographs Scholars refer to instances of the latter as Begriffsrunen concept runes The Scandinavian variants are also known as fu ark or futhark these names derived from the first six letters of the script and corresponding to the Latin letters f u th a r and k The Anglo Saxon variant is futhorc or fu orc due to changes in Old English of the sounds represented by the fourth letter br Runology is the academic study of the runic alphabets runic inscriptions runestones and their history Runology forms a specialised branch of Germanic philology br The earliest secure runic inscriptions date from around AD with a potentially earlier inscription dating to AD and Tacitus s potential description of rune use from around AD The Svingerud Runestone dates from between AD and Runes were generally replaced by the Latin alphabet as the cultures that had used runes underwent Christianisation by approximately AD in central Europe and in northern Europe However the use of runes persisted for specialized purposes beyond this period Up until the early th century runes were still used in rural Sweden for decorative purposes in Dalarna and on runic calendars br The three best known runic alphabets are the Elder Futhark c AD the Anglo Saxon Futhorc and the Younger Futhark The Younger Futhark is divided further into the long branch runes also called Danish although they were also used in Norway Sweden and Frisia short branch or R k runes also called Swedish Norwegian although they were also used in Denmark and the stavl sa or H lsinge runes staveless runes The Younger Futhark developed further into the medieval runes and the Dalecarlian runes c br The exact development of the early runic alphabet remains unclear but the script ultimately stems from the Phoenician alphabet Early runes may have developed from the Raetic Venetic Etruscan or Old Latin as candidates At the time all of these scripts had the same angular letter shapes suited for epigraphy which would become characteristic of the runes and related scripts in the region br The process of transmission of the script is unknown The oldest clear inscriptions are found in Denmark and northern Germany A West Germanic hypothesis suggests transmission via Elbe Germanic groups while a Gothic hypothesis presumes transmission via East Germanic expansion Runes continue to be used in a wide variety of ways in modern popular culture br br br Name br br br Etymology br br The name stems from a Proto Germanic form reconstructed as r n which may be translated as secret mystery secret conversation rune It is the source of Gothic r na secret mystery counsel Old English r n whisper mystery secret rune Old Saxon r na secret counsel confidential talk Middle Dutch r ne id Old High German r na secret mystery and Old Norse r n secret mystery rune The earliest Germanic epigraphic attestation is the Primitive Norse r n accusative singular found on the Einang stone AD and the Noleby stone AD br The term is related to Proto Celtic r na secret magic which is attested in Old Irish r n mystery secret Middle Welsh rin mystery charm Middle Breton rin secret wisdom and possibly in the ancient Gaulish Cobrunus com r nos confident cf Middle Welsh cyfrin Middle Breton queffrin Middle Irish comr n shared secret confidence and Sacruna sacro runa sacred secret as well as in Lepontic Runatis runo tis belonging to the secret However it is difficult to tell whether they are cognates linguistic siblings from a common origin or if the Proto Germanic form reflects an early borrowing from Celtic Various connections have been proposed with other Indo European terms for example Sanskrit r uti roar Latin r mor noise rumor Ancient Greek er ask and ereun investigate although linguist Ranko Matasovi finds them difficult to justify for semantic or linguistic reasons Because of this some scholars have speculated that the Germanic and Celtic words may have been a shared religious term borrowed from an unknown non Indo European language br br br Related terms br In early Germanic a rune could also be referred to as r na stabaz a compound of r n and stabaz staff letter It is attested in Old Norse r na stafr Old English r n st f and Old High German r n stab Other Germanic terms derived from r n include run n counsellor r njan and ga r njan secret mystery raun trial inquiry experiment hugi r n secret of the mind magical rune and halja r n witch sorceress literally possessor of the Hel secret It is also often part of personal names including Gothic Runilo Frankish R nfrid Old Norse Alfr n Dagr n Gu r n Sigr n lr n Old English lfr n and Lombardic Goder na br The Finnish word runo meaning poem is an early borrowing from Proto Germanic and the source of the term for rune riimukirjain meaning scratched letter The root may also be found in the Baltic languages where Lithuanian runoti means both to cut with a knife and to speak br The Old English form r n survived into the early modern period as roun which is now obsolete The modern English rune is a later formation that is partly derived from Late Latin runa Old Norse r n and Danish rune br br br History and use br br The runes were in use among the Germanic peoples from the st or nd century AD This period corresponds to the late Common Germanic stage linguistically with a continuum of dialects not yet clearly separated into the three branches of later centuries North Germanic West Germanic and East Germanic br No distinction is made in surviving runic inscriptions between long and short vowels although such a distinction was certainly present phonologically in the spoken languages of the time Similarly there are no signs for labiovelars in the Elder Futhark such signs were introduced in both the Anglo Saxon futhorc and the Gothic alphabet as variants of p see peor br br br Origins br br The formation of the Elder Futhark was complete by the early th century with the Kylver Stone being the first evidence of the futhark ordering as well as of the p rune br Specifically the Rhaetic alphabet of Bolzano is often advanced as a candidate for the origin of the runes with only five Elder Futhark runes e j p having no counterpart in the Bolzano alphabet Scandinavian scholars tend to favor derivation from the Latin alphabet itself over Rhaetic candidates A North Etruscan thesis is supported by the inscription on the Negau helmet dating to the nd century BC This is in a northern Etruscan alphabet but features a Germanic name Harigast Giuliano and Larissa Bonfante suggest that runes derived from some North Italic alphabet specifically Venetic But since Romans conquered Veneto after BC and then the Latin alphabet became prominent and Venetic culture diminished in importance Germanic people could have adopted the Venetic alphabet within the rd century BC or even earlier br The angular shapes of the runes are shared with most contemporary alphabets of the period that were used for carving in wood or stone There are no horizontal strokes when carving a message on a flat staff or stick it would be along the grain thus both less legible and more likely to split the wood This characteristic is also shared by other alphabets such as the early form of the Latin alphabet used for the Duenos inscription but it is not universal especially among early runic inscriptions which frequently have variant rune shapes including horizontal strokes Runic manuscripts that is written rather than carved runes such as Codex Runicus also show horizontal strokes br The West Germanic hypothesis speculates on an introduction by West Germanic tribes This hypothesis is based on claiming that the earliest inscriptions of the nd and rd centuries found in bogs and graves around Jutland the Vimose inscriptions exhibit word endings that being interpreted by Scandinavian scholars to be Proto Norse are considered unresolved and long having been the subject of discussion br In the early Runic period differences between Germanic languages are generally presumed to be small Another theory presumes a Northwest Germanic unity preceding the emergence of Proto Norse proper from roughly the th century An alternative suggestion explaining the impossibility of classifying the earliest inscriptions as either North or West Germanic is forwarded by A Makaev who presumes a special runic koine an early literary Germanic employed by the entire Late Common Germanic linguistic community after the separation of Gothic nd to th centuries while the spoken dialects may already have been more diverse br br br The Meldorf fibula and Tacitus s Germania br With the potential exception of the Meldorf fibula a possible runic inscription found in Schleswig Holstein dating to around AD the earliest reference to runes and runic divination may occur in Roman Senator Tacitus s ethnographic Germania Dating from around CE Tacitus describes the Germanic peoples as utilizing a divination practice involving rune like inscriptions br br For divination and casting lots they have the highest possible regard Their procedure for casting lots is uniform They break off the branch of a fruit tree and slice into strips they mark these by certain signs and throw them as random chance will have it on to a white cloth Then a state priest if the consultation is a public one or the father of the family if it is private prays to the gods and gazing to the heavens picks up three separate strips and reads their meaning from the marks scored on them If the lots forbid an enterprise there can be no further consultation about it that day if they allow it further confirmation by divination is required br As Victoria Symons summarizes If the inscriptions made on the lots that Tacitus refers to are understood to be letters rather than other kinds of notations or symbols then they would necessarily have been runes since no other writing system was available to Germanic tribes at this time br br br Early inscriptions br br Runic inscriptions from the year period AD are described as Period I These inscriptions are generally in Elder Futhark but the set of letter shapes and bindrunes employed is far from standardized Notably the j s and runes undergo considerable modifications while others such as p and remain unattested altogether prior to the first full futhark row on the Kylver Stone c AD br Artifacts such as spear heads or shield mounts have been found that bear runic marking that may be dated to AD as evidenced by artifacts found across northern Europe in Schleswig North Germany Funen Zealand Jutland Denmark and Scania Sweden Earlier but less reliable artifacts have been found in Meldorf S derdithmarschen in northern Germany these include brooches and combs found in graves most notably the Meldorf fibula and are supposed to have the earliest markings resembling runic inscriptions br br br Magical or divinatory use br br The stanza of H vam l attribute to runes the power to bring that which is dead back to life In this stanza Odin recounts a spell br br The earliest runic inscriptions found on artifacts give the name of either the craftsman or the proprietor or sometimes remain a linguistic mystery Due to this it is possible that the early runes were not used so much as a simple writing system but rather as magical signs to be used for charms Although some say the runes were used for divination there is no direct evidence to suggest they were ever used in this way The name rune itself taken to mean secret something hidden seems to indicate that knowledge of the runes was originally considered esoteric or restricted to an elite The th century Bj rketorp Runestone warns in Proto Norse using the word rune in both senses br br Haidzruno runu falahak haidera ginnarunaz Arageu haeramalausz uti az Weladaude sa z at barutz U arba spa br I master of the runes conceal here runes of power Incessantly plagued by maleficence doomed to insidious death is he who breaks this monument I prophesy destruction prophecy of destruction br br The same curse and use of the word rune is also found on the Stentoften Runestone There also are some inscriptions suggesting a medieval belief in the magical significance of runes such as the Franks Casket AD panel br Charm words such as auja la u lauka and most commonly alu appear on a number of Migration period Elder Futhark inscriptions as well as variants and abbreviations of them Much speculation and study has been produced on the potential meaning of these inscriptions Rhyming groups appear on some early bracteates that also may be magical in purpose such as salusalu and luwatuwa Further an inscription on the Gummarp Runestone AD gives a cryptic inscription describing the use of three runic letters followed by the Elder Futhark f rune written three times in succession br Nevertheless it has proven difficult to find unambiguous traces of runic oracles although Norse literature is full of references to runes it nowhere contains specific instructions on divination There are at least three sources on divination with rather vague descriptions that may or may not refer to runes Tacitus s st century Germania Snorri Sturluson s th century Ynglinga saga and Rimbert s th century Vita Ansgari br The first source Tacitus s Germania describes signs chosen in groups of three and cut from a nut bearing tree although the runes do not seem to have been in use at the time of Tacitus writings A second source is the Ynglinga saga where Granmar the king of S dermanland goes to Uppsala for the bl t There the chips fell in a way that said that he would not live long F ll honum svo sp nn sem hann mundi eigi lengi lifa These chips however are easily explainable as a bl tsp nn sacrificial chip which was marked possibly with sacrificial blood shaken and thrown down like dice and their positive or negative significance then decided br The third source is Rimbert s Vita Ansgari where there are three accounts of what some believe to be the use of runes for divination but Rimbert calls it drawing lots One of these accounts is the description of how a renegade Swedish king Anund Uppsale first brings a Danish fleet to Birka but then changes his mind and asks the Danes to draw lots According to the story this drawing of lots was quite informative telling them that attacking Birka would bring bad luck and that they should attack a Slavic town instead The tool in the drawing of lots however is easily explainable as a hlautlein lot twig which according to Foote and Wilson would be used in the same manner as a bl tsp nn br The lack of extensive knowledge on historical use of the runes has not stopped modern authors from extrapolating entire systems of divination from what few specifics exist usually loosely based on the reconstructed names of the runes and additional outside influence br A recent study of runic magic suggests that runes were used to create magical objects such as amulets but not in a way that would indicate that runic writing was any more inherently magical than were other writing systems such as Latin or Greek br br br Medieval use br br As Proto Germanic evolved into its later language groups the words assigned to the runes and the sounds represented by the runes themselves began to diverge somewhat and each culture would create new runes rename or rearrange its rune names slightly or stop using obsolete runes completely to accommodate these changes Thus the Anglo Saxon futhorc has several runes peculiar to itself to represent diphthongs unique to or at least prevalent in Old English br Some later runic finds are on monuments runestones which often contain solemn inscriptions about people who died or performed great deeds For a long time it was presumed that this kind of grand inscription was the primary use of runes and that their use was associated with a certain societal class of rune carvers br In the mid s however approximately inscriptions known as the Bryggen inscriptions were found in Bergen These inscriptions were made on wood and bone often in the shape of sticks of various sizes and contained information of an everyday nature ranging from name tags prayers often in Latin personal messages business letters and expressions of affection to bawdy phrases of a profane and sometimes even of a vulgar nature Following this find it is nowadays commonly presumed that at least in late use Runic was a widespread and common writing system br br In the later Middle Ages runes also were used in the clog almanacs sometimes called Runic staff Prim or Scandinavian calendar of Sweden and Estonia The authenticity of some monuments bearing Runic inscriptions found in Northern America is disputed most of them have been dated to modern times br br br Runes in Eddic poetry br In Norse mythology the runic alphabet is attested to a divine origin Old Norse reginkunnr This is attested as early as on the Noleby Runestone from c AD that reads Runo fahi raginakundo toj e k a meaning I prepare the suitable divine rune and in an attestation from the th century on the Sparl sa Runestone which reads Ok ra runa a r gi n kundu meaning And interpret the runes of divine origin In the Poetic Edda poem H vam l Stanza the runes also are described as reginkunnr br br The poem H vam l explains that the originator of the runes was the major deity Odin Stanza describes how Odin received the runes through self sacrifice br br In stanza Odin continues br br In the Poetic Edda poem R gs ula another origin is related of how the runic alphabet became known to humans The poem relates how R g identified as Heimdall in the introduction sired three sons Thrall slave Churl freeman and Jarl noble by human women These sons became the ancestors of the three classes of humans indicated by their names When Jarl reached an age when he began to handle weapons and show other signs of nobility R g returned and having claimed him as a son taught him the runes In the exiled Swedish archbishop Olaus Magnus recorded a tradition that a man named Kettil Runske had stolen three rune staffs from Odin and learned the runes and their magic br br br Runic alphabets br br br Elder Futhark nd to th centuries br br The Elder Futhark used for writing Proto Norse consists of runes that often are arranged in three groups of eight each group is referred to as an tt Old Norse meaning clan group The earliest known sequential listing of the full set of runes dates to approximately AD and is found on the Kylver Stone in Gotland Sweden br Most probably each rune had a name chosen to represent the sound of the rune itself The names are however not directly attested for the Elder Futhark themselves Germanic philologists reconstruct names in Proto Germanic based on the names given for the runes in the later alphabets attested in the rune poems and the linked names of the letters of the Gothic alphabet For example the letter a was named from the runic letter called Ansuz An asterisk before the rune names means that they are unattested reconstructions The Elder Futhark runes are the following br br br Anglo Saxon runes th to th centuries br br The Anglo Saxon runes also known as the futhorc sometimes written fu orc are an extended alphabet consisting of and later characters It was probably used from the th century onwards There are competing theories as to the origins of the Anglo Saxon also called Anglo Frisian Futhorc One theory proposes that it was developed in Frisia and later spread to England while another holds that Scandinavians introduced runes to England where the futhorc was modified and exported to Frisia Some examples of futhorc inscriptions are found on the Thames scramasax in the Vienna Codex in Cotton Otho B x Anglo Saxon rune poem and on the Ruthwell Cross br The Anglo Saxon rune poem gives the following characters and names feoh ur orn os rad cen gyfu ynn h gl nyd is ger eoh peor eolh sigel tir beorc eh mann lagu ing thel d g ac sc yr ior ear br Extra runes attested to outside of the rune poem include cweor calc gar and stan Some of these additional letters have only been found in manuscripts Feoh orn and sigel stood for f and s in most environments but voiced to v and z between vowels or voiced consonants Gyfu and wynn stood for the letters yogh and wynn which became g and w in Middle English br br br Marcomannic runes th to th centuries br br A runic alphabet consisting of a mixture of Elder Futhark with Anglo Saxon futhorc is recorded in a treatise called De Inventione Litterarum ascribed to Hrabanus Maurus and preserved in th and th century manuscripts mainly from the southern part of the Carolingian Empire Alemannia Bavaria The manuscript text attributes the runes to the Marcomanni quos nos Nordmannos vocamus and hence traditionally the alphabet is called Marcomannic runes but it has no connection with the Marcomanni and rather is an attempt of Carolingian scholars to represent all letters of the Latin alphabets with runic equivalents br Wilhelm Grimm discussed these runes in br br br Younger Futhark th to th centuries br br The Younger Futhark also called Scandinavian Futhark is a reduced form of the Elder Futhark consisting of only characters The reduction correlates with phonetic changes when Proto Norse evolved into Old Norse They are found in Scandinavia and Viking Age settlements abroad probably in use from the th century onward They are divided into long branch Danish and short twig Swedish and Norwegian runes The difference between the two versions is a matter of controversy A general opinion is that the difference between them was functional viz the long branch runes were used for documentation on stone whereas the short twig runes were in everyday use for private or official messages on wood br br br Medieval runes th to th centuries br br In the Middle Ages the Younger Futhark in Scandinavia was expanded so that it once more contained one sign for each phoneme of the Old Norse language Dotted variants of voiceless signs were introduced to denote the corresponding voiced consonants or vice versa voiceless variants of voiced consonants and several new runes also appeared for vowel sounds Inscriptions in medieval Scandinavian runes show a large number of variant rune forms and some letters such as s c and z often were used interchangeably br Medieval runes were in use until the th century Of the total number of Norwegian runic inscriptions preserved today most are medieval runes Notably more than inscriptions using these runes have been discovered in Bergen since the s mostly on wooden sticks the so called Bryggen inscriptions This indicates that runes were in common use side by side with the Latin alphabet for several centuries Indeed some of the medieval runic inscriptions are written in Latin br br br Dalecarlian runes th to th centuries br br According to Carl Gustav Werner In the isolated province of Dalarna in Sweden a mix of runes and Latin letters developed The Dalecarlian runes came into use in the early th century and remained in some use up to the th century Some discussion remains on whether their use was an unbroken tradition throughout this period or whether people in the th and th centuries learned runes from books written on the subject The character inventory was used mainly for transcribing Swedish in areas where Elfdalian was predominant br br br Differences from Roman script br While Roman script would ultimately replace runes in most contexts it differed significantly from runic script For example on the differences between the use of Anglo Saxon runes and the Latin script that would come to replace them runologist Victoria Symons says br br As well as being distinguished from the roman alphabet in visual appearance and letter order the fu orc is further set apart by the fact that unlike their roman counterparts runic letters are often associated not only with sound values but also with names These names are often nouns and in almost all instances they begin with the sound value represented by the associated letter The fact that each rune represents both a sound value and a word gives this writing system a multivalent quality that further distinguishes it from roman script A roman letter simply represents its sound value When used for example for the purpose of pagination such letters can assume added significance but this is localised to the context of an individual manuscript Runic letters on the other hand are inherently multivalent they can and often do represent several different kinds of information simultaneously This aspect of runic letters is one that is frequently employed and exploited by writers and scribes who include them in their manuscripts br br br Use as ideographs Begriffsrunen br In addition to their historic use as letters in the runic alphabets runes were also used to represent their names ideographs Such instances are sometimes referred to by way of the modern German loan word Begriffsrunen meaning concept runes singular Begriffsrune The criteria for the use of Begriffsrunen and the frequency of their use by ancient rune writers remains controversial The topic of Begriffsrunen has produced much discussion among runologists Runologist Klaus D wel has proposed two criteria for the identification of runes as Begriffsrunen A graphic argument and a semantic argument br Examples of Begriffsrunen or potential Begriffsrunen include the following br br In addition to the instances above several different runes occur as ideographs in Old English and Old Norse manuscripts featuring Anglo Saxon runes and Younger Futhark runes respectively Runologist Thomas Birkett summarizes these numerous instances as follows br br The ma r rune is found regularly in Icelandic manuscripts the f rune somewhat less frequently whilst in Anglo Saxon manuscripts the runes mon d g wynn and e el are all used on occasion These are some of the most functional of the rune names occurring relatively often in written language unlike the elusive peor for example which would be of little or no use as an abbreviation because of its rarity The practicality of using an abbreviation for a familiar noun such as man is demonstrated clearly in the Old Norse poem H vam l where the ma r rune is used a total of forty five times saving a significant amount of space and effort Codex Regius br br br Academic study br br The modern study of runes was initiated during the Renaissance by Johannes Bureus Bureus viewed runes as holy or magical in a kabbalistic sense The study of runes was continued by Olof Rudbeck Sr and presented in his collection Atlantica Anders Celsius further extended the science of runes and travelled around the whole of Sweden to examine the runstenar From the golden age of philology in the th century runology formed a specialized branch of Germanic linguistics br br br Body of inscriptions br br The largest group of surviving Runic inscription are Viking Age Younger Futhark runestones commonly found in Denmark and Sweden Another large group are medieval runes most commonly found on small objects often wooden sticks The largest concentration of runic inscriptions are the Bryggen inscriptions found in Bergen more than in total Elder Futhark inscriptions number around about of which are from Scandinavia of which about half are on bracteates Anglo Saxon futhorc inscriptions number around items br br br Modern use br br Runic alphabets have seen numerous uses since the th century Viking revival in Scandinavian Romantic nationalism Gothicismus and Germanic occultism in the th century and in the context of the Fantasy genre and of modern Germanic paganism in the th century br br br Esotericism br br br Germanic mysticism and Nazi Germany br br The pioneer of the Armanist branch of Ariosophy and one of the more important figures in esotericism in Germany and Austria in the late th and early th century was the Austrian occultist mysticist and v lkisch author Guido von List In he published in Das Geheimnis der Runen The Secret of the Runes a set of eighteen so called Armanen runes based on the Younger Futhark and runes of List s own introduction which allegedly were revealed to him in a state of temporary blindness after cataract operations on both eyes in The use of runes in Germanic mysticism notably List s Armanen runes and the derived Wiligut runes by Karl Maria Wiligut played a certain role in Nazi symbolism The fascination with runic symbolism was mostly limited to Heinrich Himmler and not shared by the other members of the Nazi top echelon Consequently runes appear mostly in insignia associated with the Schutzstaffel SS the paramilitary organization led by Himmler Wiligut is credited with designing the SS Ehrenring which displays a number of Wiligut runes br br br Modern paganism and esotericism br Runes are popular in New Age

br br Runes play an important role in the horror story Casting the Runes by the academic Medievalist and ghost story author M R James first published in his collection More Ghost Stories of an Antiquary In J R R Tolkien s novel The Hobbit the Anglo Saxon runes are used on a map and on the title page to emphasize its connection to the Dwarves They also were used in the initial drafts of The Lord of the Rings but later were replaced by the Cirth rune like alphabet invented by Tolkien used to write the language of the Dwarves Khuzdul Following Tolkien historical and fictional runes appear
