F erie French pronunciation fe i sometimes translated as fairy play was a French theatrical genre known for fantasy plots and spectacular visuals including lavish scenery and mechanically worked stage effects F eries blended music dancing pantomime and acrobatics as well as magical transformations created by designers and stage technicians to tell stories with clearly defined melodrama like morality and an extensive use of supernatural elements The genre developed in the early th century and became immensely popular in France throughout the nineteenth century influencing the development of burlesque musical comedy and film br br br Style br br F eries used a fairy tale aesthetic to combine theatre with music dances mime acrobatics and especially spectacular visual effects created by innovative stage machinery such as trap doors smoke machines and quickly changeable sets Songs always appeared usually featuring new lyrics to familiar melodies Transformation scenes in which a scene would change as if by magic in full view of the audience were an important component of the style until nearly all scene changes in f eries were full view transformations The last transformation in a f erie accompanied by a flourish of music led to the apotheosis a grand final stage picture usually involving beautiful supernumeraries descending from the sky or suspended on wires br These elements especially the spectacle and stage effects were far more prominent than the plot The critic Francisque Sarcey suggested that for a f erie the crew in charge of design and stagecraft should be regarded as more important than the writers noting that the scripts themselves were so incoherent that one can put the beginning at the end and vice versa Th ophile Gautier even suggested with considerable irony that the immensely successful f erie Les Pilules du diable could be performed as a purely mimed production so that no spoken words would distract the audience from the spectacle they had come to enjoy The total effect was one of a dazzling dreamlike array of visuals harkening back to fairy tale traditions and a childlike sense of wonder through the use of innovative stage technology In a review of The Blue Bird a writer in the Journal des d bats commented satirically on the spectacular frivolity of a typical f erie but positively on the genre s vast potential for creativity br br Nothing is more rare than a f erie which is not an absurd mixture of ridiculous adventures and burlesque inventions and which consists otherwise only as an exhibition of tricks costumes and decors Nevertheless what resources are offered by the f erie to the poetic imagination br br The plots of f eries were usually borrowed from fairy tales in the French tradition such as those by Charles Perrault and Madame d Aulnoy other f eries borrowed from outside sources such as the One Thousand and One Nights or created original plots Like melodramas the form f eries involved a stirring battle between forces of good and evil However where melodrama merely suggested the existence of these extremes f eries made them unabashedly literal by embodying them as witches gnomes and other supernatural creatures The clear moral tone was heightened by the dialogue which often included maxims about love duty virtue and similar topics A full length f erie often ran for several hours br Four human characters reliably appeared among the supernatural forces two young lovers an ingenue and her heroic suitor an often comical and grotesque rival for the affections of the ingenue and a lazy valet obsessed with eating The supernatural forces in the plot drove these characters through fantastic landscapes and multiple adventures typically involving magic talismans used to transform people things and places The apotheosis reunited the lovers to dazzling effect br br br Origins br br The f erie can trace its origins to the ballet de cour court ballet tradition of the Renaissance in which such court leaders as Catherine de Medici and Henry IV of France would commission spectacularly designed ballets based on mythological subjects and fables Another notable precursor is the pi ces machines plays with machines genre popular at the Th tre du Marais in the mid th century again using mythology as source material Moli re s Psych is a notable small scale example and Corneille s Androm de and La Toison d or also count within the genre These genres owed much to the theatrical engineering work of Italian architects especially Nicola Sabbatini These spectacles paved the way for th century fairground pantomimes th tre de la foire such as Arlequin dans un oeuf at the Th tre des Jeunes Artistes or Les Eaux de Merlin by Alain Ren Lesage The fairground pantomimes by combining motifs from the Commedia dell Arte with lavish fantasy created by theatrical spectacle served as the most direct precursor of the th century f erie br The French Revolution changed the face of French theatre with a large new audience to please the bourgeoisie Various genres developed to please bourgeois tastes The f erie combining the fairground influences with the farcical style of com die en vaudeville began as a form of melodrama but the gap between them quickly became highly pronounced For the nineteenth century audience the two genres stood at opposite ends of a spectrum at one end was melodrama with its plots calculated to make audiences weep f erie filled a place at the other extreme providing entertainment designed to make audiences laugh Notable early attempts toward the genre were Cuvelier de Trie s adaptations of Tom Thumb and Puss in Boots in and respectively The development of the f erie was helped along by a growing French interest in the literary qualities of classic fairy tales and by the popularity of the One Thousand and One Nights after its first publication in France br br br Early successes br br The f erie in the full th century sense of the word was born on December with the premiere at the Th tre de la Ga t of Le Pied de mouton The Mutton Foot The play written by Alphonse Martainville in collaboration with the actor C sar Ribi follows the quest of a lovesick hero Guzman to save his lover Leonora from the hands of a villainous rival With the help of a magic talisman the mutton foot of the title and under the watch of a fairy who espouses the value of virtue and duty Guzman braves his way through a series of spectacular trials spiced with music ballet and duels Thanks to stage machinery magical events flow freely through the play portraits move people fly chaperones transform into guitarists food disappears In the end love conquers all and the fairy intervenes once more to ensure the triumph of good over evil br Le Pied de mouton was widely successful and frequently revived It codified the standard form of f eries for the next hundred years a narrative in which the hero or heroes undergo a series of adventures through spectacular scenes with the sets often magically transforming in view of the audience Scholars continue to cite it as a quintessential example of the genre br br The f erie once established quickly flourished between and alone some sixty f eries were produced An m lodrame f erie at the Porte Saint Martin Le Monstre et le magicien struck new ground not only thematically it had a Gothic edge and was based on Mary Shelley s Frankenstein but also literally an English designer Tomkins was brought in to install a complex new system of trapdoors in the stage floor While the trap doors became a staple for f erie effects the fashion for Gothic fiction onstage subsided by the s One of Guilbert de Pix r court s most famous works in the genre Ondine or La Nymphe des Eaux marks the beginning of a popular trend for plots featuring romances between mortals and supernatural beings it tells the balletic often aquatic love story of the water nymph Ondine who obtains a soul by falling in love with a mortal Technical advances in stage machinery were quickly woven into new f erie productions gas lighting installed in most major Paris theaters by the late s allowed for more realistic set designs and various atmospheric effects with limelight becoming especially useful to simulate sunbeams and moonbeams Similarly Louis Daguerre s invention of the diorama a staged tableau animated and transformed by changes in lighting widely influenced f erie transformation effects br br The first great hit to match the success of Le Pied de mouton was the Cirque Olympique s Les Pilules du diable from a script by the vaudeville writer Auguste Anicet Bourgeois and two writers for circus productions Laloue and Laurent While the stage effects had gotten more spectacular since the initial f eries the plots remained familiar in this play the rich hidalgo Sottinez madly in love with the ingenue Isabelle pursues her and her lover Albert through bizarre and spectacular adventures Les Pilules du diable was widely revived and imitated and was possibly the most celebrated f erie of all br Later successful f eries included La Biche au bois La Chatte Blanche and Peau d ne all of which borrowed heavily from fairy tales and romances while reframing their stories to suit the tastes of the day The popular playwright Adolphe d Ennery had a hit at the Ga t in with Les Sept Ch teaux du diable a morality play like fantasy in which a pair of young couples face temptations in castles representing the Seven Deadly Sins among d Ennery s other f eries is the similarly moral Rothomago Many successful f eries were the work of the prolific Cogniard brothers their adaptation of the One Thousand and One Nights Les Mille et une nuits introduced exoticism to the genre while preserving its lighthearted vaudevillian dialogue Other notable Cogniard productions were La Chatte blanche with the caf concert performer Th r sa the trick filled La Poudre de Perlinpinpin and in collaboration with the vaudeville writer Clairville the Vari t s production Les Bibelots du diable a comic spectacle with winking references and allusions to most of the major f eries that had gone before it The comic strain of Le Pied de mouton and Les Pilules du diable was emphasized in many of these successes such as Les Sept Ch teaux Perlinpinpin and Les Bibelots br br Because of the large scale of the spectacle the biggest and most technically equipped Parisian stages became the most in demand venues for the shows The Cirque Olympique formerly an arena used for political and equestrian spectacles took advantage of its deep stage to present expensively mounted f eries it was eventually replaced by a new auditorium built specifically for spectacle the Th tre du Ch telet The Th tre de la Porte Saint Martin originally designed for opera productions had a stage and machinery well suited to the demands of the f erie and flourished with the genre under the direction of Marc Fournier br br br Evolution of the term br The term f erie began as an adjective used together with more established descriptive terms to advertise a production s genre Many of the first f eries were advertised as m lodrame f eries fairy melodrama half of all f eries presented between and were so described a description which fell out of favor during the s Pantomime f eries developed by the mime Deburau became highly popular in the s Other popular descriptors included folie f eries and com die f eries Op ra f eries with an increased emphasis on music first flourished in the s eventually developing into a form of operetta in such works as Jacques Offenbach s Le Voyage dans la lune Most popular of all were vaudeville f eries written by vaudeville playwrights and featuring more songs and jokes than other productions did This style became so widespread that by the late s vaudeville f eries were known simply as f eries and their particular tone became the standard across the genre br br br International variants br br James Robinson Planch after seeing a f erie at the Th tre de la Porte Saint Martin on his honeymoon in brought the genre to England as the fairy extravaganza He staged some twenty fairy extravaganzas in London between and The nineteenth century pantomime also had strong similarities to the f erie with one critic for a New Zealand newspaper describing Les coups du diable as a fairy play which in everything but in name is very much like our own Christmas pantomime With its fairy tale themes the f erie can be also compared to later English fairy plays such as J M Barrie s Peter Pan or to American fairy tale extravaganzas such as L Frank Baum s musical version of The Wizard of Oz br In Spain the comedia de magia a genre very similar to the f erie began a rise to prominence in with the works of Juan Salvo y Vela The form was well established there by the time Juan Grimaldi adapted Le Pied de mouton for the Spanish stage in Grimaldi s version La Pata de Cabra was a pronounced popular success and was widely imitated br In Russia the concept of fairy tale spectacle merged with narrative ballet to create the ballet f erie fairy ballet This form took its name from the French genre and its dance characteristics from the Italian ballo grande style It was often considered a lower class more commercialized entertainment than traditional ballet many late nineteenth century Russian critics attacked it describing it as a foreign threat to national ballet traditions Nonetheless the ballet f erie form attracted considerable artistic attention Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky s The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker are both ballet f eries Like the French f erie the ballet f erie emphasized spectacle and stage effects Where previous dance stagings had emphasized the technique and solo virtuosity of the prima ballerina the new genre put the focus on ensemble dances magical transformations and shifting stage pictures created with movement and color br br br Popularity br br By the mid nineteenth century f eries had become one of the foremost venues for fairy tale storytelling in popular culture and had gained the fascination and respect of some of the foremost writers of the day Th ophile Gautier often reviewed them in his capacity as a writer on the theatre comparing the shifting scenes and magical occurrences of the f erie to a dream br br What a charming summer spectacle is a f erie That which doesn t demand any attention and unravels without logic like a dream that we make wide awake It is a symphony of forms of colours and of lights The characters brilliantly clothed wander through a perpetually changing series of tableaux panic stricken stunned running after each other searching to reclaim the action which goes who knows where but what does it matter The dazzling of the eyes is enough to make for an agreeable evening br The popularity of the f erie had its first peak in the s by the end of the decade around the time of Les Bibelots du diable the focus had shifted from the fairy tale plot to extravaganza on its own terms Siraudin and Delacour s satire La Queue de la po le parodied the conventions of the genre much as Fr d rick Lema tre had done to melodrama in his version of L Auberge des Adrets br Though seen as somewhat old fashioned during the s the genre saw a second surge in popularity from through the s in which ever more lavish versions of the genre s classics were mounted In his dictionary of theatre arts Arthur Pougin noted that audiences always show up in great numbers to any f erie on offer because they adore this truly magical entertainment and praised the f erie as surely a delightful entertainment when it is in the hands of a true poet It freely enters the whimsy of his imagination and can both delight the viewer s mind and enchant their eyes br One of the poems in Charles Baudelaire s Les Fleurs du mal L Irreparable was inspired by a f erie he had seen La Belle aux Cheveaux d Or starring Marie Daubrun an actress with whom he was smitten Gustave Flaubert even wrote a full length f erie Le Ch teau des c urs in though it was never performed Jules Verne made his own contribution to the genre in with Journey Through the Impossible written in collaboration with Adolphe d Ennery and featuring themes and characters from Verne s well known novels Maurice Maeterlinck s play The Blue Bird was likewise described by contemporary observers as a f erie though critics noted that it was a more overtly poetic and intellectual example of the genre than the classic Ch telet productions br br br Later years br br From s La Voyage dans la lune onward some f eries began to show a trend for incorporating scientific and technological themes into their plots a novelty due in part to the popularity and influence of Jules Verne s works A related and very popular genre was also derived from Verne the pi ce de grand spectacle an extravagantly lavish production built on a colorful but not fantasy based plot The genre was launched with Verne and d Ennery s smash hit dramatization of Around the World in Eighty Days quickly followed by two further adaptations from the same team The Children of Captain Grant and Michael Strogoff The style of the pi ce de grand spectacle was so close to the f erie that some critics found the terms interchangeable Alphonse Daudet called Around the World the most sumptuous the most original of all f eries while Jules Claretie said he overheard a theatregoer describe the show as La Biche au bois by locomotive Eventually Around the World and Michael Strogoff both immensely successful codified the pi ce de grand spectacle as a genre of its own in competition with the similar but magic based form of the classical f erie br The f erie fell out of popularity by the end of the th century by which time it was largely seen as entertainment for children It disappeared from French stages just as another medium the cinema was beginning to supplant it as a form of storytelling spectacle br br br Legacy br br With his film version of Cinderella Georges M li s brought the f erie into the newly developing world of motion pictures The f erie quickly became one of film s most popular and lavishly mounted genres in the early years of the twentieth century with such pioneers as Edwin S Porter Cecil Hepworth Ferdinand Zecca and Albert Capellani contributing fairy tale adaptations in the f erie style or filming versions of popular stage f eries like Le Pied de mouton Les Sept Ch teaux du diable and La Biche au bois The leader in the genre however remained M li s who designed many of his major films as f eries and whose work as a whole is intensely suffused with the genre s influence Jacques Demy s film Peau d ne also shows a strong f erie influence using elements of the f erie of the same name by Emile Vanderburch Evrard Laurencin and Charles Clairville br With its explorations into ways of integrating spectacle comedy and music in the theatre the f erie also influenced the development of burlesque and musical comedy In recollections of his career making films in the M li s tradition Ferdinand Zecca reflected on the genre s power It s not in the dramas and the acrobatic films that I put my greatest hope It was in the f eries br br br Notes br br br Footnotes br br br br br br Sources br br br
