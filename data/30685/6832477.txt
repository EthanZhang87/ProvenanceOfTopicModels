title: A Preface to Paradise Lost
id: 6832477
A Preface to Paradise Lost is one of C S Lewis s most famous scholarly works The book had its genesis in Lewis s Ballard Matthews Lectures which he delivered at the University College of North Wales in It discusses the epic poem Paradise Lost by John Milton br br Lewis s work responds to Denis Saurat s work Milton Man and Thinker which had celebrated Milton the man as well as the centrality of the personal Milton s heresies to an understanding of the epic Lewis disagrees with this point of view Lewis dismisses what he calls Milton s private thoughts idiosyncratic and accidental as they are as well as the heresies that reduce themselves to something very small Lewis s Paradise Lost rather is defined as Augustinian and Hierarchical and also as he writes with a slight nudge and a wink Catholic although he does immediately acknowledge that he s using the term in its ordinary sense to mean universal not Roman Catholic br br br Summary br The book has no material before Chapter besides a dedication to Charles Williams br br br Epic genre and criticism br Chapter Epic Poetry introduces the epic genre br br Chapter Is Criticism Possible is a digression that replies to a remark by T S Eliot in A Note on the Verse of John Milton Eliot had said There is a large class of persons including some who appear in print as critics who regard any censure upon a great poet as a breach of the peace as an act of wanton iconoclasm or even hoodlumism The kind of derogatory criticism that I have to make upon Milton is not intended for such persons who cannot understand that it is more important in some vital respects to be a good poet than to be a great poet and of what I have to say I consider that the only jury of judgement is that of the ablest poetical practitioners of my own time Lewis paraphrases the last clause and focuses on it but interprets it rather as a representative of the idea that poets are the only judges of poetry meant in a general sense rather than applying only to Eliot s specific criticism of Milton at that specific time Lewis then critically examines this idea believing that it leads to a situation where every poet would be trapped in a self referential cycle where their own judgment of being a poet is a necessary precondition for their critique to be valuable br Chapters are titled Primary Epic The Technique of Primary Epic and The Subject of Primary Epic They discuss Lewis s concept of primary epic the oldest kind of epic genre represented by the epics of Homer and by Beowulf br br Chapter Virgil and the Subject of Secondary Epic discusses the influence of Virgil s Aeneid on the secondary epic genre which came after primary epic primarily by introducing the idea that it should have a great theme It also introduces the importance of vocation and the choice between vocation and happiness as a typical trait of secondary epic br br br Style br br Chapter The Style of Secondary Epic explains the peculiar style of Virgil and Milton as coming from the fact that epic is no longer recited but can only be read and must give the effect of the performance entirely through the writing br Lewis points out three main mechanisms through which Milton achieves his elevated style namely the use of archaic and unfamiliar constructs the use of proper names and the constant allusion to sensory experiences br br br Similes br Lewis explains Milton s unique approach to similes Unlike traditional similes that draw clear analogies Milton s similes often have superficial logical connections but profound emotional or thematic resonances The Miltonic simile thus operates on two levels a surface level logical connection and a deeper emotional or thematic linkage This technique is shown by when Paradise is compared to the field of Enna with the primary connection being how both locations are one beautiful landscape to another IV Beneath this surface connection the deeper value of the simile lies in the resemblance which is not explicitly noted as a resemblance at all the fact that in both these places the young and the beautiful while gathering flowers was ravished by a dark power risen up from the underworld br This simile neglects that Eve is far more responsible for her own fall than was Proserpina and when expelled she will bring death and pain down upon herself her spouse and all their descendants to a degree that would seem to exceed Ceres s Demeter s terrible pain at Hades s abduction of her daughter as Stephen Scully points out Lewis himself notes that sometimes the logical underpinning of Milton s similes can stretch thin as in the case of Satan s association with the unpleasant smell of fish br br br Description versus arousal br br Focusing on Satan s approach to Paradise in book IV lines Lewis analyses how Milton s style does not describe events and landscapes in the narrative but rather while seeming to describe uses general language to arouse the Paradisal idea as it exists in our own depth Lewis justly observes that this is done by making the sequence of Satan s entering Paradise resemble a dream as Satan approaches Paradise Milton describes various tiers of the landscape but just when it seems like we ve reached the highest point another layer or aspect is revealed and as in dream landscapes we find that what seemed the top is not the top Lewis perceptively observed that we experience an almost kinesthetic sense of straining to look higher and higher so as to take in the full view br Chapter Defence of this Style defends the style of secondary epic against some objections br br br Worldview br Chapter The Doctrine of the Unchanging Human Heart criticizes the idea that readers should seek an unchanging human heart beneath all the theology of Milton or more generally to read past the outmoded ideas of premodern literature br Chapter Milton and St Augustine gives context to the poem by presenting a version of the Fall story based on St Augustine since Lewis claims that Milton s version of the story is substantially the same as the one given by Augustine which is that of the Church as a whole Lewis says that he hopes that this short analysis will prevent the reader from ever raising certain questions this sentence was seized upon by Michael Bryson as a sign that Lewis wished to downplay Milton s heresies in such a way as to make it impossible for his readers to even think to question Milton s orthodoxy br Chapter Hierarchy explains the effect of the idea of hierarchy as it applies to the poem Paradise Lost manifests according to Lewis order proportion measure and control Lewis commenting on critical views in which there is felt to be a disquieting contrast between republicanism for the earth and royalism for Heaven argues that all such opinions are false and argue a deep misunderstanding of Milton s central thought Arguing from the principle that the goodness happiness and dignity of every being consists in obeying its natural superior and ruling its natural inferiors Lewis claims that there is no contradiction between Milton s poem and his politics because Milton believed that God was his natural superior and that Charles Stuart was not Lewis is correct in asserting that in holding this position Milton belongs to the ancient orthodox tradition of European ethics but he downplays the significance of Milton using this tradition against kings rather than to bolster their position by affirming that society and above all the king embody such relations of natural superiority br br Chapter The Theology of Paradise Lost evaluates to what extent the poem shows that its author is a heretic Lewis claims that as far as doctrine goes the poem is overwhelmingly Christian Except for a few isolated passages it is not even specifically Protestant or Puritan It gives the great central tradition Paradise Lost according to Lewis bases its poetry on conceptions not to be found in seventeenth century radical politics but in those that have been held always and everywhere by all br br According to Lewis criticism should not be interested at all in connections to Milton s private thinking In Paradise Lost we are to study what the poet with his singing robes about him has given and not the private theological whimsies that he laid aside during his working hours as an epic poet Lewis s Milton hearkens back to the attempts of Bentley and Johnson to separate the private radical heterodox and wild man from the putatively orthodox achievement of the poem To the extent that Lewis attacks like Eliot personality he is attacking a Milton attached to revolutionary politics antinomian ethics and the worship of Man by Man but also a conception of criticism that focuses more on psychology than on the best of Milton which is in his epic Why he writes with a jibe at Saurat s emphasis on passion and sensuality must Noah always figure in our minds drunk and naked never building the Ark Saurat through his reading of the romantics had brought not only the individual but the unconscious into Paradise Lost Lewis the figure of Anglican orthodoxy for whom Decorum is the grand masterpiece prefers Milton the very disciplined artist to the admittedly undisciplined man of passion br br br Satan and other angels br br Chapter Satan defends the idea that Milton did not seek to present Satan as an admirable figure but rather that Milton uses all his skill to make us regard Satan as a despicable human being Lewis focuses on Satan s egoism claiming that Satan s monomaniac concern with himself and his supposed rights and wrongs is a necessity of the Satanic predicament br Lewis urges that we should simply reject everything Satan says as untrue even from his own point of view and refers to him as a personified self contradiction Lewis demonstrates with perhaps more vigor than necessary that Satan s line Evil be thou my Good is absurd Lewis comments that by his argument in book V lines ff Satan renders himself ridiculous since he both loses in dignity and produces just the evidence to prove that he was not self created Helen Gardner says that C S Lewis building as he delighted to own on Mr Williams destroyed one hopes for ever the notion that Satan had grounds for his rebellion br From hero to general from general to politician from politician to secret service agent and thence to a thing that peers in at bedroom or bathroom windows and thence to a toad and finally to a snake such is the progress of Satan according to Lewis s analysis of Milton Lewis rightly rejects the belief that Milton began by making Satan more glorious than he intended and then too late attempted to rectify the error saying that such an unerring picture of the sense of injured merit in its actual operations upon character cannot have come about by blundering and accident br Chapter Satan s Followers discusses the infernal debate among the fallen angels in Hell in Book II of Paradise Lost br Chapter The Mistake about Milton s Angels explains that Milton probably believed in a kind of Platonic Theology according to which angels were not incorporeal but instead had bodies made of very fine and subtle matter br br br Humanity br br Chapter Adam and Eve explains the portrayal of Adam and Eve in Paradise Lost as wise and mature rather than innocent in the sense of childish br Chapter Unfallen Sexuality discusses whether Milton succeeded in his portrayal of human sexuality in its unfallen state Lewis displays disquiet at Milton s attributing sexual modesty to Eve and allowing her to blush and uneasiness at Milton s making it quite clear that there was pleasure in the act of love before the Fall these attitudes were not shared by Helen Gardner Lewis suggests that Milton should instead have treated the loves of Adam and Eve as remotely and mysteriously as the loves of the angels and Helen Gardner disagreed with this as well br Chapter The Fall claims that Eve fell through Pride whereas Adam fell by uxoriousness It claims that the precise name in English for the sin committed by Eve is Murder this analysis was criticized by Helen Gardner although she agreed with Lewis s claim that the temptation and fall of Eve is not dramatically exploited or lingered on as Lewis says the whole thing is so quick each new element of folly malice and corruption enters so unobtrusively so naturally that it is hard to realize we have been watching the genesis of murder br br br Conclusion br Chapter Conclusion gives a very short estimate of the poem s value as a whole He famously describes the last two books as an untransmuted lump of futurity and inartistic He remarks on other critics claiming that after Blake Milton criticism is lost in misunderstanding and the true line is hardly found again until Mr Charles Williams s preface br br br Reception br Helen Gardner describes A Preface to Paradise Lost as immensely influential Michael Bryson in The Atheist Milton mentions the influence of A Preface to Paradise Lost on views of Milton s theological outlook by saying that it has been primarily since the publication of C S Lewis s A Preface to Paradise Lost that the image of Milton as the great defender of a somehow Augustinian orthodoxy has taken hold Bryson highlights the continuing effect of Lewis s work on such views br William Kolbrener claims that Lewis along with T S Eliot set the course for Milton Studies for the second half of the twentieth century and that he set forth a tradition of interpretation which was later followed by Stanley Fish s book Surprised By Sin John P Rumrich made the same assessment of Fish describing Fish s book as a methodologically radical update of Lewis s reading of Paradise Lost as a literary monument to mainstream Christianity Michael Bryson highlights the importance of this in his remark that even more than Lewis s work however the book that has cast the longest shadow over the field of Milton studies at least in the United States for the last years is Stanley Fish s Surprised by Sin Rumrich characterizes this interpretive tradition as an approach that promises historical fidelity yet at the same time represents Milton as the exponent of a transhistorical Christian tradition br br br Criticism br Helen Gardner claims that C S Lewis s discussion of the varieties of evil disposition shown in the great consult of Book II seems to range very far from what the text presents to our imagination and that Lewis s analysis of the successive sins that Eve falls into ending with Murder presents us with the abstractions and exaggerations of the moralist in place of Milton s presentation of the events br br br Theology br David Hopkins claims that Lewis s Preface to Paradise Lost gives the impression that only those who shared Milton s and Lewis s Christian faith would be likely to enjoy or respect the poem but that this is not true and is contradicted by Lewis himself in certain passages from An Experiment in Criticism br William Kolbrener regarded Lewis s attempt to acquit Paradise Lost of heresy as unsuccessful claiming that Lewis s insistence on an orthodox Milton like Bentley s before him can t help but reveal the heretical perspectives even the passionate and sensual energies it attempts to repress br Michael Bryson in a book titled The Atheist Milton criticizes Lewis s attempt to prevent the reader from ever raising certain questions about Milton s orthodoxy claiming that Milton is hardly the spokesperson for the kind of Anglican orthodoxy C S Lewis tried to assimilate him to and claims that the false simplicity of Lewis s approach to such questions as the role of Disobedience in the epic and to the significance of the apple is designed it seems as it also seems with David Urban to promote a very specific theological agenda br br br Portrayal of Satan br br Regarding the portrayal of Satan Arnold Stein said that C S Lewis in reducing Satan s argument to its illogical nonsense seems to overlook the possibility that Satan may be conscious of what he is saying br br Helen Gardner saw Lewis s analysis of the character of Satan as displaying Lewis s own harsh view of human nature Mr Lewis in exposing Shelley s misconceptions has inverted the Romantic attitude for the effect of his chapter on Satan is to make us feel that because Satan is wicked and wicked with no excuse he is not to be pitied but is to be hated and despised Shelley saw in Satan the indomitable rebel against unjust tyranny and while regretting the taints in his character excused them Mr Lewis who thinks more harshly of himself and of human nature than Shelley did exposes Satan with all the energy and argumentative zeal which we used to hear our European Service employing in denouncing the lies of Goebbels and revealing the true nature of the promises of Hitler Both Shelley s passionate sympathy and Mr Lewis s invective derive from the same fundamental attitude It is we who are Satan Margaret Olofson Thickstun also sees Lewis s analysis as a response to Romantic attitudes and sees support in it for the view that Satan may be redeemed through apocatastasis Surprisingly support for reading apocastatic potential in Satan s story comes from another extremely orthodox reader of Paradise Lost C S Lewis Responding to a Romantic tradition that sympathizes with a Satan whom they claim Milton made more glorious than he intended Lewis argues against valorizing Satan precisely by emphasizing his interiority He reminds readers that the terrible soliloquy in Book IV was conceived and in part composed before the first two books It was from this conception that Milton started Lewis Lewis means to enlist this fact to support recognition of Satan s consistency as a character but it also underscores Milton s theological perspective Milton conceived Satan from the start as a troubled creature with an intense inner life If Satan is presented in anguish as a warning to sinners not to be like him if he retains an inner life and personal responsibility as the poem insists he does then Satan must still be like humans capable of ontological change and growth Robertson br br br See also br Paradise Lost a epic poem by John Milton br Stanley Fish author who had similar opinions to Lewis on Paradise Lost br br
