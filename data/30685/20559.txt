In science fiction mecha Japanese Hepburn meka or mechs are giant robots or machines typically depicted as piloted and as humanoid walking vehicles The term was first used in Japanese after shortening the English loanword mechanism mekanizumu or mechanical mekanikaru but the meaning in Japanese is more inclusive and robot robotto or giant robot is the narrower term br Fictional mecha vary greatly in size and shape but are distinguished from vehicles by their humanoid or biomorphic appearance although they are bigger often much bigger than human beings Different subgenres exist with varying connotations of realism The concept of Super Robot and Real Robot are two such examples found in Japanese anime and manga br Real world piloted humanoid or non humanoid robotic platforms existing or planned may also be called mecha In Japanese mecha may refer to mobile machinery or vehicles including aircraft in general piloted or otherwise br br br Characteristics br Mecha is an abbreviation first used in Japanese of mechanical In Japanese mecha encompasses all mechanical objects including cars guns computers and other devices and robot or giant robot is used to distinguish limbed vehicles from other mechanical devices Outside of this usage it has become associated with large humanoid machines with limbs or other biological characteristics Mecha differ from robots in that they are piloted from a cockpit typically located in the chest or head of the mech br While the distinction is often hazy mecha typically does not refer to form fitting powered armor such as Iron Man s suit They are usually much larger than the wearer like Iron Man s enemy the Iron Monger or the mobile suits depicted in the Gundam franchise br In most cases mecha are depicted as fighting machines whose appeal comes from the combination of potent weaponry with a more stylish combat technique than a mere vehicle Often they are the primary means of combat with conflicts sometimes being decided through gladiatorial matches Other works represent mecha as one component of an integrated military force supported by and fighting alongside tanks fighter aircraft and infantry functioning as a mechanical cavalry The applications often highlight the theoretical usefulness of such a device combining a tank s resilience and firepower with infantry s ability to cross unstable terrain and a high degree of customization In some continuities special scenarios are constructed to make mecha more viable than current day status For example in Gundam the fictional Minovsky particle inhibits the use of radar making long range ballistic strikes impractical thus favouring relatively close range warfare of Mobile Suits br However some stories such as the manga anime franchise Patlabor and the American wargame BattleTech universe also encompass mecha used for civilian purposes such as heavy construction work police functions or firefighting Mecha also have roles as transporters recreation advanced hazmat suits and other research and development applications br Mecha have been used in fantasy settings for example in the anime series Aura Battler Dunbine The Vision of Escaflowne Panzer World Galient and Maze In those cases the mecha designs are usually based on some alternative or lost science fiction technology from ancient times In case of anime series Zoids the machines resemble dinosaurs and animals and have been shown to evolve from native metallic organisms br A chicken walker is a fictional type of bipedal robot or mecha distinguished by its rear facing knee joint This type of articulation resembles a bird s legs hence the name However birds actually have forward facing knees they are digitigrade and what most call the knee is actually the ankle br br br Early history br The Edward S Ellis novel The Steam Man of the Prairies featured a steam powered back piloted mechanical man br The Jules Verne novel The Steam House La Maison Vapeur featured a steam powered piloted mechanical elephant One of the first appearances of such machines in modern literature was the tripod or fighting machine as they are known in the novel of H G Wells famous The War of the Worlds The novel does not contain a fully detailed description of the tripods mode of locomotion but it is hinted at Can you imagine a milking stool tilted and bowled violently along the ground That was the impression those instant flashes gave But instead of a milking stool imagine it a great body of machinery on a tripod stand br gon Bat a kamishibai that debuted in later adapted into an anime in featured the first piloted humanoid giant robot Dai Ningen Tanku but as an enemy rather than a protagonist In Gajo Sakamoto launched Tank Tankuro on a metal creature that becomes a battle machine br The first humanoid giant robot piloted by the protagonist appeared in the manga Atomic Power Android Genshi Ryoku Jinz Ningen in The manga and anime Tetsujin Go introduced in featured a robot Tetsujin that was controlled externally by an operator by remote control The manga and anime Astro Boy introduced in with its humanoid robot protagonist was a key influence on the development of the giant robot genre in Japan The first anime featuring a giant mecha being piloted by the protagonist from within a cockpit was the Super Robot show Mazinger Z written by Go Nagai and introduced in Mazinger Z introduced the notion of mecha as pilotable war machines rather than remote controlled robots Ken Ishikawa and Go Nagai later introduced the concept of combination gattai where several units slot together to form a super robot with Getter Robo debut br An early use of mech like machines outside Japan is found in The Invisible Empire a Federal Men s story arc by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster serialized in New Comics Other examples include the Mexican comic Invictus by Leonel Guillermo Prieto and Victaleno Le n the Brazilian comic Audaz o demolidor by lvaro Aruom Moura and Messias de Mello inspired by Invictus created for the supplement A Gazetinha from the newspaper A Gazeta Kimball Kinnison s battle suit in E E Doc Smith s Lensman novel Galactic Patrol the French animated film The King and the Mockingbird first released and Robert Heinlein s waldo in his short story Waldo and the Mobile Infantry battle suits in Heinlein s Starship Troopers br A transforming mech can transform between a standard vehicle such as a fighter plane or transport truck and a fighting mecha robot This concept of transforming mecha was pioneered by Japanese mecha designer Sh ji Kawamori in the early s when he created the Diaclone toy line in and then the Macross anime franchise in In North America the Macross franchise was adapted into the Robotech franchise in and then the Diaclone toy line was adapted into the Transformers franchise in Some of Kawamori s most iconic transforming mecha designs include the VF Valkyrie from the Macross and Robotech franchises and Optimus Prime called Convoy in Japan from the Transformers and Diaclone franchises br br br In various media br br br Anime and manga br br In Japan robot anime known as mecha anime outside Japan is one of the oldest genres in anime Robot anime is often tied in with toy manufacturers Large franchises such as Gundam Macross Transformers and Zoids have hundreds of different model kits br The size of mecha can vary according to the story and concepts involved Some of them may not be considerably taller than a tank Armored Trooper Votoms Yatterman Megazone Code Geass some may be a few stories tall Gundam Escaflowne Bismark Gurren Lagann others can be titan sized as tall as a skyscraper Space Runaway Ideon Genesis of Aquarion Science Ninja Team Gatchaman Neon Genesis Evangelion some are big enough to contain an entire city Macross some the size of a planet Diebuster galaxies Getter Robo Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann or even as large as universes Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann Lagann hen Demonbane Transformers Alternity br The first titan robots seen were in the manga Atomic Power Android Genshiryoku Jinz Ningen and Mitsuteru Yokoyama s manga Tetsujin go However it was not until the advent of Go Nagai s Mazinger Z that the genre was established Mazinger Z innovated by adding the inclusion of futuristic weapons and the concept of being able to pilot from a cockpit rather than via remote control in the case of Tetsujin According to Go Nagai br br I wanted to create something different and I thought it would be interesting to have a robot that you could drive like a car br Mazinger Z featured giant robots that were piloted by means of a small flying car and command center that docked inside the head It was also a pioneer in die cast metal toys such as the Chogokin series in Japan and the Shogun Warriors in the U S that were and still are very popular with children and collectors br Robot mecha anime and manga differ vastly in storytelling and animation quality from title to title and content ranges from children s shows to ones intended for an older teen or adult audience br Some of the first mecha featured in manga and anime were super robots The super robot genre features superhero like giant robots that are often one of a kind and the product of an ancient civilization aliens or a mad genius These robots are usually piloted by Japanese teenagers via voice command or neural uplink and are often powered by mystical or exotic energy sources br The later real robot genre features robots that do not have mythical superpowers but rather use largely conventional albeit futuristic weapons and power sources and are often mass produced on a large scale for use in wars The real robot genre also tends to feature more complex characters with moral conflicts and personal problems The genre is therefore aimed primarily at young adults instead of children Mobile Suit Gundam is largely considered the first series to introduce the real robot concept and along with The Super Dimension Fortress Macross would form the basis of what people would later call real robot anime br Some robot mecha are capable of transformation Macross and Zeta Gundam or combining to form even bigger ones Beast King GoLion and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann the latter called combination Go Nagai and Ken Ishikawa are often credited with inventing this in with Getter Robo br Not all mecha need to be completely mechanical Some have biological components with which to interface with their pilots and some are partially biological themselves such as in Neon Genesis Evangelion Eureka Seven and Zoids br Mecha based on anime have seen extreme cultural reception across the world The personification of this popularity can be seen as sized Mazinger Z Tetsujin and Gundam statues built across the world br br br Film br br In the Godzilla franchise the monster Mechagodzilla created by Toho is an Alien Monster that first appeared in the film Godzilla vs
