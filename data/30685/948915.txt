of his life was deaf which acted as a handicap For some time he wanted to obtain a professorship He made three unsuccessful attempts before he was appointed at Owens College Manchester in Among his colleagues there was the educational theorist Catherine Isabella Dodd whom he admired Another educationalist he found impressive was Esther Lawrence a cousin br Robert Mackintosh owed his appointment

articles on philosophical subjects to Mind the Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society and the International Journal of Ethics In he won the Green moral philosophy prize with an essay on the subject In what direction does Moral Philosophy seem to you to admit or require advance It was the basis of his volume Moral Order and Progress which was published in and went into its third edition in Alexander credited A C Bradley with introducing him to ethics and his brother F H Bradley helped him with the book He was influenced by T H Green in whose memory the prize had been set up but diverged from his views in pursuing evolutionary ethics br Alexander was appointed Gifford lecturer at Glasgow in and delivered his lectures in the winters of and They drew on preliminary papers he had written from onwards These materials he developed into his major work Space Time and Deity published in two volumes in John Laird called it the boldest adventure in detailed speculative metaphysics attempted in so grand a manner by any English writer between and His Arthur Davis Memorial Lecture on Spinoza and Time in the nature of an annexe to Space Time and Deity was published in br In Alexander published Beauty and Other Forms of Value mainly an essay in aesthetics It incorporated passages from papers that had appeared in the previous ten years Compared to his systematic work it was rather closer to the mainstream of British thought and was praised highly by R G Collingwood br br br Philosophical ideas br Two key concepts for Alexander are those of an emergent quality and the idea of emergent evolution br br As existents within Space Time minds enter into various relations of a perfectly general character with other things and with one another These account for the familiar features of mental life knowing freedom values and the like In the hierarchy of qualities the next higher quality to the highest attained is deity God is the whole universe engaged in process towards the emergence of this new quality and religion is the sentiment in us that we are drawn towards him and caught in the movement of the world to a higher level of existence br His idea was to start with space and time each of which he regarded as inconceivable without the other in fact mutually equivalent His thinking as he said originated in Instinct and Experience by C Lloyd Morgan who went on in to give an exposition of emergent properties Pure spacetime emerges through a process Alexander describes simply as motion the stuff and matter that make up our material world br br Space Time the universe in its primordial form is the stuff out of which all existents are made It is Space Time with the characters which we have found it to reveal to experience But it has no quality save that of being spatio temporal or motion br Motion is not a succession of point instants but rather a point instant is the limiting case of a motion br Point instants are real but their separateness from one another is conceptual They are in fact the elements of motion and in their reality are inseparable from the universe of motion they are elements in a continuum br Time makes Space distinct and Space makes Time distinct Space or Time may be regarded as supplying the element of diversity to the element of identity supplied by the other br Alexander absolutizes spacetime and even speaks of it as a Entity stuff of which things are made At the same time he also says that spacetime can be called Motions not motion in the singular but complexes of motions with kaleidoscopic changes within a continuum In other words for Alexander motion is primitive and space and time are defined through relations between motions br In Space Time and Deity Alexander held that an object may be before a consciousness but is not in it consciousness of an object is not the same as consciousness of one s consciousness of the object For example an object such as a chair may be apprehended by a consciousness but the chair is not located within that consciousness and the contemplation of the chair is distinct from thinking about the act of contemplating the chair Further since the contemplation of an object is itself an action in Alexander s view it cannot be contemplated but only subjectively experienced or enjoyed br Alexander asked the question br br How far a science of order could be founded on this bare conception of ordered parts of Space Time I do not know But at any rate the more comprehensive theorems of speculative mathematics at the present time do not thus proceed They appear to use the conception of Space and Time not as being stuffs as we have taken them to be within which there are relations of the parts of Space and Time themselves but as relational in the sense that they are relations between things or entities This is the antithesis between absolute and relational br Alexander s views have been described as panentheistic br br br Family br A change in Alexander s home life occurred in when the whole of his family his mother an aunt two elder brothers and his sister came from Australia to live with him His sister became his hostess and on Wednesday evenings there were informal social gatherings br Alexander was an unofficial godfather to writer Naomi Mitchison n e Haldane born in He took an interest in her studies and wrote her long
