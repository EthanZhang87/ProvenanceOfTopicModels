The Screwtape Letters is a Christian apologetic novel by C S Lewis and dedicated to J R R Tolkien It is written in a satirical epistolary style and while it is fictional in format the plot and characters are used to address Christian theological issues primarily those to do with temptation and resistance to it br First published in February the story takes the form of a series of letters from a senior demon Screwtape to his nephew Wormwood a junior tempter The uncle s mentorship pertains to the nephew s responsibility in securing the damnation of a British man known only as the Patient br Until the novel had English and German editions with around half a million sold copies br br br Summary br In The Screwtape Letters Lewis imagines a series of lessons in the importance of taking a deliberate role in Christian faith by portraying a typical human life with all its temptations and failings seen from devils viewpoints Screwtape holds an administrative post in the bureaucracy Lowerarchy of Hell and acts as a mentor to his nephew Wormwood an inexperienced and incompetent tempter br In the letters which compose the book Screwtape gives Wormwood detailed advice on various methods of undermining God s words and of promoting abandonment of God in the Patient whom Wormwood is tempting interspersed with observations on human nature and on the Bible In Screwtape s advice selfish gain and power are seen as the only good and neither demon can comprehend God s love for man or acknowledge human virtue br Versions of the letters were originally published weekly in the Anglican periodical The Guardian during wartime from May to November The book adds an introduction explaining how the author chose to write his story br Lewis wrote a sequel Screwtape Proposes a Toast in The satirical essay criticizes trends in British society education and public attitudes Although Britain calls its major private schools public schools Lewis is referring to state schools when he criticizes public education The essay was included with a new preface by Lewis in editions of The Screwtape Letters published by Bles in and by Macmillan in br The Screwtape Letters became one of Lewis most popular works although he said it was not fun to write and resolved never to write another Letter br Both The Screwtape Letters and Screwtape Proposes a Toast were released on audio cassette and CD with narrations by John Cleese Joss Ackland and Ralph Cosham Cleese s recording was a Grammy Awards Finalist for Best Spoken Word br br br Plot overview br The Screwtape Letters consists of letters written by a senior demon named Screwtape to his nephew Wormwood named after a star in the Book of Revelation a younger and less experienced demon charged with guiding a man called the Patient toward Our Father Below Satan and away from the Enemy God br After the first letter the Patient converts to Christianity and Wormwood is chastised for allowing this A striking contrast is formed between Wormwood and Screwtape during the rest of the book wherein Wormwood is depicted through Screwtape s letters as anxious to tempt his patient into extravagantly wicked and deplorable sins often recklessly while Screwtape takes a more subtle stance as in Letter XII wherein he remarks the safest road to hell is the gradual one the gentle slope soft underfoot without sudden turnings without milestones without signposts br In Letter VIII Screwtape explains to his prot g the different purposes that God and the devils have for the human race We want cattle who can finally become food He wants servants who can finally become sons With this end in mind Screwtape urges Wormwood in Letter VI to promote passivity and irresponsibility in the Patient God wants men to be concerned with what they do our business is to keep them thinking about what will happen to them br With his own views on theology Lewis goes on to describe and discuss sex love pride gluttony and war in successive letters Lewis an Oxford and Cambridge scholar himself suggests in his work that even intellectuals are not impervious to the influence of such demons especially during complacent acceptance of the Historical Point of View Letter XXVII br In Letter XXII after several attempts to find a licentious woman for the Patient to promote a useful marriage and after Screwtape s narrowly avoiding a painful punishment for having divulged to Wormwood God s genuine love for humanity about which Wormwood had promptly informed the Infernal authorities Screwtape notes that the Patient has fallen in love with a Christian girl and through her and her family had adopted a very Christian way of life Toward the end of this letter in his anger Screwtape becomes a large centipede mimicking a similar transformation in Book X of Paradise Lost wherein the demons are changed into snakes Later in the correspondence it is revealed that the young man may be placed in harm s way by his possible civil defence duties it is stated in an earlier letter that he is eligible for military service but it is never actually confirmed that he was indeed called While Wormwood is delighted with this and by the Second World War in general Screwtape admonishes Wormwood to keep the Patient safe in hopes that they can compromise his faith over a long lifetime br In the last letter the Patient has been killed during the Blitz and has gone to Heaven and for his ultimate failure Wormwood is doomed to suffer the consumption of his spiritual essence by the other demons especially by Screwtape himself He responds to Wormwood s final letter by saying that he may expect as little assistance as Screwtape would expect from Wormwood were their situations reversed My love for you and your love for me are as alike as two peas The difference is that I am the stronger mimicking the situation where Wormwood himself reported his uncle to the Infernal Police for Infernal Heresy making a religiously positive remark that would offend Satan br Screwtape starts every letter with My dear Wormwood except the last letter which sarcastically says My dear my very dear Wormwood my poppet my pigsnie br br br Literary sequels br br br Screwtape Proposes a Toast br The short sequel Screwtape Proposes a Toast first published as an article in The Saturday Evening Post is an addendum to The Screwtape Letters the two works are often published together as one book The sequel takes the form of an after dinner speech given by Screwtape at the Tempters Training College for young demons In stage adaptations it is sometimes added as a prelude making the work a prequel Screwtape Proposes a Toast is Lewis criticism of leveling and featherbedding trends in public education more specifically as he reveals in the foreword to the American edition public education in America though in the text it is English education that is held up as the purportedly awful example br The Cold War opposition between the West and the Communist World is explicitly discussed as a backdrop to the educational issues Screwtape and other demons are portrayed as consciously using the subversion of education and intellectual thought in the West to bring about its overthrow by the communist enemy from without and within In this sense Screwtape Proposes a Toast is more strongly political than The Screwtape Letters wherein no strong stand is made on political issues of the day such as World War II br br br Other literary sequels br Though C S Lewis had resolved not to write another letter and only revisited the character of Screwtape once in Screwtape Proposes a Toast the format referred to by Lewis himself as a kind of demonic ventriloquism has inspired other authors to prepare sequels or similar works such as br br
