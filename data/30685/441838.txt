in The New York Times With great skill Mrs Paterson takes Jess to the depths of this nightmare and then brings him back along with all he has learned in Terabithia a survivor and certainly equal to the demands According to The Horn Book Magazine Jess and his family are magnificently characterized the book abounds in descriptive vignettes humorous sidelights on the clash of cultures and realistic depictions of rural school life The symbolism of falling and of building bridges forms a theme throughout the story which is one of remarkable richness and depth beautifully written In a retrospective essay about the Newbery Medal winning books from to literary critic Zena Sutherland wrote of Bridge to Terabithia The poignant story is all the more effective because Paterson lets Jesse express his grief and guilt rather than telling readers that he feels them There is no glossing over nor is there a reaching for dramatic effect br br br Literary significance br The novel s content has been the
