worked together on Shrek and Shrek Because Adamson had to shoot the film in New Zealand for an extended period and Gregson Williams was working on scores for films such as Kingdom of Heaven he initially only prepared for the project by re reading the book and reading the film script It was not until he saw the first cut of the film that as he put it I could see the look of it the look of the characters I found that what I felt emotionally when compared to the book was quite different and it was then at that point that I could really get under the skin of the project He said that although re reading the book helped him enter that headspace the script also provided a lot of good information because it included several scenes that were not in the book br br br Writing and recording br br br Score br During the recording process Gregson Williams employed the piece Hollywood Studio Symphony Orchestra along with a member choir from Abbey Road Studios London England mostly members of the Bach Choir and numerous other solo musicians such as electric violinist Hugh Marsh and vocalist Lisbeth Scott at his Wavecrest Studio He composed the original score and then spent late September through early November conducting the Hollywood Orchestra and overseeing the recording of the English choir For color he employed instruments used in ancient folk music and to underscore critical dramatic moments he added choral textures and occasionally a solo voice The score includes instances of electronic music br Though frequent comparisons were made between it and Howard Shore s score for The Lord of the Rings film trilogy Gregson Williams said he was not influenced by Shore during the scoring of The Chronicles of Narnia He also said he composed over minutes of music for the original score although less than sixty minutes made the final cut There is a bootleg copy of the complete recordings circulating on the internet although no official version of this soundtrack has been released The complete recordings comprises all music composed by Williams for the movie br The score features many uses of themes or leitmotifs the most prominent of which are a motif for the Pevensie children a motif for Narnia itself and the Heroic motif The heroic motif however is not heard until track nine To Aslan s Camp br br br Songs br Gregson Williams co wrote a song with Imogen Heap Can t Take It In which Heap recorded for the soundtrack Originally Dido submitted a song for the soundtrack but it was considered unsatisfactory Heap was approached after a suggestion from the soundtrack s supervisor who managed a band with whom Heap had toured The song was written recorded produced and mixed in a week Heap said she needed like a year more than I got and considered the experience of handing in the song an hour after completing it p retty scary According to her the creation of the song was difficult because The Chronicles of Narnia is a family film so she had to be quite descriptive and not too electronic when making the song br The soundtrack includes the song Wunderkind which Alanis Morissette wrote and recorded in three days it was produced by Mike Elizondo According to her after watching a rough cut of the film the song seemed to flow from me and that it really touches me deeply Also included is Winter Light written and recorded by Tim Finn The album song Where sung by Lisbeth Scott does not appear in the film but its melody is based on the Pevensie children motif from the score br Evanescence lead singer Amy Lee claimed she had been approached to write music for the film both of which were rejected However the producers of the film stated that they had never approached Lee about penning music for the film and that it was news to them No
