Dante Alighieri Italian dante ali j ri c May September most likely baptized Durante di Alighiero degli Alighieri and widely known and often referred to in English mononymously as Dante English US was an Italian poet writer and philosopher His Divine Comedy originally called Comed a modern Italian Commedia and later christened Divina by Giovanni Boccaccio is widely considered one of the most important poems of the Middle Ages and the greatest literary work in the Italian language br Dante is known for establishing the use of the vernacular in literature at a time when most poetry was written in Latin which was accessible only to educated readers His De vulgari eloquentia On Eloquence in the Vernacular was one of the first scholarly defenses of the vernacular His use of the Florentine dialect for works such as The New Life and Divine Comedy helped establish the modern day standardized Italian language By writing his poem in the Italian vernacular rather than in Latin Dante influenced the course of literary development making Italian the literary language in western Europe for several centuries His work set a precedent that important Italian writers such as Petrarch and Boccaccio would later follow br Dante was instrumental in establishing the literature of Italy and is considered to be among the country s national poets and the Western world s greatest literary icons His depictions of Hell Purgatory and Heaven provided inspiration for the larger body of Western art and literature He influenced English writers such as Geoffrey Chaucer John Milton and Alfred Tennyson among many others In addition the first use of the interlocking three line rhyme scheme or the terza rima is attributed to him He is described as the father of the Italian language and in Italy he is often referred to as il Sommo Poeta the Supreme Poet Dante Petrarch and Boccaccio are also called the tre corone three crowns of Italian literature br br br Early life br br Dante was born in Florence Republic of Florence in what is now Italy The exact date of his birth is unknown although it is believed to be around May This can be deduced from autobiographic allusions in the Divine Comedy Its first section the Inferno begins Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita Midway upon the journey of our life implying that Dante was around years old since the average lifespan according to the Bible Psalm Vulgate is years and since his imaginary travel to the netherworld took place in he was most probably born around Some verses of the Paradiso section of the Divine Comedy also provide a possible clue that he was born under the sign of Gemini As I revolved with the eternal twins I saw revealed from hills to river outlets the threshing floor that makes us so ferocious XXII In the sun was in Gemini between approximately May and June Julian calendar br Dante claimed that his family descended from the ancient Romans Inferno XV but the earliest relative he could mention by name was his great great grandfather Cacciaguida degli Elisei Paradiso XV born no earlier than about Dante s father was Alighiero di Bellincione a businessman and moneylender and Dante s mother was Bella probably a member of the Abati family a noble Florentine family She died when Dante was not yet ten years old Alighiero soon married again to Lapa di Chiarissimo Cialuffi It is uncertain whether he really married her since widowers were socially limited in such matters but she definitely bore him two children Dante s half brother Francesco and half sister Tana Gaetana br During Dante s time most Northern Italian city states were split into two political factions the Guelphs who supported the papacy and the Ghibellines who supported the Holy Roman Empire Dante s family was loyal to the Guelphs The Ghibellines took over Florence at the Battle of Montaperti in forcing out many of the Guelphs Although Dante s family were Guelphs they suffered no reprisals after the battle probably because of Alighiero s low public standing The Guelphs later fought the Ghibellines again in at the Battle of Benevento retaking Florence from the Ghibellines br br Dante said he first met Beatrice Portinari daughter of Folco Portinari when he was nine she was eight and he claimed to have fallen in love with her at first sight apparently without even talking with her When he was however he was promised in marriage to Gemma di Manetto Donati daughter of Manetto Donati member of the powerful Donati family Contracting marriages for children at such an early age was quite common and involved a formal ceremony including contracts signed before a notary Dante claimed to have seen Beatrice again frequently after he turned exchanging greetings with her in the streets of Florence though he never knew her well br Years after his marriage to Gemma he claims to have met Beatrice again he wrote several sonnets to Beatrice but never mentioned Gemma in any of his poems He refers to other Donati relations notably Forese and Piccarda in his Divine Comedy The exact date of his marriage is not known the only certain information is that before his exile in he had fathered three children with Gemma Pietro Jacopo and Antonia br Dante fought with the Guelph cavalry at the Battle of Campaldino June This victory brought about a reformation of the Florentine constitution To take part in public life one had to enroll in one of the city s many commercial or artisan guilds so Dante entered the Physicians and Apothecaries Guild His name is occasionally recorded as speaking or voting in the councils of the republic Many minutes from such meetings between were lost so the extent of his participation is uncertain br br br Education and poetry br br Not much is known about Dante s education he presumably studied at home or in a chapter school attached to a church or monastery in Florence It is known that he studied Tuscan poetry and that he admired the compositions of the Bolognese poet Guido Guinizelli in Purgatorio XXVI he characterized him as his father at a time when the Sicilian School Scuola poetica Siciliana a cultural group from Sicily was becoming known in Tuscany He also discovered the Proven al poetry of the troubadours such as Arnaut Daniel and the Latin writers of classical antiquity including Cicero Ovid and especially Virgil br Dante s interactions with Beatrice set an example of so called courtly love a phenomenon developed in French and Proven al poetry of prior centuries Dante s experience of such love was typical but his expression of it was unique It was in the name of this love that Dante left his imprint on the dolce stil nuovo sweet new style a term that Dante himself coined and he would join other contemporary poets and writers in exploring never before emphasized aspects of love Amore Love for Beatrice as Petrarch would express for Laura somewhat differently would be his reason for writing poetry and for living together with political passions In many of his poems she is depicted as semi divine watching over him constantly and providing spiritual instruction sometimes harshly When Beatrice died in Dante sought refuge in Latin literature The Convivio chronicles his having read Boethius s De consolatione philosophiae and Cicero s De Amicitia br br He next dedicated himself to philosophical studies at religious schools like the Dominican one in Santa Maria Novella He took part in the disputes that the two principal mendicant orders Franciscan and Dominican publicly or indirectly held in Florence the former explaining the doctrines of the mystics and of St Bonaventure the latter expounding on the theories of St Thomas Aquinas br At around the age of Dante met Guido Cavalcanti Lapo Gianni Cino da Pistoia and soon after Brunetto Latini together they became the leaders of the dolce stil nuovo Brunetto later received special mention in the Divine Comedy Inferno XV for what he had taught Dante Nor speaking less on that account I go With Ser Brunetto and I ask who are his most known and most eminent companions Some fifty poetical commentaries by Dante are known the so called Rime rhymes others being included in the later Vita Nuova and Convivio Other studies are reported or deduced from Vita Nuova or the Comedy regarding painting and music br br br Florence and politics br br Dante like most Florentines of his day was embroiled in the Guelph Ghibelline conflict He fought in the Battle of Campaldino June with the Florentine Guelphs against Arezzo Ghibellines he fought as a feditore responsible for the first attack To further his political career he obtained admission to the Guild of Physicians and Apothecaries around He likely joined the guild due to association between philosophy and medicine but also may have joined as apothecaries were also booksellers His guild membership allowed him to hold public office in Florence As a politician he held various offices over some years in a city rife with political unrest br After defeating the Ghibellines the Guelphs divided into two factions the White Guelphs Guelfi Bianchi Dante s party led by Vieri dei Cerchi and the Black Guelphs Guelfi Neri led by Corso Donati Although the split was along family lines at first ideological differences arose based on opposing views of the papal role in Florentine affairs The Blacks supported the Pope and the Whites wanted more freedom from Rome The Whites took power first and expelled the Blacks In response Pope Boniface VIII planned a military occupation of Florence In Charles of Valois brother of King Philip IV of France was expected to visit Florence because the Pope had appointed him as peacemaker for Tuscany But the city s government had treated the Pope s ambassadors badly a few weeks before seeking independence from papal influence It was believed Charles had received other unofficial instructions so the council sent a delegation that included Dante to Rome to persuade the Pope not to send Charles to Florence br br br Exile from Florence br br Pope Boniface quickly dismissed the other delegates and asked Dante alone to remain in Rome At the same time November Charles of Valois entered Florence with the Black Guelphs who in the next six days destroyed much of the city and killed many of their enemies A new Black Guelph government was installed and Cante dei Gabrielli da Gubbio was appointed podest of the city In March Dante a White Guelph by affiliation along with the Gherardini family was condemned to exile for two years and ordered to pay a large fine Dante was accused of corruption and financial wrongdoing by the Black Guelphs for the time that Dante was serving as city prior Florence s highest position for two months in The poet was still in Rome in as the Pope who had backed the Black Guelphs had suggested that Dante stay there Florence under the Black Guelphs therefore considered Dante an absconder br Dante did not pay the fine in part because he believed he was not guilty and in part because all his assets in Florence had been seized by the Black Guelphs He was condemned to perpetual exile if he had returned to Florence without paying the fine he could have been burned at the stake In June nearly seven centuries after his death the city council of Florence passed a motion rescinding Dante s sentence In Dante was a guest of Moroello Malaspina in the region of Lunigiana br br Dante took part in several attempts by the White Guelphs to regain power but these failed due to treachery Bitter at the treatment he received from his enemies he grew disgusted with the infighting and ineffectiveness of his former allies and vowed to become a party of one He went to Verona as a guest of Bartolomeo I della Scala then moved to Sarzana in Liguria Later he is supposed to have lived in Lucca with a woman named Gentucca She apparently made his stay comfortable and he later gratefully mentioned her in Purgatorio XXIV Some speculative sources claim he visited Paris between and and other sources even less trustworthy say he went to Oxford these claims first made in Boccaccio s book on Dante several decades after his death seem inspired by readers who were impressed with the poet s wide learning and erudition Evidently Dante s command of philosophy and his literary interests deepened in exile and when he was no longer busy with the day to day business of Florentine domestic politics and this is evidenced in his prose writings in this period There is no real evidence that he ever left Italy Dante s Immensa Dei dilectione testante to Henry VII of Luxembourg confirms his residence beneath the springs of Arno near Tuscany in April br In Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII of Luxembourg marched into Italy at the head of troops Dante saw in him a new Charlemagne who would restore the office of the Holy Roman Emperor to its former glory and also retake Florence from the Black Guelphs He wrote to Henry and several Italian princes demanding that they destroy the Black Guelphs Mixing religion and private concerns in his writings he invoked the worst anger of God against his city and suggested several particular targets who were also his personal enemies It was during this time that he wrote De Monarchia proposing a universal monarchy under Henry VII br br At some point during his exile he conceived of the Comedy but the date is uncertain The work is much more assured and on a larger scale than anything he had written in Florence it is likely he would have undertaken such a work only after he realized his political ambitions which had been central to him up to his banishment had been halted for some time possibly forever It is also noticeable that Beatrice has returned to his imagination with renewed force and with a wider meaning than in the Vita Nuova in Convivio written c he had declared that the memory of this youthful romance belonged to the past br An early indication that the poem was underway is a notice by Francesco da Barberino tucked into his Documenti d Amore Lessons of Love probably written in or early Francesco notes that Dante followed the Aeneid in a poem called Comedy and that the setting of this poem or part of it was the underworld i e hell The brief note gives no incontestable indication that Barberino had seen or read even the Inferno or that this part had been published at the time but it indicates composition was well underway and that the sketching of the poem might have begun some years before It has been suggested that a knowledge of Dante s work also underlies some of the illuminations in Francesco da Barberino s earlier Officiolum c a manuscript that came to light in It is known that the Inferno had been published by this is established by quoted lines interspersed in the margins of contemporary dated records from Bologna but there is no certainty as to whether the three parts of the poem were each published in full or rather a few cantos at a time Paradiso was likely finished before he died but it may have been published posthumously br br In Henry assaulted Florence and defeated the Black Guelphs but there is no evidence that Dante was involved Some say he refused to participate in the attack on his city by a foreigner others suggest that he had become unpopular with the White Guelphs too and that any trace of his passage had carefully been removed Henry VII died from a fever in and with him any hope for Dante to see Florence again He returned to Verona where Cangrande I della Scala allowed him to live in certain security and presumably in a fair degree of prosperity Cangrande was admitted to Dante s Paradise Paradiso XVII br During the period of his exile Dante corresponded with Dominican theologian Fr Nicholas Brunacci OP who had been a student of Thomas Aquinas at the Santa Sabina studium in Rome later at Paris and of Albert the Great at the Cologne studium Brunacci became lector at the Santa Sabina studium forerunner of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas and later served in the papal curia br In Florence was forced by Uguccione della Faggiuola the military officer controlling the town to grant an amnesty to those in exile including Dante But for this Florence required public penance in addition to payment of a high fine Dante refused preferring to remain in exile When Uguccione defeated Florence Dante s death sentence was commuted to house arrest on condition that he go to Florence to swear he would never enter the town again He refused to go and his death sentence was confirmed and extended to his sons Despite this he still hoped late in life that he might be invited back to Florence on honorable terms particularly in praise of his poetry br br br Death and burial br br Dante s final days were spent in Ravenna where he had been invited to stay in the city in by its prince Guido II da Polenta Dante died in Ravenna on September aged about of quartan malaria contracted while returning from a diplomatic mission to the Republic of Venice He was attended by his three children and possibly by Gemma Donati and by friends and admirers he had in the city He was buried in Ravenna at the Church of San Pier Maggiore later called Basilica di San Francesco Bernardo Bembo praetor of Venice erected a tomb for him in br On the grave a verse of Bernardo Canaccio a friend of Dante is dedicated to Florence br br In Bertrand du Pouget Cardinal and nephew of Pope John XXII classified Dante s Monarchia as heretical and sought to have his bones burned at the stake Ostasio I da Polenta and Pino della Tosa allies of Pouget interceded to prevent the destruction of Dante s remains br br Florence eventually came to regret having exiled Dante The city made repeated requests for the return of his remains The custodians of the body in Ravenna refused at one point going so far as to conceal the bones in a false wall of the monastery Florence built a tomb for Dante in in the Basilica of Santa Croce That tomb has been empty ever since with Dante s body remaining in Ravenna The front of his tomb in Florence reads Onorate l altissimo poeta which roughly translates as Honor the most exalted poet and is a quote from the fourth canto of the Inferno br In the fascist government discussed bringing Dante s remains to the Valtellina Redoubt the Alpine valley in which the regime intended to make its last stand against the Allies The case was made that the greatest symbol of Italianness should be present at fascism s heroic end but ultimately no action was taken br A copy of Dante s so called death mask has been displayed since in the Palazzo Vecchio scholars today believe it is not a true death mask and was probably carved in perhaps by Pietro and Tullio Lombardo br br br Legacy br br The first formal biography of Dante was the Vita di Dante also known as Trattatello in laude di Dante written after by Giovanni Boccaccio Although several statements and episodes of it have been deemed unreliable on the basis of modern research an earlier account of Dante s life and works had been included in the Nuova Cronica of the Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani br Some th century English Protestants such as John Bale and John Foxe argued that Dante was a proto Protestant because of his opposition to the pope br The th century saw a Dante revival a product of the medieval revival which was itself an important aspect of Romanticism Thomas Carlyle profiled him in The Hero as Poet the third lecture in On Heroes Hero Worship the Heroic in History He is world great not because he is worldwide but because he is world deep Dante is the spokesman of the Middle Ages the Thought they lived by stands here in everlasting music Leigh Hunt Henry Francis Cary and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow were among Dante s translators of the era br br Italy s first dreadnought battleship was completed in and named Dante Alighieri in honor of him br On April in honor of the th anniversary of Dante s death Pope Benedict XV promulgated an encyclical named In praeclara summorum naming Dante as one of the many celebrated geniuses of whom the Catholic faith can boast and the pride and glory of humanity br br On December Pope Paul VI promulgated the Latin motu proprio titled Altissimi cantus which was dedicated to Dante s figure and poetry In that year the pope also donated a golden iron Greek Cross to Dante s burial site in Ravenna in occasion of the th anniversary of his birth The same cross was blessed by Pope Francis in October br In a reconstruction of Dante s face was undertaken in a collaborative project Artists from the University of Pisa and forensic engineers at the University of Bologna at Forl constructed the model portraying Dante s features as somewhat different from what was once thought br In the Municipality of Florence officially apologized for expelling Dante years earlier In May a symbolic re trial was held virtually in Florence to posthumously clear his name br A celebration was held in at Italy s Senate of the Republic for the th anniversary of Dante s birth It included a commemoration from Pope Francis who also issued the apostolic letter Cando lucis aeternae in honor of the anniversary br br br Works br br br Overview br br Most of Dante s literary work was composed after his exile in La Vita Nuova The New Life is the only major work that predates it it is a collection of lyric poems sonnets and songs with commentary in prose ostensibly intended to be circulated in manuscript form as was customary for such poems It also contains or constructs the story of his love for Beatrice Portinari who later served as the ultimate symbol of salvation in the Comedy a function already indicated in the final pages of the Vita Nuova The work contains many of Dante s love poems in Tuscan which was not unprecedented the vernacular had been regularly used for lyric works before during all the thirteenth century However Dante s commentary on his own work is also in the vernacular both in the Vita Nuova and in the Convivio instead of the Latin that was almost universally used br The Divine Comedy describes Dante s journey through Hell Inferno Purgatory Purgatorio and Paradise Paradiso he is first guided by the Roman poet Virgil and then by Beatrice Of the books Purgatorio is arguably the most lyrical of the three referring to more contemporary poets and artists than Inferno Paradiso is the most heavily theological and the one in which many scholars have argued the Divine Comedy s most beautiful and mystic passages appear br With its seriousness of purpose its literary stature and the range both stylistic and thematic of its content the Comedy soon became a cornerstone in the evolution of Italian as an established literary language Dante was more aware than most early Italian writers of the variety of Italian dialects and of the need to create a literature and a unified literary language beyond the limits of Latin writing at the time in that sense he is a forerunner of the Renaissance with its effort to create vernacular literature in competition with earlier classical writers Dante s in depth knowledge within the limits of his time of Roman antiquity and his evident admiration for some aspects of pagan Rome also point forward to the th century br br He wrote the Comedy in a language he called Italian in some sense an amalgamated literary language predominantly based on the regional dialect of Tuscany but with some elements of Latin and other regional dialects He deliberately aimed to reach a readership throughout Italy including laymen clergymen and other poets By creating a poem of epic structure and philosophic purpose he established that the Italian language was suitable for the highest sort of expression In French Italian is sometimes nicknamed la langue de Dante Publishing in the vernacular language marked Dante as one of the first in Roman Catholic Western Europe among others such as Geoffrey Chaucer and Giovanni Boccaccio to break free from standards of publishing in only Latin the language of liturgy history and scholarship in general but often also of lyric poetry This break set a precedent and allowed more literature to be published for a wider audience setting the stage for greater levels of literacy in the future However unlike Boccaccio Milton or Ariosto Dante did not really become an author read across Europe until the Romantic era To the Romantics Dante like Homer and Shakespeare was a prime example of the original genius who set his own rules created persons of overpowering stature and depth and went beyond any imitation of the patterns of earlier masters and who in turn could not truly be imitated Throughout the th century Dante s reputation grew and solidified and by the th anniversary of his birth he had become established as one of the greatest literary icons of the Western world br br New readers often wonder how such a serious work may be called a comedy In the classical sense the word comedy refers to works that reflect belief in an ordered universe in which events tend toward not only a happy or amusing ending but one influenced by a Providential will that orders all things to an ultimate good By this meaning of the word as Dante himself allegedly wrote in a letter to Cangrande I della Scala the progression of the pilgrimage from Hell to Paradise is the paradigmatic expression of comedy since the work begins with the pilgrim s moral confusion and ends with the vision of God br A number of other works are credited to Dante Convivio The Banquet is a collection of his longest poems with an unfinished allegorical commentary Monarchia Monarchy is a summary treatise of political philosophy in Latin which was condemned and burned after Dante s death by the Papal Legate Bertrando del Poggetto it argues for the necessity of a universal or global monarchy to establish universal peace in this life and this monarchy s relationship to the Roman Catholic Church as guide to eternal peace De vulgari eloquentia On the Eloquence in the Vernacular is a treatise on vernacular literature partly inspired by the Razos de trobar of Raimon Vidal de Bezaudun Quaestio de aqua et terra A Question of the Water and of the Land is a theological work discussing the arrangement of Earth s dry land and ocean The Eclogues are two poems addressed to the poet Giovanni del Virgilio Dante is also sometimes credited with writing Il Fiore The Flower a series of sonnets summarizing Le Roman de la Rose and Detto d Amore Tale of Love a short narrative poem also based on Le Roman de la Rose These would be the earliest and most novice of his known works Le Rime is a
