of the first new characters to be introduced is Lord Drinian the captain of the Dawn Treader He is described as a dark haired young man who loyally serves Caspian on his voyage to the end of the world Although the seafaring trade in Narnia was severely limited by King Miraz s fear of the sea Caspian through his influence as the king resurrects Narnia s interest in navigation and sailing As a result Drinian is one of a few Narnians with a vast knowledge of seafaring Armed with these skills and his friendly sense of humor Drinian greatly aids Caspian and his crew in their search for the seven lost lords br Though Drinian is one of the most experienced sailors from Narnia even he is occasionally surprised throughout the course of their journey For example when they reach the island that they later rename Dragon Island they encounter a creature that most of the crew has never seen before a dragon Skeptical Drinian asserts that dragons like crocodiles cannot be trusted and refuses to let his guard down In fact it is only upon discovering the dragon s identity Eustace that Drinian is able to trust it br This cautiousness proves useful on another occasion Later in their journey Drinian spots something that turns out to be a sea serpent Surviving the sea serpent s attack Drinian and the ship head for a welcome respite in an approaching harbor When Caspian suggests that they anchor in a different section of the harbor Drinian obeys patiently but with a little reluctance at having his own choice for their resting place denied br As they near the edge of the world Lucy spots a fantastic view of merpeople who are unlike those she had seen in Narnia Drinian realizes the possible danger they pose to his crew as any of the men might fall in love with a mermaid or even in love with the world under the water itself and fall overboard as a result he orders Lucy to ignore the merpeople and act as if she had not seen them When Reepicheep falls overboard Drinian berates him out of worry because he fears for both Reepicheep s safety as well as the possibility that the crew may discover the merpeople br After Reepicheep Lucy Eustace and Edmund continue on their journey to the very edge of the world Drinian successfully returns Caspian and the crew safely home to Narnia br br br The Silver Chair br In The Silver Chair Lord Drinian has remained a good friend and trusted advisor of King Caspian X Though Caspian is depicted as being significantly older in this work than in the previous one Drinian is not described in the same manner and appears to be very active for his age Caspian is now and in a state of health which suggests he is nearing the end of his life yet Drinian is still riding a horse despite clearly being at least in his seventies Drinian also became a close friend of Caspian s son Rilian br After Caspian s wife is fatally bitten by a serpent Rilian keeps returning to the woods where his mother was killed clearly intent on tracking down and killing the serpent which killed his mother but he never manages to find any trace of it Drinian then approaches Rilian however and urges him not to continue trying to track down the serpent only for Rilian to explain that he is not revisiting the scene of his mother s death for this reason When Rilian leads Drinian to the very place where his mother died Drinian discovers why Rilian is returning there They spot a beautiful woman who is clearly the reason for Rilian s decision to keep returning to this location Although Drinian questions the attraction that Rilian has for this woman he also refuses to question Rilian s motives any further and does not object to Rilian returning there in the future Rilian then returns to the location but he never returns Drinian helps in the search for Rilian but nobody ever finds a trace of him leaving Caspian to fear that he will never see his son again When Drinian presents his knowledge of the events leading to Rilian s disappearance to Caspian he begs Caspian to condemn him as a traitor for he has allowed the son of his good friend to disappear Though Drinian implores Caspian for death as punishment for his treachery Caspian is unable to kill him not wanting to lose his friend as he has already lost his queen and his son and the two mourn the loss of Rilian as friends For the next years Rilian s disappearance remains an unsolved mystery with nobody in Narnia knowing where he went to or whether he is still alive br The serpent which killed the Queen was in fact the Lady of the Green Kirtle who ruled the underworld beneath Narnia and was intent on breaking through to invade it She later lured Rilian into the underworld A decade later Eustace Scrubb and Jill Pole entered Narnia and along with their guide Puddleglum the marshwiggle they found their way into the underworld to save Rilian who then killed the Lady of the Green Kirtle and returned to Narnia br During the primary narrative of The Silver Chair which takes place a decade after Rilian s disappearance Drinian accompanies Caspian as he voyages through the seas explored in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader Caspian had told his people that he wanted to make this voyage to see again the place of his youth but many believed that he had gone to seek Aslan to ask who could be the next King of Narnia after his death as he no longer expected to see Rilian again But the voyage is disrupted by Aslan before they reach the end of the world who explains to Caspian that he must return home to Narnia br When Caspian is reunited with his lost son Rilian an elderly Drinian is there to rejoice in the efforts of Eustace and Jill He is also at Caspian s side when the king dies soon after and witnesses the declaration of Rilian as King of Narnia br br br Film adaption br In the BBC miniseries presentation of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader Drinian is played by a year old John Hallam whereas in the BBC miniseries presentation of The Silver Chair as an elderly man in a scene from some years later he is played by Roy Boyd who was at the time but was perhaps portraying a much older man who was relatively active and young looking for his age for instance Drinian was still riding a horse In the Walden Fox film The Voyage of the Dawn Treader he is played by Gary Sweet br br br Conception br When he was at school in his younger days C S Lewis studied classic Greek works including the Odyssey One of the iconic scenes from the Odyssey is repeated in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader in which Drinian fears his crew s sanity and safety when Lucy discovers merpeople although Drinian does not resort to using wax on his crew to block out their noise like Odysseus Indeed Dawn Treader follows in the same sea saga as the Odyssey with the crew encountering mythical creatures and mysterious islands Although Drinian is highly proficient in nautical expertise he is not depicted as being noble or as having an inextinguishable desire for glory and as a result does not exhibit any other trait similarities with Odysseus Similar to the mythology and archaic material within the Greek works Lewis also enjoyed Arthurian myths Lastly Lewis suggested that he was greatly influenced by dreams when creating the characters and situations within his works In conclusion Drinian is a compilation of Odysseus from the Odyssey and the heroes of the Arthurian myths br br br Notes
