Emeth Hebrew truth firmness or veracity is a Calormene character from C S Lewis s book The Last Battle from The Chronicles of Narnia series He is a controversial character among some Christians who take the Chronicles to be allegories as opposed to what Lewis intended and thus have expressed disagreement with Lewis apparent soteriology Specifically the salvation of Emeth is understood to be an implicit endorsement of the doctrinal idea of Inclusivism br br br Story br Emeth is a young Calormene officer second in command of a detachment of the Tisroc s soldiers under Rishda Tarkaan who enter Narnia in the guise of merchants This is part of a conspiracy to seize the north of the country by using the Narnians faith in a false Aslan controlled by the ape Shift While welcoming the chance to distinguish himself in battle Emeth is troubled by the lies and trickery used to portray Aslan as the Narnian version of the Calormene deity Tash When Shift and Rishda set up the notion that Tashlan is in a stable Emeth insists on seeing Tash with his own eyes Once inside Emeth kills a Calormene soldier waiting to dispatch anyone sent into the stable and throws his body outside the door br The salvation of Emeth then follows When Emeth finds himself in Aslan s Country he encounters Aslan himself and realizes that his life spent in service to Tash will result in his condemnation Aslan however explains that Aslan and Tash are opposites any virtuous act done in Tash s name is actually accepted by Aslan since Tash can only accept acts of evil Thus Emeth s devotion to Tash founded on noble motives was actually received by Aslan Ch br br br Implications in Christian theology br br Aslan s words to Emeth in which he ratifies the good deeds the latter did even under the name of Tash are the subject of some controversy br br I take to me the services which thou hast done to Tash the false god if any man swear by him and keep his oath for the oath s sake it is by me that he has truly sworn though he know it not and it is I who reward him Ch br Aslan s comment can be understood as a development of Paul s thought in Corinthians No one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says Jesus be cursed and no one can say Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit br The implication for Christian belief is that people who reflect a righteous heart are justified regardless of unbelief or misbelief This relates to a longstanding question in Christian soteriology if only explicit faith in Christ saves a person then the large numbers of people born and raised in other faiths perhaps even without knowledge of Christianity seem to have no hope of salvation The reverse position that they are saved regardless represents a type of Inclusivism br Lewis himself contributed to the commentary on this question for example in a letter from br br I think that every prayer which is sincerely made even to a false god or to a very imperfectly conceived true God is accepted by the true God and that Christ saves many who do not think they know him For He is dimly present in the good side of the inferior teachers they follow In the parable of the Sheep and Goats those who are saved do not seem to know that they have served Christ br Lewis argues that this view can be derived from the parable of the sheep and goats in Matthew from Paul s speech to the Athenians in Acts What you now worship as something unknown I am going to proclaim to you and from Timothy God the Savior of all men especially of those who believe all references NIV br Lewis encountered at least one contradiction to this idea in Romans How then can they call on the one they have not believed in And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard And how can they hear without someone preaching to them TNIV This is consistent with Paul s doctrine that though God is already with the pagans they still need to see him revealed Lewis however replied with Corinthians One of you says I follow Paul another I follow Apollos another I follow Cephas still another I follow Christ Is Christ divided TNIV which he interpreted as indicating the sameness of God regardless of his context br In Psalm JPS The LORD is promised to be near to all who call Him to all who call Him with sincerity The word translated as sincerity is in fact Emeth in the original br br br The Golem br The Hebrew word Emeth also figures in Jewish mythology In one version of the golem legend the Kabbalist Elijah Ba al Shem of Chelm crafts in clay a man s form which he brings to life by writing word on its forehead When he sees that the golem grows and grows he realizes that he has a potentially troublesome situation He knows that if he can erase from the golem s forehead the first letter of Emeth the Hebrew letter aleph the remaining letters would spell meth meaning death The rabbi brings the golem s forehead within reach of his hand by commanding the golem to remove his boots He wipes the letter off of the golem s forehead but this causes the golem s clay to collapse upon the rabbi br br br
