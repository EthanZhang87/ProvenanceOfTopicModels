episodes of a BBC television series in and as a feature film in br br br Plot summary br The two youngest Pevensie children Lucy and Edmund are staying with their odious cousin Eustace Scrubb while their older brother Peter is studying for an exam with Professor Kirke and their older sister Susan is travelling through America with their parents Edmund Lucy and Eustace are drawn into the Narnian world through a picture of a ship at sea The painting hanging neglected in the guest bedroom in which Lucy was staying had been an unwanted present to Eustace s parents The three children land in the ocean near the pictured vessel the titular Dawn Treader and are taken aboard br The Dawn Treader is the ship of Caspian X King of Narnia whom Edmund and Lucy along with Peter and Susan helped to regain the throne of Narnia in Prince Caspian Also present on board are the Lord Drinian the captain of the Dawn Treader and first mate Rhince br Peace has been established in the three years since then and Caspian has undertaken a quest in fulfilment of his coronation oath to sail east for a year and a day to find the seven lost Lords of Narnia Argoz Bern Mavramorn Octesian Restimar Revilian and Rhoop He mentions that Trumpkin the dwarf has been left in charge of Narnia as Lord Regent in his absence Lucy and Edmund are delighted to be back in the Narnian world but Eustace is less enthusiastic as he has never been there before and had taunted his cousins with his belief that this alternate universe had never existed The Talking Mouse Reepicheep is also on board as he hopes to find Aslan s Country beyond the seas of the utter East When Eustace teases Reepicheep much is revealed about the mouse s pugnacious character br They first make landfall in the Lone Islands nominally Narnian territory but fallen away from Narnian ways in particular the slave trade flourishes here despite Narnian law stating that it is forbidden Caspian Lucy Edmund Eustace and Reepicheep are captured as merchandise by a slave trader and a man buys Caspian before they even reach the slave market He turns out to be the first lost lord Bern who had moved to the islands and married a woman there after being banished from Narnia by Miraz When Caspian reveals his identity Lord Bern acknowledges him as King Caspian reclaims the islands for Narnia and replaces Gumpas the greedy governor with Lord Bern whom he names Duke of the Lone Islands Caspian also declares that slavery is forbidden in all his dominions and that all slaves are free br At the second island they visit Eustace leaves the group to avoid participating in the work needed to render the ship seaworthy after a storm has damaged it and hides in a dead dragon s cave to escape a sudden downpour The dragon s treasure arouses his greed he fills his pockets with gold and jewels and puts on a large golden bracelet but as he sleeps he is transformed into a dragon In his new guise he becomes aware of how bad his previous behaviour was he attempts to shed his dragon skin without success It is only with the help of Aslan that he is able to become human again though the process is very painful Caspian recognises the bracelet it belonged to Lord Octesian another of the lost lords They speculate that the dragon killed Octesian or even that the dragon was Octesian Aslan turns Eustace back into a boy and as a result of his experiences he is now a much nicer person br The crew narrowly escape being sunk by a sea serpent and stop at Deathwater Island so named for a pool of water which turns everything immersed in it into gold including one of the missing lords who turns out to have been Lord Restimar Then they land on the Duffers Island where Lucy removes an invisibility spell from the Duffers later Dufflepuds at their request and befriends the Magician who cast it Next they reach the Island Where Dreams Come True called the Dark Island since it is permanently hidden in darkness It turns out that the dreams that come true there are not necessarily nice dreams and Lord Rhoop whom they rescue there has been tormented for years by his nightmares Eventually they reach the Island of the Star where they find the three remaining lost lords in enchanted sleep Ramandu the fallen star who lives on the island with his daughter tells them that the only way to awaken them is to sail to the edge of the world and to leave one member of the crew behind there Lord Rhoop wishes to sleep without dreams beside his friends until they wake and everyone agrees before they set out again br The Dawn Treader continues sailing into an area where merpeople dwell and the water turns sweet rather than salty as Reepicheep discovers when he belligerently jumps in to fight a mer man whom he thinks challenged him At last the water becomes so shallow that the ship can go no farther Caspian orders a boat lowered and announces that he will go to the world s end with Reepicheep The crew object saying that as King of Narnia he has no right to abandon them Caspian goes to his cabin in a temper but returns to say that Aslan appeared in his cabin and told him that only Lucy Edmund Eustace and Reepicheep will go on br These four venture in a small boat through a sea of lilies until they reach a wall of water that extends into the sky Fulfilling Ramandu s condition Reepicheep paddles his coracle up the waterfall and is never again seen in Narnia Edmund Eustace and Lucy find a Lamb who transforms into Aslan and tells them that Edmund and Lucy will not return to Narnia When Lucy becomes sorrowful and despondent about the prospect of not seeing Aslan again Aslan tells the children that he exists in their world too Aslan adds There I have another name You must learn to know me by that name This was the very reason why you were brought to Narnia that by knowing me here for a little you may know me better there Aslan then sends the three children home br Back in the real world

wife of Caspian and mother of Rilian br Pug slaver and pirate of the Lone Islands who takes the protagonists prisoner br Gumpas governor of the Lone Islands enabler of slavery whom Caspian deposes br Coriakin the Magician and star who rules the Dufflepuds monopods as penance for unspecified misdeeds br br br Differences between British and American editions br Several weeks or months after reading the proofs for the British edition of The Chronicles Lewis read through the proofs for the American edition While doing so he made several changes to the text HarperCollins took over publication of the series in and made the unusual decision to ignore the changes that Lewis had made and use the earlier text as the standard for their editions br In Dawn Treader Lewis made two changes one minor and one more substantial The minor change appears in the first chapter where Lewis changes the description of Eustace from far too stupid to make anything up himself to quite incapable of making anything up himself Paul Ford author of Companion to Narnia suggests that Lewis might have felt the need to soften the passage for his American readers or perhaps he was starting to like Eustace better Peter Schakel author of Imagination and the arts in C S Lewis notes that the passage should have been changed in both cases as calling a character stupid in a children s book is insensitive and unwise Both Schakel and Ford agree that it is not an accurate depiction of Eustace as Lewis describes him and this too may be the reason for the change br The more substantive change appears in Chapter The Dark Island where Lewis rewrote the ending in a way that Schakel maintains improves the imaginative experience considerably br br The reader cannot in this version dismiss the island as unreal or as no longer existing it is still there and anyone who can get to Narnia still could get caught in it More important the inserted analogy with its second person pronouns draws readers into the episode and evokes in them the same emotions the characters experience This is no laughing matter as the earlier version risks making it br A side by side comparison of the ending of chapter follows br br br Reception br Boucher and McComas found Voyage not quite up to the high level set by previous Narnian adventures They singled out Reepicheep for praise as one of Lewis s finest imaginings br Researcher Sue Baines wrote In contrast to other Narnia books Dawn Treader has virtually no overt villains other than the slavers in the very beginning who are quickly overcome and disposed of Rather the plot confronts the protagonists again and again with the flaws of their own character Eustace s greediness and general bad behavior cause him to turn into a dragon and he must work hard to show himself worthy of becoming human again Caspian is tempted to seize the magic pool which turns everything to gold which would have turned Caspian himself into a greedy tyrant ready to kill in order to preserve his power and wealth later Caspian faces the nobler but still wrong headed temptation to go off to Aslan s Country and abandon his responsibilities as a King Lucy is tempted to make herself magically beautiful which would have led to her becoming the focus of terrible wars devastating Narnia and all its neighbors and having resisted this temptation she succumbs to a lesser temptation to magically spy on her schoolmates and is punished by hearing malicious things and destroying what could have developed into an enduring nice friendship Edmund who had undergone a very severe test of his character on his first arrival in Narnia is spared such an experience in the present book and acts as the most mature and grown up member of the group br br br Influences br Arguably Voyage of the Dawn Treader is the novel which shows the most influence of Lewis Irish background It is reminiscent of the Immram genre of Irish literature Lewis draws inspiration from the Medieval text The Voyage of Saint Brendan a clear example of the Immram Lewis characters follow the plot of St Brendan s voyage almost exactly showing the influence of the classic Celtic fable However unlike such voyages Dawn Treader travels East rather than West maybe because Lewis wanted to signify new beginnings and rebirth as opposed to the traditional connotation of death and closure associated with heading west br The novel also underscores the idea of Aslan representing Jesus Christ In the end of the novel Aslan appears as a lamb which has been used as a symbol for him in a scene evoking the Gospel of John br Eustace s transformation into a dragon in the presence of gold recalls the fate of F fnir in Norse myth Had Eustace been educated to know about myths and fairytales he would have known that dragons gold is cursed br In chapter Ulysses in Dante s Inferno Canto v is closely paraphrased by one of the three lords when they reach Ramandu s island br Mary Coombe noted that The Fifth book of Rabelais Gargantua and Pantagruel depicts a King with his loyal followers sailing in a ship stopping at various islands and having strange adventures To be sure in Lewis handling of the same theme the details of the King his retinue and the islands they visit are all very different from those of Rabelais Lewis considered Rabelais to be mainly a teller of coarse jokes It might have appealed to Lewis to take up a theme from Rabelais and treat it in a less coarse way In particular the quest undertaken by Pantagruel and his companions is entirely and manifestly farcical while that of Caspian is conducted very earnestly indeed br br br Adaptations br br br Theatre br In the world premiere of the musical stage adaptation of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader was
