world Isekai is one of the most popular genres of anime and isekai stories share many common tropes for example a powerful protagonist who is able to beat most people in the other world by fighting This plot device typically allows the audience to learn about the new world at the same pace as the protagonist over the course of their quest or lifetime If the main characters are transported to a game like world the genre can overlap with LitRPG br The concept of isekai started in Japanese folktales such as Urashima Tar However the first modern isekai works were Haruka Takachiho s novel Warrior from Another World and Yoshiyuki Tomino s television series Aura Battler Dunbine br br br Characteristics br The genre can be divided into two types transition into another world isekai ten i and reincarnation into another world isekai tensei In transition into another world stories the protagonist gets transported to another world e g by traveling into it or being magically summoned into it In reincarnation into another world stories the protagonist is sent into another world after dying in the real world A common method of death is being run over by a truck and dying spawning the meme of Truck kun a truck which appears in many isekai series that kills the protagonist and the protagonist reincarnates into a different world br In many examples the main character is an ordinary person who thrives in their new environment thanks to modern things in the real world being seen as extraordinary in the other world This can be physical characteristics such as hair or eye color or normal everyday skills they learned in their previous life such as cooking engineering basic education or medicine which are far more advanced in the modern real world than in the world they are sent to In Sorcerous Stabber Orphen an entire population of humans appear in the magically created world transported from Earth and are partially mixed with local dragonlike Heavenly Beings br While the protagonist of a classic isekai work is usually a chosen hero there have been a number of alternative takes on the concept One trend is the protagonist reincarnating into the body of an unimportant side character or even a villain as in My Next Life as a Villainess All Routes Lead to Doom The Most Heretical Last Boss Queen and Villainess Level Another is being transported to another world without dying such as in How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom Chillin in Another World with Level Super Cheat Powers I Got a Cheat Skill in Another World and Became Unrivaled in the Real World Too Battle Girls Time Paradox and Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear or while close to death as in Saving Gold in Another World for My Retirement In some works the protagonist is an adult reincarnated in a new world as a child with special powers such as in Chronicles of an Aristocrat Reborn in Another World Trapped in a Dating Sim The World of Otome Games Is Tough for Mobs As a Reincarnated Aristocrat I ll Use My Appraisal Skill to Rise in the World The World s Finest Assassin Gets Reincarnated in Another World as an Aristocrat and Fluffy Paradise or is reborn in a new world with special powers but no changes to their appearance such as in In Another World with My Smartphone and Farming Life in Another World There are even instances of protagonists becoming inhuman creatures with special abilities such as in That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime where the protagonist reincarnates as a slime monster I ve Been Killing Slimes for Years and Maxed Out My Level where the protagonist reincarnates as an immortal witch So I m a Spider So What where the protagonist reincarnates as a spider monster or even sentient objects such as a sword or a vending machine br Others known as reverse isekai follow beings from a fantasy universe who have been transported to or reincarnated into modern day Earth including the anime Re Creators br An offshoot of the isekai genre is the second chance or reincarnation genre in which the protagonist upon dying is transported not to a different world or new body but into their own younger self With their new knowledge and older intellect they are able to relive their life avoiding their previous pitfalls Another offshoot of the genre includes the slow life approach where the protagonist was overworked in their previous life so decides to take it easy in the next Another offshoot is where the protagonist uses the new world to explore an interest hobby or goal they had in the previous world but were unable to achieve such as studying or opening a business like in Restaurant to Another World br In many works isekai overlaps with the harem and LitRPG genres where the protagonist gains the affection of several potential love interests who may or may not be human One example of this is Harem in the Labyrinth of Another World br Writing for the Journal of Anime and Manga Studies Paul Price in his article A Survey of the Story Elements of Isekai Manga argues for the existence of four kinds of isekai based on Farah Mendlesohn s framework of organizing fantasy portal quest where the protagonist enters the isekai via some kind of portal Price cites Death March to the Parallel World Rhapsody as an example immersive where no such portal exists and all the action takes place in the other world Slayers intrusion which are akin to reverse isekai in which the fantastic enters the real world The Devil Is a Part Timer and liminal where the portal becomes a liminal space where the real world and the isekai mix Restaurant to Another World
