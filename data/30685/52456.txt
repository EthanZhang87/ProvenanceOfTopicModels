id: 52456
A dwarf pl dwarfs or dwarves is a type of supernatural being in Germanic folklore Accounts of dwarfs vary significantly throughout history however they are commonly but not exclusively presented as living in mountains or stones and being skilled craftspeople In early literary sources only males are explicitly referred to as dwarfs However they are described as having sisters and daughters while male and female dwarfs feature in later saga literature and folklore Dwarfs are sometimes described as short however scholars have noted that this is neither explicit nor relevant to their roles in the earliest sources br Dwarfs continue to feature in modern popular culture such as in the works of J R R Tolkien and Terry Pratchett where they are often but not exclusively presented as distinct from elves They are often depicted as miners smiths armorers tailors carpenters artisans and mechanics br br br Etymology br The modern English noun dwarf descends from Old English dweorg It has a variety of cognates in other Germanic languages including Old Norse dvergr and Old High German twerg According to Vladimir Orel the English noun and its cognates ultimately descend from Proto Germanic dwergaz A different etymology of dwarf traces it to Proto Germanic dwezgaz with the r sound being the product of Verner s Law Anatoly Liberman connects the Germanic word with Modern English dizzy suggesting a link between the etymology and their role in inflicting mental diseases on humans similar to some other supernatural beings in Germanic folklore such as elves br For forms earlier than the Proto Germanic reconstruction the etymology of the word dwarf is highly contested Scholars have proposed theories about the origins of the being by way of historical linguistics and comparative mythology including the idea that dwarfs may have originated as nature spirits as beings associated with death or as a mixture of concepts Competing etymologies include a basis in the Indo European root dheur meaning damage the Indo European root dhreugh whence for example modern English dream and German Trug deception and scholars have made comparisons with Sanskrit dhvaras a type of demonic being br Modern English has two plurals for the word dwarf dwarfs and dwarves Dwarfs remains the most commonly employed plural The minority plural dwarves was recorded as early as However it was later popularized by the fiction of philologist and legendarium author J R R Tolkien originating as a hypercorrective mistake It was employed by Tolkien for some time before Regarding his use of this plural Tolkien wrote in I am afraid it is just a piece of private bad grammar rather shocking in a philologist but I shall have to go with it br br br Attestations br br br Eddic sources br br br Terminology br Scholars have noted that the Svart lfar black elves appear to be the same beings as dwarfs given that both are described in the Prose Edda as the residents of Svart lfaheimr Another potential synonym is d kk lfar dark elves however it is unclear whether svart lfar and d kk lfar were considered the same at the time of the writing of the Prose Edda The partial overlap of dwarfs in Eddic sources with elves is supported by the names of dwarfs recorded in the Dvergatal section of V lusp which include lfr Elf Gand lfr Wand elf Vind lf Wind elf Dvergatal further lists Yngvi a name of the god Freyr who was given lfheimr the home of the elves to rule according to Gr mnism l br br br Notable Eddic dwarfs br br Andvari a shapechanging dwarf featuring in the V lsung cycle who is extorted out of his treasure by Loki br Fjalar and Galar two brothers who murder Kvasir and brew the mead of poetry from his blood br Brokkr and Sindri brothers who craft Draupnir Gullinbursti and Mj lnir for the gods br Sons of valdi brothers who craft Gungnir Sk bla nir and Sif s hair for the gods br Alv ss a dwarf who requested the hand in marriage of Thor s daughter r r Thor outwits him by keeping him talking until daybreak whereupon he turns to stone br Litr a dwarf kicked by Thor into Baldr s funeral pyre for an unclear reason br br br Germanic heroic legend and sagas br br br Continuity with older beliefs br After the Christianisation of the Germanic peoples dwarfs continued in the folklore of Germanic speaking areas of Europe and the literary works produced there Opinions on the degree of continuity in beliefs on dwarfs before and after Christianisation differ significantly Some scholars such as Rudolf Simek propose that the folk beliefs remained essentially intact in the transitional period making later sources exceedingly informative on pre Christian Germanic religion In contrast others such as Sch fke argue that there is no resemblance between Eddic and skaldic dwarfs and those in later sources br br br Old Norse br Dwarfs feature throughout both fornaldars gur and riddaras gur In V lsunga saga which details the events that unfold after Loki extorts treasure out of the dwarf Andvari to pay the wergild for his killing of tr a being whose brother Regin is also described in some sources as either resembling or being a dwarf In Hervarar saga ok Hei reks the sword Tyrfing is forged and subsequently cursed by a dwarf named Dvalinn and another named Dulin in the Hauksb k manuscript br br br Middle High German br In German literature many dwarfs can make themselves invisible typically via a Tarnkappe cloak of invisibility which has been suggested to be an ancient attribute of dwarfs Depending on the story they may be hostile or friendly to humans br The dwarf Alberich plays a vital role in the Nibelungenlied where he guards the Nibelung s treasure and has the strength of twelve men He is defeated by Siegfried and afterwards serves the hero In Ortnit Alberich seduces the Lombardy queen spawning the hero Ortnit The dwarf then aids Ortnit in his adventures after revealing to the hero that he is his father In Das Lied vom H rnen Seyfrid Siegfried is aided by the dwarf Eugel who is the son of the dwarf king Nibelung originator of the Nibelung s treasure br The hero Dietrich von Bern is portrayed in adventures involving dwarfs In Laurin he fights against the dwarf King Laurin at the dwarf s magical rose garden He later rescues a woman whom Laurin had kidnapped A similar plot occurs in the fragmentary poem Goldemar In Virginal Dietrich rescues the dwarf queen Virginal from a force of invading heathens The dwarfs Eggerich and Baldung play a role in aiding Dietrich in the poem Sigenot Baldung gives Dietrich a magical gem that prevents him from being bitten when thrown into a snake pit whereas Eggerich helps Dietrich and Hildebrand escape In the Heldenbuch Prosa a dwarf takes Dietrich out of this world after the death of all the other heroes a role given to Laurin in some different versions of Dietrich s end br br br Modern period br Dwarfs feature in the modern folklore of Germanic speaking regions of Europe such as the Simonside Dwarfs in Northumberland who are sometimes believed to use lights to lure people off paths akin to a will o the wisp br Some dwarfs in modern folklore have been argued to belong to a broader group of smith beings living within hollow mountains or in caves such as the Grinkenschmied These craftsmen can be referred to explicitly as dwarfs or terms that describe their roles such as Swedish bergsmed mountain smith Mounds in Denmark can also be referred to by names derived from their inhabitants such as smedsberg or smedshoie smith s hill or smith s mound Anglian folklore tells that one can hear a forge from within a mound and feel furnace fires under the earth while in Switzerland the heat can be attributed to the underground kitchens of dwarfs In one example the furnace s heat is believed to increase soil fertility br br br Attributes and themes br br br Diversity and vagueness br Rather than existing a true single nature of a dwarf they vary in their characteristics not only across regions and time but also between one another in the same cultural context Some are capable of changing their form entirely The scholar rmann Jakobsson notes that accounts of dwarfs in the Eddas and the section of Ynglinga saga regarding Sveig ir lack prominence in their narratives and cohesive identity Based on this he puts forward the idea that dwarfs in these sources are set apart from other beings by their difficulty to be defined and generalised ultimately stemming from their intrinsic nature to be hidden and as the Other that stands in contrast with humans br br br Appearance br br br Form and colour br br Based on the etymology of dwarf it has been proposed that the oldest conception of a dwarf was as exclusively a formless spirit potentially as in the case of disease causing dwarfs however this view is not seen in the oldest manuscript accounts In the quotation of V lusp in the Prose Edda the dwarfs emerge as beings with human form mannl kun while in the Codex Regius manuscript the first two dwarfs created either dwarfs or people with human forms The prose of the Ynglinga saga describes a dwarf sitting standing and speaking leading to the proposal that at the time of writing dwarfs were believed to at least sometimes have a human like form It nonetheless appears to have been recognised as a dwarf however that may have been due to its behaviour instead of its physical appearance In skaldic and Eddic sources it has been noted that their roles are what define them rather than their physical appearance which has no significant relevance br Many dwarf names in Eddic sources relate to light and brightness such as Dellingr the gleaming one and Gl inn glowing Stories do not explain these names but it has been theorised that they refer to the fires in the forges the dwarfs work or to haugaeldar grave mound fires that are found in later Icelandic folklore In contrast Snorri describes d kk lfar which are typically identified as dwarfs as blacker than pitch Alv ss is described by Thor in Alv ssm l as being as unsuitable for wedding his daughter r r as he was pale about the nostrils and resembled a urs br In Middle High German heroic poetry most dwarfs have long beards but some may appear childish br br br Size br In the early Old Norse sources dwarfs are typically described vaguely with no reference to them being particularly small in the legendary sagas and later folklore however they are often described as short br Nor ri Su ri Austri and Vestri are four dwarfs potentially depicted as four anthropomorphic figures on the hogback stone in Heysham in Lancashire that according to the Prose Edda each holds up a corner of the sky that was fashioned from the skull of Ymir It has been suggested that this would imply that dwarfs could be very tall however it has been noted that the sky could have been conceived of as being close to the earth at the horizon Regin a figure identified as either a dwarf or resembling a dwarf is a similar size to the hero Sigurd on both the Ramsund carving and carvings from the Hylestad Stave Church Dwarf names in Eddic sources include Fullangr tall enough and H r high however the terms are ambiguous and do not necessarily mean the dwarfs were conceived of as tall relative to a human Some names suggest a small size such as Nori and Nabbi which have been translated as tiny and little nub respectively however it has been argued that this was not necessarily the general rule br Not all late sagas involving dwarfs describe their size but all that do describe them as short In some German stories the dwarf takes on the attributes of a knight but is most clearly separated from normal humans by his small size in some cases only reaching up to the knees Despite their small size dwarfs in these contexts typically have superhuman strength either by nature or through magical means Anatoly Liberman suggests that dwarfs may have been initially thought of as lesser supernatural beings which became literal smallness after Christianization br br br Shape changing br Diversity in appearance is not only seen between dwarfs throughout time and region but also with individual dwarfs who can be capable of changing their shape and size such as in Reginsm l in which the dwarf Andvari lived as a pike in the water due to curse from a Norn however could also take on a human like shape In later German folklore the Zwergk nig Dwarf King is a tiny being but is capable of becoming enormously tall at will br br br Gender and family groups br br In Eddic and skaldic sources dwarfs are almost exclusively male for example in the Dvergatal every dwarf named is male Some scholars have proposed that female dwarfs were not believed to exist however they are likely attested in charms dating to the early medieval period and are explicitly described in later saga material Dwarfs are also widely referenced in these sources as having family relations with others such as brothers and sons Pairs or groups of brothers are seen relatively abundantly in Eddic contexts as with the sons of valdi and Fjalarr and Galarr br The inscription on the th century Ribe skull fragment has been interpreted by some scholars as explicitly referring to a dvergynja female dwarf that may have been believed to have been causing harm to the user of the fragment This interpretation is paralleled in Wi Dweorh XCIIIb Against a Dwarf XCIIIb in which a harmful dwarf s sister is called to prevent him from causing an afflicted person s illness br In F fnism l the worm F fnir refers to some Norns as Dvalinn s daughters Old Norse Dvalins d tr while in the Prose Edda they are described as of the dwarfs kin Old Norse dverga ttar As Norns are also female this could mean that dwarfs were conceived of by the author of the poem as able to be female it is not clear whether either their mother or mothers are dwarfs or if they themselves are considered dwarfs just because they are descended from dwarfs br It has been noted that it may not be that female dwarfs did not exist in the folklore of this period only that no explicit references to them survive in preserved narratives It has been proposed this may be because narratives typically centre on the gods rather than dwarfs and that female dwarfs were not conceived of as of great relevance to the gods given their primary interest in obtaining goods from dwarfs which does not depend on their gender Humans being of lower power and status cannot control dwarfs as easily and require alternative strategies to obtain treasures from them potentially explaining why female dwarfs are more prominent in saga literature br Female dwarfs feature in the late Gibbons saga B sa saga and jalar J ns saga where they are referred to by the term dyrgja In these cases female dwarfs are only mentioned alongside males and are not independently important to the plot Beyond Svama the named dyrgja in jalar J ns saga the only other explicitly named dwarf woman in saga literature is the daughter of Sindri in orsteins saga V kingssonar Herr r In saga material dwarf children are also seen In orsteins saga V kingssonar and Egils saga einhenda ok smundar berserkjabana central characters help these children and are rewarded in return by the father with treasures Conversely in Sigur ar saga gla the human H lfdan is cursed after he throws a rock at a dwarf child breaking its jaw and is subsequently visited by the child s father in a dream who curses him H lfdan s brother later gives the child a gold ring to atone for the harm and is rewarded by the father once more in a dream Together this suggests that dwarfs could be conceived of as loving and protective of their children by the saga authors In orsteins saga V kingssonar this family love is extended to the human H lfdan who develops a fostering relation with the dwarf Litr likely with H lfdan as the foster son br In German heroic legend male dwarfs are often portrayed as lusting after human women In contrast female dwarfs seek to possess the male hero in the legends br br br Craftsmanship and treasure br In Eddic sources dwarfs are attributed with creating magical treasures for the gods such as Mj lnir Sif s hair Draupnir Gullinbursti Sk bla nir Gleipnir and Gungnir while in S rla ttr they craft Br singamen for Freyja They further created the Mead of Poetry from the blood of Kvasir which grants skill in poetry to those who drink from it According to Sk ldskaparm l due to the role of dwarfs in crafting the drink poetry can be referred to by kennings such as the Billow of the Dwarf Crag Thought s Drink of the Rock Folk the Drink of Dvalinn the Dwarves ship and the Ale of the Dwarves John Lindow noted that stanza of the Poetic Edda poem V lusp can be read as describing the creation of human forms from the earth and follows a catalogue of dwarf names he suggests that the poem may present Ask and Embla as having been created by dwarfs with the three gods then giving them life br In Eddic and some saga sources rather than being exchanged items of value move from dwarfs to others often through extortion This has been suggested to be a critical differentiator between dwarfs and elves in pre Christian Germanic religion who maintain reciprocal and positive relationships with gods and humans Kormaks saga describes how food was to be shared with elves to heal sickness and Austrfararv sur records an lfabl t being held around the early th century in Sweden Dwarfs on the other hand according to these sources are asocial and there are no records of them receiving bl ts or other gifts in this period br Dwarfs maintain their roles as reluctant donors of their possessions in some later Old Norse legends such as Volsunga saga and Hervarar saga ok Hei reks where they are forced to give up Andvaranaut and Tyrfing respectively Some legendary and romance sagas diverge from this with dwarfs acting friendlily and helpfully however this is attributed to their lateness and likely do not represent perceptions that predate Christianisation Typically in these later sagas fighting dwarfs is considered dishonourable in contrast to other beings such as dragons Receiving help from a dwarf however such as being healed or given a treasure was not seen as problematic it has been proposed that the worldview of the saga writers was that a hero is not defined by achieving deeds alone but by being able to both give and accept help br In German legends they also possess other magical objects and often appear as master smiths br br br Association with mountains and stones br br The Codex Regius version of V lusp records that dwarfs were produced out of the earth while in the Prose Edda they form like maggots in the flesh of Ymir which became the earth Beyond this in early Old Norse sources there is ambiguity between whether dwarfs live within stones or whether they are themselves stones In V lusp they are referred to as masters of the rocks Old Norse veggbergs v sir and skaldic kennings for stone include dvergrann house of the dwarf and Durnis ni ja salr the hall of Durnir s kinsman In Ynglingatal stanza and the accompanying prose in the Ynglinga saga a dwarf lures King Sveig ir into an open stone which closes behind them whereupon he is never seen again Ynglingasaga also describes this dwarf as being afraid of the sun Old Norse dagskjarr akin to in Alv ssm l where the poem s eponymous dwarf is turned to stone sunlight br In German legends they typically live inside of hollow mountains in some cases they may live above the ground while in saga literature such as orsteins saga V kingssonar they commonly live in individual stones which could also serve as workshops such as in the forging of Br singamen in S rla ttr The presentation of dwarfs living within stones continued into modern folklore surrounding specific landscape features such as the Dwarfie Stane a chambered tomb located on the island of Hoy and the Dvergasteinn in Sey isfj r ur br It has been proposed by Lotte Motz that the inhabitation of mountains stones and mounds by dwarfs may be derived from their earlier association with the dead who were frequently buried in mounds and around megaliths br br br Causing disease br br The term dweorg can be used in Old English texts to describe an illness it is commonly used in medical texts derived from Greek or Latin sources where it is used to gloss symptoms such as fever The Dictionary of Old English divides the definition of Old English dweorg into either a dwarf or pygmy or a fever however it has been argued that the distinction between the two meanings may not have been prevalent among Germanic peoples in the Early Middle Ages due to the close association between the beings and sickness in medicinal charms br The th century Ribe skull fragment found in Jutland bears an inscription that calls for help from three beings including Odin against either one or two harmful dwarfs The item s function has been compared to the Sigtuna amulet I and Canterbury charm that seek to drive away a lord of ursar that is causing an infection the latter explicitly with the help of Thor A similar inscription dating between the th and th century is found on a lead plaque discovered near Fakenham in Norfolk which reads dead is dwarf Old English dead is dwerg and has been interpreted as another example of a written charm aiming to rid the ill person of the disease identified as a dwarf The Lacnunga contains the Anglo Saxon charm Wi Dweorh XCIIIb Against a Dwarf XCIIIb that refers to a sickness as a dweorg that is riding the afflicted person like a horse similar to the harmful mare in the later folklore of the Germanic speaking peoples Despite the Christian elements in the Wi Dweorh charms such as the saints called upon for help their foundations likely lie in a shared North Sea Germanic tradition that includes inscribed runic charms such as those found in Ribe and Norfolk br The conception of diseases as being caused by projectiles from supernatural beings is widespread in Germanic folklore through time such as in the phenomenon of elfshot in Wi f rstice where they are thrown by elves se and witches and in the Canterbury charm in which an infection is caused by the wound spear Old Norse s r vara used by the lord of ursar In the case of dwarfs this association has continued in places into the modern period such as in the Norwegian words dvergskot or dvergskott which refer to an animal disease and translate literally as dwarfshot br br br Toponomy br Placenames derived from dwarf or cognate br England br br Dwarriden Dwarf dale Valley in the West Riding of Yorkshire br br br Influence on popular culture br br Dwarfs feature in modern tellings of folklore such as Walt Disney s film based on the folktale recorded by the Brothers Grimm br Most dwarfs in modern fantasy fiction closely follow those of J R R Tolkien s The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings where the dwarves Tolkien s spelling were distinguished from elves most modern fantasy has continued this distinction Dwarfs are also present in other fantasy literature such as C S Lewis s Narnia stories Terry Pratchett s Discworld and the Artemis Fowl novels by Eoin Colfer br The emergence of fantasy video games has led to differing depictions and interpretations of dwarfs In the universe of The Elder Scrolls dwarves or Dwemer are presented as a race of subterranean elves whose culture was centred around science and engineering which differs from Tolkien s conceptualisation in that they are not particularly short and are extinct Other games like Dragon Age and Warcraft present an image of dwarfs as stout bearded mountain dwellers separate from Elves br
