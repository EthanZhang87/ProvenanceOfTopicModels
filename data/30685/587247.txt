title: Classical planet
id: 587247
A classical planet is an astronomical object that is visible to the naked eye and moves across the sky and its backdrop of fixed stars the common stars which seem still in contrast to the planets Visible to humans on Earth there are seven classical planets the seven luminaries They are from brightest to dimmest the Sun the Moon Venus Jupiter Mars Mercury and Saturn br Greek astronomers such as Geminus and Ptolemy recorded these classical planets during classical antiquity introducing the term planet which means wanderer in Greek plan s and plan t s expressing the fact that these objects move across the celestial sphere relative to the fixed stars Therefore the Greeks were the first to develop the astrological connections to the planets visual detail br Through the use of telescopes other celestial objects like the classical planets were found starting with the Galilean moons in Today the term planet is used considerably differently with a planet being defined as a natural satellite directly orbiting the Sun or other stars and having cleared its own orbit Therefore only five of the seven classical planets remain recognized as planets alongside Earth Uranus and Neptune br br br History br br br Babylonian br br The Babylonians recognized seven planets A bilingual list in the British Museum records the seven Babylonian planets in the following order br br The Moon Sin br The Sun Shamash br Jupiter Merodach br Venus Ishtar br Saturn Ninip br Mercury Nebo br Mars Nergal br br br Mandaean br br In Mandaeism the names of the seven planets are derived from the seven Babylonian planets Overall the seven classical planets Classical Mandaic romanized uba lit The Seven ibiahia planets or combined uba ibiahia Seven Planets are generally not viewed favorably in Mandaeism since they constitute part of the entourage of Ruha the Queen of the World of Darkness who is also their mother However individually some of the planets can be associated with positive qualities The names of the seven planets in Mandaic are borrowed from Akkadian Some of the names are ultimately derived from Sumerian since Akkadian had borrowed many deity names from Sumerian br Each planet is said to be carried in a ship Drawings of these ships are found in various Mandaean scriptures such as the Scroll of Abatur The planets are listed according to the traditional Mandaean order of the planets as mentioned in Masco br br br Symbols br br The astrological symbols for the classical planets appear in the medieval Byzantine codices in which many ancient horoscopes were preserved In the original papyri of these Greek horoscopes there are found a circle with one ray for the Sun and a crescent for the Moon br The written symbols for Mercury Venus Jupiter and Saturn have been traced to forms found in late Greek papyri The symbols for Jupiter and Saturn are identified as monograms of the initial letters of the corresponding Greek names and the symbol for Mercury is a stylized caduceus br A S D Maunder finds antecedents of the planetary symbols in earlier sources used to represent the gods associated with the classical planets Bianchini s planisphere produced in the nd century shows Greek personifications of planetary gods charged with early versions of the planetary symbols Mercury has a caduceus Venus has attached to her necklace a cord connected to another necklace Mars a spear Jupiter a staff Saturn a scythe the Sun a circlet with rays radiating from it and the Moon a headdress with a crescent attached br A diagram in Johannes Kamateros th century Compendium of Astrology shows the Sun represented by the circle with a ray Jupiter by the letter zeta the initial of Zeus Jupiter s counterpart in Greek mythology Mars by a shield crossed by a spear and the remaining classical planets by symbols resembling the modern ones without the cross mark seen in modern versions of the symbols The modern Sun symbol pictured as a circle with a dot first appeared in the Renaissance br br br Planetary hours br br The Ptolemaic system used in ancient Greek astronomy placed the planets by order of proximity to Earth in the then current geocentric model closest to furthest as the Moon Mercury Venus Sun Mars Jupiter and Saturn In addition the day was divided into seven hour intervals each ruled by one of the planets although the order was staggered see below br The first hour of each day was named after the ruling planet giving rise to the names and order of the Roman seven day week Modern Latin based cultures in general directly inherited the days of the week from the Romans and they were named after the classical planets for example in Spanish Mi rcoles is Mercury and in French mardi is Mars day br The modern English days of the week were mostly inherited from gods of the old Germanic Norse culture Wednesday is W den s day W den or Wettin eqv Mercury Thursday is Thor s day Thor eqv Jupiter Friday is Frige day Frige eqv Venus Equivalence here is by the gods roles for instance Venus and Frige were both goddesses of love It can be correlated that the Norse gods were attributed to each Roman planet and its god probably due to Roman influence rather than coincidentally by the naming of the planets A vestige of the Roman convention remains in the English name Saturday br br br Alchemy br br In alchemy each classical planet Moon Mercury Venus Sun Mars Jupiter and Saturn was associated with one of the seven metals known to the classical world silver mercury quicksilver copper gold iron tin and lead respectively As a result the alchemical glyphs for the metal and associated planet coincide Alchemists believed the other elemental metals were variants of these seven e g zinc was known as Indian tin or mock silver br br Alchemy in the Western World and other locations where it was widely practiced was and in many cases still is allied and intertwined with traditional Babylonian Greek style astrology in numerous ways they were built to complement each other in the search for hidden knowledge knowledge that is not common i e the occult Astrology has used the concept of classical elements from antiquity up until the present day today Most modern astrologers use the four classical elements extensively and indeed they are still viewed as a critical part of interpreting the astrological chart br br

Venus are visible only in twilight hours because their orbits are interior to that of Earth Venus is the third brightest object in the sky and the most prominent planet Mercury is more difficult to see due to its proximity to the Sun Lengthy twilight and an extremely low angle at maximum elongations make optical filters necessary to see Mercury from extreme polar locations Mars is at its brightest when it is in opposition which occurs approximately every twenty five months Jupiter and Saturn are the largest of the five planets but are farther from the Sun and therefore receive less sunlight Nonetheless Jupiter is often the next brightest object in the sky after Venus Saturn s luminosity is often enhanced by its rings which reflect light to varying degrees depending on their inclination to the ecliptic however the rings themselves are not visible to the naked eye from the Earth br br br See also br Antikythera mechanism br Behenian fixed star br Celestial spheres br
