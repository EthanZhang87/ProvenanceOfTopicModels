Mere Christianity is a Christian apologetical book by the British author C S Lewis It was adapted from a series of BBC radio talks made between and originally published as three separate volumes Broadcast Talks Christian Behaviour and Beyond Personality The book consists of four parts the first presents Lewis s arguments for the existence of God the second contains his defence of Christian theology including his notable Liar lunatic or Lord trilemma the third has him exploring Christian ethics among which are cardinal and theological virtues in the final he writes on the Christian conception of God br Mere Christianity was published in the United Kingdom by Geoffrey Bles on July While initial reviews to the book were generally positive modern reviewers were more critical of it and its overall reception was relatively mixed The praise was primarily directed to Lewis s humorous straightforward style of writing the criticism was primarily around the validity of his trilemma which defends the Christian doctrine of the divinity of Jesus and how he should have considered providing more choices br Deemed a classic in Lewis s career and religious literature Mere Christianity has often received a wide readership decades following its release and contributed to establishing its author s reputation as one of the most original exponents of the Christian faith in the th century The work with Lewis s arguments for God s existence in it continued to be examined in scholarly circles Mere Christianity has retained popularity among Christians from various denominations and appeared in several lists of finest Christian books Often used as a tool of evangelism it has been translated into over thirty languages and cited by a number of public figures as their influence to their conversion to Christianity Several biographies of the book have also been written br br br Background br After reading Lewis s The Problem of Pain James Welch the Director of Religious Broadcasting for the BBC wrote Lewis the following I write to ask whether you would be willing to help us in our work of religious broadcasting The microphone is a limiting and rather irritating instrument but the quality of thinking and depth of conviction which I find in your book ought sure to be shared with a great many other people Welch suggested two potential subjects Lewis responded with thanks and observed that modern literature the first did not suit him choosing instead the Christian faith as Lewis understood it br In the preface to later editions Lewis described his desire to avoid contested theological doctrine by focusing on core beliefs of the Christian Faith The succinct and pithy language employed by Lewis enabled him to impact broad audiences while retaining intellectual substance for more studied readers br Every Wednesday from pm to pm during August Lewis gave live talks entitled Right or Wrong A Clue to the Meaning of the Universe which would become the first book in Mere Christianity The first set of talks became very popular and flooded Lewis with responses from an adoring and irate public This feedback led to Lewis going back on air to answer listeners questions br The following January and February Lewis gave the next set of talks on what would become What Christians Believe The talks remained popular and because of the success of the newly released The Screwtape Letters Lewis s publisher was happy to publish the broadcast talks as books that year br In Autumn the third series of talks were ironically cut down from to minutes Due to a miscommunication Lewis had prepared for minutes but added the cut material back into the next book and added several more chapters br The fourth set of talks did not take place until The script drafts had a much wider scope originally and Lewis prepared for minute talks when the BBC was giving him The timing of these talks was important and strictly adhered to due to technology and World War II Germany would broadcast propaganda through the English spoken Lord Hawhaw during any dead air Due to the timing of the fourth set of talks pm Lewis said he could not do them all live and would have to record some br br br The Case for Christianity Broadcast Talks in UK br The core of the first section centres on an argument from morality the basis of which is the law of human nature a rule about right and wrong which Lewis maintained is commonly available and known to all human beings He cites as an example the case of Nazi Germany writing This law was called the Law of nature because people thought that everyone knew it by nature and did not need to be taught it They did not mean of course that you might not find an odd individual here and there who did not know it just as you find a few people who are colour blind or have no ear for a tune But taking the race as a whole they thought that the human idea of decent behaviour was obvious to everyone And I believe they were right If they were not then all the things we said about the war were nonsense What was the sense in saying the enemy were in the wrong unless Right is a real thing which the Nazis at bottom knew as well as we did and ought to have practised If they had had no notion of what we mean by right then though we might still have had to fight them we could no more have blamed them for that than for the colour of their hair br On a mundane level it is generally accepted that stealing is a violation of this moral law Lewis argues that the moral law is like scientific laws e g gravity or mathematics in that it was not contrived by humans However it is unlike scientific laws in that it can be broken or ignored and it is known intuitively rather than through experimentation After introducing the moral law Lewis argues that thirst reflects the fact that people naturally need water and there is no other substance which satisfies that need Lewis points out that earthly experience does not satisfy the human craving for joy and that only God could fit the bill humans cannot know to yearn for something if it does not exist br After providing reasons for his conversion to theism Lewis explicates various conceptions of God Pantheism he argues is incoherent and atheism too simple Eventually he arrives at Jesus Christ and invokes a well known argument now known as Lewis s trilemma Lewis arguing that Jesus was claiming to be God uses logic to advance three possibilities either he really was God was deliberately lying or was not God but thought himself to be which would make him delusional and likely insane The book goes on to say that the latter two possibilities are not consistent with Jesus character and it was most likely that he was being truthful br br br Christian Behaviour br The next third of the book explores the ethics resulting from Christian belief He cites the four cardinal virtues prudence justice temperance and fortitude After touching on these he goes into the three theological virtues hope faith and charity Lewis also explains morality as being composed of three layers relationships between man and man the motivations and attitudes of the man himself and contrasting worldviews br Lewis also covers such topics as social relations and forgiveness sexual ethics and the tenets of Christian marriage and the relationship between morality and psychoanalysis He also writes about the great sin pride which he argues to be the root cause of all evil and rebellion br His most important point is that Christianity mandates that one love your neighbour as yourself He points out that all persons unconditionally love themselves Even if one does not like oneself one would still love oneself Christians he writes must also apply this attitude to others even if they do not like them Lewis calls this one of the great secrets when one acts as if he loves others he will presently come to love them br br br Critical reception br br Initial reviews of Mere Christianity generally show enthusiasm and most of them were from Christian publications However combining them with the reviews published decades later indicated a more mixed reception The historian Stephanie L Derrick observed that the book s literary elements such as its eloquence were the aspect most frequently noted by contemporary publications The historian George M Marsden summarised that Mere Christianity has been hated as well as loved Nonetheless as a popular presentation of the faith it has drawn less systematic criticism than would a book that purported to be a definitive treatise on Christian apologetics and theology On the general reception to the book the Lewis biographer Margaret Patterson Hannay described it as his most popular and most disparaged work adding that probably because its fans have spoken of it as a profound piece of theology while it is as was designed to be only a primer br Describing the book as a rare gift Edward Skillin of the Commonweal magazine commented of Lewis s ability to make complicated matters more accessible especially to laypeople On a passage of the book Edward D Myers of Theology Today noted This is clear it is simple it is eminently Christian and it is typical of the ease with which Mr Lewis puts great matters into plain language Joseph McSorley of The Catholic World found Lewis writing with his customary clarity and incisiveness and with proofs that the average man will find convincing It is a delight to see him demolish in a paragraph many of the heresies which have contributed to our present ghastly condition The Tablet a Catholic magazine wrote br br We have never read arguments better marshalled and handled so that they can be remembered or any book more useful to the Christian in the Army or elsewhere who finds himself called upon to argue briefly from first premises to say why morality is not herd instinct why there is a special and unique character attaching to the sense of obligation why the conviction that there is a law of right and wrong and a transcendent morality is only intelligible if there is a God br The Times Literary Supplement wrote of Lewis s quite unique power of making theology interesting even exciting and one might almost say uproariously funny The reviewer added No writer of popular apologetics today is more effective than Mr C S Lewis The Clergy Review s G D Smith opined that Lewis shows himself a master in the rare art of conveying profound truths in simple and compelling language J H Homes of the New York Herald Tribune Weekly Book Review wrote that his clarity of thought and simplicity of expression have a magic about them which makes plain the most abstruse problems of theological speculation The Guardian said His learning is abundantly seasoned with common sense his humor and his irony are always at the service of the most serious purposes and his originality is the offspring of enthusiastically loyal orthodoxy br br The author Colin Duriez praised it as easy to understand and the biographer Thomas C Peters opined that his straightforward language makes the book fit to a wide audience There had been also criticism which was primarily directed towards Lewis s Liar lunatic or Lord trilemma The Lewis biographer and Christian apologist Alister McGrath while commending the book in general felt that his trilemma is a weak defence for the doctrine of the divinity of Jesus calling this the book s most obvious concern He wrote his argument is mostly unsupported by the modern biblical scholarship and argued that others options such as that Jesus was mistaken about his identity should have gotten into consideration of alternatives br Scathing criticism came from the philosopher John Beversluis in his book C S Lewis and the Search for Rational Religion Beversluis analysed Lewis s arguments for Christianity arriving in the conclusion that each of them is built on faulty logic He argued that Lewis made his arguments convincing by creating false analogies with an instance in his trilemma Beversluis said there are more alternatives in addition to Jesus being a liar or lunatic one of which is that his disciples misinterpreted his words The philosopher Victor Reppert replied to Beversluis in C S Lewis s Dangerous Idea noting that Beversluis was correct in pointing out that many of Lewis s arguments are not strictly logical but overestimating the degree to which Lewis rested his case for Christianity on reason alone Reppert continued that Lewis in his autobiography Surprised by Joy realised Christianity rests on far more than solely reason br br br Legacy br Mere Christianity has been referred to as a classic of Lewis s career as well as of religious literature particularly in the category of Christian apologetics Commentators have also seen it as a guide to the basics of the Christian faith and to his theology The book along with his arguments for the existence of God have frequently received academic evaluation either complimenting or critical Analysing Lewis s books the Australian archeologist Warwick Ball believed Mere Christianity is perhaps his most influential and widely read apologetic work the American philosopher C Stephen Evans called his moral argument the most widely convincing apologetic argument of the twentieth century McGrath considered it perhaps as outstanding an example of a lucid and intelligent presentation of the rational and moral case for Christian belief as we are ever likely to see br Mere Christianity has retained popularity years after its publication and has been compared to other well known Christian works including Augustine s The City of God and G K Chesterton s The Everlasting Man The BBC journalist Justin Phillips observed that it continues to transform the lives of those who read it There is no reason why it won t continue to be potent for decades to come According to the authors Roger Lancelyn Green and Walter Hooper its success led to the acknowledgment of Lewis as one of the most original exponents of the Christian faith of the th century The book Hooper continued shows Lewis s ability of providing a comprehensible guidance of the Christian beliefs theology to everyone and has become synonymous with Lewis The academic Bruce L Edwards noted that it contributes to shaping Lewis s reputation as a witty articulate proponent of Christianity The author Marvin D Hinten wrote When people are asked which C S Lewis book has most influenced them spiritually the most common answer is Mere Christianity br According to Peters the book is more popular among Christians of various denominations including Catholic Latter day Saint Orthodox and Protestant but less among non Christians It is often used as an evangelistic tool predominantly in Christian majority countries including the United States where its influence is most felt Furthermore its influence is strengthened by the publication of its translations according to Marsden it has been translated to about thirty six languages In the next decades Mere Christianity is continued to be reprinted and sold by Christian and online booksellers For instance soon after the dissolution of the Soviet Union it was translated into the several native languages of its breakaway states which was done by Orthodox Christians to rebuild their influence As of the book had been in BookScan Religion Bestseller s list for weeks consecutively There is also a considerable readership in China with copies had been sold there as of br The book has also been cited by a number of public figures as their influence to their conversion or re conversion to Christianity as well as other Christian denominations The American geneticist Francis Collins related his story of conversion from atheism in his book The Language of God and described Mere Christianity as having influenced him to embrace Christianity The American attorney Charles Colson s conversion happened after him reading a copy of the book given by his friend Thomas L Phillips the chairman of the board of the Raytheon Company His story became popular enhanced by the release of his autobiography in which was consequently declared the Year of the Evangelicals by the Newsweek magazine Catholic converts include the British philanthropist Leonard Cheshire the German economist E F Schumacher the American author Sheldon Vanauken the American columnist Ross Douthat the American theologian Peter Kreeft and the American philosopher Francis J Beckwith br Mere Christianity has been featured in several lists It was included in the book Christian Books That Changed the Century by William J Petersen and Randy Petersen In and the evangelical magazine Christianity Today s editorial board included Mere Christianity in its Books of the Century and The Top Books That Have Shaped Evangelicals respectively In a article to Christianity Today McGrath ranked it the first among the five books by Lewis he liked the most In the same year s The Best Christian Book of All Time Tournament run by InterVarsity Christian Fellowship Mere Christianity was voted as the all time best Christian book only after Augustine s autobiography Confessions In Christianity Today s Greg Cootsona a writer of the relationship between religion and science featured it in his Books That Bring Science and Christianity Together listing br Mere Christianity has influenced other Christian publications with the scholar Gary L Tandy noting that it remains the standard for assessing them mainly the apologetic ones Subsequent publications with allusion to the book in their titles include N T Wright s Simply Christian and McGrath s Mere Apologetics The American pastor Tim Keller referred to his apologetic The Reason for God as Mere
