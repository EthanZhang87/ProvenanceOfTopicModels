In folklore giants from Ancient Greek gigas cognate giga are beings of humanoid appearance but are at times prodigious in size and strength or bear an otherwise notable appearance The word giant is first attested in from Robert of Gloucester s chronicle It is derived from the Gigantes Greek of Greek mythology br Fairy tales such as Jack the Giant Killer have formed the modern perception of giants as dimwitted and violent ogres sometimes said to eat humans while other giants tend to eat livestock In more recent portrayals like those of Jonathan Swift and Roald Dahl some giants are both intelligent and friendly br br br Literary and cultural analysis br Giants appear many times in folklore and myths Representing the human body enlarged to the point of being monstrous giants evoke terror and remind humans of their body s frailty and mortality They are often portrayed as monsters and antagonists but there are exceptions Some giants intermingle with humans in a friendly way and can even be part of human families with their offspring being portrayed as regular humans where they are often referred to as half giants br Folklorists and historians examine the role giants are assigned in regional geomythologies For example Fionn mac Cumhaill is said to have built the Giant s Causeway on the island of Ireland Per a examination in an American studies journal It is generally admitted today that Paul Bunyan was a synthetic figure conceived by advertising men rather than the spontaneous product of the folk mind yet he has been adopted by the American people with enthusiasm Paul and his blue ox Babe are supposed to have altered the appearance of the American continent the animal s hoof prints became the lake beds of the Northwest and from its drinking trough spilled the Mississippi River Fossilized remains of ancient mammals and reptiles common to the Sivalik Hills of India may have influenced aspects of the Mah bh rata that tell of battles in which hundreds of mighty and sometimes gigantic heroes horses and war elephants are said to have died br br br Archeology and paleontology br Claudine Cohen in her book The Fate of the Mammoth argued that the history of human interaction with fossil bones of prehistoric megafauna was heavily influenced by giant lore Per Cohen the proto scientific study of giants appears in several phases of human history Herotodus reported that the remains of Orestes were found in Tegea Pliny described a giant s skeleton found in Crete after an earthquake and seemed to refer to evolution as the process by which giants become human size over time and Saint Augustine mentions what is believed to have been the fossilized molar of an ancient Elephantidae in his City of God in a passage reflecting on the nature and meaning of the Noahacian deluge The academic consideration of giants continued through the Middle Ages Renaissance and even the early modern period Boccaccio devoted a passage of his Genealogies of the Pagan Gods to purported archeological discoveries in Sicily that he thought might be evidence of the historicity of The Odyssey s Polyphemus Rabelais created a wholly fabricated giantology for his th century Gargantua and Pantagruel Massive bones found in in France were initially assigned to Teutobochus but the examinations of them by various physicians and their publication of diverging conclusions about the bones kicked off a pamphlet war between anatomists and surgeons of the day The discovery of the so called Claverack Giant in colonial New York triggered giantological investigations by two important early American intellectuals Cotton Mather and Edward Taylor br br br Religion and mythology br br br Abrahamic br br Genesis tells of the Nephilim before and after Noah s Flood The word Nephilim is loosely translated as giants in some translations of the Hebrew Bible but left untranslated in others According to Genesis the Nephilim were destroyed in the Flood but Nephilim are reported after the Flood including br br The Anakim br The Amorites br The Rephaites also known as The Emites br The Book of Numbers includes the discouraging report by the spies sent by Moses into Canaan We can t attack those people they are stronger than we are All the people we saw there are of great size We saw the Nephilim there the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes and we looked the same to them The Book of Joshua describing the actual conquest of Canaan in a later generation makes reference to such people living there in Joshua and Joshua br br The Bible also tells of Gog and Magog who later entered European folklore and of the famous battle between David and the Philistine Goliath While Goliath is often portrayed as a giant in retellings of the Biblical narrative he appears to be significantly smaller than other giants biblical or otherwise The Masoretic Text version of the Book of Samuel gives his height as six cubits and one span possibly centimetres ft in ft in while the Septuagint the st century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus and the nd st centuries BCE Dead Sea Scrolls give Goliath s height as four cubits and one span possibly centimetres ft in ft in For comparison the Anakites are described as making the Israelites seem like grasshoppers See also Gibborim br Josephus also described the Amorites as giants in his Antiquities of the Jews circa CE indicating that some sort of fossils may have been on display at that time For which reason they removed their camp to Hebron and when they had taken it they slew all the inhabitants There were till then left the race of giants who had bodies so large and countenances so entirely different from other men that they were surprising to the sight and terrible to the hearing The bones of these men are still shown to this very day unlike to any credible relations of other men br The Book of Enoch describes giants as the offspring of Watchers and women in br br br Armenian br Hayk was known as the founder of the Armenian state Hayk was part of a race of giants who helped construct the Tower of Babel Ancient historian Movses

between two rival armies of giants to the south east of Lake Van br br br Aztec br Aztec mythology features the Quinametzin a race of giant men created in one of the previous solar eras They are credited with the construction of Teotihuacan br br br Basque br Giants are rough but generally righteous characters of formidable strength living in the hills of the Basque Country Giants stand for the Basque people reluctant to convert to Christianity who decide to stick to the old lifestyle and customs in the forest Sometimes they hold the secret of ancient techniques and wisdom unknown to the Christians like in the legend of San Martin Txiki while their most outstanding feature is their strength It follows that in many legends all over the Basque territory the giants are held accountable for the creation of many stone formations hills and ages old megalithic structures dolmens etc with similar explanations provided in different spots br However giants show different variants and forms

The Greeks believed some of them like Enceladus to lie buried from that time under the earth and that their tormented quivers resulted in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions br Herodotus in Book
