but was Christianized and likely gained its modern name and features scythe skeleton black robe etc during the Middle Ages The designation Meager comes from its portrayal as a skeleton which was largely influenced by the Christian Dance of Death Dutch dodendans theme that was prominent in Europe during the late Middle Ages Hein was a Middle Dutch name originating as a short form of Heinric see Henry given name Its use was possibly related to the comparable German concept of Freund Hein Notably many of the names given to Death can also refer to the Devil it is likely that fear of death

nature of the memitim it is generally accepted that as described in the Book of Job they are killers of some sort br br br Form and functions br According to the Midrash the Angel of Death was created by God on the first day His dwelling is in heaven whence he reaches earth in eight flights whereas Pestilence reaches it in one He has twelve wings Over all people have I surrendered thee the power said God to the Angel of Death only not over this one i e Moses which has received freedom from death through the Law It is said of the Angel of Death that he is full of eyes In the hour of death he stands at the head of the departing one with a drawn sword to which clings a drop of gall As soon as the dying man sees Death he is seized with a convulsion and opens his mouth whereupon Death throws the drop into it This drop causes his death he turns putrid and his face becomes yellow The expression the taste of death originated in the idea that death was caused by a drop of gall br The soul escapes through the mouth or as is stated in another place through the throat therefore the Angel of Death stands at the head of the patient Adolf Jellinek l c ii Midr Teh to Ps xi When the soul

member of the heavenly host with often grim and destructive duties One of Samael s greatest roles in Jewish lore is that of the main angel of death and the head of satans br br br Scholars and the Angel of Death br br Talmud teachers of the th century associate quite familiarly with him When he appeared to one on the street the teacher reproached him with rushing upon him as upon a beast whereupon the angel called upon him at his house To another he granted a respite of thirty days that he might put his knowledge in order before entering the next world To a third he had no access because he could not interrupt the study of the Talmud To a fourth he showed a rod of fire whereby he is recognized as the Angel of Death M K a He often entered the house of Bibi and conversed with him ag b Often he resorts to strategy in order to interrupt and seize his victim B M a Mak a br The death of Joshua ben Levi in particular is surrounded with a web of fable When the time came for him

the way This request also was granted to him and Joshua sprang with the knife over the wall of paradise the angel who is not allowed to enter paradise caught hold of the end of his garment Joshua swore that he would not come out and God declared that he should not leave paradise unless he had ever absolved himself of an oath he had never absolved himself of an oath so he was allowed to remain The Angel of Death then demanded back his knife but Joshua refused At this point a heavenly voice bat ol rang out Give him back the knife because the children of men have need of it will bring death Hesitant Joshua Ben Levi gives back the knife in exchange for the Angel of Death s name To never forget the name he carved Troke into his arm the Angel of Death s chosen name When the knife was returned to the Angel Joshua s carving of the name faded and he forgot br Ket b Jellinek l c ii Bacher l c i et seq br br br Rabbinic views br The Rabbis found the Angel of Death mentioned in Psalm where the Targum translates There is no man who lives and seeing the Angel of Death can deliver his soul from his hand Eccl is thus explained in Midrash Rabbah to the passage One may not escape the Angel of Death nor say to him Wait until I put my affairs in order or There is my son my slave take him in my stead Where the Angel of Death appears there is no remedy but his name Talmud Ned a Hul b

the Apocalypse portrayed in the Book of Revelation in Revelation br br And I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth br He is also known as the Pale Horseman whose name is Thanatos the same as

Fire that burns with sulfur br br Death and Hell were thrown into the Lake of Fire This is the second death br The last enemy to be destroyed is death br br br In Islam br In Islam Archangel Azrael is the Malak al Maut angel of death He and his many subordinates pull the souls out of the bodies and guide them through the journey of the afterlife Their appearance depends on the person s deeds and actions with those who did good seeing a beautiful being and those who did wrong seeing a horrific monster br Islamic tradition discusses elaborately as to what exactly happens before during and after the death The angel of death appears to the dying to take out their souls The sinners souls are extracted in a most painful way while the righteous are treated easily After the burial two angels Munkar and Nakir come to question the dead to test their faith The righteous believers answer correctly and live in peace and comfort while the sinners and disbelievers fail and punishments ensue The period or stage between death and resurrection is called barzakh the interregnum br Death is a significant event in Islamic life and theology It is seen not as the termination of life but rather the continuation of life in another form In Islamic belief God has made this worldly life a test and a preparation ground for the afterlife and with death this worldly life comes to an end Thus every person has only one chance to prepare themselves for the life to come where God will resurrect and judge every individual and will entitle them to rewards or punishment based on their good or bad deeds Death is seen as the gateway to and beginning of the afterlife In Islamic belief death is predetermined by God and the exact time of a person s death is known only to Allah br br br Gallery br
