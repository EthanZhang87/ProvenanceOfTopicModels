Western Canada It is commonly referred to as the Old West or the Wild West and depicted in Western media as a hostile sparsely populated frontier in a state of near total lawlessness patrolled by outlaws sheriffs and numerous other stock gunslinger characters Western narratives often concern the gradual attempts to tame the crime ridden American West using wider themes of justice freedom rugged individualism manifest destiny and the national history and identity of the United States br Within the larger scope of the Western genre there are several recognized subgenres Some subgenres
