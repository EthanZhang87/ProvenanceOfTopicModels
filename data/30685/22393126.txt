Inferno Italian i f rno Italian for Hell is the first part of Italian writer Dante Alighieri s th century narrative poem The Divine Comedy It is followed by Purgatorio and Paradiso The Inferno describes the journey of a fictionalised version of Dante himself through Hell guided by the ancient Roman poet Virgil In the poem Hell is depicted as nine concentric circles of torment located within the Earth it is the realm of those who have rejected spiritual values by yielding to bestial appetites or violence or by perverting their human intellect to fraud or malice against their fellowmen As an allegory the Divine Comedy represents the journey of the soul toward God with the Inferno describing the recognition and rejection of sin br br The poem begins on the night of Maundy Thursday on March or April shortly before the dawn of Good Friday The narrator Dante himself is years old and thus midway in the journey of our life Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita half of the biblical lifespan of Psalm in the Vulgate numbered as Psalm in the King James Bible The poet finds himself lost in a dark wood selva oscura astray from the straight way diritta via also translatable as right way of salvation He sets out to climb directly up a small mountain but his way is blocked by three beasts he cannot evade a lonza usually rendered as leopard or leopon a leone lion and a lupa she wolf The three beasts taken from Jeremiah are thought to symbolize the three kinds of sin that bring the unrepentant soul into one of the three major divisions of Hell According to John Ciardi these are incontinence the she wolf violence and bestiality the lion and fraud and malice the leopard br It is now dawn of Good Friday April with the sun rising in Aries The beasts drive him back despairing into the darkness of error a lower place basso loco where the sun is silent l sol tace However Dante is rescued by a figure who announces that he was born sub Iulio i e in the time of Julius Caesar and lived under Augustus it is the shade of the Roman poet Virgil author of the Aeneid a Latin epic br br On the evening of Good Friday Dante hesitates as he follows Virgil Virgil explains that he has been sent by Beatrice the symbol of Divine Love Beatrice had been moved to aid Dante by the Virgin Mary symbolic of compassion and Saint Lucia symbolic of illuminating Grace Rachel symbolic of the contemplative life also appears in the heavenly scene recounted by Virgil The two of them then begin their journey to the underworld br br Dante passes through the gate of Hell which bears an inscription ending with the phrase Lasciate ogne speranza voi ch intrate most frequently translated as Abandon all hope ye who enter here Dante and his guide hear the anguished screams of the Uncommitted These are the souls of people who in life took no sides the opportunists who were for neither good nor evil but instead were merely concerned with themselves Among these Dante recognizes a figure who made the great refusal implied to be Pope Celestine V whose cowardice in selfish terror for his own welfare served as the door through which so much evil entered the Church Mixed with them are outcasts who took no side in the Rebellion of Angels These souls are forever unclassified they are neither in Hell nor out of it but reside on the shores of the Acheron Naked and futile they race around through the mist in eternal pursuit of an elusive wavering banner symbolic of their pursuit of ever shifting self interest while relentlessly chased by swarms of wasps and hornets who continually sting them Loathsome maggots and worms at the sinners feet drink the putrid mixture of blood pus and tears that flows down their bodies This symbolizes the sting of their guilty conscience and the repugnance of sin This may also be seen as a reflection of the spiritual stagnation in which they lived br br After passing through the vestibule Dante and Virgil reach the ferry that will take them across the river Acheron and to Hell proper The ferry is piloted by Charon who does not want to let Dante enter for he is a living being Virgil forces Charon to take him by declaring Vuolsi cos col dove si puote ci che si vuole It is so willed there where is power to do That which is willed referring to the fact that Dante is on his journey on divine grounds The wailing and blasphemy of the damned souls entering Charon s boat contrast with the joyful singing of the blessed souls arriving by ferry in the Purgatorio The passage across the Acheron however is undescribed since Dante faints and does not awaken until they reach the other side br br Virgil proceeds to guide Dante through the nine circles of Hell The circles are concentric representing a gradual increase in wickedness and culminating at the centre of the earth where Satan is held in bondage The sinners of each circle are punished for eternity in a fashion fitting their crimes each punishment is a contrapasso a symbolic instance of poetic justice For example later in the poem Dante and Virgil encounter fortune tellers who must walk forward with their heads on backward unable to see what is ahead because they tried to see the future through forbidden means Such a contrapasso functions not merely as a form of divine revenge but rather as the fulfilment of a destiny freely chosen by each soul during his or her life People who sinned but prayed for forgiveness before their deaths are found not in Hell but in Purgatory where they labour to become free of their sins Those in Hell are people who tried to justify their sins and are unrepentant br br Dante s Hell is structurally based on the ideas of Aristotle but with certain Christian symbolisms exceptions and misconstructions of Aristotle s text and a further supplement from Cicero s De Officiis Virgil reminds Dante the character of Those pages where the Ethics tells of three Conditions contrary to Heaven s will and rule Incontinence vice and brute bestiality Cicero for his part had divided sins between violence and fraud By conflating Cicero s violence with Aristotle s bestiality and his fraud with malice or vice Dante the poet obtained three major categories of sin as symbolized by the three beasts that Dante encounters in Canto I these are Incontinence Violence Bestiality and Fraud Malice Sinners punished for incontinence also known as wantonness the lustful the gluttonous the hoarders and wasters and the wrathful and sullen all demonstrated weakness in controlling their appetites desires and natural urges according to Aristotle s Ethics incontinence is less condemnable than malice or bestiality and therefore these sinners are located in four circles of Upper Hell Circles These sinners endure lesser torments than do those consigned to Lower Hell located within the walls of the City of Dis for committing acts of violence and fraud the latter of which involves as Dorothy L Sayers writes abuse of the specifically human faculty of reason The deeper levels are organized into one circle for violence Circle and two circles for fraud Circles and As a Christian Dante adds Circle Limbo to Upper Hell and Circle Heresy to Lower Hell making Circles in total incorporating the Vestibule of the Futile this leads to Hell containing main divisions This structure is also found within the Purgatorio and Paradiso Lower Hell is further subdivided Circle Violence is divided into three rings Circle Fraud is divided into ten bolge and Circle Treachery is divided into four regions Thus Hell contains divisions in total br br Dante awakens to find that he has crossed the Acheron and Virgil leads him to the first circle of the abyss Limbo where Virgil himself resides The first circle contains the unbaptized and the virtuous pagans who although not sinful enough to warrant damnation did not accept Christ Dorothy L Sayers writes After those who refused choice come those without opportunity of choice They could not that is choose Christ they could and did choose human virtue and for that they have their reward Limbo shares many characteristics with the Asphodel Meadows and thus the guiltless damned are punished by living in a deficient form of Heaven Without baptism the portal of the faith that you embrace they lacked the hope for something greater than rational minds can conceive When Dante asked if anyone has ever left Limbo Virgil states that he saw Jesus a Mighty One descend into Limbo and take Adam Abel Noah Moses Abraham David Rachel and others see Limbo of the Patriarchs into his all forgiving arms and transport them to Heaven as the first human souls to be saved The event known as the Harrowing of Hell supposedly occurred around AD or br Dante encounters the poets Homer Horace Ovid and Lucan who include him in their number and make him sixth in that high company They reach the base of a great Castle the dwelling place of the wisest men of antiquity surrounded by seven gates and a flowing brook After passing through the seven gates the group comes to an exquisite green meadow and Dante encounters the inhabitants of the Citadel These include figures associated with the Trojans and their descendants the Romans Electra mother of Troy s founder Dardanus Hector Aeneas Julius Caesar in his role as Roman general in his armor falcon eyed Camilla Penthesilea Queen of the Amazons King Latinus and his daughter Lavinia Lucius Junius Brutus who overthrew Tarquin to found the Roman Republic Lucretia Julia Marcia and Cornelia Africana Dante also sees Saladin a Muslim military leader known for his battle against the Crusaders as well as his generous chivalrous and merciful conduct br Dante next encounters a group of philosophers including Aristotle with Socrates and Plato at his side as well as Democritus Diogenes either Diogenes the Cynic or Diogenes of Apollonia Anaxagoras Thales Empedocles Heraclitus and Zeno either Zeno of Elea or Zeno of Citium He sees the scientist Dioscorides the mythical Greek poets Orpheus and Linus and Roman statesmen Marcus Tullius Cicero and Seneca Dante sees the Alexandrian geometer Euclid and Ptolemy the Alexandrian astronomer and geographer as well as the physicians Hippocrates and Galen He also encounters Avicenna a Persian polymath and Averroes a medieval Andalusian polymath known for his commentaries on Aristotle s works Dante and Virgil depart from the four other poets and continue their journey br Although Dante implies that all virtuous non Christians find themselves here he later encounters two Cato of Utica and Statius in Purgatory and two Trajan and Ripheus in Heaven In Purgatorio XXII Virgil names several additional inhabitants of Limbo who were not mentioned in the Inferno br br Dante and Virgil leave Limbo and enter the Second Circle the first of the circles of Incontinence where the punishments of Hell proper begin It is described as a part where no thing gleams They find their way hindered by the serpentine Minos who judges all of those condemned for active deliberately willed sin to one of the lower circles At this point in Inferno every soul is required to confess all of their sins to Minos after which Minos sentences each soul to its torment by wrapping his tail around himself a number of times corresponding to the circle of Hell to which the soul must go The role of Minos here is a combination of his classical role as condemner and unjust judge of the underworld and the role of classical Rhadamanthus interrogator and confessor of the underworld This mandatory confession makes it so every soul verbalizes and sanctions their own ranking amongst the condemned since these confessions are the sole grounds for their placement in hell Dante is not forced to make this confession instead Virgil rebukes Minos and he and Dante continue on br In the second circle of Hell are those overcome by lust These carnal malefactors are condemned for allowing their appetites to sway their reason These souls are buffeted back and forth by the terrible winds of a violent storm without rest This symbolizes the power of lust to blow needlessly and aimlessly as the lovers drifted into self indulgence and were carried away by their passions so now they drift for ever The bright voluptuous sin is now seen as it is a howling darkness of helpless discomfort Since lust involves mutual indulgence and is not therefore completely self centered Dante deems it the least heinous of the sins and its punishment is the most benign within Hell proper The ruined slope in this circle is thought to be a reference to the earthquake that occurred after the death of Christ br br In this circle Dante sees Semiramis Dido Cleopatra Helen of Troy Paris Achilles Tristan and many others who were overcome by sexual love during their life Due to the presence of so many rulers among the lustful the fifth Canto of Inferno has been called the canto of the queens Dante comes across Francesca da Rimini who married the deformed Giovanni Malatesta also known as Gianciotto for political purposes but fell in love with his younger brother Paolo Malatesta the two began to carry on an adulterous affair Sometime between and Giovanni surprised them together in Francesca s bedroom and violently stabbed them both to death Francesca explains br br Francesca further reports that she and Paolo yielded to their love when reading the story of the adultery between Lancelot and Guinevere in the Old French romance Lancelot du Lac Francesca says Galeotto fu l libro e chi lo scrisse The word Galeotto means pander but is also the Italian term for Gallehaut who acted as an intermediary between Lancelot and Guinevere encouraging them on to love John Ciardi renders line as That book and he who wrote it was a pander Inspired by Dante author Giovanni Boccaccio invoked the name Prencipe Galeotto in the alternative title to The Decameron a th century collection of novellas Ultimately Francesca never makes a full confession to Dante Rather than admit to her and Paolo s sins the very reasons they reside in this circle of hell she consistently takes an erroneously passive role in the adulterous affair The English poet John Keats in his sonnet On a Dream imagines what Dante does not write the point of view of Paolo br br As he did at the end of Canto III Dante overcome by pity and anguish describes his swoon I fainted as if I had met my death And then I fell as a dead body falls br br In the third circle the gluttonous wallow in a vile putrid slush produced by a ceaseless foul icy rain a great storm of putrefaction as punishment for subjecting their reason to a voracious appetite Cerberus described as il gran vermo literally the great worm line the monstrous three headed beast of Hell ravenously guards the gluttons lying in the freezing mire mauling and flaying them with his claws as they howl like dogs Virgil obtains safe passage past the monster by filling its three mouths with mud br Dorothy L Sayers writes that the surrender to sin which began with mutual indulgence leads by an imperceptible degradation to solitary self indulgence The gluttons grovel in the mud by themselves sightless and heedless of their neighbors symbolizing the cold selfish and empty sensuality of their lives Just as lust has revealed its true nature in the winds of the previous circle here the slush reveals the true nature of sensuality which includes not only overindulgence in food and drink but also other kinds of addiction br In this circle Dante converses with a Florentine contemporary identified as Ciacco which means hog A character with the same nickname later appears in The Decameron of Giovanni Boccaccio where his gluttonous behaviour is clearly portrayed Ciacco speaks to Dante regarding strife in Florence between the White and Black Guelphs which developed after the Guelph Ghibelline strife ended with the complete defeat of the Ghibellines In the first of several political prophecies in the Inferno Ciacco predicts the expulsion of the White Guelphs Dante s party from Florence by the Black Guelphs aided by Pope Boniface VIII which marked the start of Dante s long exile from the city These events occurred in prior to when the poem was written but in the future at Easter time of the time in which the poem is set br br The Fourth Circle is guarded by a figure Dante names as Pluto this is Plutus the deity of wealth in classical mythology Although the two are often conflated he is a distinct figure from Pluto Dis the classical ruler of the underworld At the start of Canto VII he menaces Virgil and Dante with the cryptic phrase Pape Sat n pape Sat n aleppe but Virgil protects Dante from him br Those whose attitude toward material goods deviated from the appropriate mean are punished in the fourth circle They include the avaricious or miserly including many clergymen and popes and cardinals who hoarded possessions and the prodigal who squandered them The hoarders and spendthrifts joust using great weights as weapons that they push with their chests br br Relating this sin of incontinence to the two that preceded it lust and gluttony Dorothy L Sayers writes Mutual indulgence has already declined into selfish appetite now that appetite becomes aware of the incompatible and equally selfish appetites of other people Indifference becomes mutual antagonism imaged here by the antagonism between hoarding and squandering The contrast between these two groups leads Virgil to discourse on the nature of Fortune who raises nations to greatness and later plunges them into poverty as she shifts those empty goods from nation unto nation clan to clan This speech fills what would otherwise be a gap in the poem since both groups are so absorbed in their activity that Virgil tells Dante that it would be pointless to try to speak to them indeed they have lost their individuality and been rendered unrecognizable br br In the swampy stinking waters of the river Styx the Fifth Circle the actively wrathful fight each other viciously on the surface of the slime while the sullen the passively wrathful lie beneath the water withdrawn into a black sulkiness which can find no joy in God or man or the universe At the surface of the foul Stygian marsh Dorothy L Sayers writes the active hatreds rend and snarl at one another at the bottom the sullen hatreds lie gurgling unable even to express themselves for the rage that chokes them As the last circle of Incontinence the savage self frustration of the Fifth Circle marks the end of that which had its tender and romantic beginnings in the dalliance of indulged passion br br Phlegyas reluctantly transports Dante and Virgil across the Styx in his skiff On the way they are accosted by Filippo Argenti a Black Guelph from the prominent Adimari family Little is known about Argenti although Giovanni Boccaccio describes an incident in which he lost his temper early commentators state that Argenti s brother seized some of Dante s property after his exile from Florence Just as Argenti enabled the seizing of Dante s property he himself is seized by all the other wrathful souls br When Dante responds In weeping and in grieving accursed spirit may you long remain Virgil blesses him with words used to describe Christ himself Luke In a literal sense this reflects the fact that souls in Hell are eternally fixed in the state they have chosen but allegorically it reflects Dante s beginning awareness of his own sin br br In the distance Dante perceives high towers that resemble fiery red mosques Virgil informs him that they are approaching the City of Dis Dis itself surrounded by the Stygian marsh contains Lower Hell within its walls Dis is one of the names of Pluto the classical king of the underworld in addition to being the name of the realm The walls of Dis are guarded by fallen angels Virgil is unable to convince them to let Dante and him enter br br Dante is threatened by the Furies consisting of Alecto Megaera and Tisiphone and Medusa An angel sent from Heaven secures entry for the poets opening the gate by touching it with a wand and rebukes those who opposed Dante Allegorically this reveals the fact that the poem is beginning to deal with sins that philosophy and humanism cannot fully understand Virgil also mentions to Dante how Erichtho sent him to the lowest circle of Hell to bring back a spirit from there br br In the sixth circle heretics such as Epicurus and his followers who say the soul dies with the body are trapped in flaming tombs Dante holds discourse with a pair of Epicurian Florentines in one of the tombs Farinata degli Uberti a famous Ghibelline leader following the Battle of Montaperti in September Farinata strongly protested the proposed destruction of Florence at the meeting of the victorious Ghibellines he died in and was posthumously condemned for heresy in and Cavalcante de Cavalcanti a Guelph who was the father of Dante s friend and fellow poet Guido Cavalcanti The political affiliation of these two men allows for a further discussion of Florentine politics In response to a question from Dante about the prophecy he has received Farinata explains that what the souls in Hell know of life on earth comes from seeing the future not from any observation of the present Consequently when the portal of the future has been shut it will no longer be possible for them to know anything Farinata explains that also crammed within the tomb are Emperor Frederick II commonly reputed to be an Epicurean and Ottaviano degli Ubaldini whom Dante refers to as il Cardinale br br Dante reads an inscription on one of the tombs indicating it belongs to Pope Anastasius II although some modern scholars hold that Dante erred in the verse mentioning Anastasius Anastasio papa guardo lo qual trasse Fotin de la via dritta lines confusing the pope with the Byzantine emperor of the time Anastasius I Pausing for a moment before the steep descent to the foul smelling seventh circle Virgil explains the geography and rationale of Lower Hell in which the sins of violence or bestiality and fraud or malice are punished In his explanation Virgil refers to the Nicomachean Ethics and the Physics of Aristotle with medieval interpretations Virgil asserts that there are only two legitimate sources of wealth natural resources Nature and human labor and activity Art Usury to be punished in the next circle is therefore an offence against both it is a kind of blasphemy since it is an act of violence against Art which is the child of Nature and Nature derives from God br Virgil then indicates the time through his unexplained awareness of the stars positions The Wain the Great Bear now lies in the northwest over Caurus the northwest wind The constellation Pisces the Fish is just appearing over the horizon it is the zodiacal sign preceding Aries the Ram Canto I notes that the sun is in Aries and since the twelve zodiac signs rise at two hour intervals it must now be about two hours prior to sunrise a m on Holy Saturday April br br The Seventh Circle divided into three rings houses the Violent Dante and Virgil descend a jumble of rocks that had once formed a cliff to reach the Seventh Circle from the Sixth Circle having first to evade the Minotaur L infamia di Creti the infamy of Crete line at the sight of them the Minotaur gnaws his flesh Virgil assures the monster that Dante is not its hated enemy Theseus This causes the Minotaur to charge them as Dante and Virgil swiftly enter the seventh circle Virgil explains the presence of shattered stones around them they resulted from the great earthquake that shook the earth at the moment of Christ s death Matthew at the time of the Harrowing of Hell Ruins resulting from the same shock were previously seen at the beginning of Upper Hell the entrance of the Second Circle Canto V br br Ring br Against Neighbors br In the first round of the seventh circle the murderers war makers plunderers and tyrants are immersed in Phlegethon a river of boiling blood and fire Ciardi writes as they wallowed in blood during their lives so they are immersed in the boiling blood forever each according to the degree of his guilt The Centaurs commanded by Chiron and Pholus patrol the ring shooting arrows into any sinners who emerge higher out of the boiling blood than each is allowed The centaur Nessus guides the poets along Phlegethon and points out Alexander the Great disputed Dionysius either Dionysius I or Dionysius II or both they were bloodthirsty unpopular tyrants of Sicily Ezzelino III da Romano the cruelest of the Ghibelline tyrants Obizzo d Este and Guy de Montfort The river grows shallower until it reaches a ford after which it comes full circle back to the deeper part where Dante and Virgil first approached it immersed here are tyrants including Attila King of the Huns flagello in terra scourge on earth line Pyrrhus either the bloodthirsty son of Achilles or King Pyrrhus of Epirus Sextus Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo After bringing Dante and Virgil to the shallow ford Nessus leaves them to return to his post This passage may have been influenced by the early medieval Visio Karoli Grossi br Ring br Against Self br The second round of the seventh circle is the Wood of the Suicides in which the souls of the people who attempted or died by suicide are transformed into gnarled thorny trees and then fed upon by Harpies hideous clawed birds with the faces of women the trees are only permitted to speak when broken and bleeding Dante breaks a twig off one of the trees and from the bleeding trunk hears the tale of Pietro della Vigna a powerful minister of Emperor Frederick II until he fell out of favor and was imprisoned and blinded He subsequently committed suicide his presence here rather than in the Ninth Circle indicates that Dante believes that the accusations made against him were false The Harpies and the characteristics of the bleeding bushes are based on Book of the Aeneid According to Dorothy L Sayers Dante presents the sin of suicide as an insult to the body so here the shades are deprived of even the semblance of the human form As they refused life they remain fixed in a dead and withered sterility They are the image of the self hatred which dries up the very sap of energy and makes all life infertile The trees have also been interpreted as a metaphor for the state of mind in which suicide is committed Dante learns that these suicides unique among the dead will not be corporally resurrected after the Final Judgement since they threw their bodies away instead they will maintain their bushy form with their own corpses hanging from the thorny limbs After Pietro della Vigna finishes his story Dante notices two shades Lano da Siena and Jacopo Sant Andrea race through the wood chased and savagely mauled by ferocious bitches this is the punishment of the violently profligate who possessed by a depraved passion dissipated their goods for the sheer wanton lust of wreckage and disorder The destruction wrought upon the wood by the profligates flight and punishment as they crash through the undergrowth causes further suffering to the suicides who cannot move out of the way br Ring br Against God Art and Nature br The third round of the seventh circle is a great Plain of Burning Sand scorched by great flakes of flame falling slowly down from the sky an image derived from the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah Genesis The Blasphemers the Violent against God are stretched supine upon the burning sand the Sodomites the Violent against Nature run in circles while the Usurers the Violent against Art which is the Grandchild of God as explained in Canto XI crouch huddled and weeping Ciardi writes Blasphemy sodomy and usury are all unnatural and sterile actions thus the unbearing desert is the eternity of these sinners and thus the rain which in nature should be fertile and cool descends as fire Dante finds Capaneus stretched out on the sands for blasphemy against Jove he was struck down with a thunderbolt during the war of the Seven against Thebes and is still scorning Jove in the afterlife The overflow of Phlegethon the river of blood from the first ring flows boiling through the Wood of the Suicides the second ring and crosses the Burning Plain Virgil explains the origin of the rivers of Hell which includes references to the Old Man of Crete br br Protected by the powers of the boiling rivulet Dante and Virgil progress across the burning plain They pass a roving group of Sodomites and Dante to his surprise recognizes Brunetto Latini Dante addresses Brunetto with deep and sorrowful affection paying him the highest tribute offered to any sinner in the Inferno thus refuting suggestions that Dante only placed his enemies in Hell Dante has great respect for Brunetto and feels spiritual indebtedness to him and his works you taught me how man makes himself eternal and while I live my gratitude for that must always be apparent in my words Brunetto prophesies Dante s bad treatment by the Florentines He also identifies other sodomites including Priscian Francesco d Accorso and Bishop Andrea de Mozzi br br The Poets begin to hear the waterfall that plunges over the Great Cliff into the Eighth Circle when three shades break from their company and greet them They are Iacopo Rusticucci Guido Guerra and Tegghiaio Aldobrandi all Florentines much admired by Dante Rusticucci blames his savage wife for his torments The sinners ask for news of Florence and Dante laments the current state of the city At the top of the falls at Virgil s order Dante removes a cord from about his waist and Virgil drops it over the edge as if in answer a large distorted shape swims up through the filthy air of the abyss br br The creature is Geryon the Monster of Fraud Virgil announces that they must fly down from the cliff on the monster s back Dante goes alone to examine the Usurers he does not recognize them but each has a heraldic device emblazoned on a leather purse around his neck On these their streaming eyes appeared to feast The coats of arms indicate that they came from prominent Florentine families they indicate the presence of Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi Ciappo Ubriachi the Paduan Reginaldo degli Scrovegni who predicts that his fellow Paduan Vitaliano di Iacopo Vitaliani will join him here and Giovanni di Buiamonte Dante then rejoins Virgil and both mounted atop Geryon s back the two begin their descent from the great cliff in the Eighth Circle the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious br Geryon the winged monster who allows Dante and Virgil to descend a vast cliff to reach the Eighth Circle was traditionally represented as a giant with three heads and three conjoined bodies Dante s Geryon meanwhile is an image of fraud combining human bestial and reptilian elements Geryon is a monster with the general shape of a wyvern but with the tail of a scorpion hairy arms a gaudily marked reptilian body and the face of a just and honest man The pleasant human face on this grotesque body evokes the insincere fraudster whose intentions behind the face are all monstrous cold blooded and stinging with poison br br Dante now finds himself in the Eighth Circle called Malebolge Evil ditches the upper half of the Hell of the Fraudulent and Malicious The Eighth Circle is a large funnel of stone shaped like an amphitheatre around which run a series of ten deep narrow concentric ditches or trenches called bolge singular bolgia Within these ditches are punished those guilty of Simple Fraud From the foot of the Great Cliff to the Well which forms the neck of the funnel are large spurs of rock like umbrella ribs or spokes which serve as bridges over the ten ditches Dorothy L Sayers writes that the Malebolge is the image of the City in corruption the progressive disintegration of every social relationship personal and public Sexuality ecclesiastical and civil office language ownership counsel authority psychic influence and material interdependence all the media of the community s interchange are perverted and falsified br br Bolgia Panderers and seducers These sinners make two files one along either bank of the ditch and march quickly in opposite directions while being whipped by horned demons for eternity They deliberately exploited the passions of others and so drove them to serve their own interests are themselves driven and scourged Dante makes reference to a recent traffic rule developed for the Jubilee year of in Rome In the group of panderers the poets notice Venedico Caccianemico a Bolognese Black Guelph who sold his own sister Ghisola to the Marchese d Este In the group of seducers Virgil points out Jason the Greek hero who led the Argonauts to fetch the Golden Fleece from Ae tes King of Colchis He gained the help of the king s daughter Medea by seducing and marrying her only to later desert her for Creusa Jason had previously seduced Hypsipyle when the Argonauts landed at Lemnos on their way to Colchis but abandoned her alone and pregnant br Bolgia Flatterers These also exploited other people this time abusing and corrupting language to play upon others desires and fears They are steeped in excrement representative of the false flatteries they told on earth as they howl and fight amongst themselves Alessio Interminei of Lucca and Tha s are seen here br Bolgia Simoniacs Dante now forcefully expresses his condemnation of those who committed simony or the sale of ecclesiastic favors and offices and therefore made money for themselves out of what belongs to God Rapacious ones who take the things of God that ought to be the brides of Righteousness and make them fornicate for gold and silver The time has come to let the trumpet sound for you The sinners are placed head downwards in round tube like holes within the rock debased mockeries of baptismal fonts with flames burning the soles of their feet The heat of the fire is proportioned to their guilt The simile of baptismal fonts gives Dante an incidental opportunity to clear his name of an accusation of malicious damage to the font at the Baptistery of San Giovanni Simon Magus who offered gold in exchange for holy power to Saint Peter and after whom the sin is named is mentioned here although Dante does not encounter him One of the sinners Pope Nicholas III must serve in the hellish baptism by fire from his death in until the arrival in Hell of Pope Boniface VIII who will take his predecessor s place in the stone tube until when he will in turn be replaced by Pope Clement V a puppet of King Philip IV of France who moved the Holy See to Avignon ushering in the Avignon Papacy Dante delivers a denunciation of simoniacal corruption of the Church br Bolgia Sorcerers In the middle of the bridge of the Fourth Bolgia Dante looks down at the souls of fortune tellers diviners astrologers and other false prophets The punishment of those who attempted to usurp God s prerogative by prying into the future is to have their heads twisted around on their bodies in this horrible contortion of the human form these sinners are compelled to walk backwards for eternity blinded by their own tears John Ciardi writes Thus those who sought to penetrate the future cannot even see in front of themselves they attempted to move themselves forward in time so must they go backwards through all eternity and as the arts of sorcery are a distortion of God s law so are their bodies distorted in Hell While referring primarily to attempts to see into the future by forbidden means this also symbolises the twisted nature of magic in general Dante weeps in pity and Virgil rebukes him saying Here pity only lives when it is dead for who can be more impious than he who links God s judgment to passivity Virgil gives a lengthy explanation of the founding of his native city of Mantua Among the sinners in this circle are King Amphiaraus one of the Seven against Thebes foreseeing his death in the war he sought to avert it by hiding from battle but died in an earthquake trying to flee and two Theban soothsayers Tiresias in Ovid s Metamorphoses III Tiresias was transformed into a woman upon striking two coupling serpents with his rod seven years later he was changed back to a man in an identical encounter and his daughter Manto Also in this bolgia are Aruns an Etruscan soothsayer who predicted the Caesar s victory in the Roman civil war in Lucan s Pharsalia I the Greek augur Eurypylus astrologers Michael Scot served at Frederick II s court at Palermo and Guido Bonatti served the court of Guido da Montefeltro and Asdente a shoemaker and soothsayer from Parma Virgil implies that the moon is now setting over the Pillars of Hercules in the West the time is just after a m the dawn of Holy Saturday br Bolgia Barrators Corrupt politicians who made money by trafficking in public offices the political analogue of the simoniacs are immersed in a lake of boiling pitch which represents the sticky fingers and dark secrets of their corrupt deals They are guarded by demons called the Malebranche Evil Claws who tear them to pieces with claws and grappling hooks if they catch them above the surface of the pitch The Poets observe a demon arrive with a grafting Senator of Lucca and throw him into the pitch where the demons set upon him Virgil secures safe conduct from the leader of the Malebranche named Malacoda Evil Tail He informs them that the bridge across the Sixth Bolgia has collapsed as a result of the earthquake that shook Hell at the death of Christ in AD but that there is another path further on He sends a squad of demons led by Barbariccia to escort them safely Based on details in this Canto and if Christ s death is taken to have occurred at exactly noon the time is now a m of Holy Saturday The demons provide some satirical black comedy in the last line of Canto XXI the sign for their march is provided by a fart and he had made a trumpet of his ass br br One of the grafters an unidentified Navarrese identified by early commentators as Ciampolo is seized by the demons and Virgil questions him The sinner speaks of his fellow grafters Friar Gomita a corrupt friar in Gallura eventually hanged by Nino Visconti see Purgatorio VIII for accepting bribes to let prisoners escape and Michele Zanche a corrupt Vicar of Logodoro under King Enzo of Sardinia He offers to lure some of his fellow sufferers into the hands of the demons and when his plan is accepted he escapes back into the pitch Alichino and Calcabrina start a brawl in mid air and fall into the pitch themselves and Barbariccia organizes a rescue party Dante and Virgil take advantage of the confusion to slip away br br Bolgia Hypocrites The Poets escape the pursuing Malebranche by sliding down the sloping bank of the next pit Here they find the hypocrites listlessly walking around a narrow track for eternity weighted down by leaden robes The robes are brilliantly gilded on the outside and are shaped like a monk s habit the hypocrite s outward appearance shines brightly and passes for holiness but under that show lies the terrible weight of his deceit a falsity that weighs them down and makes spiritual progress impossible for them Dante speaks with Catalano dei Malavolti and Loderingo degli Andal two Bolognese brothers of the Jovial Friars an order that had acquired a reputation for not living up to its vows and was eventually disbanded by Papal decree Friar Catalano points out Caiaphas the High Priest of Israel under Pontius Pilate who counseled the Pharisees to crucify Jesus for the public good John He himself is crucified to the floor of Hell by three large stakes and in such a position that every passing sinner must walk upon him he must suffer upon his body the weight of all the world s hypocrisy The Jovial Friars explain to Virgil how he may climb from the pit Virgil discovers that Malacoda lied to him about the bridges over the sixth bolgia br Bolgia Thieves Dante and Virgil leave the bolgia of the Hypocrites by climbing the ruined rocks of a bridge destroyed by the great earthquake after which they cross the bridge of the seventh bolgia to the far side to observe the next chasm The pit is filled with monstrous reptiles the shades of thieves are pursued and bitten by snakes and lizards who curl themselves about the sinners and bind their hands behind their backs The full horror of the thieves punishment is revealed gradually just as they stole other people s substance in life their very identity becomes subject to theft here One sinner who reluctantly identifies himself as Vanni Fucci is bitten by a serpent at the jugular vein bursts into flames and is re formed from the ashes like a phoenix Vanni tells a dark prophecy against Dante br br Vanni hurls an obscenity at God and the serpents swarm over him The centaur Cacus arrives to punish him he has a fire breathing dragon on his shoulders and snakes covering his equine back In Roman mythology Cacus the monstrous fire breathing son of Vulcan was killed by Hercules for raiding the hero s cattle in Aeneid VIII Virgil did not describe him as a centaur Dante then meets five noble thieves of Florence and observes their various transformations Agnello Brunelleschi in human form is merged with the six legged serpent that is Cianfa Donati A figure named Buoso perhaps either Buoso degli Abati or Buoso Donati the latter of whom is mentioned in Inferno XXX first appears as a man but exchanges forms with Francesco de Cavalcanti who bites Buoso in the form of a four footed serpent Puccio Sciancato remains unchanged for the time being br br Bolgia Counsellors of Fraud Dante addresses a passionate lament to Florence before turning to the next bolgia Here fraudulent advisers or evil counsellors move about hidden from view inside individual flames These are not people who gave false advice but people who used their position to advise others to engage in fraud Ulysses and Diomedes are punished together within a great double headed flame they are condemned for the stratagem of the Trojan Horse resulting in the Fall of Troy for persuading Achilles to sail for Troy causing Deidamia to die of grief and for the theft of the sacred statue of Pallas the Palladium upon which it was believed the fate of Troy depended Ulysses the figure in the larger horn of the flame narrates the tale of his last voyage and death a creation of Dante s that illustrates the extent of his own pride despite his condemnation of this principal vice throughout the Divine Comedy Ulysses tells how after his detainment by Circe his love for neither his son his father nor his wife could overpower his desire to set out on the open sea to gain experience of the world and of the vices and the worth of men As they approach the Pillars of Hercules Ulysses urges his crew br Consider well the seed that gave you birth br you were not made to live your lives as brutes br but to be followers of worth and knowledge br br This passage exemplifies the danger of using rhetoric without proper wisdom a failing condemned by several of Dante s most prominent philosophical influences Although Ulysses successfully convinces his crew to venture into the unknown he lacks the wisdom to understand the danger this entails leading to their death in a shipwreck after sighting Mount Purgatory in the Southern Hemisphere br br Dante is approached by Guido da Montefeltro head of the Ghibellines of Romagna asking for news of his country Dante replies with a tragic summary of the current state of the cities of Romagna Guido then recounts his life he advised Pope Boniface VIII to offer a false amnesty to the Colonna family who in had walled themselves inside the castle of Palestrina in the Lateran When the Colonna accepted the terms and left the castle the Pope razed it to the ground and left them without a refuge Guido describes how St Francis founder of the Franciscan order came to take his soul to Heaven only to have a demon assert prior claim Although Boniface had absolved Guido in advance for his evil advice the demon points out the invalidity absolution requires contrition and a man cannot be contrite for a sin at the same time that he is intending to commit it br br Bolgia Sowers of Discord In the ninth bolgia the Sowers of Discord are hacked and mutilated for all eternity by a large demon wielding a bloody sword their bodies are divided as in life their sin was to tear apart what God had intended to be united these are the sinners who are ready to rip up the whole fabric of society to gratify a sectional egotism The souls must drag their ruined bodies around the ditch their wounds healing in the course of the circuit only to have the demon tear them apart anew These are divided into three categories i religious schism and discord ii civil strife and political discord and iii family disunion or discord between kinsmen Chief among the first category is Muhammad the founder of Islam his body is ripped from groin to chin with his entrails hanging out Dante apparently saw Muhammad as causing a schism within Christianity when he and his followers splintered off Dante also condemns Muhammad s son in law Ali for schism between Sunni and Shiite his face is cleft from top to bottom Muhammad tells Dante to warn the schismatic and heretic Fra Dolcino In the second category are Pier da Medicina his throat slit nose slashed off as far as the eyebrows a wound where one of his ears had been the Roman tribune Gaius Scribonius Curio who advised Caesar to cross the Rubicon and thus begin the Civil War his tongue is cut off and Mosca dei Lamberti who incited the Amidei family to kill Buondelmonte dei Buondelmonti resulting in conflict between Guelphs and Ghibellines his arms are hacked off Finally in the third category of sinner Dante sees Bertran de Born The knight carries his severed head by its own hair swinging it like a lantern Bertran is said to have caused a quarrel between Henry II of England and his son Prince Henry the Young King his punishment in Hell is decapitation since dividing father and son is like severing the head from the body br br Bolgia Falsifiers The final bolgia of the Eighth Circle is home to various sorts of falsifiers A disease on society they are themselves afflicted with different types of afflictions horrible diseases stench thirst filth darkness and screaming Some lie prostrate while others run hungering through the pit tearing others to pieces Shortly before their arrival in this pit Virgil indicates that it is approximately noon of Holy Saturday and he and Dante discuss one of Dante s kinsmen Geri de Bello among the Sowers of Discord in the previous ditch The first category of falsifiers Dante encounters are the Alchemists Falsifiers of Things He speaks with two spirits viciously scrubbing and clawing at their leprous scabs Griffolino d Arezzo an alchemist who extracted money from the foolish Alberto da Siena on the promise of teaching him to fly Alberto s reputed father the Bishop of Siena had Griffolino burned at the stake and Capocchio burned at the stake at Siena in for practicing alchemy br br Suddenly two spirits Gianni Schicchi de Cavalcanti and Myrrha both punished as Imposters Falsifiers of Persons run rabid through the pit Schicchi sinks his teeth into the neck of an alchemist Capocchio and drags him away like prey Griffolino explains how Myrrha disguised herself to commit incest with her father King Cinyras while Schicchi impersonated the dead Buoso Donati to dictate a will giving himself several profitable bequests Dante then encounters Master Adam of Brescia one of the Counterfeiters Falsifiers of Money for manufacturing Florentine florins of rather than carat gold he was burned at the stake in He is punished by a loathsome dropsy like disease which gives him a bloated stomach prevents him from moving and an eternal unbearable thirst Master Adam points out two sinners of the fourth class the Perjurers Falsifiers of Words These are Potiphar s wife punished for her false accusation of Joseph in Genesis and Sinon the Achaean spy who lied to the Trojans to convince them to take the Trojan Horse into their city Aeneid II Sinon is here rather than in Bolgia because his advice was false as well as evil Both suffer from a burning fever Master Adam and Sinon exchange abuse which Dante watches until he is rebuked by Virgil As a result of his shame and repentance Dante is forgiven by his guide Sayers remarks that the descent through Malebolge began with the sale of the sexual relationship and went on to the sale of Church and State now the very money is itself corrupted every affirmation has become perjury and every identity a lie so that every aspect of social interaction has been progressively destroyed br br Dante and Virgil approach the Central Well at the bottom of which lies the Ninth and final Circle of Hell The classical and biblical Giants who perhaps symbolize pride and other spiritual flaws lying behind acts of treachery stand perpetual guard inside the well pit their legs embedded in the banks of the Ninth Circle while their upper halves rise above the rim and are visible from the Malebolge Dante initially mistakes them for great towers of a city Among the Giants Virgil identifies Nimrod who tried to build the Tower of Babel he shouts out the unintelligible Raph l mai am cche zab almi Ephialtes who with his brother Otus tried to storm Olympus during the Gigantomachy he has his arms chained up and Briareus who Dante claimed had challenged the gods and Tityos and Typhon who insulted Jupiter Also here is Antaeus who did not join in the rebellion against the Olympian gods and therefore is not chained At Virgil s persuasion Antaeus takes the poets in his large palm and lowers them gently to the final level of Hell br br At the base of the well Dante finds himself within a large frozen lake Cocytus the Ninth Circle of Hell Trapped in the ice each according to his guilt are punished sinners guilty of treachery against those with whom they had special relationships The lake of ice is divided into four concentric rings or rounds of traitors corresponding in order of seriousness to betrayal of family ties betrayal of community ties betrayal of guests and betrayal of lords This is in contrast to the popular image of Hell as fiery as Ciardi writes The treacheries of these souls were denials of love which is God and of all human warmth Only the remorseless dead center of the ice will serve to express their natures As they denied God s love so are they furthest removed from the light and warmth of His Sun As they denied all human ties so are they bound only by the unyielding ice This final deepest level of hell is reserved for traitors betrayers and oathbreakers its most famous inmate is Judas Iscariot br br Round Caina this round is named after Cain who killed his own brother in the first act of murder Genesis This round houses the Traitors to their Kindred they have their necks and heads out of the ice and are allowed to bow their heads allowing some protection from the freezing wind Here Dante sees the brothers Alessandro and Napoleone degli Alberti who killed each other over their inheritance and their politics some time between and Camiscion de Pazzi a Ghibelline who murdered his kinsman Ubertino identifies several other sinners Mordred traitorous son of King Arthur Vanni de Cancellieri nicknamed Focaccia a White Guelph of Pistoia who killed his cousin Detto de Cancellieri and Sassol Mascheroni of the noble Toschi family of Florence murdered a relative Camiscion is aware that in July his relative Carlino de Pazzi would accept a bribe to surrender the Castle of Piantravigne to the Blacks betraying the Whites As a traitor to his party Carlino belongs in Antenora the next circle down his greater sin will make Camiscion look virtuous by comparison br Round Antenora the second round is named after Antenor a Trojan soldier who betrayed his city to the Greeks Here lie the Traitors to their Country those who committed treason against political entities parties cities or countries have their heads above the ice but they cannot bend their necks Dante accidentally kicks the head of Bocca degli Abati a traitorous Guelph of Florence and then proceeds to treat him more savagely than any other soul he has thus far met Also punished in this level are Buoso da Duera Ghibelline leader bribed by the French to betray Manfred King of Naples Tesauro dei Beccheria a Ghibelline of Pavia beheaded by the Florentine Guelphs for treason in Gianni de Soldanieri noble Florentine Ghibelline who joined with the Guelphs after Manfred s death in Ganelon betrayed the rear guard of Charlemagne to the Muslims at Roncesvalles according to the French epic poem The Song of Roland and Tebaldello de Zambrasi of Faenza a Ghibelline who turned his city over to the Bolognese Guelphs on Nov The Poets then see two heads frozen in one hole one gnawing the nape of the other s neck The gnawing sinner tells his story he is Count Ugolino and the head he gnaws belongs to Archbishop Ruggieri In the most pathetic and dramatic passage of the Inferno Ugolino describes how he conspired with Ruggieri in to oust his nephew Nino Visconti and take control over the Guelphs of Pisa However as soon as Nino was gone the Archbishop sensing the Guelphs weakened position turned on Ugolino and imprisoned him with his sons and grandsons in the Torre dei Gualandi In March the Archbishop condemned the prisoners to death by starvation in the tower br Round Ptolomaea the third region of Cocytus is named after Ptolemy who invited his father in law Simon Maccabaeus and his sons to a banquet and then killed them Maccabees Traitors to their Guests lie supine in the ice while their tears freeze in their eye sockets sealing them with small visors of crystal even the comfort of weeping is denied to them Dante encounters Fra Alberigo one of the Jovial Friars and a native of Faenza who asks Dante to remove the visor of ice from his eyes In Alberigo invited his opponents Manfred his brother and Alberghetto Manfred s son to a banquet at which his men murdered the dinner guests He explains that often a living person s soul falls to Ptolomea before he dies before dark Atropos has cut their thread Then on earth a demon inhabits the body until the body s natural death Fra Alberigo s sin is identical in kind to that of Branca d Oria a Genoese Ghibelline who in invited his father in law Michele Zanche seen in the Eighth Circle Bolgia and had him cut to pieces Branca that is his earthly body did not die until but his soul together with that of his nephew who assisted in his treachery fell to Ptolomaea before Zanche s soul arrived at the bolgia of the Barrators Dante leaves without keeping his promise to clear Fra Alberigo s eyes of ice And yet I did not open them for him and it was courtesy to show him rudeness br Round Judecca the fourth division of Cocytus named for Judas Iscariot contains the Traitors to their Lords and benefactors Upon entry into this round Virgil says Vexilla regis prodeunt inferni The banners of the King of Hell draw closer Judecca is completely silent all of the sinners are fully encapsulated in ice distorted and twisted in every conceivable position The sinners present an image of utter immobility it is impossible to talk with any of them so Dante and Virgil quickly move on to the centre of Hell br br In the very centre of Hell condemned for committing the ultimate sin personal treachery against God is the Devil referred to by Virgil as Dis the Roman god of the underworld the name Dis was often used for Pluto in antiquity such as in Virgil s Aeneid The arch traitor Lucifer was once held by God to be fairest of the angels before his pride led him to rebel against God resulting in his expulsion from Heaven Lucifer is a giant terrifying beast trapped waist deep in the ice fixed and suffering He has three faces each a different color one red the middle one a pale yellow the right and one black the left br br Dorothy L Sayers notes that Satan s three faces are thought by some to suggest his control over the three human races black for the African the race of Ham yellow for the Asiatic the race of Shem and red for the Europeans the race of Japheth All interpretations recognize that the three faces represent a fundamental perversion of the Trinity Satan is impotent ignorant and full of hate in contrast to the all powerful all knowing and all loving nature of God Lucifer retains his six wings but these are now dark bat like and futile the icy wind that emanates from the beating of Lucifer s wings only further ensures his imprisonment in the frozen lake He weeps from his six eyes and his tears mix with bloody froth and pus as they pour down his three chins Each face has a mouth that chews eternally on a prominent traitor Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus dangle with their feet in the left and right mouths respectively for their involvement in the assassination of Julius Caesar BC an act which to Dante represented the destruction of a unified Italy and the killing of the man who was divinely appointed to govern the world In the central most vicious mouth is Judas Iscariot the apostle who betrayed Christ Judas is receiving the most horrifying torture of the three traitors his head is gnawed inside Lucifer s mouth while his back is forever flayed and shredded by Lucifer s claws According to Dorothy L Sayers Just as Judas figures treason against God so Brutus and Cassius figure treason against Man in Society or we may say that we have here the images of treason against the Divine and the Secular government of the world br At about p m on Saturday Virgil and Dante begin their escape from Hell by clambering down Satan s ragged fur feet first When they reach Satan s genitalia the poets pass through the centre of the universe and of gravity from the Northern Hemisphere of land to the Southern Hemisphere of water When Virgil changes direction and begins to climb upward towards the surface of the Earth at the antipodes Dante in his confusion initially believes they are returning to Hell Virgil indicates that the time is halfway between the canonical hours of Prime a m and Terce a m that is a m of the same Holy Saturday which was just about to end Dante is confused as to how after about an hour and a half of climbing it is now apparently morning Virgil explains that it is as a result of passing through the Earth s centre into the Southern Hemisphere which is twelve hours ahead of Jerusalem the central city of the Northern Hemisphere where therefore it is currently p m br Virgil goes on to explain how the Southern Hemisphere was once covered with dry land but the land recoiled in horror to the north when Lucifer fell from Heaven and was replaced by the ocean Meanwhile the inner rock Lucifer displaced as he plunged into the centre of the earth rushed upwards to the surface of the Southern Hemisphere to avoid contact with him forming the Mountain of Purgatory This mountain the only land mass in the waters of the Southern Hemisphere rises above the surface at a point directly opposite Jerusalem The poets then ascend a narrow chasm of rock through the space contained between the floor formed by the convex side of Cocytus and the underside of the earth above moving in opposition to Lethe the river of oblivion which flows down from the summit of Mount Purgatory The poets finally emerge just before dawn on the morning of Easter Sunday March or April beneath
