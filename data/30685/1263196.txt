Dark fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy literary artistic and cinematic works that incorporates disturbing and frightening themes It often combines fantasy with elements of horror possessing a dark and gloomy tone or a gothic atmosphere of dread br br A strict definition for dark fantasy is difficult to pin down Gertrude Barrows Bennett has been called the woman who invented dark fantasy Both Charles L Grant and Karl Edward Wagner are credited with having coined the term dark fantasy although both authors were describing different styles of fiction Brian Stableford argues dark fantasy can be usefully defined as subgenre of stories that attempt to incorporate elements of horror fiction into the standard formulae of fantasy stories Stableford also suggests that supernatural horror set primarily in the real world is a form of contemporary fantasy whereas supernatural horror set partly or wholly in secondary worlds should be described as dark fantasy br Additionally other authors critics and publishers have adopted dark fantasy to describe various other works However these stories rarely share universal similarities beyond supernatural occurrences and a dark often brooding tone As a result dark fantasy cannot be solidly connected to a defining set of tropes The term itself may refer collectively to tales that are either horror based or fantasy based br Some writers also use dark fantasy or Gothic fantasy as an alternative description to horror because they feel the latter term is too lurid or vivid br br Charles L Grant is often cited as having coined the term dark fantasy Grant defined his brand of dark fantasy as a type of horror story in which humanity is threatened by forces beyond human understanding He often used dark fantasy as an alternative to horror as horror was increasingly associated with more visceral works br Dark fantasy is sometimes also used to describe stories told from a monster s point of view or that present a more sympathetic view of supernatural beings usually associated with horror Anne Rice s The Vampire Chronicles Chelsea Quinn Yarbro s Saint Germain and Neil Gaiman s The Sandman are early examples of this style of dark fantasy This is in contrast to the traditional horror model which focuses more on the victims and survivors br In a more general sense dark fantasy is occasionally used as a synonym for supernatural horror to distinguish horror stories that contain elements of the supernatural from those that do not For example a story about a werewolf or vampire could be described as dark fantasy while a story about a serial killer would simply be horror br Stableford suggests that the type of horror conveyed by fantasy stories such as William Beckford s Vathek and Edgar Allan Poe s The Masque of the Red Death is more aesthetic than visceral or existential and that such stories should be considered dark fantasies rather than the supernaturalized thrillers of conventional horror fiction br Karl Edward Wagner is often credited for creating the term dark fantasy when used in a more fantasy based context Wagner used it to describe his fiction about the Gothic warrior Kane Since then dark fantasy has sometimes been applied to sword and sorcery and high fantasy fiction that features anti heroic or morally ambiguous protagonists Another good example under this definition of dark fantasy is Michael Moorcock s saga of the albino swordsman Elric br The fantasy work of H P Lovecraft Clark Ashton Smith and their emulators have been specified as dark fantasy since the imaginary worlds they depicted contain many horror elements br Dark fantasy is occasionally used to describe fantasy works by authors whom the public primarily associates with the horror genre Examples of these are Stephen King s The Dark Tower series Peter Straub s Shadowland and Clive Barker s Weaveworld Alternatively dark fantasy is sometimes used for darker fiction written by authors best known for other styles of fantasy Raymond Feist s Faerie Tale and Charles de Lint s novels written as Samuel M Key would fit here br Roald Dahl s novel The Witches and its film adaptations is described as dark fantasy Dahl s poetic reworking of Cinderella which features in his poetry collection Revolting Rhymes sees him upend the happy tale br br Berserk a manga and anime franchise by Kentaro Miura that debuted in is frequently noted as an example of the genre due to its depictions of extreme violence moral ambiguity apocalyptic storylines and anti hero protagonists br Attack on Titan is a dark fantasy for its intense violence and the dystopian world it takes place in br br Ridley Scott s film Legend has been described as a dark fairy tale fantasy film Guillermo del Toro s fantasy film Pan s Labyrinth has been described as a sort of a dark spin on Alice in Wonderland br br The fantasy action role playing game Dragon s Crown contains many elements of dark fantasy such as werewolves vampires zombies homonculi and human monster hybrids br Modern games from Japanese game development and publishing company FromSoftware are lauded as exceptional representations of the dark fantasy genre notably the Dark Souls
