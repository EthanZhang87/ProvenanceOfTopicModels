A nymph Ancient Greek romanized n mph Attic Greek n mp sometimes spelled nymphe is a minor female nature deity in ancient Greek folklore Distinct from other Greek goddesses nymphs are generally regarded as personifications of nature they are typically tied to a specific place landform or tree and are usually depicted as maidens Because of their association with springs they were often seen as having healing properties other divine powers of the nymphs included divination and shapeshifting Nymphs like other goddesses were immortal except for the Hamadryads whose lives were bound to a specific tree br Nymphs are divided into various broad subgroups based on their habitat such as the Meliae ash tree nymphs the Dryads oak tree nymphs the Alseids grove nymphs the Naiads or Hydriads spring nymphs the Nereids sea nymphs the Oceanids ocean nymphs the Oreads mountain nymphs and the Epimeliads apple tree and flock nymphs Other nymphs included the Hesperides evening nymphs the Hyades rain nymphs and the Pleiades companions of Artemis br Nymphs featured in classic works of art literature and mythology They are often attendants of goddesses and frequently occur in myths with a love motif being the lovers of heroes and other deities Desirable and promiscuous nymphs can rarely be fully domesticated being often aggressive to their mortal affairs Since the Middle Ages nymphs have been sometimes popularly associated or even confused with fairies br br br Etymology br br The Greek word n mph has the primary meaning of young woman bride young wife but is not usually associated with deities in particular Yet the etymology of the noun n mph remains uncertain The Doric and Aeolic Homeric form is n mph br Modern usage more often applies to young women contrasting with parthenos a virgin of any age and generically as kore maiden girl The term is sometimes used by women to address each other and remains the regular Modern Greek term for bride br br br Ancient Greek mythology br br Nymphs were sometimes beloved by many and dwelt in specific areas related to the natural environment e g mountainous regions forests springs Other nymphs were part of the retinue of a god such as Dionysus Hermes or Pan or of a goddess generally the huntress Artemis br The Greek nymphs were also spirits invariably bound to places not unlike the Latin genius loci and sometimes this produced complicated myths like the cult of Arethusa to Sicily In some of the works of the Greek educated Latin poets the nymphs gradually absorbed into their ranks the indigenous Italian divinities of springs and streams Juturna Egeria Carmentis Fontus while the Lymphae originally Lumpae Italian water goddesses owing to the accidental similarity of their names could be identified with the Greek Nymphae The classical mythologies of the Roman poets were unlikely to have affected the rites and cults of individual nymphs venerated by country people in the springs and clefts of Latium Among the Roman literate class their sphere of influence was restricted and they appear almost exclusively as divinities of the watery element br br br Greek folk religion br The ancient Greek belief in nymphs survived in many parts of the country into the early years of the twentieth century when they were usually known as nereids Nymphs often tended to frequent areas distant from humans but could be encountered by lone travelers outside the village where their music might be heard and the traveler could spy on their dancing or bathing in a stream or pool either during the noon heat or in the middle of the night They might appear in a whirlwind Such encounters could be dangerous bringing dumbness besotted infatuation madness or stroke to the unfortunate man When parents believed their child to be nereid struck they would pray to Saint Artemidos br br br Nymphs and fairies br Nymphs are often depicted in classic works across art literature mythology and fiction They are often associated with the medieval romances or Renaissance literature of the elusive fairies or elves br br br Sleeping nymph br br A motif that entered European art during the Renaissance was the idea of a statue of a nymph sleeping in a grotto or spring This motif supposedly came from an Italian report of a Roman sculpture of a nymph at a fountain above the River Danube The report and an accompanying poem supposedly on the fountain describing the sleeping nymph are now generally concluded to be a fifteenth century forgery but the motif proved influential among artists and landscape gardeners for several centuries after with copies seen at neoclassical gardens such as the grotto at Stourhead br br br List br All the names for various classes of nymphs have plural feminine adjectives most agreeing with the substantive numbers and groups of nymphai There is no single adopted classification that could be seen as canonical and exhaustive Some classes of nymphs tend to overlap which
