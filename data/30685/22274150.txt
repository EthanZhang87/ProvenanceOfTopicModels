Moore and Douglas Gresham Steven Knight wrote the script following a draft by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely Richard Taylor Isis Mussenden and Howard Berger continued their roles working on the production design and practical effects while visual effects supervisor Jim Rygiel composer David Arnold and cinematographer Dante Spinotti are newcomers to the series The film was officially budgeted at million although some estimates put the cost at million br br When Apted signed on to direct The Voyage of the Dawn Treader in June filming was set to begin in January for a May release date Shooting would have begun in Malta and then moved to Prague and Iceland A few months later Disney announced that in consideration of the challenging schedules for its young actors they were delaying the release date to May and filming was moved to October Johnson rescheduled the shoot to Playas de Rosarito Baja California Mexico where two thirds of the film would be shot at the water tank that was used for Titanic and Master and Commander The Far Side of the World Filming was also scheduled for Australia Disney and Walden eventually grew concerned over safety in Mexico and Australian officials at Warner Roadshow Studios in Queensland offered to become the project s base for the whole shoot br Disney announced on December that it would no longer co produce the film Disney and Walden disputed over the budget after the box office performance of Prince Caspian grossed far less than The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Disney wanted to limit it to million whereas Walden wanted a million budget of which Disney would only need to provide half Another reason why Disney opted not to produce the film was that they feared the budget would only grow during filming and post production The Los Angeles Times also reported creative differences led to the split Times columnist Mary McNamara noted that Disney leaving the series could be a mistake because Voyage is the most popular Narnia book while Caspian was the series least popular and did not create the anticipation surrounding the first film Walden began searching for a new distributor for the film Several other studios including Sony s Columbia Pictures Universal Pictures Paramount Pictures Warner Bros and th Century Fox were in negotiations to distribute the film although several markets already predicted that Fox would take over br It was announced in January that th Century Fox would replace Walt Disney Pictures as the distributor while Disney would still retain the rights for the first two Fox had pursued the Narnia film rights in and distributed various other Walden projects Producer Mark Johnson admitted that we made some mistakes with Prince Caspian and I don t want to make them again He said it was very important that filmmakers regain the magic for Dawn Treader br br br Writing br Michael Petroni was hired to rewrite the script with Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely following a draft written by Richard LaGravenese and Steven Knight The previous two films have been described as remaining more faithful to the original stories than the third installment Apted noted the episodic and disconnected nature of the story would need to be revised for a film version such as the material involving the Dark Island the Sea Serpent and Eustace They even discussed combining The Voyage of the Dawn Treader with The Silver Chair much as the BBC combined Dawn Treader and Prince Caspian in its television serial As a result some elements were borrowed from The Silver Chair where Narnians are held hostage and rescued The author s estate did not initially receive the change well but it gained favor after review br Eustace has a greater role as a dragon in the film he proceeds as a dragon with the ship to the next islands and proves to be a valuable asset for the crew for the remainder of the voyage This allows the character to take a major part in the action beyond mere work duty on the ship as in the book The filmmakers felt that the book s description of Eustace s stream of consciousness as he realizes that he had become a dragon while sleeping was effective as text but that it could not easily be translated onto film though the BBC version did exactly that Further the film omits a noted passage from the book where Aslan peels Eustace s dragon skin off in layers Walden President Micheal Flaherty remarked that people don t earn grace they receive it once they are humbled and aware of their need The film also omits the passage describing Eustace discovering the old dragon who dies next to its hoard in the valley br br br Filming br Ernie Malik a unit publicist for the film confirmed that filming began on July on location in Queensland Australia Filming took place at Village Roadshow Studios in August and September with filming of exterior shots on board the ship at Cleveland Point and the Gold Coast Seaway in September Apted stated that fellow directors Gore Verbinski and Peter Weir recommended him not to shoot on water so they built a giant Dawn Treader on a gimbal at which allowed it to rock and shift as if on the high seas At the end of the town s peninsula jutting into Moreton Bay the tonne ton boat could be rotated through degrees to keep the sun angles consistent Additional shots were taken at the Southport School also located on the Gold Coast It was also filmed around White Island off the coast of Tauranga New Zealand br br br Effects br br special effects shots were made for The Voyage of the Dawn Treader more than The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe s and fewer than Prince Caspian s shots Angus Bickerton served as the lead visual effects supervisor of the film while Jim Rygiel who supervised the effects on The Lord of the Rings film trilogy worked as the senior visual effects supervisor British visual effects companies the Moving Picture Company Framestore CFC and The Senate VFX were hired to create the visual effects alongside Cinesite and The Mill Moving Picture worked on the dragon Eustace and the Dawn Treader They say the dragon is amongst the most heroic characters ever created and is scheduled to be featured in around shots of the movie They also revised Reepicheep from the previous film by saturating his color giving him bushier eyebrows and ear hair and making his whiskers a little more wiry just to give him a sense of age Framestore also revised Aslan changing his color palette to be a more realistic lion than a golden lion and adding a darker mane they also created different dufflepuds to replace Jonathan Fawkner and Angus Bickerton running around first as dufflepuds on the set The Senate worked on the opening shot of King s College Cambridge as well as the star effect on Liliandil at Ramandu s Island Cinesite worked on the Dark Island and Fugitive Studios did the end titles and credits which featured original drawings created by Pauline Baynes for the Narnia books These illustrations were included because the film s creators wanted the credits to have visual interest and also because they wished to include an acknowledgment to Pauline Baynes who died in August

it is the first Narnia film to have a D release Walden had previous experience creating D films having released James Cameron s documentaries Ghosts of the Abyss and Aliens of the Deep as well as Journey to the Center of the Earth with New Line Cinema The filmmakers initially discussed shooting the film in D during principal photography but later decided to shoot in two dimensional cameras to save on costs Prime Focus Group was hired in June to convert the film to D during post production Film director Joe Dante remarked that Apted was at first skeptical about the conversion stating If I was gonna do a D movie I would have done it differently Later he remarked that he was excited after seeing progress during the conversion Dawn Treader was his first D film Johnson later said that the reason for the film s D release was to help Dawn Treader at the box office where it would compete with films such as Tangled Tron Legacy and Yogi Bear which were released in D br br br Music br br

mixed reviews upon release Will Wilson writing for the mobile gaming website Pocket Gamer gave a mixed review stating that The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a solid movie tie in that doesn t desecrate the license and will please fans but it doesn t offer up anything to get pulses racing either br br br Release br The Voyage of the Dawn Treader held its world premiere on November in London at the

on December and in North America and Europe on December br br br Critical reception br The Voyage of the Dawn Treader was met with mixed reviews from critics Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that of critics gave the film a positive review based on a sample of reviews with a rating average of The consensus reads Its leisurely businesslike pace won t win the franchise many new fans but Voyage of the Dawn Treader restores some of the Narnia franchise s lost luster with strong performances and impressive special effects On Metacritic which assigns a weighted mean rating from film critics the film has a rating score of based on reviews indicating mixed to average reviews CinemaScore polls conducted during the opening weekend revealed the average grade cinemagoers gave the film an A on an A to F scale br Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times praised the film and gave it three stars out of four saying This is a rip snorting adventure fantasy for families especially the younger members who are not insistent on continuity Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave it a three stars out of four he remarked it is a worthy challenger to the far more popular Harry Potter pictures The Guardian gave the film a positive review They stated that the film arrives with confidence and bravado intact and arguably the most Tolkien esque of the Narnia books IGN was positive stating The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is a solid sequel that might even surpass the first entry as the best in the series for some fans It also bodes well for the future of this once iffy franchise br Several film critics have praised Apted s direction in character development and Poulter s performance as Eustace Among them The Arizona Republic s Kerry Lengel said The best thing about the film is neither the top notch CGI nor the shallow moral lessons but the performance of Georgie Henley as Lucy as well as the performance of her and Edmund s insufferable cousin Eustace Scrubb Luke Y Thompson from E Online praised the performances stating Henley and Keynes are charming as ever and Poulter s turn as Eustace injects a welcome note of comedic cynicism into the sea of sentimentality Simon Pegg ably succeeds Eddie Izzard as mouse warrior Reepicheep Bille Brown s sorcerer Coriakin has a fun performance and a sequence in which Lucy inadvertently wishes her life away is brilliantly disorienting and nightmarish br Despite the movie adaptation of the book to appeal to the everyman and not just to Christian audiences and Lewis fans with the introduction of the search for the seven swords side plot the continued reoccurrence of the White Queen and the larger role for the dragon Eustace Christian reviewers found much to like about the movie The key for many was the closing scene with Lucy and Aslan in which Aslan assures a sobbing Lucy that he s very much in her world where he has another name and that This was the very reason why Lucy was brought to Narnia that by knowing Aslan here for a little she may know him better there This was in direct contradiction to the first two Narnia movies in which Christian reviewers felt that the director failed to grasp and accurately reproduce key sections and overriding themes from The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian br br br Commercial analysis br Brandon Gray of Box Office Mojo stated There certainly will be an audience for this picture I just don t think it is going to restore the franchise to its former glory He added that the film would be considered a relative success if it made anything close to Prince Caspian s box office numbers which would increase the likelihood of further Narnia films br br Mark Johnson the producer of the Narnia films later remarked that Prince Caspian had strayed from its core audience referring to the Christian and family audience who catapulted The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe to the top at the box office Tom Rothman co chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment remarked We think this is a tremendously undervalued asset we believe there is great life in the franchise He feels the film is not just a single motion picture but a re launch of a movie series that still has long term potential He commented that Fox and Walden had engaged in talks about further potential Narnia films though such discussions were made before the opening of Dawn Treader br br br Box office
