There is some evidence that in addition to being a writing system runes historically served purposes of magic This is the case from the earliest epigraphic evidence of the Roman to the Germanic Iron Age with non linguistic inscriptions and the alu word An erilaz appears to have been a person versed in runes including their magic applications br In medieval sources notably the Poetic Edda the Sigrdr fum l mentions victory runes to be carved on a sword some on the grasp and some on the inlay and name Tyr twice br In the early modern period and modern history related folklore and superstition is recorded in the form of the Icelandic magical staves In the early th century Germanic mysticism coined new forms of runic magic some of which were continued or developed further by contemporary adherents of Germanic Neopaganism Modern systems of runic divination are based on Hermeticism classical Occultism and the I Ching br br br Historical evidence br br br Tacitus br Historically it is known that the Germanic peoples used various forms of divination and means of reading omens Tacitus Germania gives a detailed account AD br br They attach the highest importance to the taking of auspices and casting lots Their usual procedure with the lot is simple They cut off a branch from a nut bearing tree and slice it into strips these they mark with different signs and throw them at random onto a white cloth Then the state s priest if it is an official consultation or the father of the family in a private one offers prayer to the gods and looking up towards heaven picks up three strips one at a time and according to which sign they have previously been marked with makes his interpretation If the lots forbid an undertaking there is no deliberation that day about the matter in question If they allow it further confirmation is required by taking auspices br br It is often debated whether signs refers specifically to runes or to other marks both interpretations are plausible and Tacitus does not give enough detail for a definite decision to be made br br br Epigraphy br br The Ansuz and Tiwaz runes in particular seem to have had magical significance in the early Elder Futhark period The Sigrdr fum l instruction of name Tyr twice is reminiscent of the double or triple stacked Tyr bindrunes found e g on Seeland II C or the Lindholm amulet in the aaaaaaaazzznnn b muttt sequence which besides stacked Tyr involves multiple repetition of Ansuz but also triple occurrence of Algiz and Naudiz br Many inscriptions also have apparently meaningless utterances interpreted as magical chants such as tuwatuwa Vadstena bracteate aaduaaaliia DR BR or g g og Undley bracteate g ag ag a Kragehul I br Alu is a charm word appearing on numerous artifacts found in Central and Northern Europe dating from the Germanic Iron Age The word is the most common of the early runic charm words and can appear either alone or as part of an apparent formula The origin and meaning of the word are matters of dispute though a general agreement exists among scholars that the word either represents amulet magic or is a metaphor or metonym for it br A few Viking Age rings with runic inscriptions of apparently magical nature were found among them the Kingmoor Ring The phrase runes of power is found on two runestones in Sweden DR from Stentoften and DR from Bj rketorp Runestones with curses include DR in Skjern DR in S nder Vinge DR in Glavendrup DR from Tryggev lde DR in Glemminge and Vg in Saleby br br br Medieval sources br The most prolific source for runic magic in the Poetic Edda is the Sigrdr fum l where the valkyrie Sigrdr fa Brynhild presents Sigurd with a memory draught of ale that had been charmed with gladness runes stanza br br She goes on to give advice on the magical runes in seven further stanzas In all instances the runes are used for actual magic apotropaic or ability enhancing spells rather than for divination br br victory runes to be carved on the sword hilt stanza presumably referring to the t rune named for Tyr br lrunar Ale runes stanza a protective spell against being bewitched by means of ale served by the host s wife naudiz is to be marked on one s fingernails and laukaz on the cup br biargrunar birth runes stanza a spell to facilitate childbirth br brimrunar wave runes stanza a spell for the protection of ships with runes to be carved on the stem and on the rudder br limrunar branch runes stanza a healing spell the runes to be carved on trees with boughs to the eastward bent br malrunar speech runes stanza the stanza is corrupt but apparently referred to a spell to improve one s rhetorical ability at the thing br hugrunar thought runes stanza the stanza is incomplete but clearly discussed a spell to improve one s wit br The Poetic Edda also seems to corroborate the magical significance of the runes the H vam l where Odin mentions runes in contexts of divination of healing and of necromancy trans Bellows br br Certain is that which is sought from runes That the gods so great have made And the Master Poet painted br Of runes heard I words nor were counsels wanting At the hall of Hor br Grass cures the scab and runes the sword cut br Runes shalt thou find and fateful signs br if high on a tree I see a hanged man swing So do I write and color the runes That forth he fares And to me talks br Other oft cited sources for the practice of runic divination are chapter of Snorri Sturluson s Ynglinga Saga where Granmar the king of S dermanland travels to the Temple at Uppsala for the seasonal bl t There the chips fell in a way that said that he would not live long F ll honum svo sp nn sem hann mundi eigi lengi lifa br Another source is in the Vita Ansgari the biography of Ansgar the Archbishop of Hamburg Bremen which was written by a monk named Rimbert Rimbert details the custom of casting lots by the pagan Norse chapters The chips and the lots however can be explained respectively as a bl tsp nn sacrificial chip and a hlauttein lot twig which according to Foote and Wilson would be marked possibly with sacrificial blood shaken and thrown down like dice and their positive or negative significance then decided br Egils Saga features several incidents of runic magic The most celebrated is the scene where Egil discovers and destroys a poisoned drink prepared for him by cutting his hand and cutting runes on the drinking horn and painting the runes with blood While the motif of blood painted runes also appears in other examples of early Norse literature it is uncertain whether the practice of painting runes with blood is merely a literary invention or whether it had precedence in magical practice br br br Modern systems br br In the th century Hermeticist and Rosicrucian Johannes Bureus having been inspired by visions developed a Runic system based on the Kaballah and the Futhark which he called the Adulruna br The Armanen runes revealed to Guido von List in were employed for magical purposes in Germanic mysticism by authors such as Friedrich Bernhard Marby and Siegfried Adolf Kummer and after World War II in a reformed pansophical system by Karl Spiesberger More recently Stephen Flowers Adolf Schleipfer Larry E Camp and others also build on List s system br Several modern systems of runic magic and runic divination were published from the s onward The first book on runic divination written by Ralph Blum in led to the development of sets of runes designed for use in several such systems of fortune telling in which the runes are typically incised in clay stone tiles crystals resin glass or polished stones then either selected one by one from a closed bag or thrown down at random for reading br Later authors such as Diana L Paxson and Freya Aswynn follow Blum in drawing a direct correlation between runic divination and tarot divination They may discuss runes in the context of spreads and advocate the usage of rune cards br Modern authors like Ralph Blum sometimes include a blank rune in their sets Some were to replace a lost rune but according to Ralph Blum this was the god Odin s rune the rune of the beginning and the end representing the divine in all human transactions br br br Ralph Blum br In a modern usage of the runes for answering life s questions was apparently originated by Ralph Blum in his divination book The Book of Runes A Handbook for the Use of an Ancient Oracle which was marketed with a small bag of round tiles with runes stamped on them This book has remained in print since its first publication The sources for Blum s divinatory interpretations as he explained in The Book of Runes itself drew heavily on then current books describing the ancient I Ching divination system of China br Each of Blum s seven books on runic divination deals with a specialized area of life or a varied technique for reading runes br br The Book of Runes A Handbook for the Use of an Ancient Oracle The Viking

wake of a dissertation on Runes and Magic Stephen Flowers published a series of books under the pen name Edred Thorsson which detailed his own original method of runic divination and magic odianism

developed in the s by Friedrich Marby under the name of Rune Yoga also Runic Yoga Stadhagaldr br br br Stephan Grundy br In Stephan Grundy a k a Kveldulf Gundarsson described runic magic as the active principle as opposed to passive interpretations based on runic divination He held that runic magic is more active than the allegedly shamanic practice of seid practiced by the Sei kona Runic magic he states uses the runes to affect the world outside based on the archetypes they represent br Most of Gundarsson s runic magic entails being in possession of a physical entity that is engraved with any or all of the individual runes or staves so as to practically work with their energies The individual runes are reddened with either blood dyes or paints The act of possessing the stave in its final form serves the purpose of affecting the world of form with the rune might of that particular stave After use the staves are discarded or destroyed br Gundarsson holds that each rune has a certain sound to it to be chanted or sung the sound has in common the phonetic value by which it is represented This act of singing or chanting is supposed to have more or less the same effect of using the staves in their physical form br br br Other br Nigel Pennick proposes Germanic Runic Astrology in publications such as Runic Astrology Starcraft and Timekeeping in the Northern Tradition ISBN br
