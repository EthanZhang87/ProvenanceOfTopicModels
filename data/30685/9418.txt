An epic poem or simply an epic is a lengthy narrative poem typically about the extraordinary deeds of extraordinary characters who in dealings with gods or other superhuman forces gave shape to the mortal universe for their descendants br br The English word epic comes from Latin epicus which itself comes from the Ancient Greek adjective epikos from epos br word story poem br In ancient Greek epic could refer to all poetry in dactylic hexameter epea which included not only Homer but also the wisdom poetry of Hesiod the utterances of the Delphic oracle and the strange theological verses attributed to Orpheus Later tradition however has restricted the term epic to heroic epic as described in this article br br Originating before the invention of writing primary epics such as those of Homer were composed by bards who used complex rhetorical and metrical schemes by which they could memorize the epic as received in tradition and add to the epic in their performances Later writers like Virgil Apollonius of Rhodes Dante Cam es and Milton adopted and adapted Homer s style and subject matter but used devices available only to those who write br The oldest epic recognized is the Epic of Gilgamesh c BCE which was recorded in ancient Sumer during the Neo Sumerian Empire The poem details the exploits of Gilgamesh the king of Uruk Although recognized as a historical figure Gilgamesh as represented in the epic is a largely legendary or mythical figure br The longest written epic from antiquity is the ancient Indian Mahabharata c rd century BC rd century AD which consists of lokas or over verse lines each shloka is a couplet as well as long prose passages so that at million words it is roughly twice the length of Shahnameh four times the length of the R m ya a and roughly ten times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined br Famous examples of epic poetry include the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh the ancient Indian Mahabharata and R m ya a in Sanskrit and Silappatikaram and Manimekalai in Tamil the Persian Shahnameh the Ancient Greek Odyssey and Iliad Virgil s Aeneid the Old English Beowulf Dante s Divine Comedy the Finnish Kalevala the German Nibelungenlied the French Song of Roland the Spanish Cantar de mio Cid the Portuguese Os Lus adas the Armenian Daredevils of Sassoun the Old Russian The Tale of Igor s Campaign John Milton s Paradise Lost The Secret History of the Mongols the Kyrgyz Manas and the Malian Sundiata Epic poems of the modern era include Derek Walcott s Omeros Mircea C rt rescu s The Levant and Adam Mickiewicz s Pan Tadeusz Paterson by William Carlos Williams published in five volumes from to was inspired in part by another modern epic The Cantos by Ezra Pound br br The first epics were products of preliterate societies and oral history poetic traditions Oral tradition was used alongside written scriptures to communicate and facilitate the spread of culture br In these traditions poetry is transmitted to the audience and from performer to performer by purely oral means Early th century study of living oral epic traditions in the Balkans by Milman Parry and Albert Lord demonstrated the paratactic model used for composing these poems What they demonstrated was that oral epics tend to be constructed in short episodes each of equal status interest and importance This facilitates memorization as the poet is recalling each episode in turn and using the completed episodes to recreate the entire epic as he performs it Parry and Lord also contend that the most likely source for written texts of the epics of Homer was dictation from an oral performance br Milman Parry and Albert Lord have argued that the Homeric epics the earliest works of Western literature were fundamentally an oral poetic form These works form the basis of the epic genre in Western literature Nearly all of Western epic including Virgil s Aeneid and Dante s Divine Comedy self consciously presents itself as a continuation of the tradition begun by these poems br br In his work Poetics Aristotle defines an epic as one of the forms of poetry contrasted with lyric poetry and drama in the form of tragedy and comedy br br Epic poetry agrees with Tragedy in so far as it is an imitation in verse of characters of a higher type They differ in that Epic poetry admits but one kind of meter and is narrative in form They differ again in their length for Tragedy endeavors as far as possible to confine itself to a single revolution of the sun or but slightly to exceed this limit whereas the Epic action has no limits of time This then is a second point of difference though at first the same freedom was admitted in Tragedy as in Epic poetry br Of their constituent parts some are common to both some peculiar to Tragedy whoever therefore knows what is good or bad Tragedy knows also about Epic poetry All the elements of an Epic poem are found in Tragedy but the elements of a Tragedy are not all found in the Epic poem Aristotle Poetics Part V br Harmon Holman define an epic br br Epic br A long narrative poem in elevated style presenting characters of high position in adventures forming an organic whole through their relation to a central heroic figure and through their development of episodes important to the history of a nation or race br Harmon Holman br Harmon and Holman delineate ten main characteristics of an epic br br Begins in medias res in the thick of things br The setting is vast covering many nations the world or the universe br Begins with an invocation to a muse epic invocation br Begins with a statement of the theme br Includes the use of epithets br Contains long lists called an epic catalogue br Features long and formal speeches br Shows divine intervention in human affairs br Features heroes that embody the values of the civilization br Often features the tragic hero s descent into the underworld or hell br The hero generally participates in a cyclical journey or quest faces adversaries that try to defeat them in their journey and returns home significantly transformed by their journey The epic hero illustrates traits performs deeds and exemplifies certain morals that are valued by the society the epic originates from Many epic heroes are recurring characters in the legends of their native cultures br br In the Indian mah k vya epic genre more emphasis was laid on description than on narration Indeed the traditional characteristics of a mah k vya are listed as br br It must take its subject matter from the epics Ramayana or Mahabharata or from history br It must help further the four goals of man purusharthas br It must contain descriptions of cities seas mountains moonrise and sunrise and accounts of merrymaking in gardens of bathing parties drinking bouts and love making br It should tell the sorrow of separated lovers and should describe a wedding and the birth of a son br It should describe a king s council an embassy the marching forth of an army a battle and the victory of a hero br br Classical epic poetry recounts a journey either physical as typified by Odysseus in the Odyssey or mental as typified by Achilles in the Iliad or both Epics also tend to highlight cultural norms and to define or call into question cultural values particularly as they pertain to heroism br br In the proem or preface the poet may begin by invoking a Muse or similar divinity The poet prays to the Muses to provide them with divine inspiration to tell the story of a great hero br Example opening lines with invocations br br Sing goddess the baneful wrath of Achilles son of Peleus Iliad br Muse tell me in verse of the man of many wiles Odyssey br From the Heliconian Muses let us begin to sing Hesiod Theogony br Beginning with thee Oh Phoebus I will recount the famous deeds of men of old Argonautica br Muse remember to me the causes Aeneid br Sing Heav nly Muse that on the secret top br of Oreb or of Sinai didst inspire Paradise Lost br An alternative or complementary form of proem found in Virgil and his imitators opens with the performative verb I sing Examples br br I sing arms and the man Aeneid br I sing pious arms and their captain Gerusalemme liberata br I sing ladies knights arms loves courtesies audacious deeds Orlando Furioso br This Virgilian epic convention is referenced in Walt Whitman s poem title opening line I sing the body electric br Compare the first six lines of the Kalevala br br Mastered by desire impulsive br By a mighty inward urging br I am ready now for singing br Ready to begin the chanting br Of our nation s ancient folk song br Handed down from by gone ages br These conventions are largely restricted to European classical culture and its imitators The Epic of Gilgamesh for example or the Bhagavata Purana do not contain such elements nor do early medieval Western epics that are not strongly shaped by the classical traditions such as the Chanson de Roland or the Poem of the Cid br br Narrative opens in the middle of things with the hero at his lowest point Usually flashbacks show earlier portions of the story For example the Iliad does not tell the entire story of the Trojan War starting with the judgment of Paris but instead opens abruptly on the rage of Achilles and its immediate causes So too Orlando Furioso is not a complete biography of Roland but picks up from the plot of Orlando Innamorato which in turn presupposes a knowledge of the romance and oral traditions br br Epic catalogues and genealogies are given called enumeratio These long lists of objects places and people place the finite action of the epic within a broader universal context such as the catalog of ships Often the poet is also paying homage to the ancestors of audience members Examples br br In The Faerie Queene the list of trees I i br In Paradise Lost the list of demons in Book I br In the Aeneid the list of enemies the Trojans find in Etruria Central Italy in Book VII Also the list of ships in Book X br In the Iliad the Catalogue of Ships the most famous epic catalogue and the Trojan Battle Order br br In the Homeric and post Homeric tradition epic style is typically achieved through the use of the following stylistic features br br Heavy use of repetition or stock phrases e g Homer s rosy fingered dawn and wine dark sea br Epic similes br br Many verse forms have been used in epic poems through the ages but each language s literature typically gravitates to one form or at least to a very limited set br Ancient Sumerian epic poems did not use any kind of poetic meter and lines did not have consistent lengths br instead Sumerian poems derived their rhythm solely through constant repetition and parallelism with subtle variations between lines br Indo European epic poetry by contrast usually places strong emphasis on the importance of line consistency and poetic meter Ancient Greek epics were composed in dactylic hexameter br Very early Latin epicists such Livius Andronicus and Gnaeus Naevius used Saturnian meter By the time of Ennius however Latin poets had adopted dactylic hexameter br Dactylic hexameter has been adapted by a few anglophone poets such as Longfellow in Evangeline whose first line is as follows br br This is the forest pri meval The murmuring pines and the hemlocks br Old English German and Norse poems were written in alliterative verse br usually without rhyme The alliterative form can be seen in the Old English Finnsburg Fragment alliterated sounds are in bold br br While the above classical and Germanic forms would be considered stichic Italian Spanish and Portuguese long poems favored stanzaic forms usually written in terza rima br or especially ottava rima br Terza rima is a rhyming verse stanza form that consists of an interlocking three line rhyme scheme An example is found in the first lines of the Divine Comedy by Dante who originated the form br br In ottava rima each stanza consists of three alternate rhymes and one double rhyme following the ABABABCC rhyme scheme Example br br From the th century English epic poems were written in heroic couplets br and rhyme royal br though in the th century the Spenserian stanza br and blank verse br were also introduced The French alexandrine is currently the heroic line in French literature though in earlier literature such as the chanson de geste the decasyllable grouped in laisses took precedence In Polish literature couplets of Polish alexandrines syllabic lines of syllables prevail br In Russian iambic tetrameter verse is the most popular br In Serbian poetry the decasyllable is the only form employed br Balto Finnic e g Estonian Finnish Karelian folk poetry uses a form of trochaic tetrameter that has been called the Kalevala meter The Finnish and Estonian national epics Kalevala and Kalevipoeg are both written in this meter The meter is thought to have originated during the Proto Finnic period br In Indic epics such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata the shloka form is used br br The primary form of epic especially as discussed in this article is the heroic epic including such works as the Iliad and Mahabharata Ancient sources also recognized didactic epic as a category represented by such works as Hesiod s Works and Days and Lucretius s De rerum natura br A related type of poetry is the epyllion plural epyllia a brief narrative poem with a romantic or mythological theme The term which means little epic came into use in the nineteenth century It refers primarily to the erudite shorter hexameter poems of the Hellenistic period and the similar works composed at Rome from the age of the neoterics to a lesser degree the term includes some poems of the English Renaissance particularly those influenced by Ovid br The most famous example of classical epyllion is perhaps Catullus br Epyllion is to be understood as distinct from mock epic another light form br Romantic epic is a term used to designate works such as Morgante Orlando Innamorato Orlando Furioso and Gerusalemme Liberata which freely lift characters themes plots and narrative devices from the world of prose chivalric romance br Non European forms br Long poetic narratives that do not fit the traditional European definition of the heroic epic are sometimes known as folk epics Indian folk epics have been investigated by Lauri Honko Brenda Beck and John Smith amongst others Folk epics are an important part of community identities For example in Egypt the folk genre known as al sira relates the saga of the Hil l tribe and their migrations across the Middle East and north Africa see Bridget Connelly In India folk epics reflect the caste system of Indian society and the life of the lower levels of society such as cobblers and shepherds see C N Ramachandran Ambivalence and Angst A Note on Indian folk epics in Lauri Honko p Some Indian oral epics feature strong women who actively pursue personal freedom in their choice of a romantic partner Stuart Claus Flueckiger and Wadley eds p Japanese traditional performed narratives were sung by blind singers One of the most famous The Tale of the Heike deals with historical wars and had a ritual function to placate the souls of the dead Tokita p A variety of epic forms are found in Africa Some have a linear unified style while others have a more cyclical episodic style Barber p People in the rice cultivation zones of south China sang long narrative songs about the origin of rice growing rebel heroes and transgressive love affairs McLaren The borderland ethnic populations of China sang heroic epics such as the Epic of King Gesar of the Mongols and the creation myth epics of the Yao people of south China br br de Vries Jan Heroic Song and
