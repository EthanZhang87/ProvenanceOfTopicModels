A legendary creature also called a mythical or mythological creature is a type of fantasy entity typically a hybrid that has not been proven and that is described in folklore including myths and legends but may be featured in historical accounts before modernity br In the classical era monstrous creatures such as the Cyclops and the Minotaur appear in heroic tales for the protagonist to destroy Other creatures such as the unicorn were claimed in accounts of natural history by various scholars of antiquity br Some legendary creatures originated in traditional mythology and were believed to be real creatures For example dragons griffins and unicorns Others are based on real encounters or garbled accounts of travellers tales such as the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary which supposedly grew tethered to the earth br br br Creatures br br A variety of mythical animals appear in the art and stories of the classical era For example in the Odyssey monstrous creatures include the Cyclops Scylla and Charybdis for the hero Odysseus to confront Other tales include Medusa to be defeated by Perseus the human bull Minotaur to be destroyed by Theseus and the Hydra to be killed by Heracles while Aeneas battles with the harpies These monsters thus have the basic function of emphasizing the greatness of the heroes involved br Some classical era creatures such as the horse human centaur chimaera Triton and the flying horse Pegasus are found also in Indian art Similarly sphinxes appear as winged lions in Indian art and the Piasa Bird of North America br In medieval art animals both real and mythical played important roles These included decorative forms as in medieval jewellery sometimes with their limbs intricately interlaced Animal forms were used to add humor or majesty to objects In Christian art animals carried symbolic meanings where for example the lamb symbolized Christ a dove indicated the Holy Spirit and the classical griffin represented a guardian of the dead Medieval bestiaries included animals regardless of biological reality the basilisk represented the devil while the manticore symbolised temptation br br br Allegory br br One function of mythical animals in the Middle Ages was allegory Unicorns for example were described as extraordinarily swift and uncatchable by traditional methods It was believed that the only way for one to catch this beast was to lead a virgin to its dwelling Then the unicorn was supposed to leap into her lap and go to sleep at which point a hunter could finally capture it In terms of symbolism the unicorn was a metaphor for Christ Unicorns represented the idea of innocence and purity In the King James Bible Psalm states My horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of a unicorn This is because the translators of the King James erroneously translated the Hebrew word re em as unicorn Later versions translate this as wild ox The unicorn s small size signifies the humility of Christ br Another common legendary creature that served allegorical functions within the Middle Ages was the dragon Dragons were identified with serpents though their attributes were greatly intensified The dragon was supposed to have been larger than all other animals It was believed that the dragon had no harmful poison but was able to slay anything it embraced without any need for venom Biblical scriptures speak of the dragon in reference to the devil and they were used to denote sin in general during the Middle Ages Dragons were said to have dwelled in places like Ethiopia and India based on the idea that there was always heat present in these locations br Physical detail was not the central focus of the artists depicting such animals and medieval bestiaries were not conceived as biological categorizations Creatures like the unicorn and griffin were not categorized in a separate mythological section in medieval bestiaries as the symbolic implications were of primary importance Animals we know to have existed were still presented with a fantastical approach It seems the religious and moral implications of animals were far more significant than matching a physical likeness in these renderings Nona C Flores explains By the tenth century artists were increasingly bound by allegorical interpretation and abandoned naturalistic depictions br br br See also br Fearsome critters br Lists of legendary creatures br List of legendary creatures by type br List of cryptids br Non physical entity br br br br br br External links br Media related to creatures at Wikimedia Commons
