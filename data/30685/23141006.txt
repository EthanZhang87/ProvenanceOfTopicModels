title: Orc
id: 23141006
An orc sometimes spelt ork in J R R Tolkien s Middle earth fantasy fiction is a race of humanoid monsters which he also calls goblin br In Tolkien s The Lord of the Rings orcs appear as a brutish aggressive ugly and malevolent race of monsters contrasting with the benevolent Elves They are a corrupted race of elves either bred that way by the Dark Lord Morgoth or turned savage in that manner according to the Silmarillion br The orc was a sort of hell devil in Old English literature and the orc n pl orc n as demon corpses was a race of corrupted beings and descendants of Cain alongside the elf according to the poem Beowulf Tolkien adopted the term orc from these old attestations which he professed was a choice made purely for phonetic suitability reasons br Tolkien s concept of orcs has been adapted into the fantasy fiction of other authors and into games of many different genres such as Dungeons Dragons Magic The Gathering and Warcraft br br br Etymology br br The Anglo Saxon word orc which Tolkien used is generally thought to be derived from the Latin word name Orcus though Tolkien himself expressed doubt about this The term orcus is glossed as orc yrs o e hel deofol Goblin spectre or hell devil in the th century Old English Cleopatra Glossaries about which Thomas Wright wrote Orcus was the name for Pluto the god of the infernal regions hence we can easily understand the explanation of hel deofol Orc in Anglo Saxon like thyrs means a spectre or goblin br In the sense of a monstrous being the term is used just once in Beowulf as the plural compound orcneas one of the tribes belonging to the descendants of Cain alongside the elves and ettins giants condemned by God br br The meaning of Orcneas is uncertain Frederick Klaeber suggested it consisted of orc L orcus the underworld neas corpses to which the translation evil spirits failed to do justice It is generally supposed to contain an element n cognate to Gothic naus and Old Norse n r both meaning corpse If orcn is to be glossed as orcus corpse then the compound word can be construed as demon corpses or corpse from Orcus i e the underworld Hence orc neas may have been some sort of walking dead monster a product of ancient necromancy or a zombie like creature br br br Tolkien br br The term orc is used only once in the first edition of Tolkien s The Hobbit which preferred the term goblins Orc was later used ubiquitously in The Lord of the Rings The orc element occurs in the sword name Orcrist which is given as its Elvish language name and glossed as Goblin cleaver br br br Stated etymology br Tolkien began the more modern use of the English term orc to denote a race of evil humanoid creatures His earliest Elvish dictionaries include the entry Ork orq monster ogre demon together with orqindi and ogresse He sometimes used the plural form orqui in his early texts He stated that the Elvish words for orc were derived from a root ruku fear horror in Quenya orco plural orkor in Sindarin orch plurals yrch and Orchoth as a class They had similar names in other Middle earth languages uruk in Black Speech in the language of the Dr edain gorg n ork folk in Khuzdul rukhs plural rakh s and in the language of Rohan and in the Common Speech orka br Tolkien stated in a letter to the novelist Naomi Mitchison that his orcs had been influenced by George MacDonald s The Princess and the Goblin He explained that his word orc was derived from Old English orc demon but only because of its phonetic suitability and br br I originally took the word from Old English orc Beowulf orc neas and the gloss orc yrs ogre heldeofol hell devil This is supposed not to be connected with modern English orc ork a name applied to various sea beasts of the dolphin order br Tolkien also observed a similarity with the Latin word orcus noting that the word used in translation of Q uenya urko S indarin orch is Orc But that is because of the similarity of the ancient English word orc evil spirit or bogey to the Elvish words There is possibly no connection between them br br br Description br Orcs are of human shape and of varying size They are depicted as ugly and filthy with a taste for human flesh They are fanged bow legged and long armed Most are small and avoid daylight br By the Third Age a new breed of orc had emerged the Uruk hai larger and more powerful and no longer afraid of daylight Orcs eat meat including the flesh of Men and may indulge in cannibalism in The Two Towers Grishn kh an orc from Mordor claims that the Isengard orcs eat orc flesh Whether that is true or spoken in malice is uncertain an orc flings Peregrin Took stale bread and a strip of raw dried flesh the flesh of he dared not guess what creature br Half orcs appear in The Lord of the Rings created by interbreeding of orcs and Men they were able to go in sunlight The sly Southerner in The Fellowship of the Ring looks more than half like a goblin similar but more orc like hybrids appear in The Two Towers man high but with goblin faces sallow leering squint eyed br br In Peter Jackson s Lord of the Rings films the actors playing orcs are made up with masks designed to make them look evil After a disagreement with the film producer Harvey Weinstein Jackson had one of the masks made to resemble Weinstein as an insult to him br br br Orkish language br br The Orcs had no language of their own merely a pidgin of many various languages However individual tribes developed dialects that differed so widely that Westron often with a crude accent was used as a common language When Sauron returned to power in Mordor in the Third Age Black Speech was used by the captains of his armies and by his servants in his tower of Barad d r A sample of debased Black Speech can be found in The Two Towers where a yellow fanged guard Orc of Mordor curses Ugl k of Isengard an Uruk hai chief with the words Ugl k u bagronk sha pushdug Saruman glob b bhosh skai In The Peoples of Middle earth Tolkien gives the translation Ugl k to the cesspool sha the dungfilth the great Saruman fool skai However in a note published in Vinyar Tengwar he gives an alternative translation Ugl k to the dung pit with stinking Saruman filth pig guts gah br Alexander Nemirovsky speculated that Tolkien might have drawn upon the language of the ancient Hittites and Hurrians for Black Speech br br br In fiction origins br br The origin s of orcs were explained two different ways i e inconsistently by Tolkien the orcs were either East Elves Avari enslaved tortured and bred by Morgoth as Melkor became known or perhaps Avari a race of elves turned evil and savage in the wild both according to The Silmarillion br The orcs multiplied like Elves and Men meaning that they reproduced sexually Tolkien stated in a letter dated October to a Mrs Munsby that there must have been orc women In The Fall of Gondolin Morgoth made them of slime by sorcery bred from the heats and slimes of the earth Or they were beasts of humanized shape possibly Tolkien wrote Elves mated with beasts and later Men Or again Tolkien noted they could have been fallen Maiar perhaps a kind called Boldog like lesser Balrogs or corrupted Men br Shippey writes that the orcs in The Lord of the Rings were almost certainly created just to equip Middle earth with a continual supply of enemies over whom one need feel no compunction or in Tolkien s words from The Monsters and the Critics the infantry of the old war ready to be slaughtered Shippey states that all the same orcs share the human concept of good and evil with a familiar sense of morality though he notes that like many people orcs are quite unable to apply their morals to themselves In his view Tolkien as a Catholic took it as a given that evil cannot make only mock so orcs could not have an equal and opposite morality to that of men or elves In a letter Tolkien wrote that orcs were fundamentally a race of rational incarnate creatures though horribly corrupted if no more so than many Men to be met today The scholar of English literature Robert Tally wrote in Mythlore that despite the uniform presentation of orcs as loathsome ugly cruel feared and especially terminable Tolkien could not resist the urge to flesh out and humanize these inhuman creatures from time to time in the process giving them their own morality Shippey notes that in The Two Towers the orc Gorbag disapproves of the regular elvish trick an immoral act of abandoning a comrade as he wrongly supposes Sam Gamgee has done to Frodo Baggins Shippey describes the implied view of evil as Boethian that evil is the absence of good He notes however that Tolkien did not agree with that point of view Tolkien believed that evil had to be actively fought with war if necessary something that Shippey describes as representing the Manichean position that evil coexists with good and is at least equally powerful br br br Debated racism br br The possibility of racism in Tolkien s descriptions of orcs has been debated In a private letter Tolkien describes orcs as br br squat broad flat nosed sallow skinned with wide mouths and slant eyes in fact degraded and repulsive versions of the to Europeans least lovely Mongol types br O Hehir describes orcs as a subhuman race bred by Morgoth and or Sauron although not created by them that is morally irredeemable and deserves only death They are dark skinned and slant eyed and although they possess reason speech social organization and as Shippey mentions a sort of moral sensibility they are inherently evil He notes Tolkien s own description of them saying it could scarcely be more revealing as a representation of the Other and states it is also the product of his background and era like most of our inescapable prejudices At the level of conscious intention he was not a racist or an anti Semite and mentions Tolkien s letters to this effect The literary critic Jenny Turner writing in the London Review of Books endorses Andrew O Hehir s comment on Salon com that orcs are by design and intention a northern European s paranoid caricature of the races he has dimly heard about br Tally describes the orcs as a demonized enemy despite he writes Tolkien s own objections to demonization of the enemy in the two World Wars In a letter to his son Christopher who was serving in the RAF in the Second World War Tolkien wrote of orcs as appearing on both sides of the conflict br br Yes I think the orcs as real a creation as anything in realistic fiction only in real life they are on both sides of course For romance has grown out of allegory and its wars are still derived from the inner war of allegory in which good is on one side and various modes of badness on the other In real exterior life men are on both sides which means a motley alliance of orcs beasts demons plain naturally honest men and angels br John Magoun writing in the J R R Tolkien Encyclopedia states that Middle earth has a fully expressed moral geography Any moral bias towards a north western geography however was directly denied by Tolkien in a letter to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer who had recently interviewed him in br br Auden has asserted that for me the North is a sacred direction That is not true The North west of Europe where I and most of my ancestors have lived has my affection as a man s home should I love its atmosphere and know more of its histories and languages than I do of other parts but it is not sacred nor does it exhaust my affections I do have for instance a particular fondness for the Latin language and among its descendants for Spanish That it is untrue for my story a mere reading of the synopses should show The North was the seat of the fortresses of the Devil ie Morgoth br br Scholars of English literature William N Rogers II and Michael R Underwood note that a widespread element of late th century Western culture was fear of moral decline and degeneration this led to eugenics In The Two Towers the Ent Treebeard says br br It is a mark of evil things that came in the Great Darkness that they cannot abide the Sun but Saruman s orcs can endure it even if they hate it I wonder what he has done Are they Men he has ruined or has he blended the races of orcs and Men That would be a black evil br The Germanic studies scholar Sandra Ballif Straubhaar however argues against the recurring accusations of racism stating that a polycultured polylingual world is absolutely central to Middle earth and that readers and filmgoers will easily see that The historian and Tolkien scholar Jared Lobdell likewise disagreed with any notions of racism inherent or latent in Tolkien s works and wondered if there were a way of writing epic fantasy about a battle against an evil spirit and his monstrous servants without its being subject to speculation of racist intent br The journalist David Ibata writes that the interpretations of orcs in Peter Jackson s Lord of the Rings films look much like the worst depictions of the Japanese drawn by American and British illustrators during World War II br br br Other fiction br As a response to the type casting of orcs as generic evil characters or antagonists some novels portray events from the point of view of the orcs or make them more sympathetic characters Mary Gentle s novel Grunts presents orcs as generic infantry used as metaphorical cannon fodder A series of books by Stan Nicholls Orcs First Blood focuses on the conflicts between orcs and humans from the orcs point of view In Terry Pratchett s Discworld series orcs are close to extinction in his Unseen Academicals it is said that When the Evil Emperor wanted fighters he got some of the Igors to turn goblins into orcs to be used as weapons in a Great War encouraged by whips and beatings br br br In games br br Orcs based on The Lord of the Rings have become a fixture of fantasy fiction and role playing games br br br Dungeons Dragons br br In the fantasy tabletop role playing game Dungeons Dragons D D orcs are creatures in the game and somewhat based upon those described by Tolkien These D D orcs are implemented in the game rules as a multi tribed race of hostile and bestial humanoids br The D D orcs are endowed with muscular frames large canine teeth like boar s tusks and snouts rather than human like noses While a pug nose flat nosed was attributable to Tolkien s written correspondence the pig headed pig faced look was imparted on the orc by the D D original edition It was later modified from bald headed to hairy in subsequent editions In the third version of the game the orc became gray skinned even though a complicated color palleted description of a non gray orc had been implemented in the Monster Manual for the first edition Newer versions seem to have dropped references to skin color br Early versions of the game introduced the half orc as race The orc was described in the first edition of Monster Manual op cit as a fiercely competitive bully a tribal creature often dwelling and building underground in newer editions orcs though still described as sometimes inhabiting cavern complexes had been shifted to become more prone to non subterranean habitation as well adapting captured villages into communities for instance The mythology and attitudes of the orcs are described in detail in Dragon June in Roger E Moore s article The Half Orc Point
