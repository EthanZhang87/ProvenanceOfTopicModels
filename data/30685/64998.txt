and act in This was combined with the use of miniature models and scaled down city sets to create the illusion of a giant creature in a city Due to the extreme stiffness of the latex or rubber suits filming would often be done at double speed so that when the film was shown the monster was smoother and slower than in the original shot Kaiju films also used a form of puppetry interwoven between suitmation scenes for shots that were physically impossible for the suit actor to perform From the release of Godzilla American produced kaiju films strayed from suitmation to computer generated
