that he was not in favor of civil unions He stated that generally agreed civil unions were merely same sex marriage under a different name He claimed his main priority in opposing the same sex

br Social scientists have criticized Focus on the Family for misrepresenting their research in order to bolster its own perspective Researcher Judith Stacey whose work was used by Focus on the Family to claim that gays and lesbians do not make good parents said that the claim was a direct misrepresentation of the research She elaborated Whenever you hear Focus on the Family legislators or lawyers say Studies prove that children do better in families with a mother and a father they are referring to studies which compare two parent heterosexual households to single parent households The studies they are talking about do not cite research on families headed by gay and lesbian couples FOTF claimed that Stacey s allegation was without merit and that their position is that the best interests of children are served when there is a father and a mother We haven t said anything about sexual orientation said Glenn Stanton br James Dobson cited the research of Kyle Pruett and Carol Gilligan in a Time magazine guest article in the service of a claim that two women cannot raise a child upon finding out that her work had been used in this way Gilligan wrote a letter to Dobson asking him to apologize and to cease and desist from citing her work describing herself as mortified to learn that you had distorted my work Not only did you take my research out of context you did so without my knowledge to support discriminatory goals that I do not agree with there is nothing in my research that would lead you to draw the stated conclusions you did in the Time article Pruett wrote a similar letter in which he said that Dobson cherry picked a phrase to shore up highly in my view discriminatory purposes This practice is condemned in real science common though it may be in pseudo science circles There is nothing in my longitudinal research or any of my writings to support such conclusions and asked that FOTF not cite him again without permission br After Elizabeth Saewyc s research on teen suicide was used by Focus on the Family to promote conversion therapy she said that the research has been hijacked for somebody s political purposes or ideological purposes and that s worrisome

findings include Robert Spitzer Gary Remafedi and Angela Phillips br br br Football advertisements br In Focus on the Family bought ad time during Super Bowl XLIV to air a commercial featuring Heisman Trophy winning Florida Gators quarterback Tim Tebow and his mother Pam In the ad Pam described Tim as a miracle baby who almost didn t make it into this world and further elaborated that with all our family s been through we have to be tough after which Pam was promptly tackled by Tim The ad directed viewers to the organization s website br Women s rights groups asked CBS not to air the then unseen ad arguing that it was divisive Planned Parenthood released a video response of its own featuring fellow NFL player Sean James The claim that Tebow s family chose not to perform an abortion was also widely criticized critics felt that the claim was implausible because it would be unlikely for doctors to recommend the procedure because abortion is illegal in the Philippines CBS s decision to run the ad was also criticized for deviating from its past policy to reject advocacy type ads during the Super Bowl including ads by left leaning groups such as PETA MoveOn org and the United Church of Christ which wanted to run an ad that was pro same sex marriage However CBS stated that we have for some time moderated our approach to advocacy submissions after it became apparent that our stance did not reflect public sentiment or industry norms on the issue br Focus on the Family produced another commercial which ran during the second quarter of the January Denver Broncos New England Patriots AFC Divisional Playoff broadcast on CBS featuring children reciting the Bible verse John The ad did not generate nearly the amount of controversy that surrounded the Super Bowl commercial It did gain some national media attention and president Jim Daly stated in a press release that its purpose was to help everyone understand some numbers are more important than the ones on the scoreboard
