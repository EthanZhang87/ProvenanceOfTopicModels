In folklore a mermaid is an aquatic creature with the head and upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide including Europe Asia and Africa br Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods storms shipwrecks and drownings In other folk traditions or sometimes within the same traditions they can be benevolent or beneficent bestowing boons or falling in love with humans br The male equivalent of the mermaid is the merman also a familiar figure in folklore and heraldry Although traditions about and reported sightings of mermen are less common than those of mermaids they are in folklore generally assumed to co exist with their female counterparts The male and the female collectively are sometimes referred to as merfolk or merpeople br The Western concept of mermaids as beautiful seductive singers may have been influenced by the sirens of Greek mythology which were originally half birdlike but came to be pictured as half fishlike in the Christian era Historical accounts of mermaids such as those reported by Christopher Columbus during his exploration of the Caribbean may have been sightings of manatees or similar aquatic mammals While there is no evidence that mermaids exist outside folklore reports of mermaid sightings continue to the present day br Mermaids have been a popular subject of art and literature in recent centuries such as in Hans Christian Andersen s literary fairy tale The Little Mermaid They have subsequently been depicted in operas paintings books comics animation and live action films br br The English word mermaid has its earliest known attestation in Middle English Chaucer Nun s Priest s Tale c The compound word is formed from mere sea and maid br br Another English word mermin headword in the OED for siren or mermaid is older though now obsolete It derives from Old English m rem nen ad m re sea m nen female slave earliest attestation mereminne as a gloss for siren in Corpus Glossary c br A Middle English example mereman in a bestiary c manuscript now dated to is indeed a mermaid part maiden part fish like br Its Old High German cognate merimenni is known from biblical glosses and Physiologus br The Middle High German cognate merminne mod German meerweib mermaid is attested in epics and the one in Rabenschlacht is a great grandmother this same figure is in an Old Swedish text a haffru and in Old Norse a sj kona si kona sic sea woman br Old Norse marmennill dill masculine noun is also listed as cognate to mermin as well as ON margmelli modern Icelandic marbendill and modern Norwegian marm le br br Old English m rewif is another related term and appears once in reference not so much to a mermaid but a certain sea hag and not well attested later br Its MHG cognate merw p also defined as meerweib in modern German with perhaps merwoman a valid English definition The word is attested among other medieval epics in the Nibelungenlied and rendered merwoman mermaid water sprite or other terms the two in the story are translated as ON sj konur sea women br br The siren of Ancient Greek mythology became conflated with mermaids during the medieval period Some European Romance languages still use cognate terms for siren to denote the mermaid e g French sir ne and Spanish and Italian sirena br Some commentators have sought to trace origins further back into Ancient Middle Eastern mythology br br In the early Greek period the sirens were conceived of as human headed birds but by the classical period the Greeks sporadically depicted the siren as part fish in art br br The siren s part fish appearance became increasingly popular during the Middle Ages The traits of the classical sirens such as using their beautiful song as a lure as told by Homer have often been transferred to mermaids br These change of the medieval siren from bird to fish were thought by some to be the influence of Teutonic myth later expounded in literary legends of Lorelei and Undine though a dissenting comment is that parallels are not limited to Teutonic culture br br The earliest text describing the siren as fish tailed occurs in the Liber Monstrorum de diversis generibus seventh to mid eighth century which described sirens as sea girls marinae pullae whose beauty in form and sweet song allure seafarers but beneath the human head and torso have the scaly tail end of a fish with which they can navigate the sea br Sirens are mermaids Old High German Early Middle High German Sir ne s nt m remanniu is explicit in the aforementioned Old German Physiologus eleventh century br The Middle English bestiary mid th century clearly means mermaid when it explains the siren to be a mereman stating that she has a body and breast like that of a maiden but joined at the navel by a body part which is definitely fish with fins growing out of her br Old French verse bestiaries e g Philipp de Thaun s version written c also accommodated by stating that a part of the siren may be bird or fish br br In a ninth century Physiologus manufactured in France Fig top left the siren was illustrated as a woman fish i e mermaid like despite being described as bird like in the text br The Bodleian bestiary dated also pictures a group of fish tailed mermaid like sirens Fig bottom contradicting its text which likens it to a winged fowl volatilis habet figuram down to their feet br In the interim the siren as pure mermaid was becoming commonplace particularly in the so called Second Family Latin bestiaries as represented in one of the early manuscripts classified into this group Additional manuscript c s Fig top right br br Mirror and comb br While the siren holding a fish was a commonplace theme the siren in bestiaries were also sometimes depicted holding the comb or the mirror br The comb and mirror became a persistent symbol of the siren mermaid br In the Christian moralizing context e g the bestiaries the mermaid s mirror and comb were held as the symbol of vanity br br The sea monsters Scylla and Charybdis who lived near the sirens were also female and had some fishlike attributes Though Scylla s violence is contrasted with the sirens seductive ways by certain classical writers Scylla and Charybdis lived near the sirens domain In Etruscan art before the sixth century BC Scylla was portrayed as a mermaid like creature with two tails This may be tied to images of two tailed mermaids ranging from ancient times to modern depictions and is sometimes attached to the later character of Melusine A sporadic example of sirens as mermaids tritonesses in Early Greek art third century BC can be explained as the contamination of the siren myth with Scylla and Charybdis br The female oceanids nereids and naiads are mythical water nymphs or deities although not depicted with fish tails Nereid and nymph have also been applied to actual mermaid like marine creatures purported to exist from Pliny cf Roman Lusitania and Gaul and onwards Jane Ellen Harrison has speculated that the mermaids or tritonesses of Greek and Roman mythology may have been brought from the Middle East possibly transmitted by Phoenician mariners br The Greek god Triton had two fish tails instead of legs and later became pluralized as a group The prophetic sea deity Glaucus was also depicted with a fish tail and sometimes with fins for arms br br Depictions of entities with the upper bodies of humans and the tails of fish appear in Mesopotamian artwork from the Old Babylonian Period onwards on cylinder seals These figures are usually mermen kulull but mermaids do occasionally appear The name for the mermaid figure may have been kuliltu meaning fish woman Such figures were used in Neo Assyrian art as protective figures and were shown in both monumental sculpture and in small protective figurines br br A mermaid like goddess identified by Greek and Roman writers as Derceto or Atargatis was worshipped at Ashkelon In a myth recounted by Diodorus Siculus in the first century BC Derceto gave birth to a child from an affair Ashamed she abandoned the child in the desert and drowned herself in a lake only to be transformed into a human headed fish The child Semiramis was fed by doves and survived to become a queen br In the second century Lucian described seeing a Phoenician statue of Derceto with the upper body of a woman and the tail of a fish He noted the contrast with the grand statue located at her Holy City Hierapolis Bambyce which appeared entirely human br In the myth Semiramis s first husband is named Onnes Some scholars have compared this to the earlier Mesopotamian myth of Oannes one of the apkallu or seven sages described as fish men in cuneiform texts While Oannes was a servant of the water deity Ea having gained wisdom from the god English writer Arthur Waugh understood Oannes to be equivalent to Ea and proposed that surely Oannes had a fish tailed wife and descendants with Atargatis being one deity thus descended through the mists of time br Diodorus s chronology of Queen Semiramis resembles the feats of Alexander the Great campaigns to India etc and Diodorus may have woven the Macedonian king s material via some unnamed source There is a mermaid legend attached to Alexander the Great s sister but this is of post medieval vintage see below br br Sometime before BC Milesian philosopher Anaximander postulated that mankind had sprung from an aquatic animal species a theory that is sometimes called the Aquatic Ape Theory He thought that humans who begin life with prolonged infancy could not have survived otherwise br There are also naturalist theories on the origins of the mermaid postulating they derive from sightings of manatees dugongs or even seals br Still another theory tangentially related to the aforementioned Aquatic Ape Theory is that the mermaids of folklore were actually human women who trained over time to be skilled divers for things like sponges and spent a lot of time in the sea as a result One proponent of this theory is British author William Bond who has written several books about it br br Two prophetic merwomen MHG pl merw p Sigelinde MHG Sigelint and her maternal aunt Hadeburg MHG Hadeburc are bathing in the Danube River when Hagen von Tronje encounters them Nibelungenlied ventiure br They are called sj konar sea women in the Old Norse i reks saga There is a swan maiden tale motif involved here Hagen robs their clothing but Grimm argued they must have actually been swan maidens since they are described as hovering above water br In any case this brief segment became the foundational groundwork of subsequent water nix lore and literature that developed in the Germanic sphere br They are a probable source of the three Rhine maidens in Richard Wagner s opera Das Rheingold Though conceived of as swan maidens in Wagner s scenario the number being a threesome was suggested by the woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld and Eugen Napoleon Neureuther in the Pfizer edition of fig on the left br br Middle High German mereminne mermaid is mentioned among other epics in the Rabenschlacht Battle of Ravenna th cent of the Dietrich cycle The mermaid or undine is named W chilt and is the ancestress of the traitorous Wittich who carries him off at the time of peril to her submarine home br This material has been found translated as a medieval i reks saga only in a late reworked Swedish version i e one of the closing chapters of i riks saga fifteenth century also known as the Swedish epilogue The mermaid undine is here translated as Old Swedish haffru br The Old Norse i reks saga proper calls the same mermaid a sj kona si kona sic or sea woman br The genealogy is given in the saga the sea woman and Villcinus Vilkinus king of Scandinavia together had a son Va i Wade of Sj land Sj lland Zealand who was a giant risi whose son was Velent Wayland the Smith whose son after that was Vi ga Velentsson Wittich or Witige who became a companion champion of King i rekr Dietrich von Bern br Thus the saga is an early source which associates a famed clan of merfolk with a place in Denmark i e Sj lland Sj lland was the divided portion of Villcina land inherited by the bastard prince Va i Wade according to the saga The Swedish epilogue transposed the locations concerning the battle from Italy to Germany and claimed the rescued Vi ga Witige was brought to Sj lland That is to say the crucial battle had been in Ravenna Northern Italy in the German epic Rabenschlacht but the battle spot was changed to Gronsport somewhere on the Moselle in Northern Germany in the Swedish version br br The Norman chapel in Durham Castle built around has what is probably the earliest surviving artistic depiction of a mermaid in England It can be seen on a south facing capital above one of the original Norman stone pillars br br Mermaids appear in British folklore as unlucky omens both foretelling disaster and provoking it Several variants of the ballad Sir Patrick Spens depict a mermaid speaking to the doomed ships In some versions she tells them they will never see land again in others she claims they are near shore which they are wise enough to know means the same thing Mermaids can also be a sign of approaching rough weather and some have been described as monstrous in size up to feet m br In another short ballad Clerk Colvill Child ballad No the mermaid seduces the title character and foretells his doom It has been surmised that in the original complete version the man was being penalized for spurning her though the Scandinavian counterparts that tells the complete story feature an elf woman or elf queen rather than mermaid br Mermaids have been described as able to swim up rivers to freshwater lakes In one story the Laird of Lorntie went to aid a woman he thought was drowning in a lake near his house his servant pulled him back warning that it was a mermaid and the mermaid screamed at them that she would have killed him if it were not for his servant But mermaids could occasionally be more beneficent e g teaching humans cures for certain diseases Mermen have been described as wilder and uglier than mermaids with little interest in humans br According to legend a mermaid came to the Cornish village of Zennor where she used to listen to the singing of a chorister Matthew Trewhella The two fell in love and Matthew went with the mermaid to her home at Pendour Cove On summer nights the lovers can be heard singing together The legend recorded by folklorist William Bottrell stems from a fifteenth century mermaid carving on a wooden bench at the Church of Saint Senara in Zennor br Some tales raised the question of whether mermaids had immortal souls answering in the negative br In Scottish mythology a ceasg is a freshwater mermaid though little beside the term has been preserved in folklore br Mermaids from the Isle of Man known as ben varrey are considered more favorable toward humans than those of other regions with various accounts of assistance gifts and rewards One story tells of a fisherman who carried a stranded mermaid back into the sea and was rewarded with the location of treasure Another recounts the tale of a baby mermaid who stole a doll from a human little girl but was rebuked by her mother and sent back to the girl with a gift of a pearl necklace to atone for the theft A third story tells of a fishing family that made regular gifts of apples to a mermaid and was rewarded with prosperity br In Irish lore L Ban was a human being transformed into a mermaid After three centuries when Christianity came to Ireland she was baptized The Irish mermaid is called merrow in tales such as Lady of Gollerus published in the nineteenth century br br The mermaid corresponds to Danish and Bokm l Norwegian havfrue whereas merman answers to Danish Norwegian havmand br As a side note a supposed Old Norse haffr is the etymological source of Norman French havette for a man snatching water sprite according to one linguist br An early description of the Havfrue and her mate Havmand was given by the Danish Bishop Pontoppidan They were considered the mating female and male of the creature inhabiting the North Sea and their offspring was called marm le var marm te as repeated by later commentators br Though he was aware of fabulous fables being told about them he was convinced such creature existed But as they were non human he argued the term Havmand merman should be avoided in favor of some coined term such as sea ape Danish hav abe He also knowingly employed Old Norwegian Old Norse maryge sic and hafstrambe sic as the Norwegian names of the mermaid and merman respectively br br The Icelandic cognate form is haffr with several synonyms though instead of these the commonly used term today is hafmey br The Faroese forms are havfr gv havfr g The Swedish form is hafsfru with other synonyms such as sj jungfru or sj r sea fairy the maritime counterpart of the forest skogsr br br The terms marg gur or havg gur as aliases for mermaid were apparently current among the populace in modern age Iceland according to J n rnason alongside the marbendill modern Icelandic for ON marmennill br Benjamin Thorpe writing on Norwegian folklore gave margygr for mermaid and marmennill for merman as Norwegian folk terms but these are interpolations which the source Andreas Faye s Norske sagn only side noted as occurrences of old terms in medieval literature br br The beautiful havfrue of Scandinavia may be benevolent or malicious and legends about her abducting maidens cf infra is given as a case of point for her malice br It is said the havfrue will avenge harm done to it as in the Norwegian anecdote of one who was lured near the ship and had her hand cruelly lopped off on the gunwale She caused a storm that nearly drowned the wicked sailor br br The appearance sighting alone betides an impending storm Norwegians do not wish to see the havfrue as she heralds storm or bad weather Norway The appearance of the sj r forebodes a storm or poor catch in Swedish tradition much as the appearance of the skogsr wood nymph presages poor catch for the hunter According to the superstitions of Swedish fishermen if one saw a sj r who was harbinger of tempest and bad catch one should not tell his comrades but strike flint against steel to light a spark br In other cases the Scandinavian mermaid is considered to be prophetic br The tale type The Mermaid s Message Norwegian Havfruas sp dom ML is recognized as a Migratory Legend i e a group of tales found in Scandinavia with parallels found elsewhere according to the scheme devised by Reidar Thoralf Christiansen This may not necessarily involve the mermaid s spaeing and in the following example of this ML type tale she merely imparts wisdom A fisherman who performs favors and earns the privilege to pose three questions to a mermaid He inquires about the most suitable material for a flail to which she answers calf s hide of course and tells him he should have asked about how to brew water into beer which would have benefited him more greatly br br The Swedish ballad Hafsfrun Havsfruns t rna SMB TSB A is an instance where a mermaid kidnaps a human girl at age fifteen and when the girl s brother accomplishes the rescue the mermaid declares she would have cracked her neck if she knew she would be thus betrayed The Swedish merman Hafsman nen steals a human woman to become his bride according to folklore br br As aforementioned the mermaid Norwegian havfrue takes the merman Norwegian havmand for husband and produce children called marm ler sing Norwegian marm le sea talkers which the fishermen sometimes bring home to gain insight into the future br Early sources say that Norwegian fishermen who capture the marm te or marm le may bring them home but do not dare keep it for more than hours before turning them back into the sea whence they found it br br J n rnason describes the marg gur as yellow haired woman who is fish from the waist down who drags careless seamen to the depths of the sea br br However margygr literally means something like mer troll and in medieval tradition the margygr is more of a sea monster or sea ogress br According to a version of the Saga of St Olaf Olaf II of Norway the king encountered a margygr whose singing lulled voyagers to sleep causing them to drown and whose high pitched shrieks drove men insane Her physical appearance is described thus She has a head like a horse with ears erect and distended nostrils big green eyes and fearful jaws She has shoulders like a horse and hands in front but behind she resembles a serpent This margygr was also said to be furry like a seal and gray colored br br Melusine is a mermaid like character from European folklore cursed to take the form of a serpent from the waist down Later depictions sometimes changed this to a fish tail At some point possibly in the late nineteenth century her name became attached to the two tailed mermaid of heraldry br The alchemist Paracelsus s treatise A Book on Nymphs Sylphs Pygmies and Salamanders and on the Other Spirits spawned the idea that the water elemental or water sprite could acquire an immortal soul through marriage with a human this led to the writing of De la Motte Fouqu s novella Undine and eventually to the famous literary mermaid tale Hans Christian Andersen s The Little Mermaid br During the Romanesque period mermaids were often associated with lust br br The conception of the siren as both a mermaid like creature and part bird like persisted in Byzantine Greece for some time The Physiologus began switching the illustration of the siren as that a mermaid as in a version dated to the ninth century The tenth century Byzantine Greek dictionary Suda still favored the avian description br There is a modern Greek legend that Alexander the Great s sister Thessalonike turned into a mermaid Greek after her death living in the Aegean She would ask the sailors on any ship she encountered only one question Is King Alexander alive Greek to which the correct answer was He lives and reigns and conquers the world Greek This answer would please her and she would accordingly calm the waters and bid the ship farewell Any other answer would enrage her and she would stir up a terrible storm dooming the ship and every sailor on board This legend derives from an Alexander romance entitled the Phyll da tou Megal xandrou dating to the Ottoman Greece period first printed in br br Rusalkas are the Slavic counterpart of the Greek sirens and naiads often seducing sailors to their doom The nature of rusalkas varies among folk traditions but according to ethnologist D K Zelenin they all share a common element they are the restless spirits of the unclean dead They are usually the ghosts of young women who died a violent or untimely death either by murder or suicide before their wedding especially by drowning Rusalkas are said to inhabit lakes and rivers They appear as beautiful young women with long pale green hair and pale skin suggesting a connection with floating weeds and days spent underwater in faint sunlight They can be seen after dark dancing together under the moon and calling out to young men by name luring them to the water and drowning them The characterization of rusalkas as both desirable and treacherous is prevalent in Russia Ukraine and Belarus and was emphasized by nineteenth century Russian authors The best known of the great Czech nationalist composer Anton n Dvo k s operas is Rusalka br In Sadko Russian an East Slavic epic the title character an adventurer merchant and gusli musician from Novgorod lives for some time in the underwater court of the Sea Tsar and marries his daughter Chernava before finally returning home The tale inspired such works as the poem Sadko by Alexei Tolstoy the opera Sadko composed by Nikolai Rimsky Korsakov and the painting Sadko by Ilya Repin br br A merfolk race called the Di people are described as populating its own nation in the Shanhaijing Classic of Mountains and Seas compilation of Chinese geography and mythology dating from the fourth century BC The ancient work also included several types of human headed fish such as the chiru or red ru fish as well as creature with some humanlike qualities like the renyu or human fish br Note that these are not of a specific gender so they are not really conducive to being called mermaids though some English European writers might use mermaid as shorthand br There is also an account of the hairenyu literally sea human fish given in the Taiping guangji compilation sourced from the work entitled Qiawenji The female of its kind had a head like beautiful woman s with hair like a horse s tail and white skin like jade without scales covered with multicolored downy hair or peach fuzz and legless The male and female had sexual organs like humans so that widows and widowers would keep them in their ponds and the creatures could perform sexual intercourse normally as a human would br An anecdote considered relevant concerns a renyu human fish allegedly seen by the ship carrying Zha Dao and emissary to Korea She had an unkempt hairdo and scarlet mane extending to the back of her elbows Zha ordered the crew to bring her aboard with poles but she escaped Zha explained that she was a renyu adept at copulating with humans and was a type of human dwelling in the sea The anecdote in the lost Cuyiji Records of Bygone Extraordinay Things from the Northern Song period survives in quotes e g from leishu compilation Gujin tushu jicheng Comprehensive Compendium of Illustrations and Books Ancient and Modern br br Korea is bound on three sides by the sea In some villages near the sea in Korea there are mysterious stories about mermaids Mermaids have features just like humans Kim Dam Ryeong a mayor of the town saved four captured mermaids from a fisherman as recorded in the Eou yadam unofficial histories In Dongabaek Island of Busan is a tale of Princess Hwang ok from Naranda a mythical undersea kingdom of mermaids this tale is based on the historical Heo Hwang ok from India Another tale concerns a mermaid named Sinjike Korean who warned fishermen of impending storms by singing and throwing rocks into the sea from Geomun Island The island s residents believed her to be a goddess of the sea and that she could predict the weather br br The Japanese equivalent is ningyo literally human fish According to one dictionary ningyo oftentimes refers to a half woman and half fish fabulous creature i e mermaid though not necessarily female i e includes mermen br Despite the dictionary stating it has the appearance of half woman half fish the creature has been pictorialized rather as a being with a human female head sitting on a body which is entirely fish like see fig right br br The ningyo s flesh was purported to be an elixir and consuming its flesh said to bestow remarkable longevity br A famous ningyo legend concerns the Yao bikuni who is said to have partaken of the flesh of a merfolk and attained miraculous longevity and lived for centuries It is not discernible whether the flesh was a female a pair of translators call it flesh of a mermaid in one book but merely a strange fish with a human face in another br br A ningyo might be counted as a y kai since it is included in Toriyama Sekien s Hyakki Yagy series Gender is unclear as it is only described as a being with a human face a fish body However Sekien s ningyo picture actually represents a human fish that lives in Western China also known as the Di people Diren according to the inscription printed alongside They are described in the Classic of Mountains and Seas and translated as the Low People or the Di People br br In Hinduism Suvannamaccha lit golden mermaid is a daughter of Ravana who appears in the Cambodian and Thai versions of the Ramayana She is a mermaid princess who tries to spoil Hanuman s plans to build a bridge to Lanka but falls in love with him instead She is a popular figure in Thai folklore br br In Thailand Suvannamaccha is a daughter of Tosakanth appearing in the Thai and other Southeast Asian versions of Ramayana She is a mermaid princess who tries to spoil Hanuman s plans to build a bridge to Lanka but falls in love with him instead br In Cambodia she is referred as Sovanna Maccha a favorite for Cambodian audiences br br In the Javanese culture of Indonesia Nyai Roro Kidul is a sea goddess and the Queen of the Southern Seas the mermaid queen is said to inhabit the southern beach in Java She has many forms in her mermaid form she is called Nyai Blorong br br In the Tagalog language mermaids are known as sirena and siyokoy respectively The general term for mermaid among all ethnic groups is Sirena br In the Philippines mermaid concepts differ per ethnic group Among the Pangasinense the Binalatongan mermaid is a Queen of the sea who married the mortal Maginoo Palasipas and ruled humanity for a time Among the Ilocano mermaids were said to have propagated and spread through the union of the first Serena and the first Litao a water god Among the Bicolano mermaids were referred as Magindara known for their beautiful voice and vicious nature Among the Sambal mermaids called Mambubuno are depicted as having two fins instead of one br br Mermaids and mermen are also characters of The myth of Pania of the Reef a well known tale of M ori mythology has many parallels with stories of sea people in other parts of the world br br Mami Water Lit Mother of the Water are water spirits venerated in West Central and southern Africa and in the African diaspora in the Caribbean and parts of North Central and South America They are usually female but are sometimes male They are regarded as diabolical beings and are often femme fatales luring men to their deaths The Persian word or maneli means mermaid br Among the Shona of Zimbabwe njuzu are mermaid like spirits The juengu also known as the Itongo Sea Queen of Cameroon is sometimes depicted as half woman and half fish br br The One Thousand and One Nights collection includes several tales featuring sea people such as Jullan r the Sea born and Her Son King Badr B sim of Persia Unlike depictions of mermaids in other mythologies these are anatomically identical to land bound humans differing only in their ability to breathe and live underwater They can and do interbreed with land humans and the children of such unions have the ability to live underwater In the tale Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman the protagonist Abdullah the Fisherman gains the ability to breathe underwater and discovers an underwater society that is portrayed as an inverted reflection of society on land The underwater society follows a form of primitive communism where concepts like money and clothing do not exist In The Adventures of Bulukiya the protagonist Bulukiya s quest for the herb of immortality leads him to explore the seas where he encounters societies of mermaids br br The Neo Ta no nations of the Caribbean identify a mermaid called Aycayia with attributes of the goddess Jagua and the hibiscus flower of the majagua tree Hibiscus tiliaceus In modern Caribbean culture there are a number of mermaids that are derived from West African originals and taken by slaves These include Watramama in Suriname and Guyana Mamadjo in Grenada Yemanya or Yemaya in Brazil and Cuba Erzulie in Haiti and Lamant in Martinique There is a mermaid recognized as a Haitian vodou loa called Lasir n from the French French la sir ne the mermaid representing wealth beauty and romance but also the possibility of death br br In Brazilian folklore the iara also known as m e d agua lady mother of the water is a water dwelling beauty whom fishermen are prone to fall prey to According to eighteenth century sources she is a long haired woman who enchant men by night and those who scucumb die drowned by passion Folklore also blamed disappearances of men on the Iara who lured them singing in the indigenous language Other commentators insist Iara is a beautiful white woman who lives in a river reputedly golden haired though the blond blue eyed image was not attested until after the mid nineteenth century to the best knowledge of Camara Cascudo Cascudo in his earlier writing contended that though the Iara was rooted in two indigenous beings the water devil Ipupiara cf below and the Cobra Grande he also saw the combining of the Portuguese lore of the Enchanted Moura moorish girl who was obviously dark skinned The Iara became increasingly to be regarded as a woman fish after the image of the European sirens mermaids br It is often argued that the legends of the Iara developed around the eighteenth century out of the indigenous myth of the Ipupiara among the Tupinamb people The Ipupiara was originally conceived of as a male water dweller that carried fishermen to the bottom devouring their mouths nose fingertips and genitals European writers during the age of exploration disseminated the myth but the Gandavo included an illustration of Hipupi ra with female breasts Subsequently the Jesuit Cardim wrote that the Igpupi ra also consisted of females that look like women with long hair Though somewhat vague in the case of Gandavo Cardim had clearly injected Christian opinion which would readily relegate the role of emasculating men to the female kind Later with the introduction of African slaves the Yoruba myth of Iemanj was admixed into the telling br br In his Natural History Pliny the Elder remarked that a triton merman was seen off the coast of Olisipo present day Lisbon Portugal and it bore the physical appearance in accordance with common notion of the triton according to a deputation from Lisbon who reported it to Emperor Tiberus One nereid was sighted earlier on the same Lisbon coast Pliny remarks that contrary to popular notion the true nereids are not smooth skinned in their human like portions but covered with scales all over the body Their mournful songs at death have also been heard by the coastal inhabitants Also multiple nereids had washed up on the shore according to the legatus governor of Gaul who informed the late Emperor Augustus about it in a letter br Sixteenth century Swedish writer Olaus Magnus quotes the same passage from Pliny and further notes that the nereid are said to utter dismal moans wailings at the hour of her death thus observing a connection to the legend of sea nymphs and the sister Fates whose clashing cymbals and flute tunes could be heard on shore Olaus in a later passage states that the nereids tr mermaids are known to sing plaintively in general br It has been conjectured that these carcasses of nereids washed up on shore were presumably seals br br In sailing off the coast of Hispaniola Christopher Columbus spotted three mermaids Spanish sirenas which he said were not as beautiful as they are represented due to masculine features in their faces He is widely believed to have seen manatees not mermaids br During Henry Hudson s second voyage on June members of his crew reported sighting a mermaid in the Arctic Ocean either in the Norwegian or Barents Seas br Dutch explorer David Danell during his expeditions to Greenland in claimed to have spotted a mermaid with flowing hair and very beautiful though the crew failed to capture it br br Danish physician and natural historian Thomas Bartholin wrote about a mermaid specimen caught in Brazil probably a manatee and subsequently dissected at Leiden Though referred to in the text as a sea man homo marinus from Brazil the account was accompanied by an engraved drawing captioned Sirene whose appearance was that of a humanoid female with bared breasts a mermaid The specimen s body was deformed and without the sign of a tail matching the drawing And a membrane that join the fingers together is also reflected in the drawing as well as her webbed pair of hands forepaws br The specimen s account and illustration was later reproduced by Linnaeus who captioned the beast Siren Bartholini hence Bartholin s Siren br Bartholin was actually not the sole proprietor of the specimen but he came into possession of its hand and ribs which he also illustrated in his book figures above Based on the illustration the hand has been determined to be the front flipper belonging to a manatee by a team of researchers br Bartholin himself had argued that it was a sea mammal closely related to seals phocae His rationale was that since there are several marine counterparts to land mammals e g sea horses the possibility of a marine creature with striking likeness to humans could not be ruled out though they should all be classified among seal kind br Erasmus Francisci Erasmus Finx associated this Brazilian specimen with the local native lore of the Yupiapra Ipupiara br br A type of mermaid referred to as anthropomorphus or woman fish Spanish peche mujer allegedly inhabited the Spanish ruled Philippines particularly in the waters around the Visayan Islands according to contemporary writings from the seventeenth century br The accounts are found in several books on various topics from magnetism to natural history to ecclesiastical history br These books refer to the mermaid merman as piscis anthropomorphos Dutch Anthropomorphus and emphasize how human like they appear in their upper bodies as well as providing woodcut or etchings illustrating the male and female of the part human part fish creature br The woman fish or peche mujer in modern Spanish was the name given to the creature among the Spaniards but the sources also state it was called duyon by the indigenous people and it is assumed the actual creature was a dugong according to modern translators notes br Several of these sources mention the medical use of the woman fish to control the flow of blood or the four humours It was effective for staunching the bleeding i e effective against hemorrhages according to Jonston Other sources mention the ability to stop bleeding e g Col n who also thought that the Philippine woman fish tasted like fatty pork The bones were made into beads i e strung together as it was believed effective against defluxions of the humours br br Allegedly captured in the Moluccas in the seventeenth century was the so called Amboina mermaid after the then Dutch Province of Ambon which its leading researcher has referred to as Samuel Fallours s Sirenne after the man who came into possession of it and made an original painting of it in full color br The painting was reproduced by Louis Renard on the Fish of the region first published in br It was supposedly caught by Boeren in Ambon Province Buru in present day Maluku Province presumably around the years or perhaps the year precisely During this period Fallours served briefly as soldier for the VOC Dutch East India Company starting June but turned associate curate Krankbezoeker for the Dutch Reformed Church September to June br Fallour s mermaid with additional details were described by Fran ois Valentijn in a book br The mermaid was Dutch inches duimen long or feet in Rhineland measures She reportedly survived days hours in a water tank and died after refusing food it was given having uttered no intelligible sound or issuing sounds like screechings of a mouse French souris Something like a straw cape Japanese mino appears wrapped around her waist in the painting according to one commentator but Fallours revealed in his notes that he lifted the front and back fins and found it was shaped like a woman br The mermaid was suspected to be a dugong in reality even by contemporary scholars such as Georg Rumphius although Valentijn was unable to believe they were the one and the same Leading researcher Theodore
