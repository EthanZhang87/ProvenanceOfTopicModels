id: 31318495
The Chronicles of Narnia is a series of seven fantasy novels for children written by C S Lewis It is considered a classic of children s literature and is the author s best known work having sold over million copies in languages The series borrows characters and ideas from Classical Norse Irish Arthurian Islamic Jewish and Christian mythology Of all the mythologies taken into consideration the Christian one is the most fundamental for the Narnia series due to the themes covered br br br Christian parallels br Specific Christian parallels may be found in the entries for individual books and characters br C S Lewis was an adult convert to Christianity and had previously authored some works on Christian apologetics and fiction with Christian themes However he did not originally set out to incorporate Christian theological concepts into his Narnia stories it is something that occurred as he wrote them As he wrote in his essay Sometimes Fairy Stories May Say Best What s To Be Said br br Some people seem to think that I began by asking myself how I could say something about Christianity to children then fixed on the fairy tale as an instrument then collected information about child psychology and decided what age group I d write for then drew up a list of basic Christian truths and hammered out allegories to embody them This is all pure moonshine I couldn t write in that way It all began with images a faun carrying an umbrella a queen on a sledge a magnificent lion At first there wasn t anything Christian about them that element pushed itself in of its own accord br Lewis an expert on the subject of allegory and the author of The Allegory of Love maintained that the Chronicles were not allegory on the basis that there is no one to one correspondence between characters and events in the books and figures and events in Christian doctrine He preferred to call the Christian aspects of them suppositional This indicates Lewis view of Narnia as a fictional parallel universe As Lewis wrote in a letter to a Mrs Hook in December br br If Aslan represented the immaterial Deity in the same way in which Giant Despair a character in The Pilgrim s Progress represents despair he would be an allegorical figure In reality however he is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question What might Christ become like if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours This is not allegory at all br Although Lewis did not consider them allegorical and did not set out to incorporate Christian themes in Wardrobe he was not hesitant to point them out after the fact In one of his last letters written in March Lewis writes br br Since Narnia is a world of Talking Beasts I thought He Christ would become a Talking Beast there as He became a man here I pictured Him becoming a lion there because a the lion is supposed to be the king of beasts b Christ is called The Lion of Judah in the Bible c I d been having strange dreams about lions when I began writing the work The whole series works out like this br The Magician s Nephew tells the Creation and how evil entered Narnia br The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe the Crucifixion and Resurrection br Prince Caspian restoration of the true religion after corruption br The Horse and His Boy the calling and conversion of a heathen br The Voyage of the Dawn Treader the spiritual life specially in Reepicheep br The Silver Chair the continuing war with the powers of darkness br The Last Battle the coming of the Antichrist the Ape the end of the world and the Last Judgement br With the release of the film there was renewed interest in the Christian parallels found in the books Some find them distasteful while noting that they are easy to miss if one is not familiar with Christianity Alan Jacobs author of The Narnian The Life and Imagination of C S Lewis implies that through these Christian aspects Lewis becomes a pawn in America s culture wars Some Christians see the Chronicles as excellent tools for Christian evangelism The subject of Christianity in the novels has become the focal point of many books br Rev Abraham Tucker pointed out that While there are in the Narnia tales many clear parallels with Biblical events they are far from precise one on one parallels Aslan sacrifices himself in order to redeem Edmund the Traitor who is completely reformed and forgiven That is as if the New Testament were to tell us that Jesus Christ redeemed Judas Iscariot and that Judas later became one of the Apostles There had been times in Christian history when Lewis might have been branded a heretic for far smaller creative innovations in theology br Alan Jacobs professor of English at Wheaton College describes The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe as a twofold story the rightful king of Narnia returns to re establish his kingdom and bring peace and that same king sacrifices himself to save a traitor kingdom and salvation are what the story is all about The similarity between the death and resurrection of Aslan and the death and resurrection of Jesus in the Bible has been noted one author has noted that like Jesus Aslan was ridiculed before his death mourned and then discovered to be absent from the place where his body had been laid Other authors have likened the character of Edmund to the Judas of the four Gospels In this interpretation the girls Susan and Lucy who witness Aslan s death mourn him and witness his resurrection would stand for The Three Marys of Christian tradition Stanley Mattson president of the Redlands Calif based C S Lewis Foundation states that the Deeper Magic referred to in the book is all about redemption it s all about reconciliation it s all about healing and it s all about death being swallowed up in victory br br br Paganism br Lewis has also received criticism from some Christians and Christian organizations who feel that The Chronicles of Narnia promotes soft sell paganism and occultism because of the recurring pagan themes and the supposedly heretical depictions of Christ as an anthropomorphic lion The Greek god Dionysus and the Maenads are depicted in a positive light with the caveat that meeting them without Aslan around would not be safe although they are generally considered distinctly pagan motifs Even an animistic River god is portrayed in a positive light According to Josh Hurst of Christianity Today not only was Lewis hesitant to call his books Christian allegory but the stories borrow just as much from pagan mythology as they do the Bible His books have also been criticized by non religious critics who feel it is religious propaganda br Lewis himself believed that pagan mythology could act as a preparation for Christianity both in history and in the imaginative life of an individual and even suggested that modern man was in such a lamentable state that perhaps it was necessary first to make people good pagans and after that to make them Christians He also argued that imaginative enjoyment of as opposed to belief in classical mythology has been a feature of Christian culture through much of its history and that European literature has always had three themes the natural the supernatural believed to be true practiced religion and the supernatural believed to be imaginary mythology Colin Duriez author of three books on Lewis suggests that Lewis believed that to reach a post Christian culture one needed to employ pre Christian ideas Lewis disliked modernity which he regarded as mechanized and sterile and cut off from natural ties to the world By comparison he had hardly any reservations about pre Christian pagan culture As Christian critics have pointed out Lewis disdained the non religious agnostic character of modernity but not the polytheistic character of pagan religion br Calormen is the only openly pagan society within the fictional Narnian world Their practices centre around Tash a god who is imagined to be an ancestor of the Calormene royal family Additionally there are lesser gods like Azaroth and Zardeenah The Calormene religion can be compared to pre Islamic Middle Eastern paganism br br br Religious and secular reception br The initial critical reception was generally positive and the series quickly became popular with children In the time since then it has become clear that reaction to the stories both positive and negative cuts across religious viewpoints Although some saw in the books potential proselytising material others insisted that non believing audiences could enjoy the books on their own merits br The Narnia books have a large Christian following and are widely used to promote Christian ideas Narnia tie in material is marketed directly to Christian even to Sunday school audiences As noted above however a number of Christians have criticized the series for including pagan imagery or even for misrepresenting the Christian story Christian authors who have criticised the books include fantasy author J K Rowling on ethical grounds and literary critic John Goldthwaite in The Natural History of Make Believe on the grounds that in creating the Narnia world Lewis is flirting with bad faith and playing at polytheism br J R R Tolkien was a close friend of Lewis a fellow author and was instrumental in Lewis own conversion to Christianity As members of the Inklings literary group the two often read and critiqued drafts of their work Nonetheless Tolkien was not enthusiastic about the Narnia stories in part due to the eclectic elements of the mythology and their haphazard incorporation in part because he disapproved of stories involving travel between real and imaginary worlds Though a Catholic himself Tolkien felt that fantasy should incorporate Christian values without resorting to the obvious allegory Lewis employed br Reaction from non Christians has been mixed as well Philip Pullman an atheist supporter of secularism and humanism has serious objections to the Narnia series On the other hand the books have appeared in Neo pagan reading lists by the Wiccan author Starhawk among others Positive reviews of the books by authors who share few of Lewis religious views can be found in Revisiting Narnia edited by Shanna Caughey br The producers of the film hoped to tap into the large religious audience revealed by the success of Mel Gibson s film The Passion of the Christ and at the same time hoped to produce an adventure film that would appeal to secular audiences but they and the reviewers as well worried about aspects of the story that could variously alienate both groups br Two full length books examining Narnia from a non religious point of view take diametrically opposite views of its literary merits David Holbrook has written many psychoanalytic treatments of famous novelists including Dickens Lawrence Lewis Carroll and Ian Fleming His book The Skeleton in the Wardrobe treats Narnia psychoanalytically speculating that Lewis never recovered from the death of his mother and was frightened of adult female sexuality He characterises the books as Lewis failed attempt to work out many of his inner conflicts Holbrook does give higher praise to The Magician s Nephew and Till We Have Faces Lewis reworking of the myth of Cupid and Psyche as reflecting greater personal and moral maturity Holbrook also plainly states his non belief in Christianity br In contrast to Holbrook Laura Miller s The Magician s Book A Skeptic s Guide to Narnia finds in the Narnia books a deep spiritual and moral meaning from a non religious perspective Blending autobiography and literary criticism Miller a co founder of Salon com discusses how she resisted her Catholic upbringing as a child she loved the Narnia books but felt betrayed when she discovered their Christian subtext As an adult she found deep delight in the books and decided that these works transcend their Christian elements Ironically a section in His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman one of Narnia s severest critics about how children acquire grace from innocence but adults from experience had a profound influence on Miller s later appreciation of the
