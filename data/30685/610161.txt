title: Fantastique
id: 610161
Fantastique is a French term for a literary and cinematic genre and mode that is characterized by the intrusion of supernatural elements into the realistic framework of a story accompanied by uncertainty about their existence The concept comes from the French literary and critical tradition and is distinguished from the word fantastic which is associated with the broader term of fantasy in the English literary tradition According to the literary theorist Tzvetan Todorov Introduction la litt rature fantastique the fantastique is distinguished from the marvellous by the hesitation it produces between the supernatural and the natural the possible and the impossible and sometimes between the logical and the illogical The marvellous on the other hand appeals to the supernatural in which once the presuppositions of a magical world have been accepted things happen in an almost normal and familiar way The genre emerged in the th century and knew a golden age in th century Europe particularly in France and Germany br br br Definition br Three major critical sources in French literary theory give the same fundamental definition of the concept Le Conte fantastique en France de Nodier Maupassant of Pierre Georges Castex De la f erie la science fiction of Roger Caillois and Introduction la litt rature fantastique of Tzvetan Todorov In these three essays the fantastique is defined as the intrusion of supernatural phenomena into an otherwise realist narrative It evokes phenomena which are not only left unexplained but which are inexplicable from the reader s point of view In this respect Tzvetan Todorv explains that the fantastique is somewhere between the French concept of marvellous merveilleux where the supernatural is accepted and entirely reasonable in the imaginary world of a non realist narrative and the uncanny trange in French where apparently supernatural phenomena are explained and accepted as normal In an English speaking theoritical perspective it can therefore been considered as a subgenre of fantasy br Instead characters in a work of fantastique are just like the readers unwilling to accept the supernatural events that occur This refusal may be mixed with doubt disbelief fear or some combination of those reactions The fantastique is often linked to a particular ambiance a sort of tension in the face of the impossible A good deal of fear is often involved either because the characters are afraid or because the author wants to provoke fright in the reader However fear is not an essential component of fantastique br The French concept of fantastique in literature should therefore not be confused with the marvellous or fantasy where the supernatural is posited and accepted from the outset with science fiction which is rational or with horror although these genres can be combined br However the English term fantastic can sometimes be used in the French sense as in the Literary Encyclopedia since the term was translated as above in the English translation of Todorov s essay This is nonetheless a minority use and much of the English critical literature that discusses fantastic literature associates the word with a broader meaning related to fantasy as in the works of Eric Rabkin Rosemary Jackson Lucy Armitt and David Sandner The polysemy of the word fantastic and the difference of critical traditions of each country have led to controversies such as the one led by Sanislaw Lem br The word is also polysemous in French a distinction must be made between the academic definition and the everyday meaning In everyday language the word can refer to anything to do with the supernatural Some people use in French the term m di val fantastique to refer to high fantasy but it is not a term used by academic critics br br br Related genres br The fantastique is often considered to be very close to science fiction However there are important differences between them science fiction is not supernatural but rational H G Wells s The Time Machine for example is a science fiction novel because the hero travels back in time using a machine designed for the purpose in other words using a technological process that while unknown in the current state of human knowledge is presented as technological and therefore cannot be described as supernatural br The fantastique narratives also differs from fantasy ones such as those by J R R Tolkien when in fact they belong to the realm of the marvellous It should also be noted that in the English speaking world fantastique literature is not considered a separate genre but rather a sub genre of low fantasy The fantastique then combines the same characteristics as intrusion fantasy as defined by Farah Mendlesohn The fantastique is also related to magic realism a genre based as well on the insertion of supernatural elements into a realistic narrative However the supernatural is considered normal making magic realism a branch of the marvellous rather than the fantastique br Tzvetan Todorov thus defines the fantastique as being somewhere between the uncanny i e a reality whose limits are pushed to the limit as in Edgar Allan Poe s The Fall of the House of Usher in which a rational analysis can be adopted and the marvellous where supernatural elements are considered normal the fantastique is this in between this moment when the mind still hesitates between a rational and irrational explanation As a final condition for the appearance of the fantastique he adds a realistic universe or context the setting must be perceived as natural in order to introduce the marks of the supernatural and thus the hesitation that leads to the fantastique br The Fantastique can encompass both works of the horror and gothic genres Two representative stories might be br br Algernon Blackwood s story The Willows where two men traveling down the Danube River are beset by an eerie feeling of malice and several improbable setbacks in their trip the question that pervades the story is whether they are falling prey to the wilderness and their own imaginations or if there really is something horrific out to get them br Edgar Allan Poe s story The Black Cat where a murderer is haunted by a black cat but is it revenge from beyond the grave or just a cat br The fantastique is sometimes erroneously called the Grotesque or Supernatural fiction because both the Grotesque and the Supernatural contain fantastic elements yet they are not the same as the fantastique is based on an ambiguity of those elements br In Russian literature the fantastic encompasses science fiction called science fantastic fantasy and other non realistic genres br br br History br br br Origins br When Charles Nodier wants to invent a fantastique history when Nerval recalls Cazotte as an initiator in spite of himself they both refer without hesitation to The Golden Ass also called Metamorphoses by Apuleius st c AD The hero of the Metamorphoses is supposed to come to a particularly mysterious region of Greece Thessaly The witches of this province were renowned and the protagonist Lucius was transformed into a donkey after using the wrong ointment A whole section of the novel from the moment Lucius is metamorphosed to the moment he regains his primitive form escapes the fantastique and foreshadows the future course of picaresque heroes Only the beginning when the witches magic remains uncertain could be considered fantastique Works of fantastique however only began to appear in the th century and this type of literature reached its golden age in the th century br br br From Marvellous to Fantastique br Baroque whether in the form of novels plays or even operas was the link between the Merveilleux of the Renaissance and the more formalized fairy tales of the Enlightenment period The undeniable popularity of the genre was in great part attributable to the fact that Fairy Tales were safe they did not imperil the soul a serious concern for a nation which had just come out of an era of great religious persecution and they appropriately reflected the grandeur of the Sun King s reign Even if fairy tales and marvellous novels don t belong to the fantastique they contributed to the emergence of the genre in Europe since the creatures found in fantastique literature that invade reality often come from marvellous literature br Cazotte is often considered as the creator of the fantastique genre in France with his novel Le Diable amoureux The Devil in Love sub titled un roman fantastique so labeled for the first time in literary history In it a young nobleman Alvare conjures up a demon who assumes the shape of a beautiful woman Biondetta At the end of the story the young woman disappears and we don t know if she ever really existed Another work in the same vein was Vathek a novel written directly into French in by English born writer William Thomas Beckford A Byronic figure steeped in occult knowledge and sexual perversions Beckford allegedly wrote his novel non stop in three days and two nights in a state of trance Finally in the very strange Le Manuscrit Trouv Saragosse The Manuscript Found in Saragossa was published Like Vathek it was written directly into French by a non French writer the Polish count and scientist Jan Potocki br br br Gothic Novel br The real source of the fantastique genre is the English Gothic novel of late In addition to the emergence of fantastique themes ghosts the Devil vampires these novels characterised by a more pronounced atmosphere of horror introduced the ambiguity characteristic of the genre Among the most representative works are Horace Walpole s The Castle of Otranto Matthew Gregory Lewis s The Monk Ann Radcliffe s The Mysteries of Udolpho William Godwin s Caleb Williams Charlotte Dacre s Zofloya or the Moor and Charles Robert Maturin s Melmoth the Wandering Man br br br Frenetic romanticism br In France the discovery of English Gothic novels gave rise to a profusion of so called frenetic novels roman fr n tique also known as roman noir Still strongly influenced by the marvellous these romantic works of the s introduced a taste for horror and the macabre into the French novel br The frenetic novel reached its apogee with the petits romantiques P trus Borel in Champavert Contes immoraux and especially in Madame de Putiphar was even more provocative than the English writers particularly in his indulgence in the horrible The cruelty of Champavert s stories foreshadows Auguste de Villiers de L Isle Adam What s more Borel wrote a truly fantastique tale Gottfried Wolfgang br Among the outstanding works of the French Gothic period are novels which having been written with the aim of parodying the tales of Lewis and Radcliffe have become authentic roman noir The literary critic Jules Janin wrote L ne mort et la femme guillotin e Similarly Fr d ric Souli s Les m moires du Diable which combined the roman fr n tique with the passions of the Marquis de Sade br Notable works in that category include br br Coelina ou l Enfant du Myst re Coelina or The Child Of Mystery by Fran ois Guillaume Ducray Duminil br Victor Hugo with Han d Islande Han Of Iceland a bloody tale featuring a Viking warrior and a mythical bear Bug Jargal and the morbid and romantic L Homme qui Rit a k a The Man Who Laughs about a horribly disfigured man who lived in th century England br br br Birth of the real fantastique in Germany br Fantastique literature in the strict sense of the terme was born in Germany in the early th century with Adelbert von Chamisso Peter Schlemilh then Achim von Arnim and E T A Hoffmann Hoffmann s fantastique is characterised by exaltation chaos and frenzy The novel The Devil s Elixirs which claims to be a descendant of Lewis s The Monk often incoherently accumulates episodes of very different kinds a love story aesthetic or political meditations picaresque adventures a family epic mystical ecstasies etc The theme of madness and solitude is central to both Hoffmann s and Chamisso s work br Hoffmann had a universal and almost continuous influence on the genre His tales form a veritable repertoire of the fantastique subsequently adapted by other authors and in other arts opera ballet cinema br br br The French Fantastique in the th Century br br br The Rise of fantastique in France br From the s Hoffmann s tales were translated into French by Lo ve Veimars and met a spectacular success After Jacques Cazotte s Le Diable amoureux Nodier was one of the first French writers to write fantastique tales However he saw this genre as nothing more than a new way of writing marvellous stories for him fantastique was a pretext for dreaming and fantasy In fact he wrote a study on the fantastique which shows that for Nodier the line between the marvellous and the fantastique is quite blurred Populated by ghosts vampires and the undead his texts nevertheless possess the hallmarks of the fantastique ambiguity uncertainty and disquiet His best known tales are Smarra ou les d mons de la nuit Smarra or The Demons Of The Night a series of terrifying dream based tales Trilby ou le lutin d argail La F e aux miettes In this last work a young carpenter is devoted to the eponymous Fairy who may be the legendary Queen of Sheba In order to restore her to her true form he searches for the magical Singing Mandragore br Then several of the greatest names in French literature stated to write in this genre Honor de Balzac author of a dozen fairy tales and three fantastique novels was also influenced by Hoffmann Apart from L lixir de longue vie and Melmoth r concili his main fantastique work is La Peau de chagrin in which the main character has made a pact with the Devil he buys a skin of sorrow that has the power to grant all his wishes but which symbolising his life shrinks every time he uses it Despite the fantastique component this novel is rooted in realism Balzac uses description to paint the sights of Paris he brings in the psychology and social situation of his characters However Balzac s fantastique work is not conceived as an end in itself At the very least Balzac does not seek to frighten or surprise the reader and does not involve vampires or werewolves of any kind Rather it is a work of reflection set within the framework of the Com die humaine Through the allegorical power of his characters and situations Balzac is above all writing philosophical tales We can mention as well Falthurne by Honor de Balzac a novel about a virgin prophetess who knows occult secrets that date back to Ancient Mesopotamia Also of note by Balzac Le Centenaire The Centenarian about a man seeking higher dimensions the aptly named La Recherche de l Absolu The Search For The Absolute whose hero is an alchemist and Melmoth R concili Melmoth Reconciled br A great admirer of Hoffmann Th ophile Gautier is a key writer of fantastique literature Inhabited by fantastique and the desire to escape his tales are among the most accomplished in terms of storytelling technique Gautier excels at keeping the reader guessing throughout his stories and surprising them at the punch line He wrote a number of masterpieces that regularly feature in anthologies devoted to the fantastique such as La Cafeti re and La Morte amoureuse In La Morte Amoureuse Th ophile Gautier told the story of a young priest who falls in love with a beautiful female vampire In it the vampire is not a soulless creature but a loving and erotic woman Gautier s Avatar and Spirite are roman spirites which deal with the theme of life after death br Prosper M rim e wrote only a very small number of fantastique works a few short stories at most but they are of the highest quality La V nus d Ille in particular is one of the most famous short stories in the genre it features a pagan statue that comes to life and kills a young groom on his wedding night Lokis and Vision de Charles XI are also among his successes M rim e also translated Pushkin s The Queen of Spades and published a study on Nicholas Gogol the master of Russian fantastique br Guy de Maupassant is clearly one of the greatest authors of fantastique literature His work is marked by realism the genre in which he built his reputation and is firmly rooted in everyday life His recurring themes are fear anxiety and above all madness which he fell into shortly before his death These themes can be found in his masterpiece Le Horla In the form of a diary the narrator recounts his anxieties caused by the presence of an invisible being The hesitation is based on the narrator s possible madness In Maupassant s work the blend of realism and fantastique is often driven by the madness of one of the protagonists bringing his distorted vision of the world into the real world The Horla a word coined by Maupassant most likely means Out there implying that this invisible being comes from another world There are two versions of Le Horla by the same author the second version ends with the main character being committed to a psychiatric hospital br In G rard de Nerval collaborated with Alexandre Dumas on L Alchimiste The Alchemist Mentally unhinged after a lover s death Nerval developed an interest in mystical beliefs especially in his book Les Illumin s After writing fantastique texts influenced by the German Romanticism of Goethe and Hoffmann G rard de Nerval wrote a major work Aur lia in a more poetic and personal style He also wrote another text in a similar style La Pandora br Other notable works at that time include br br Cyprien B rard s Lord Rutwen ou les Vampires which was adapted into a stage play by Charles Nodier the same year and starred John William Polidori s vampire character Lord Ruthven br The three volume La Vampire by tienne L on de Lamothe Langon which tells the story of a young Napoleonic army officer who bring his Hungarian fianc e home to later discover that she is a vampire and Le Diable The Devil featuring the charismatic evil Chevalier Draxel br Rustic legends of the Alsace were also the main source of inspiration of mile Erckmann and Alexandre Chatrian a writing team who signed their works Erckmann Chatrian Their first collection Les Contes Fantastiques Fantastic Tales includes the classic short story L Araign e Crabe The Crab Spider about a blood sucking lake monster with the body of a spider and the head of a man br Alexandre Dumas p re was finely attuned to the literary marketplace The success of Hoffmann s Tales and of the Thousand And One Nights influenced him to write Les Mille et Un Fant mes A Thousand And One Ghosts an anthology of macabre tales Dumas wrote his own version of Lord Ruthwen in Le Vampire Finally in he penned one of the first modern werewolf stories Le Meneur de Loups The Leader Of Wolves br Edgar Quinet wrote Ahasv rus a lengthy and sophisticated poetic narrative about the Wandering Jew br Eug ne Sue s own Wandering Jew narrative Le Juif Errant The Wandering Jew was serialized in Dumas Isaac Laquedem appeared in br Paul F val p re was one of the most important fantastique writers of the period with Les Revenants Revenants La Fille du Juif Errant The Daughter Of The Wandering Jew the macabre La Vampire The Vampire Countess and La Ville Vampire The Vampire City which parodied Ann Radcliffe making her the book s fictional heroine br br br Fin de Si cle Symbolism and Fantastique br The end of the th century saw the rise of so called decadent literature whose favourite themes were cruelty vice and perversity In the wake of works such as Joris Karl Huysmans rebours Against Nature L Bas Down There and Jules Barbey d Aurevilly s Les Diaboliques fantastique was no longer an end in itself but a means of conveying a provocation a denunciation or an aesthetic desire During this period there were no longer any fantastique writers but many authors who wrote a few fantastique texts Tales became more mannered descriptions became richer and exoticism and eroticism became important elements Finally the fantastique tale provided an opportunity for social criticism often directed against bourgeois materialism as in Villiers de L Isle Adam s Contes cruels Cruel Tales and Tribulat Bonhomet The decadent Symbolists also made extensive use of fantastique in their tales which were not far removed from fable and allegory br L on Bloy wrote two collections of stories Sueurs de sang and Histoires d sobligeantes Although not all his stories are fantastique they do have a strange or supernatural ring to them Writing in an incendiary style Bloy was determined to shock his readers with the cruelty of his stories Another writer who made anything cruel unhealthy or sordid his favourite source of inspiration was Jean Lorrain author of Monsieur de Phocas one of the key works of fin de si cle literature His many fantastique tales can be found in several collections the best of which is undoubtedly Histoires de masques We can mention as well Buveurs d mes Soul Drinkers Les contes d un buveur d ther and the kabbalistic novel La Mandragore br The Symbolist author Marcel Schwob hardly unmoved to the deleterious atmosphere of decadent works managed to reconcile this aesthetic with the vein of the fantastic Using the marvellous and the power of allegory he wrote two collections of tales C ur Double and Le Roi au masque d or The collection Histoires magiques by another symbolist writer R my de Gourmont in which the influence of Villiers de L Isle Adam is undeniable is also worth mentioning and is the only one by its author to contain fantastique tales br In Henri de R gnier wrote a collection of three important fantastique stories Histoires incertaines whose aesthetic is directly influenced by fin de si cle literature br Other notable works of this category include br br Octave Mirbeau s sadistic and mean spirited tales of murders cannibalism and ghostly revenge collected in Le Jardin des Supplices Torture Garden br Also from Belgium Franz Hellens a precursor of the surrealists displayed a lyrical romantic approach to fantasy Les Hors le Vent The Out Wind and Nocturnal explored into the land of dreams which he dubbed the second life while his novel M lusine was generally considered a pre surrealist novel br br br Victorian England br Victorian England produced few fantastique writers in the strict sense of the term as the subtle ambiguities inherent in the genre found little echo in the English literary tradition Thomas de Quincey s short stories for example are more clearly in the tradition of the Gothic novel than that of fantastique The Irishman Sheridan Le Fanu wrote Carmilla a Gothic novel whose originality lies in the character of the homosexual female vampire It inspired the famous Dracula by his compatriot Bram Stoker the undisputed masterpiece of vampire stories Oscar Wilde also wrote one of the most famous Anglo Saxon fantastique novels The Portrait of Dorian Gray in which the main character sees his portrait age and take on every mark of his vices while he possesses eternal youth and indulges in every excess In this text Wilde develops his thoughts on aestheticism and depicts the conflict between physical and moral decay Sensuality and homosexuality also permeate the work Far beyond the realm of fantastique this novel had a strong influence on French literature particularly on decadent writers Oscar Wilde also wrote a parody of a ghost story The Canterville Ghost br One British writer Arthur Llewelyn Jones also known as Arthur Machen was born on March in Wales and died on December aged in England He is particularly associated with fantastique literature notably with his first novel The Great God Pan The Anglo American writer Henry James regularly tackled fantastique in the course of his literary career and more specifically ghost stories His most accomplished work is The Nutcracker a benchmark in the art of vacillating between rational and irrational explanations James s allusive style leads the reader to doubt each of the protagonists in turn so that the ultimate truth of the story is not revealed at the end that choice is left to the reader This book is also remarkable for the ghostly nature of its characters br Other famous writers have penned some fantastique texts including Robert Louis Stevenson Dr Jeckyll and Mr Hyde Markheim Olalla and Rudyard Kipling br This period also saw the birth of new genres of popular literature close to the fantastique mystery fiction with Wilkie Collins science fiction with H G Wells and Mary Shelley and fantasy with William Morris and George MacDonald br br br American Fantastique br At its birth in the early th century American literature was strongly influenced by the English Gothic novel and fantastique Nathaniel Hawthorne then Washington Irving and above all Edgar Allan Poe also made the short story and the tale their preferred forms of expression Poe also played a special role in developing his own aesthetic theory He was also one of the pioneers of science fiction and detective fiction Washington Irving one of the first great American writers wrote many tales that were closer to legend than to the supernatural strictly speaking He is characterised by his realism and ironic tone His best known collection is the Sketch Book which contains the tale of Rip Van Winckle one of the first two truly original American works of fantastique along with William Austin s Peter Rugh the Missing br Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote a number of works involving the supernatural They are marked by oppression in Puritan America and have the recurring theme of curses in reference to legends of witchcraft Although fantastique occupies little space in his abundant output Francis Marion Crawford is the author of a collection of high quality in the genre Wandering Ghosts While drawing on this tradition H P Lovecraft gave it a particular twist closer to horror Lovecraft went on to inspire many twentieth century authors including Stephen King br br br Russian Fantastique br Alexander Pushkin introduced the fantastique genre to Russia with his famous short story The Queen of Spades From then on fantastique became a favourite genre in Russian literature finding its themes in folk tales and legends Works such as Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy s The Family of Vourdalak and Nikolai Gogol s The Frightful Vengeance are examples of fantastique that is close to the marvellous a character of its own in realist works marked by deep concern and greater sincerity than the literary masterpieces that emerged from the fantastique craze particularly in France Such is the case with Gogol s The Cloak and Nikolai Leskov s The White Eagle This realism was to be found much later in Andrei Biely s novel Petersburg and in Fyodor Sologub s The Petty Demon br Encouraged by Pushkin Nicholai Gogol published some fantastique tales the most famous of which are The Nose and The Diary of a Madman published in the collection of Petersburg short stories These stories introduced a rather profound change in the nature of the fantastique tradition Fear played a negligible role but the absurd and the grotesque became an essential element This new style was emulated in Russia itself The Double one of Dostoyevsky s first novels was directly inspired by Gogol s work br br br Fantastique in German Expressionism br The beginning of the th century saw the rise of dark pessimistic fantastique in German speaking countries The works published during this period became sources of inspiration for the expressionist cinema that was developing in Germany Gustav Meyrink was one of the greatest fantastique writers of the period A great lover of the occult he distilled occultist theories in his novels with the aim of initiating his readers His most famous novel The Golem was inspired by the Kabbalah It depicts a degraded and miserable humanity in the Jewish quarter of Prague His other major fantastique novel was Walpurgis Night Its theme is violence and collective madness and it echoes the butchery of the First World War br A more controversial figure Hanns Heinz Ewers is the author of an abundant oeuvre which although it often veers more towards the uncanny than the fantastique remains largely in the realm of the supernatural With a pronounced penchant for the macabre blood and unhealthy eroticism his works are intended to be provocative and have often been judged immoral Ewers is best known for his novel Mandragore He wrote another significant novel The Sorcerer s Apprentice as well as numerous short stories the best known of which is The Spider br In the Austrian writer and illustrator Alfred Kubin published a single fantastique novel The Other Side which reflects the nightmarish atmosphere of his drawings This novel in which dreams and reality form an inextricable skein is considered by Peter Assman Kubin s main biographer to be an essential step in the development of European fantastique literature br Other important fantastique works written during this period include Leo Perutz s The Marquis of Bolibar and Alexander Lernet Holenia s Baron Bagge It was also during this period that Franz Kafka wrote The Metamorphosis often considered to be a fantastique short story br br br Belgian Fantastique br The development of a particular kind of fantasy literature in Belgium in the th century is a curious but indisputable fact It is all the more important to mention it because fantastique plays a central role in Belgian literature in general Belgian fantastique emerged from symbolism and realism at the end of the nineteenth century Symbolism created an atmosphere conducive to the intrusion of the supernatural whether through allegory enchantment or allusiveness The major work of this movement is Bruges la Morte by Georges Rodenbach Alongside symbolism a realist and rustic movement developed whose main representative was Georges Eekhoud Marked by a realism of excess and hyperbole his work includes a major collection Cycles patibulaires br Two writers helped bring Belgian fantastique to maturity Franz Hellens and Jean Ray The former alternating between symbolism and realism distinguished himself in a genre that is sometimes described as magic realism His main works are Nocturnal and Les r alit s fantastiques Jean Ray was a true innovator of supernatural literature in the th century He has the particularity of having considered the fantastique genre as a whole and devoted himself exclusively to it He began his career as a pulp writer using a variety of aliases and had several stories published in Weird Tales He is the author of an unbridled fantastique whose greatest success is Malpertuis ans he wrote short stories steeped in the rich mist shrouded atmosphere of his native Flanders Finally Michel de Ghelderode in addition to his impressive theatrical work also wrote Sortil ges a collection of fantastique short stories that is one of the masterpieces of the genre br br br The French Fantastique in the th Century br br br th century prior to World War II br The confidence displayed by French Society in the early s was sapped by the slaughter of World War I the Dadaist and Surrealist movements expressed a desire to break violently with the past In the Andr Breton s Manifesto of Surrealism inspired by Freudian discoveries challenged the realist attitude contested the reign of logic and called for imagination and dreams to regain their rights Breton however said little about fantastique Indeed the surrealism generally favours the marvellous over the fantastique even if it influenced the genre A non literary influence on the fantastique writers was that of Sigmund Freud br Some of the major contributors of the period include br br In La R volte des anges The Revolt Of The Angels Anatole France wrote a startling tale in which the Fallen angel Arcade schemes to organize a new revolt among the fallen angels who are living on Earth posing as artists br Blaise Cendrars openly declared his admiration for Gustave Le Rouge His La Fin du Monde Film e par l Ange The End Of The World Filmed By An Angel and Moravagine are surrealist novels the latter named after and telling the story of an evil madman whose crimes rival those of Fant mas a character much appreciated by the Surrealists br The Faustian Marguerite de la Nuit Marguerite Of The Night by Pierre Mac Orlan was also made into a film br Jules Supervielle a writer of Basque descent incorporated Hispanic vistas and fantasy themes in his novel L Enfant de la Haute Mer The Child From The High Sea br Playwright Jean Giraudoux combined tragedy humor and fantasy in Intermezzo where a timid ghost revolutionizes a small town and Ondine about a water sprite who falls in love with a mortal br Julien Gracq s first novel The Castle of Argol combined the effects of the roman noir with the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud The book takes place in a Gormenghast like castle where the young owner his friend and the beautiful Heide spend their time playing morbid and decadent games In Gracq published the brilliant The Opposing Shore which won the Prix Goncourt and takes place in the fictional country of Orsenna br br br Fantastique Feuilletons br Between the wars the fantastique catered to the masses by providing cheap entertainment in the form of feuilletons such as Le Journal des Voyages Lectures Pour Tous and L Intr pide and paperbacks from publishers such as Ollendorff M ricant F renczi and Tallandier Significant names of the times include br br Gaston Leroux with La Double Vie de Theophraste Longuet The Double Life Of Theophraste Longuet in which a retired merchant is possessed by the spirit of th century French highwayman Cartouche the Hoffmannesque L Homme qui a Vu le Diable The Man Who Saw The Devil the classic Le Fant me de l Op ra a k a The Phantom of the Opera and Le Coeur Cambriol The Burglared Heart br Andr de

Prix Goncourt literary award wrote La Maison des Hommes Vivants The House Of Living Men in which a sect of immortals founded by the Count of St Germain steals others life forces in order to preserve their own immortality br One of the most distinctive genre writers of the s who also blended genres with deceptive facility was Pierre V ry whose mystery novels always incorporated surreal or supernatural elements Some of his works squarely belonged in the fantasy genre such as Le Pays sans toiles The Starless Country and Tout Doit Dispara tre le Mai Everything Must Go On May a collection of fantastic tales br br br th century post World War II br World War II exacted both a huge physical and psychological toll on French culture France s defeat in followed by four years of occupation confronted writers with choices they never before had to face The discovery of the atom bomb and the Cold War introduced sharp new fears Mainstream French culture increasingly frowned upon works of imagination and preferred instead to embrace the more naturalistic and political concerns of the existentialists such as Jean Paul Sartre and Albert Camus Yet paradoxically despite being marginalized by critics and the literary establishment the fantastique thrived as never before both in terms of quality and quantity br Significant foreign influences on French modern fantastique include Franz Kafka Jorge Luis Borges H P Lovecraft Dino Buzzati Julio Cort zar Vladimir Nabokov and Richard Matheson Other more recent influences included Stephen King Clive Barker none of whom were well known in France before the early s In Latin America of the st century authors such as C sar Aira Roberto Bola o Jos Baroja Andr s Neuman Juan Gabriel V squez Jorge Volpi among others stand out br Some of the most interesting authors and works up to the s are br br Marcel B alu s fantasy followed the path of Hoffman Poe and G rard de Nerval In his stories hapless souls became slowly trapped in dream like realities where inhuman forces held sway L Exp rience de la Nuit The Experience Of Night deals with the power to see into other dimensions L Araign e d Eau The Water Spider is about an impossible love between a man and a watery creature who slowly turns into a girl br Marcel Brion s approach of the supernatural almost always referred to the romantic tradition and the search for a mystical absolute His most famous collection of stories is Les Escales de la Haute Nuit The Shore Leaves Of The Deepest Night br Andr Pieyre de Mandiargues gift was to make the invisible visible with an implacable sense of logic and an almost maniacal precision His stories are collected in Le Mus e Noir The Black Museum and Soleil des Loups The Sun Of The Wolves br Andr Dh tel used adolescents as protagonists

of horror novels including books by Marc Agapit B R Bruss Maurice Limat Kurt Steiner Andr Caroff s Madame Atomos series and Jean Claude Carri re s series of Frankenstein novels br The prolific Claude Seignolle s brand of fantastique was influenced by his sorcerous childhood spent in the misty plains of his native Sologne and a terrifying encounter with the Devil incarnated in a local warlock which he claimed to have experienced at age in This conferred a real sense of authenticity to Seignolle s books which were almost devoid of any literary artifices His major works include La Malvenue The Illcome and the collections Histoires Mal fiques Maleficent Tales and Contes Macabres Macabre Stories br Other notable authors include br br br Analysis br For Todorov the fantastique requires the fulfillment of three conditions First the text must oblige the reader to consider the world of the characters as a world of living persons and to hesitate between a natural or supernatural explanation of the events described Second this hesitation may also be experienced by a character thus the reader s role is so to speak entrusted to a character and at the same time the hesitation is represented it becomes one of the themes of the work in the case of naive reading the actual reader identifies himself with the character Third the reader must adopt a certain attitude with regard to the text he will reject allegorical as well as poetic interpretations The fantastique also explores three conditions reader s hesitation hesitation may be felt by another character and the reader must have a certain mindset when reading the text There is also a system to the fantastique that he explores that uses three properties The utterance which discusses the use of figurative discourse how everything figurative is taken in a literal sense The supernatural begins to exist within the fantastique due to exaggeration figurative expression being taken literal and how the supernatural originates from the rhetorical figure Leading into the second property the act of uttering In this property it is most connected to the narrator of the story and the idea discourse wise is that the narrator character must pass this test of truth The narrator is someone who cannot lie they explain the supernatural marvelous but doubt in what they say creates the fantastique The final property is the syntactic aspect Penzoldt s theory is what focuses on this property the most br br The structure of the ideal ghost story may be represented as a rising line which leads to the cumulating point Which is obviously the appearance of the ghost Most authors try to achieve a certain gradation in their assent to this culmination first speaking vaguely then more and more directly br The fantastique can also represent dreams and wakefulness where the character or reader hesitates as to what is reality or what is a dream Again the fantastic is found in this hesitation once it is decided the fantastique ends br br br Examples br br br In literary works br Many of Edgar Allan Poe s short works br Henry James The Turn of the Screw seen by Todorov as one of the few examples of pure Fantastique br
