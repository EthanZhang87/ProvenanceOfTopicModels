of Moses Dresser Phillips a publisher from Boston created The Atlantic Monthly The plan for the magazine was launched at a dinner party which was described in a letter by Phillips br br I must tell you about a little dinner party I gave about two weeks ago It would be proper perhaps to state the origin of it was a desire to confer with my literary friends on a somewhat extensive literary project the particulars of which I shall reserve till you come But to the Party My invitations included only R W Emerson H W Longfellow J R Lowell Mr Motley the Dutch Republic man O W Holmes Mr Cabot and Mr Underwood our literary man Imagine your uncle as the head of such a table with such guests The above named were the only ones invited and they were all present We sat down at three P M and rose at eight The time occupied was longer by about four hours and thirty minutes than I am in the habit of consuming in that kind of occupation but it was the richest time intellectually by all odds that I have ever had Leaving myself and literary man out of the group I think you will agree with me that it would be difficult to duplicate that number of such conceded scholarship in the whole country besides Each one is known alike on both sides of the Atlantic and is read beyond the limits of the English language br At that dinner he announced his idea for the magazine br br Mr Cabot is much wiser than I am Dr Holmes can write funnier verses than I can Mr Motley can write history better than I Mr Emerson is a philosopher and I am not Mr Lowell knows more of the old poets than I But none of you knows the American people as well as I do br The Atlantic s first issue was published in November and quickly gained notability as one of the finest magazines in the English speaking world br
