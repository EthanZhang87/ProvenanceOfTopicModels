A merman pl mermen also known as merlad the male counterpart of the mythical female mermaid is a legendary creature which is human from the waist up and fish like from the waist down but may assume normal human shape Sometimes mermen are described as hideous and other times as handsome br br br Antiquity br Perhaps the first recorded merman was the Assyrian Babylonian sea god Ea called Enki by the Sumerians linked to the figure known to the Greeks as Oannes However while some popular writers have equated Oannes of the Greek period to the god Ea and to Dagon Oannes was rather one of the apkallu servants to Ea br The apkallu have been described as fish men in cuneiform texts and if Berossus is to be believed Oannes was indeed a being possessed of a fish head and man s head beneath and both a fish tail and manlike legs But Berossus was writing much later during the era of Greek rule engaging in the construction of the past Thus even though figurines have been unearth to corroborate this fish man iconography these can be regarded as representing human figures clad in fish cloaks rather than a being with a fish head growing above the human head And the god Ea is also seen as depicted wearing a fish cloak by modern scholars br br br Greco Roman mythology br br Triton of Greek mythology was depicted as a half man half fish merman in ancient Greek art Triton was the son of the sea god Poseidon and sea goddess Amphitrite Neither Poseidon nor Amphitrite were merfolk although both were able to live underwater as easily as on land br Tritons later became generic mermen so that multiple numbers of them were depicted in art br Tritons were also associated with using a conch shell in the later Hellenistic period In the th century Triton was referred to as the trumpeter of Neptune Neptuni tubicen in Marius Nizolius s Thesaurus and this phrase has been used in modern commentary The Elizabethan period poet Edmund Spenser referred to Triton s trompet as well br Another notable merman from Greek mythology was Glaucus He was born a human and lived his early life as a fisherman One day while fishing he saw that the fish he caught would jump from the grass and into the sea He ate some of the grass believing it to have magical properties and felt an overwhelming desire to be in the sea He jumped in the ocean and refused to go back on land The sea gods nearby heard his prayers and transformed him into a sea god Ovid describes the transformation of Glaucus in the Metamorphoses describing him as a blue green man with a fishy member where his legs had been br br br Medieval period br br br Marmennill br br A merman is called marmennill in Old Norse attested in the Ladn mab k An early settler in Iceland c th century allegedly caught a merman while fishing and the creature prophesied one thing the man s son will gain possession of the piece of land where the mare Sk lm chooses to lie down under her load In a subsequent fishing trip the man was drowned survived by the boy who stayed behind br br br Hafstrambr br The hafstrambr is a merman described as a counterpart to the hideous mermaid marg gr in the Konungs skuggsj King s mirror c He is said to generally match her anthropomorphic appearance on the top half though his lower half is said to have been never been seen In actuality it may have been just a sea mammal hooded seal Cystophora cristata or the phenomenon of some sea creature appearing magnified in size caused by mid range mirage br Medieval Norsemen may have regarded the hafstrambr as the largest sorts of mermen which would explain why the word for marmennill little mer man would be given in the diminutive br Other commentators treat the hafstrambr merely as an imaginary sea monster br br br Early cartography br A twin tailed merman is depicted on the Bianco world map A merman and a mermaid are shown on the Behaim globe c br br br Renaissance period br br br Gesner s sea satyr br br Konrad Gesner in his chapter on Triton in Historia animalium IV gave the name of sea Pan or sea satyr Latin Pan vel satyrus marinus to an artist s image he obtained which he said was that of an ichthyocentaur or sea devil br Gesner s sea devil German Meerteufel has been described by a modern commentator as having the lower body of a fish and the upper body of a man the head an horns of a buck goat or the devil and the breasts of a woman and lacks the horse legs of a typical centaur Gesner made reference to a passage where Aelian writes of satyrs that inhabit Taprobana s seas counted among the fishes and cete Ancient Greek romanized k t sea monsters br This illustration was apparently ultimately based on a skeletal specimen and mummies Gesner explained that such a creature was placed on exhibit in Rome on November Elsewhere in Gesner s book it is stated the sea monster monstrum marinum viewed on this same date was the size of a year old child It has been remarked in connection to this by one ichthyologist that mermen created by joining the monkey s upper body with a fish s lower extremity have been manufactured in China for centuries and such merchandise may have been imported into Europe by the likes of the Dutch East India Company by this time cf Bartholin s siren Mummies Feejee mermaids were certainly being manufactured in Japan in some quantity by the th century or even earlier cf Hoaxes and sideshows br The sea satyr e appears in Edmund Spenser s poem The Faerie Queene and glossed by Francis J Child as a type of ichthyocentaur on the authority of Gesner br br br Scandinavian folklore br br br Marbendill br br Icelandic folklore beliefs speak of sea dwelling humans humanoids known as marbendlar sing marbendill which is the later Norse and modern Icelandic form of marmennill br J n l r i Gu mundsson the Learned d s writings concerning elves includes the merman or marbendill as a water elf This merman is described as seal like from the waist down J n the Learned also wrote down a short tale or folktale concerning it which has been translated under the titles The Merman and Of Marbendill br J n rnasson building on this classification divided the water elves into two groups the male marbendill vs the female known variously as hafg gur haffr marg gur or meyfiskur But in current times hafmey i the common designation of the mermaid This gender classification however is not in alignment with the medieval source described above which pairs the marg gr with the hafstrambr br br br Havmand br According to Norwegian folklore dating back to the th century havmand takes the mermaid havfrue as wife and the offspring or young they produce are called marm ler sing Norwegian marm le br Norwegian mermen havm nd were later ascribed the general characteristic that they are of a dusky hue with a long beard black hair and from the waist upwards resemble a man but downwards are like a fish br While the marm ler does literally mean sea talker the word is thought to be a corruption of marmenill the aforementioned Old Norse term for merman br br br Prophesying br An alleged marmennill prophesying to an early Icelandic settler has already been noted cf Medieval period In the story The Merman a captured marbendill laughs thrice and when pressed reveals to the peasant his insight buried gold wife s infidelity dog s fidelity on promise of release The peasant finds wonderful gray milk cows next to his property which he presumes were the merman s gift the unruly cows were made obedient by bursting the strange bladder or sac on their muzzle with the stick he carried br br br Abductions br In Sweden the superstition of the merman Swedish hafsman abducting a human girl to become his wife has been documented H lsingland early th century the merman s consort is said to be occasionally spotted sitting on a holme small island laundering her linen or combing her hair br There is a Swedish ballad Swedish visa entitled Hafsmannen about a merman abducting a girl the Danish ballad Rosmer Havmand is a cognate ballad based on the same legend br Agnete og Havmanden is another Scandinavian ballad work with this theme but it is of late composition late th century It tells of a merman who had been mated to a human woman named Agnete the merman unsuccessfully pleaded with her to come back to him and their children in the sea br br br English folklore br English folklorist Jacqueline Simpson surmises that as in Nordic Scandinavian countries the original man like water dwellers of England probably lacked fish like tails A wildman caught in a fishnet described by Ralph of Coggeshall c was entirely man like though he liked to eat raw fish and eventually returned to the sea Katharine Mary Briggs opined that the mermen are often uglier and rougher in the British Isles br Mermen which seldom frequent American folklore are supposedly depicted as less beautiful than mermaids br br br Celtic folklore br The Irish fakelore story of The Soul Cages features a male merrow named Coomara a hideous creature with green hair teeth and skin narrow eyes and a red nose The tale was created by Thomas Keightley who lifted the plot from one of the Grimms collected tales Deutsche Sagen No Der Wassermann und der Bauer or The Waterman and the Peasant br In Cornish folklore into early modern times the Bucca described as a lonely mournful character with the skin of a conger eel and hair of seaweed was still placated with votive offerings of fish left on the beach by fishermen Similarly vengeful water spirits occur in Breton and Gaelic lore which may relate to pre Christian gods such as Nechtan br br br China and Japan br In China and in Japan there are various accounts of human fish Chinese renyu Japanese ningyo and these presumably occurred in male forms also br However Chinese human fish have been described and illustrated as resembling a catfish and not quite so human like cf merfolk Renyu or human fish br Illustrated depictions of male ningyo do exist from the Edo Period cf Ningyo Male ningyo One example is the picture of male human fish otoko ningyo hand copied by the young lord of Hirosaki Domain Another is the illustrated sheet of kawaraban newspaper carrying news of the ningyo from Holland bearing the face of an old man br br br Hairen or kaijin br br In China and Japan there are also accounts of the sea human Chinese hairen Japanese kaijin some of these accounts are of European origin br A known description of the hairen occurs in a work in Chinese called Zhifang waiji actually written by a European Here Ai Rul e Giulio Aleni stated that there are two kinds of hairen The example of the first kind had a beard br The second type of hairen described by Aleni was actually a female woman identifiable as the Mermaid of Edam captured in with drooping skin as if she were dressed in a pao type of robe br Later a Japanese source Nagasaki bunkenroku gave description of the kaijin encompassing features of both types it had chin hair as well as a skin flap around the waist similar to a hakama These trouser like hakama was worn by men as well as women in some cases br An older though perhaps lesser known account of hairen occurs in Shaozi or Shao Yong s work called Caomuzi which describes the creature as having the shape of a Buddhist priest though diminutive in stature It has been equated with the umib zu sea priest sea acolyte priest y kai of Japan br br br Folklore elsewhere br br In Finnish mythology a vetehinen a type of neck is sometimes portrayed as a magical powerful bearded man with the tail of a fish He can cure illnesses lift curses and brew potions but he can also cause unintended harm by becoming too curious about human life br In the Inuit folklore of Greenland and northern Canada the Auvekoejak is a furry merman br In an Italian folktale with medieval roots Cola Pesce Nicholas Fish was a human boy until his mother cursed him to become part fish As a merman he occasionally assisted fishermen but was summoned by a king who ordered him to explore the seabed and bring back items Cola Pesce reluctantly went on the king s errands only to disappear br The boto river dolphins of the Amazon River regions of northern Brazil is described according to local lore as taking the form of a human or merman also known as encantado enchanted one in Portuguese and with the habit of seducing human women and impregnating them br In the folklore of the Dogon of Mali ancestral spirits called Nommo had humanoid upper torsos legs and feet and a fish like lower torso and tail br br br In heraldry br br Mermen or tritons see uncommon use in British heraldry where they appear with the torso head and arms of a man upon the tail of a fish They are typically used as supporters and are rarely used as charges br br br Hoaxes and sideshows br br A stuffed specimen of the merfolk was exhibited in London in was later billed Fiji mermaid by P T Barnum and put on display in the Barnum s American Museum New York in Although billed as a mermaid this has also been bluntly referred to as a Barnum s merman in one piece of journalism This specimen was an example of fake mermaids posed in The Scream style named after Edvard Munch s painting mermaids in this pose were commonly made in the late th and early th century in Japan br A similar fake mermaid at the Horniman Museum has also been relabeled by another curator as a merman where mermen or feejee mermaids are used as generic terms for such concocted mummies DNA testing was inconclusive as to species and nothing on gender was disclosed but despite being catalogued as a Japanese Monkey fish it was determined to contain no monkey parts but only the teeth scales etc of fish br Another merman specimen supposedly found in Banff Alberta is displayed at the Indian Trading Post Other such mermen which may be composites of wood carvings parts of monkeys and fish are found in museums around the world for example at the Booth Museum in Brighton br Such fake mermaids handcrafted from monkeys and fish were being made in China and the Malay Archipelago and imported by the Dutch since the mid th century according to ichthyologist E W Gudger Several natural history books published around this time c s carried entries on the mermaid like monk fish sea monk and the bishopfish sea bishop and Gudger suspected these were misinformation based on the aforementioned hoax mermaids from the East br Gudger also noted that the mermaid like bishopfish could well be simulated by a dried specimen of a ray A dried ray bears a vaguely anthropomorphic shape and can be further manipulated to enhance its desired monstrous look Such figures made of sharks and rays eventually came to be known as Jenny Hanivers in Great Britain br br br Literature and popular culture br Matthew Arnold wrote a poem called The Forsaken Merman about a merman whose human wife abandoned him and their children Mermen may feature in science fiction and fantasy literature The Merman s Children by American writer Poul Anderson is inspired by the ballad Agnete og Havmanden Science fiction writer Joe Haldeman wrote two books on Attar the Merman in which genetically enhanced mermen can communicate telepathically with dolphins Samuel R Delany wrote the short story Driftglass in which mermen are deliberately created surgically as amphibious human beings with gills while in J K Rowling s Harry Potter a race of merpeople live in a lake outside Hogwarts br Mermen sometimes appear in modern comics games television shows and films Although they were once depicted largely as being unattractive in some traditions as described in previous sections in some modern works mermen are portrayed as handsome strong and brave In the television series Man from Atlantis the merman as played by Patrick Duffy is described as a survivor from Atlantis In the DC Comics mythology mermen are a common fixture of the Aquaman mythos often showing a parochialistic rivalry with humanoid water breathers The mermen or merfolk also appear in the Dungeons Dragons game Three mermen are featured in the music video for Madonna s song Cherish br The Australian TV series Mako Island of Secrets a spin off of H O Just Add Water includes a teenage boy named Zac played by Chai Hansen who turns into a merman The CG animated film Barbie Mermaidia
