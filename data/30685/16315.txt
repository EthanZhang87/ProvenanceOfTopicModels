Joseph John Campbell March October was an American writer He was a professor of literature at Sarah Lawrence College who worked in comparative mythology and comparative religion His work covers many aspects of the human experience Campbell s best known work is his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces in which he discusses his theory of the journey of the archetypal hero shared by world mythologies termed the monomyth br Since the publication of The Hero with a Thousand Faces Campbell s theories have been applied by a wide variety of modern writers and artists His philosophy has been summarized by his own often repeated phrase Follow your bliss He gained recognition in Hollywood when George Lucas credited Campbell s work as influencing his Star Wars saga br Campbell s approach to folklore topics such as myth and his influence on popular culture has been the subject of criticism especially from academic folklorists br br Joseph Campbell was born in White Plains New York on March the elder son of hosiery importer and wholesaler Charles William Campbell from Waltham Massachusetts and Josephine n e Lynch from New York Campbell was raised in an upper middle class Irish Catholic family he related that his paternal grandfather Charles had been a peasant who came to Boston from County Mayo in Ireland and became the gardener and caretaker at the Lyman Estate at Waltham where his son Charles William Campbell grew up and became a successful salesman at a department store prior to establishing his hosiery business During his childhood he moved with his family to New Rochelle New York In a fire destroyed the family home in New Rochelle killing his maternal grandmother and injuring his father who tried to save her br In Campbell graduated from the Canterbury School in New Milford Connecticut While at Dartmouth College he studied biology and mathematics but decided that he preferred the humanities He transferred to Columbia University where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature in and a Master of Arts degree in medieval literature in At Dartmouth he had joined Delta Tau Delta An accomplished athlete he received awards in track and field events and for a time was among the fastest half mile runners in the world br In Campbell traveled to Europe with his family On the ship during his return trip he encountered the messiah elect of the Theosophical Society Jiddu Krishnamurti they discussed Indian philosophy sparking in Campbell an interest in Hindu and Indian thought In he received a fellowship from Columbia University to study in Europe Campbell studied Old French Proven al and Sanskrit at the University of Paris and the University of Munich He learned to read and speak French and German br On his return to Columbia University in Campbell expressed a desire to pursue the study of Sanskrit and modern art in addition to medieval literature Lacking faculty approval Campbell withdrew from graduate studies Later in life he jested that it is a sign of incompetence to have a PhD in the liberal arts the discipline covering his work br br With the arrival of the Great Depression Campbell spent the next five years living in a rented shack in Woodstock New York There he contemplated the next course of his life while engaged in intensive and rigorous independent study He later said that he would divide the day into four three hour periods of which I would be reading in three of the three hour periods and free one of them I would get nine hours of sheer reading done a day And this went on for five years straight br Campbell traveled to California for a year continuing his independent studies and becoming a close friend of the budding writer John Steinbeck and his wife Carol Campbell had met Carol s sister Idell on a Honolulu cruise and she introduced him to the Steinbecks Campbell had an affair with Carol On the Monterey Peninsula Campbell like John Steinbeck fell under the spell of the marine biologist Ed Ricketts the model for Doc in Steinbeck s novel Cannery Row as well as central characters in several other novels Campbell lived for a while next door to Ricketts participated in professional and social activities at his neighbor s and accompanied him along with Xenia and Sasha Kashevaroff on a journey to Juneau Alaska on the Grampus Campbell began writing a novel centered on Ricketts as a hero but unlike Steinbeck did not complete his book br Bruce Robison writes that br br Campbell would refer to those days as a time when everything in his life was taking shape Campbell the great chronicler of the hero s journey in mythology recognized patterns that paralleled his own thinking in one of Ricketts s unpublished philosophical essays Echoes of Carl Jung Robinson Jeffers and James Joyce can be found in the work of Steinbeck and Ricketts as well as Campbell br Campbell continued his independent reading while teaching for a year in at the Canterbury School in Connecticut during which time he also attempted to publish works of fiction While teaching at the Canterbury School Campbell sold his first short story Strictly Platonic to Liberty magazine br br In Campbell accepted a position as Professor of Literature at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers New York In he married one of his former students the dancer choreographer Jean Erdman For most of their years of marriage they shared a two room apartment in Greenwich Village in New York City In the s they also purchased an apartment in Honolulu and divided their time between the two cities They did not have any children br Early in World War II Campbell attended a lecture by the Indologist Heinrich Zimmer the two men became good friends After Zimmer s death Campbell was given the task of editing and posthumously publishing Zimmer s papers which he would do over the following decade br In as the last volume of Zimmer s posthumous treatise The Art of Indian Asia Its Mythology and Transformations was finally about to be published Campbell took a sabbatical from Sarah Lawrence College and traveled for the first time to Asia He spent six months in southern Asia mostly India and another six in East Asia mostly Japan This year had a profound influence on his thinking about Asian religion and myth and also on the necessity for teaching comparative mythology to a larger non academic audience br In Campbell retired from Sarah Lawrence College after having taught there for years br br Campbell attended a Grateful Dead concert in and marveled that Everyone has just lost themselves in everybody else here With Grateful Dead Campbell put on a conference called Ritual and Rapture from Dionysus to the Grateful Dead br Campbell died at his home in Honolulu Hawaii on October from complications of esophageal cancer Before his death he had completed filming the series of interviews with Bill Moyers that aired the following spring as The Power of Myth He is buried in O ahu Cemetery Honolulu br br Campbell often referred to the work of modern writers James Joyce and Thomas Mann in his lectures and writings as well as to the art of Pablo Picasso He was introduced to their work during his stay as a graduate student in Paris Campbell eventually corresponded with Mann br The works of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche had a profound effect on Campbell s thinking he quoted their writing frequently br The follow your bliss philosophy attributed to Campbell following the original broadcast of The Power of Myth see below derives from the Hindu Upanishads however Campbell was possibly also influenced by the Sinclair Lewis novel Babbitt In The Power of Myth Campbell quotes from the novel br br The anthropologist Leo Frobenius and his disciple Adolf Ellegard Jensen were important to Campbell s view of cultural history Campbell was also influenced by the psychological work of Abraham Maslow and Stanislav Grof br Campbell s ideas regarding myth and its relation to the human psyche are dependent in part on the pioneering work of Sigmund Freud but in particular on the work of Jung whose studies of human psychology greatly influenced Campbell Campbell s conception of myth is closely related to the Jungian method of dream interpretation which is heavily reliant on symbolic interpretation Jung s insights into archetypes were heavily influenced by the Bardo Thodol also known as The Tibetan Book of the Dead In his book The Mythic Image Campbell quotes Jung s statement about the Bardo Thodol that it br br belongs to that class of writings which not only are of interest to specialists in Mahayana Buddhism but also because of their deep humanity and still deeper insight into the secrets of the human psyche make an especial appeal to the layman seeking to broaden his knowledge of life For years ever since it was first published the Bardo Thodol has been my constant companion and to it I owe not only many stimulating ideas and discoveries but also many fundamental insights br br Campbell s concept of monomyth one myth refers to the theory that sees all mythic narratives as variations of a single great story The theory is based on the observation that a common pattern exists beneath the narrative elements of most great myths regardless of their origin or time of creation Campbell often referred to the ideas of Adolf Bastian and his distinction between what he called folk and elementary ideas the latter referring to the prime matter of monomyth while the former to the multitude of local forms the myth takes in order to remain an up to date carrier of sacred meanings The central pattern most studied by Campbell is often referred to as the hero s journey and was first described in The Hero with a Thousand Faces An enthusiast of novelist James Joyce Campbell borrowed the term monomyth from Joyce s Finnegans Wake Campbell also made heavy use of Carl Jung s theories on the structure of the human psyche and he often used terms such as anima animus and ego consciousness br As a strong believer in the psychic unity of mankind and its poetic expression through mythology Campbell made use of the concept to express the idea that the whole of the human race can be seen as engaged in the effort of making the world transparent to transcendence by showing that underneath the world of phenomena lies an eternal source which is constantly pouring its energies into this world of time suffering and ultimately death To achieve this task one needs to speak about things that existed before and beyond words a seemingly impossible task the solution to which lies in the metaphors found in myths These metaphors are statements that point beyond themselves into the transcendent The Hero s Journey was the story of the man or woman who through great suffering reached an experience of the eternal source and returned with gifts powerful enough to set their society free br As this story spread through space and evolved through time it was broken down into various local forms masks depending on the social structures and environmental pressures that existed for the culture that interpreted it The basic structure however has remained relatively unchanged and can be classified using the various stages of a hero s adventure through the story stages such as the Call to Adventure Receiving Supernatural Aid Meeting with the Goddess Atonement with the Father and Return These stages as well as the symbols one encounters throughout the story provide the necessary metaphors to express the spiritual truths the story is trying to convey Metaphors for Campbell in contrast with similes which make use of the word like pretend to a literal interpretation of what they are referring to as in the sentence Jesus is the Son of God rather than the relationship of man to God is like that of a son to a father br In the documentary Joseph Campbell A Hero s Journey he explains God in terms of a metaphor br br God is a metaphor for a mystery that absolutely transcends all human categories of thought even the categories of being and non being Those are categories of thought I mean it s as simple as that So it depends on how much you want to think about it Whether it s doing you any good Whether it is putting you in touch with the mystery that s the ground of your own being If it isn t well it s a lie So half the people in the world are religious people who think that their metaphors are facts Those are what we call theists The other half are people who know that the metaphors are not facts And so they re lies Those are the atheists br br Campbell often described mythology as having a fourfold function within human society These appear at the end of his work The Masks of God Creative Mythology as well as various lectures br br The Mystical Metaphysical Function br Awakening and maintaining in the individual a sense of awe and gratitude before the mystery of being and his or her participation in it br According to Campbell the absolute mystery of life what he called transcendent reality cannot be captured directly in words or images Symbols and mythic metaphors on the other hand point outside themselves and into that reality They are what Campbell called being statements and their enactment through ritual can give to the participant a sense of that ultimate mystery as an experience Mythological symbols touch and exhilarate centers of life beyond the reach of reason and coercion The first function of mythology is to reconcile waking consciousness to the mysterium tremendum et fascinans of this universe as it is br The Cosmological Function br Explaining the shape of the universe br For pre modern societies myth also functioned as a proto science offering explanations for the physical phenomena that surrounded and affected their lives such as the change of seasons and the life cycles of animals and plants br The Sociological Function br Validate and support the existing social order br Ancient societies had to conform to an existing social order if they were to survive at all This is because they evolved under pressure from necessities much more intense than the ones encountered in our modern world Mythology confirmed that order and enforced it by reflecting it into the stories themselves often describing how the order arrived from divine intervention Campbell often referred to these conformity myths as the Right Hand Path to reflect the brain s left hemisphere s abilities for logic order and linearity Together with these myths however he observed the existence of the Left Hand Path mythic patterns like the Hero s Journey which are revolutionary in character in that they demand from the individual a surpassing of social norms and sometimes even of morality br The Pedagogical Psychological Function br Guide the individual through the stages of life br As a person goes through life many psychological challenges will be encountered Myth may serve as a guide for successful passage through the stages of one s life br br Campbell s view of mythology was by no means static and his books describe in detail how mythologies evolved through time reflecting the realities in which each society had to adjust Various stages of cultural development have different yet identifiable mythological systems In brief these are br br The Way of the Animal Powers br Hunting and gathering societies br At this stage of evolution religion was animistic as all of nature was seen as being infused with a spirit or divine presence At center stage was the main hunting animal of that culture whether the buffalo for Native Americans or the eland for South African tribes and a large part of religion focused on dealing with the psychological tension that came from the reality of the necessity to kill versus the divinity of the animal This was done by presenting the animals as springing from an eternal archetypal source and coming to this world as willing victims with the understanding that their lives would be returned to the soil or to the Mother through a ritual of restoration The act of slaughter then becomes a ritual where both parties animal and mankind are equal participants In Mythos and The Power of Myth Campbell recounts the story he calls The Buffalo s Wife as told by the Blackfoot tribe of North America The story tells of a time when the buffalos stopped coming to the hunting plains leaving the tribe to starve The chief s daughter promises to marry the buffalo chief in return for their reappearance but is eventually spared and taught the buffalo dance by the animals themselves through which the spirits of their dead will return to their eternal life source Indeed Campbell taught that throughout history mankind has held a belief that all life comes from and returns to another dimension which transcends temporality but which can be reached through ritual br The Way of the Seeded Earth br Early agrarian societies br Beginning in the fertile grasslands of the Levant and the Fertile Crescent of Mesopotamia in the Bronze Age and moving to Europe the practice of agriculture spread along with a new way of understanding mankind s relationship to the world At this time the earth was seen as the Mother and the myths focused around Her life giving powers The plant and cultivation cycle was mirrored in religious rituals which often included human sacrifice symbolic or literal The main figures of this system were a female Great Goddess Mother Earth and her ever dying and ever resurrected son consort a male God At this time the focus was to participate in the repetitive rhythm the world moved in expressed as the four seasons the birth and death of crops and the phases of the moon At the center of this motion was the Mother Goddess from whom all life springs and to whom all life returns This often gave Her a dual aspect as both mother and destroyer br The Way of the Celestial Lights br The first high civilizations br As the first agricultural societies evolved into the high civilisations of Mesopotamia and Babylonia the observation of the stars inspired them with the idea that life on earth must also follow a similar mathematically predetermined pattern in which individual beings are but mere participants in an eternal cosmic play The king was symbolised by the Sun with the golden crown as its main metaphor while his court were the orbiting planets The Mother Goddess remained but her powers were now fixed within the rigid framework of a clockwork universe br However two barbarian incursions changed that As the Indo European Aryan people descended from the north and the Semites swept up from the Arabian desert they carried with them a male dominated mythology with a warrior god whose symbol was the thunder As they conquered mainly due to the superior technology of iron smithing their mythology blended with and subjugated the previous system of the Earth Goddess Many mythologies of the ancient world such as those of Greece India and Persia are a result of that fusion with gods retaining some of their original traits and character but now belonging to a single system Figures such as Zeus and Indra are thunder gods who now interact with Demeter and Dionysus whose ritual sacrifice and rebirth bearing testament to his pre Indo European roots were still enacted in classical Greece But for the most part the focus heavily shifted toward the masculine with Zeus ascending the throne of the gods and Dionysus demoted to a mere demi god br This demotion was very profound in the case of the biblical imagery where the female elements were marginalized to an extreme Campbell believed that Eve and the snake that tempted her were once fertility gods worshipped in their own right with the tree of knowledge being the Tree of Life He also found significance in the biblical story of Cain and Abel with Cain being a farmer whose agrarian offering is not accepted by God while herder Abel s animal sacrifice is In the lecture series of Mythos Campbell speaks of the Mysteries of Eleusis in Ancient Greece where Demeter s journey in the underworld was enacted for young men and women of the time There he observed that wheat was presented as the ultimate mystery with wine being a symbol of Dionysus much like in the Christian mysteries where bread and wine are considered to incarnate the body and blood of Jesus Both religions carry the same seeded earth cosmology in different forms while retaining an image of the ever dying ever resurrected God br The Way of Man br Medieval mythology romantic love and the birth of the modern spirit br Campbell recognized that the poetic form of courtly love carried through medieval Europe by the traveling troubadours contained a complete mythology in its own right In The Power of Myth as well as the Occidental Mythology volume of The Masks of God Campbell describes the emergence of a new kind of erotic experience as a person to person affair in contrast with the purely physical definition given to Eros in the ancient world and the communal agape found in the Christian religion An archetypal story of this kind is the legend of Tristan and Isolde which apart from its mystical function shows the transition from an arranged marriage society as practiced in the Middle Ages and sanctified by the church into the form of marriage by falling in love with another person that we recognize today So what essentially started from a mythological theme has since become a social reality mainly due to a change in perception brought about by a new mythology and represents a central foundational manifestation of Campbell s overriding interpretive message Follow your bliss br Campbell believed that in the modern world the function served by formal traditional mythological systems has been taken on by individual creators such as artists and philosophers In the works of some of his favorites such as Thomas Mann Pablo Picasso and James Joyce he saw mythological themes that could serve the same life giving purpose that mythology had once played Accordingly Campbell believed the religions of the world to be the various culturally influenced masks of the same fundamental transcendent truths All religions can bring one to an elevated awareness above and beyond a dualistic conception of reality or idea of pairs of opposites such as being and non being or right and wrong Indeed he quotes from the Rigveda in the preface to The Hero with a Thousand Faces Truth is one the sages speak of it by many names br br In Campbell s widow choreographer Jean Erdman worked with Campbell s longtime friend and editor Robert Walter to create the Joseph Campbell Foundation br Initiatives undertaken by the JCF include The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell a series of books and recordings that aims to pull together Campbell s myriad minded work the Erdman Campbell Award the Mythological RoundTables a network of local groups around the globe that explore the subjects of comparative mythology psychology religion and culture and the collection of Campbell s library and papers housed at the OPUS Archives and Research Center br br George Lucas was the first Hollywood filmmaker to credit Campbell s influence Lucas stated following the release of the first Star Wars film in that its story was shaped in part by ideas described in The Hero with a Thousand Faces and other works of Campbell s The linkage between Star Wars and Campbell was further reinforced when later reprints of Campbell s book used the image of Luke Skywalker on the cover Lucas discusses this influence at great length in the authorized biography of Joseph Campbell A Fire in the Mind br br I came to the conclusion after American Graffiti that what s valuable for me is to set standards not to show people the world the way it is around the period of this realization it came to me that there really was no modern use of mythology The Western was possibly the last generically American fairy tale telling us about our values And once the Western disappeared nothing has ever taken its place In literature we were going off into science fiction so that s when I started doing more strenuous research on fairy tales folklore and mythology and I started reading Joe s books Before that I hadn t read any of Joe s books It was very eerie because in reading The Hero with a Thousand Faces I began to realize that my first draft of Star Wars was following classic motifs So I modified my next draft according to what I d been learning about classical motifs and made it a little bit more consistent I went on to read The Masks of God and many other books br It was not until after the completion of the original Star Wars trilogy in however that Lucas met Campbell or heard any of his lectures In Campbell gave a lecture at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco with Lucas in the audience who was introduced through their mutual friend Barbara McClintock A few years later Lucas invited Campbell to watch the entire Star Wars trilogy at Skywalker Ranch which Campbell called real art This meeting led to the filming of the documentary The Power of Myth at Skywalker Ranch In his interviews with Bill Moyers Campbell discusses the way in which Lucas used The Hero s Journey in the Star Wars films IV V and VI to re invent the mythology for the contemporary viewer Moyers and Lucas filmed an interview years later in called the Mythology of Star Wars with George Lucas Bill Moyers to further discuss the impact of Campbell s work on Lucas films In addition the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution sponsored an exhibit during the late s called Star Wars The Magic of Myth which discussed the ways in which Campbell s work shaped the Star Wars films br Many filmmakers of the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries have acknowledged the influence of Campbell s work on their own craft Christopher Vogler a Hollywood screenwriter created a seven page company memo based on Campbell s work A Practical Guide to The Hero With a Thousand Faces which led to the development of Disney s film The Lion King Among films that many viewers have recognized as closely following the pattern of the monomyth are The Matrix series the Batman series and the Indiana Jones series Dan Harmon the creator of the TV show Community and co creator of the TV show Rick and Morty often references Campbell as a major influence According to him he uses a story circle to formulate every story he writes in a formulation of Campbell s work A fictionalized version of Campbell himself appears in the seventh episode of the sixth season of Rick and Morty Full Meta Jackrick br br After the explosion of popularity brought on by the Star Wars films and The Power of Myth creative artists in many media recognized the potential to use Campbell s theories to try to unlock human responses to narrative patterns Novelists songwriters video game designers have studied Campbell s work in order to better understand mythology in particular the monomyth and its impact br The novelist Richard Adams acknowledges a debt to Campbell s work and specifically to the concept of the monomyth In his best known work Watership Down Adams uses extracts from The Hero with a Thousand Faces as chapter epigrams br Dan Brown mentioned in a New York Times interview that Joseph Campbell s works particularly The Power of Myth and The Hero with a Thousand Faces inspired him to create the character of Robert Langdon br br One of Campbell s most identifiable most quoted and arguably most misunderstood sayings was his maxim to follow your bliss He derived this idea from the Upanishads br br Now I came to this idea of bliss because in Sanskrit which is the great spiritual language of the world there are three terms that represent the brink the jumping off place to the ocean of transcendence Sat Chit Ananda The word Sat means being Chit means consciousness Ananda means bliss or rapture I thought I don t know whether my consciousness is proper consciousness or not I don t know whether what I know of my being is my proper being or not but I do know where my rapture is So let me hang on to rapture and that will bring me both my consciousness and my being I think it worked br He saw this not merely as a mantra but as a helpful guide to the individual along the hero journey that each of us walks through life br br If you follow your bliss you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while waiting for you and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living Wherever you are if you are following your bliss you are enjoying that refreshment that life within you all the time br Campbell began sharing this idea with students during his lectures in the s By the time that The Power of Myth was aired in six months following Campbell s death Follow your bliss was a philosophy that resonated deeply with the American public both religious and secular br During his later years when some students took him to be encouraging hedonism Campbell is reported to have grumbled I should have said Follow your blisters br br Campbell s approach to myth a genre of folklore has been the subject of criticism from folklorists academics who specialize in folklore studies American folklorist Barre Toelken says that few psychologists have taken the time to become familiar with the complexities of folklore and that historically Jung influenced psychologists and authors have tended to build complex theories around single versions of a tale that support a theory or a proposal To illustrate his point Toelken employs Clarissa Pinkola Est s s Women Who Run with the Wolves citing its inaccurate representation of the folklore record and Campbell s monomyth approach as another Regarding Campbell Toelken writes Campbell could construct a monomyth of the hero only by citing those stories that fit his preconceived mold and leaving out equally valid stories which did not fit the pattern Toelken traces the influence of Campbell s monomyth theory into other then contemporary popular works such as Robert Bly s Iron John A Book About Men which he says suffers from similar source selection bias br Similarly American folklorist Alan Dundes was highly critical of both Campbell s approach to folklore designating him as a non expert and gives various examples of what he considers source bias in Campbell s theories as well as media representation of Campbell as an expert on the subject of myth in popular culture Dundes writes Folklorists have had some success in publicising the results of our efforts in the past two centuries such that members of other disciplines have after a minimum of reading believe they are qualified to speak authoritatively of folkloristic matters It seems that the world is full of self proclaimed experts in folklore and a few such as Campbell have been accepted as such by the general public and public television in the case of Campbell According to Dundes there is no single idea promulgated by amateurs that has done more harm to serious folklore study than the notion of archetype br According to anthropologist Raymond Scupin Joseph Campbell s theories have not been well received in anthropology because of his overgeneralizations as well as other problems br Campbell s Sanskrit scholarship has been questioned Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson a former Sanskrit professor at the University of Toronto said that he once met Campbell and that the two hated each other at sight commenting that When I met Campbell at a public gathering he was quoting Sanskrit verses He had no clue as to what he was talking about he had the most superficial knowledge of India but he could use it for his own aggrandizement I remember thinking this man is corrupt I know that he was simply lying about his understanding According to Richard Buchen librarian of the Joseph Campbell Collection at the Pacifica Graduate Institute Campbell could not translate Sanskrit well but worked closely with three scholars who did br Ellwood observes that The Masks of God series impressed literate laity more than specialists he quotes Stephen P Dunn as remarking that in Occidental Mythology Campbell writes in a curiously archaic style full of rhetorical questions exclamations of wonder and delight and expostulations directed at the reader or perhaps at the author s other self which is charming about a third of the time and rather annoying the rest Ellwood says that Campbell was not really a social scientist and those in the latter camp could tell and records a concern about Campbell s oversimplification of historical matters and tendency to make myth mean whatever he wanted it to mean The critic Camille Paglia writing in Sexual Personae expressed disagreement with Campbell s negative critique of fifth century Athens in Occidental Mythology arguing that Campbell missed the visionary and exalted androgyny in Greek statues of nude boys Paglia has written that while Campbell is a seminal figure for many American feminists she loathes him for his mawkishness and bad research Paglia has called Campbell mushy and a false teacher and described his work as a fanciful showy mishmash br Campbell has also been accused of antisemitism by some authors In Tikkun magazine Tamar Frankiel noted that Campbell called Judaism the Yahweh Cult and that he spoke of Judaism in almost exclusively negative terms In a New York Review of Books article Brendan Gill accused Campbell of both antisemitism and prejudice against blacks Gill s article resulted in a series of letters to the editor some supporting the charge of antisemitism and others defending him However according to Robert S Ellwood Gill relied on scraps of evidence largely anecdotal to support his charges In Masson also accused Campbell of hidden anti Semitism and fascination with conservative semifascistic views Robert A Segal s Joseph Campbell on Jews and Judaism offers references br br The first published work that bore Campbell s name was Where the Two Came to Their Father an account of a Navajo ceremony that was performed by singer medicine man Jeff King and recorded by artist and ethnologist Maud Oakes recounting the story of two young heroes who go to the hogan of their father the Sun and return with the power to destroy the monsters that are plaguing their people Campbell provided a commentary He would use this tale through the rest of his career to illustrate both the universal symbols and structures of human myths and the particulars folk ideas of Native American stories br As noted above James Joyce was an important influence on Campbell Campbell s first important book with Henry Morton Robinson A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake is a critical analysis of Joyce s final text Finnegans Wake In addition Campbell s seminal work The Hero with a Thousand Faces discusses what Campbell called the monomyth the cycle of the journey of the hero a term that he borrowed directly from Joyce s Finnegans Wake br br From his days in college through the s Joseph Campbell turned his hand to writing fiction In many of his later stories published in the posthumous collection Mythic Imagination he began to explore the mythological themes that he was discussing in his Sarah Lawrence classes These ideas turned him eventually from fiction to non fiction br Originally titled How to Read a Myth and based on the introductory class on mythology that he had been teaching at Sarah Lawrence College The Hero with a Thousand Faces was published in as Campbell s first foray as a solo author it established his name outside of scholarly circles and remains arguably his most influential work to this day The book argues that hero stories such as Krishna Buddha Apollonius of Tyana and Jesus all share a similar mythological basis Not only did it introduce the concept of the hero s journey to popular thinking but it also began to popularize the very idea of comparative mythology itself the study of the human impulse to create stories and images that though they are clothed in the motifs of a particular time and place draw nonetheless on universal eternal themes Campbell asserted br br Wherever the poetry of myth is interpreted as biography history or science it is killed The living images become only remote facts of a distant time or sky Furthermore it is never difficult to demonstrate that as science and history mythology is absurd When a civilization begins to reinterpret its mythology in this way the life goes out of it temples become museums and the link between the two perspectives becomes dissolved br br Published between and Campbell s four volume work The Masks of God covers mythology from around the world from ancient to modern Where The Hero with a Thousand Faces focused on the commonality of mythology the elementary ideas the Masks of God books focus upon historical and cultural variations the monomyth takes on the folk ideas In other words where The Hero with a Thousand Faces draws perhaps more from psychology the Masks of God books draw more from anthropology and history The four volumes of Masks of God are as follows Primitive Mythology Oriental Mythology Occidental Mythology and Creative Mythology br br At the time of his death Campbell was in the midst of working on a large format lavishly illustrated series titled Historical Atlas of World Mythology This series was to build on Campbell s idea first presented in The Hero with a Thousand Faces that myth evolves over time through four stages br br The Way of the Animal Powers the myths of Paleolithic hunter gatherers which focus on shamanism and animal totems br The Way of the Seeded Earth the myths of Neolithic agrarian cultures which focus upon a mother goddess and associated fertility rites br The Way of the Celestial Lights the myths of Bronze Age city states with pantheons of gods ruling from the heavens led by a masculine god king br The Way of Man religion and philosophy as it developed after the Axial Age c th century BCE in which the mythic imagery of previous eras was made consciously metaphorical reinterpreted as referring to psycho spiritual not literal historical matters This transition is evident in the East in Buddhism Vedanta and philosophical Taoism and in the West in the Mystery cults Platonism Christianity and Gnosticism br Only the first volume was completed at the time of Campbell s death Campbell s editor Robert Walter completed the publication of the first three of five parts of the second volume after Campbell s death The works are now out of print As of Joseph Campbell Foundation is currently undertaking to create a new ebook edition br br Campbell s widest popular recognition followed his collaboration with Bill Moyers on the PBS series The Power of Myth which was first broadcast in the
