in The Horse and His Boy the protagonists are all children from the real world who are magically transported to Narnia where they are sometimes called upon by the lion Aslan to protect Narnia from evil The books span the entire history of Narnia from its creation in The Magician s Nephew to its eventual destruction in The Last Battle br The Chronicles of Narnia is considered a classic of children s literature and is Lewis s best selling work having sold million copies in languages The series has been adapted for radio television the stage film and video games br br br Background and conception br Although Lewis originally conceived what would become The Chronicles of Narnia in the picture of a Faun with parcels in a snowy wood has a history dating to he did not finish writing the first book The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe until The Magician s Nephew the penultimate book to be published but the last to be written was completed in Lewis did not write the books in the order in which they were originally published nor were they published in their current chronological order of presentation The original illustrator Pauline Baynes created pen and ink drawings for the Narnia books that are still used in the editions published today Lewis was awarded the Carnegie Medal for The Last Battle the final book in the saga The series was first referred to as The Chronicles of Narnia by fellow children s author Roger Lancelyn Green in March after he had read and discussed with Lewis his recently completed fourth book The Silver Chair originally entitled Night under Narnia br Lewis described the origin of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe in an essay entitled It All Began with a Picture br br The Lion all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood This picture had been in my mind since I was about sixteen Then one day when I was about forty I said to myself Let s try to make a story about it br Shortly before the start of World War II many children were evacuated to the English countryside in anticipation of attacks on London and other major urban areas by Nazi Germany As a result on September three school girls named Margaret Mary and Katherine came to live at The Kilns in Risinghurst Lewis s home three miles east of Oxford city centre Lewis later suggested that the experience gave him a new appreciation of children and in late September he began a children s story on an odd sheet of paper which has survived as part of another manuscript br br This book is about four children whose names were Ann Martin Rose and Peter But it is most about Peter who was the youngest They all had to go away from London suddenly because of Air Raids and because Father who was in the Army had gone off to the War and Mother was doing some kind of war work They were sent to stay with a kind of relation of Mother s who was a very old professor who lived all by himself in the country br In It All Began with a Picture C S Lewis continues br br At first I had very little idea how the story would go But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions about that time Apart from that I don t know where the Lion came from or why he came But once he was there he pulled the whole story together and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him br Although Lewis pleaded ignorance about the source of his inspiration for Aslan Jared Lobdell digging into Lewis s history to explore the making of the series suggests Charles Williams s novel The Place of the Lion as a likely influence br The manuscript for The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe was complete by the end of March br br br Name br The name Narnia is based on Narni Italy written in Latin as Narnia Green wrote br br When Walter Hooper asked where he found the word Narnia Lewis showed him Murray s Small Classical Atlas ed G B Grundy which he acquired when he was reading the classics with Mr William T Kirkpatrick at Great Bookham On plate of the Atlas is a map of ancient Italy Lewis had underscored the name of a little town called Narnia simply because he liked the sound of it Narnia or Narni in Italian is in Umbria halfway between Rome and Assisi br br br Publication history br The Chronicles of Narnia s seven books have been in continuous publication since selling over million copies in languages and with editions in Braille br The first five books were originally published in the United Kingdom by Geoffrey Bles The first edition of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe was released in London on October Although three more books Prince Caspian The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Horse and His Boy were already complete they were not released immediately at that time but instead appeared along with The Silver Chair one at a time in each of the subsequent years The last two books The Magician s Nephew and The Last Battle were published in the United Kingdom originally by The Bodley Head in and br In the United States the publication rights were first owned by Macmillan Publishers and later by HarperCollins The two issued both hardcover and paperback editions of the series during their tenure as publishers while at the same time Scholastic Inc produced paperback versions for sale primarily through direct mail order book clubs and book fairs HarperCollins also published several one volume collected editions containing the full text of the series As noted below see Reading order the first American publisher Macmillan numbered the books in publication sequence whereas HarperCollins at the suggestion of Lewis s stepson opted to use the series internal chronological order when they won the rights to it in Scholastic switched the numbering of its paperback editions in to mirror that of HarperCollins br br br Books br The seven books that make up The Chronicles of Narnia are presented here in order of original publication date br br br The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe br br The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe completed by the end of March and published by Geoffrey Bles in the United Kingdom on October tells the story of four

They are drawn back by the power of Susan s horn blown by Prince Caspian to summon help in his hour of need Narnia as they knew it is no more as years have passed their castle is in ruins and all Narnians have retreated so far within themselves that only Aslan s magic can wake them Caspian has fled into the woods to escape his uncle Miraz who has usurped the throne The children set out once again to save Narnia br br br The Voyage of the Dawn Treader br br Written between January and February and published on September The Voyage of the Dawn Treader sees Edmund and Lucy Pevensie along with their priggish cousin Eustace Scrubb return to Narnia three Narnian years and one Earth year after their last departure Once there they join Caspian s voyage on the ship Dawn Treader to find the seven lords who were banished when Miraz took over the throne This perilous journey brings them face to face with many wonders and dangers as they sail toward Aslan s country at the edge of the world br br br The Silver Chair br br Completed at the beginning of March and published September The Silver Chair is the first Narnia book not involving the Pevensie children focusing instead on Eustace Several months after The Voyage of the Dawn Treader Aslan calls Eustace back to Narnia along with his classmate Jill Pole They are given four signs to aid them in the search for Prince Caspian s son Rilian who disappeared ten years earlier on a quest to avenge his mother s death Fifty years have passed in Narnia since the events from The Voyage of the Dawn Treader Eustace is still a child but Caspian barely an adult in the previous book is now an old man Eustace and Jill with the help of Puddleglum the Marsh wiggle face danger and betrayal on their quest to find Rilian br br br The Horse

and ends in the last chapter of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe The protagonists a young boy named Shasta and a talking horse named Bree both begin in bondage in the country of Calormen By chance they meet and plan their return to Narnia and freedom Along the way they meet Aravis and her talking horse Hwin who are also fleeing to Narnia br br br The Magician s Nephew br br Completed in February br and published by Bodley Head in London on May The Magician s Nephew serves as a prequel and presents Narnia s origin story how Aslan created the world and how evil first entered it Digory Kirke and his friend Polly Plummer stumble into different worlds by experimenting with magic rings given to them by Digory s uncle In the dying world of Charn they awaken Queen Jadis and another world turns out to be the beginnings of the Narnian world where Jadis later becomes the White Witch The story is set in when Digory was a year old boy He is a middle aged professor by the time he hosts the Pevensie children in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe years later br br br The Last Battle br br Completed in March and published September The Last Battle chronicles the end of the world of Narnia Approximately two hundred Narnia years after the events of The Silver Chair Jill and Eustace return to save Narnia from the ape Shift who tricks Puzzle the donkey into impersonating the lion Aslan thereby precipitating a showdown between the Calormenes and King Tirian This leads to the end of Narnia as it is known throughout the series but allows Aslan to lead the characters to the true Narnia br br br Reading order br Fans of the series often have strong opinions over the order in which the books should be read The issue revolves around the placement of The Magician s Nephew and The Horse and His Boy in the series Both are set significantly earlier in the story of Narnia than their publication order and fall somewhat outside the main story arc connecting the others The reading order of the other five books is not disputed br br When first published the books were not numbered The first American publisher Macmillan enumerated them according to their original publication order while some early British editions specified the internal chronological order When HarperCollins took over the series rights in they adopted the internal chronological order To make the case for the internal chronological order Lewis s stepson Douglas Gresham quoted Lewis s reply to a letter from an American fan who was having an argument with his mother about the order br br I think I agree with your chronological order for reading the books more than with your mother s The series was not planned beforehand as she thinks When I wrote The Lion I did not know I was going to write any more Then I wrote P Caspian as a sequel and still didn t think there would be any more and when I had done The Voyage I felt quite sure it would be the last but I found I was wrong So perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone read them I m not even sure that all the others were written in the same order in which they were published br In the HarperCollins adult editions of the books the publisher cites this letter to assert Lewis s preference for the numbering they adopted by including this notice on the copyright page br br Although The Magician s Nephew was written several years after C S Lewis first began The Chronicles of Narnia he wanted it to be read as the first book in the series HarperCollins is happy to present these books in the order in which Professor Lewis preferred br Paul Ford cites several scholars who have weighed in against this view and continues most scholars disagree with this decision and find it the least faithful to Lewis s deepest intentions Scholars and readers who appreciate the original order believe that Lewis was simply being gracious to his youthful correspondent and that he could have changed the books order in his lifetime had he so desired They maintain that much of the magic of Narnia comes from the way the world is gradually presented in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe that the mysterious wardrobe as a narrative device is a much better introduction to Narnia than The Magician s Nephew where the word Narnia appears in the first paragraph as something already familiar to the reader Moreover they say it is clear from the texts themselves that The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe was intended to be read first When Aslan is first mentioned in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe for example the narrator says that None of the children knew who Aslan was any more than you do which is nonsensical if one has already read The Magician s Nephew Other similar textual examples are also cited br Doris Meyer author of C S Lewis in Context and Bareface A guide to C S Lewis writes that rearranging the stories chronologically lessens the impact of the individual stories and obscures the literary structures as a whole Peter Schakel devotes an entire chapter to this topic in his book Imagination and the Arts in C S Lewis Journeying to Narnia and Other Worlds and in Reading with the Heart The Way into Narnia he writes br br The only reason to read The Magician s Nephew first is for the chronological order of events and that as every story teller knows is quite unimportant as a reason Often the early events in a sequence have a greater impact or effect as a flashback told after later events which provide background and establish perspective So it is with the Chronicles The artistry the archetypes and the pattern of Christian thought all make it preferable to read the books in the order of their publication br br br Main characters br br br Aslan br br Aslan the Great Lion is the titular lion of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and his role in Narnia is developed throughout the remaining books He is also the only character to appear in all seven books Aslan is a talking lion the King of Beasts son of the Emperor Over the Sea He is a wise compassionate magical authority both temporal and spiritual who serves as mysterious and benevolent guide to the human children who visit as well as being the guardian and saviour of Narnia C S Lewis described Aslan as an alternative version of Jesus as the form in which he may have appeared in an alternative reality In his book Miracles C S Lewis argues that the possible existence of other worlds with other sentient life forms should not deter or detract from being Christian br br The universe may be full of lives that have been redeemed in modes suitable to their condition of which we can form no conception It may be full of lives that have been redeemed in the very same mode as our own It may be full of things quite other than life in which God is interested though we are not br br br Pevensie family br The four Pevensie siblings are the main human protagonists of The Chronicles of Narnia Varying combinations of some or all of them appear in five of the seven novels They are introduced in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe although their surname is not revealed until The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and eventually become Kings and Queens of Narnia reigning as a tetrarchy Although introduced in the series as children the siblings grow up into adults while reigning in Narnia They go back to being children once they get back to their own world but feature as adults in The Horse and His Boy during their Narnian reign br All four appear in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian in the latter however Aslan tells Peter and Susan that they will not return as they are getting too old Susan Lucy and Edmund appear in The Horse and His Boy Peter is said to be away fighting giants on the other side of Narnia Lucy and Edmund appear in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader where Aslan tells them too that they are getting too old Peter Edmund and Lucy appear as Kings and Queens in Aslan s Country in The Last Battle Susan does not Asked by a child in if he would please write another book entitled Susan of Narnia so that the entire Pevensie family would be reunited C S Lewis replied I am so glad you like the Narnian books and it was nice of you to write and tell me There s no use just asking me to write more When stories come into my mind I have to write them and when they don t I can t br br br Lucy Pevensie br br Lucy is the youngest of the four Pevensie siblings Of all the Pevensie children Lucy is the closest to Aslan and of all the human characters who visit Narnia Lucy is perhaps the one who believes in Narnia the most In The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe she initiates the story by entering Narnia through the wardrobe and with Susan witnesses Aslan s execution and resurrection She is named Queen Lucy the Valiant In Prince Caspian she is the first to see Aslan when he comes to guide them In The Voyage of the Dawn Treader it is Lucy who breaks the spell of invisibility on the Dufflepuds As an adult in The Horse and His Boy she helps fight the Calormenes at Anvard Although a minor character in The Last Battle much of the closing chapter is seen from her point of view br br br Edmund Pevensie br br Edmund is the second child to enter Narnia in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe where he falls under the White Witch s spell from eating the Turkish delight she gives him Instantiating the book s Christian theme of betrayal repentance and subsequent redemption via blood sacrifice he betrays his siblings to the White Witch but quickly realizes her true nature and her evil intentions and is redeemed by the sacrifice of Aslan s life He is named King Edmund the Just In Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader he supports Lucy in The Horse and His Boy he leads the Narnian delegation to Calormen and later the Narnian army breaking the siege at Anvard br br br Susan Pevensie br br In The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Susan accompanies Lucy to see Aslan die and rise again She is named Queen Susan the Gentle In Prince Caspian however she is the last of the four to believe and follow Lucy when the latter is called by Aslan to guide them As an adult queen in The Horse and His Boy she is courted by Prince Rabadash of Calormen but refuses his marriage proposal and his angry response leads the story to its climax In The Last Battle she has stopped believing in Narnia and remembers it only as a childhood game though Lewis mentioned in a letter to a fan that he thought she may eventually believe again The books don t tell us what happened to Susan But there is plenty of time for her to mend and perhaps she will get to Aslan s country in the end in her own way br br br Peter Pevensie br br Peter is the eldest of the Pevensies In The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe he kills Maugrim a talking wolf to save Susan and leads the Narnian army against the White Witch Aslan names him High King and he is known as Peter the Magnificent In Prince Caspian he duels the usurper King Miraz to restore Caspian s throne In The Last Battle it is Peter whom Aslan entrusts with the duty of closing the door on Narnia for the final time br br br Eustace Scrubb br br Eustace Clarence Scrubb is a cousin of the Pevensies and a classmate of Jill Pole at their school Experiment House He is portrayed at first as a brat and a bully but comes to improve his nasty behaviour when his greed turns him into a dragon for a while His distress at having to live as a dragon causes him to reflect upon how horrible he has been and his subsequent improved character is rewarded when Aslan changes him back into a boy In the later books Eustace comes across as a much nicer person although he is still rather grumpy and argumentative Nonetheless he becomes a hero along with Jill Pole when the pair succeed in freeing the lost Prince Rilian from the clutches of an evil witch He appears in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader The Silver Chair and The Last Battle br br br Jill Pole br br Jill Pole is a schoolmate of Eustace Scrubb She appears in The Silver Chair where she is the viewpoint character for most of the action and returns in The Last Battle In The Silver Chair Eustace introduces her to the Narnian world where Aslan gives her the task of memorising a series of signs that will help her and Eustace on their quest to find Caspian s lost son In The Last Battle she and Eustace accompany King Tirian in his ill fated defence of Narnia against the Calormenes br br br Professor Digory Kirke br br Digory Kirke is the nephew referred to in the title of The Magician s Nephew He first appears as a minor character in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe known only as The Professor who hosts the Pevensie children when they are evacuated from London and defends Lucy s story of having found a country in the back of the wardrobe In The Magician s Nephew the young Digory thanks to his uncle s magical experimentation inadvertently brings

wicked magician who is Digory s uncle into touching a magic ring which transports her to the Wood between the Worlds and leaves her there stranded The wicked uncle persuades Digory to follow her with a second magic ring that has the power to bring her back This sets up the pair s adventures into other worlds and they witness the creation of Narnia as described in The Magician s Nephew She appears

but quickly repents and befriends her In The Horse and His Boy he devises the Narnian delegation s plan of escape from Calormen He returns for a brief dialogue at the end of The Last Battle Lewis s initial inspiration for the entire series was a mental image of a faun in a snowy wood Tumnus is that faun br br br Caspian br br Caspian is first introduced in the book titled after him as the young nephew and heir of King Miraz Fleeing potential assassination by his uncle he becomes leader of the Old Narnian rebellion against the Telmarine occupation With the help of the Pevensies he defeats

Tash br br br Title characters br The Magician s Nephew Digory Kirke Andrew Ketterley is the magician br The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Aslan Jadis br The Horse and His Boy Bree Shasta br Prince Caspian Prince Caspian br br br Appearances of main characters br br br Narnian geography br br The Chronicles of Narnia describes the world in which Narnia exists as one major landmass encircled by an ocean Narnia s capital sits on the eastern edge of the landmass on the shores of the Great Eastern Ocean This ocean contains the islands explored in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader On the main landmass Lewis places the countries of Narnia Archenland Calormen and Telmar along with a variety of other areas that are not described as countries The author also provides glimpses of more fantastic locations that exist in and around the main world of Narnia including an edge and an underworld br br br Influences br br br Lewis s life br Lewis s early life has parallels with The Chronicles of Narnia At the age of seven he moved with his family to a large house on the edge of Belfast Its long hallways and empty rooms inspired Lewis and his brother to invent make believe worlds whilst exploring their home an activity reflected in Lucy s discovery of Narnia in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Like Caspian and Rilian Lewis lost his mother at an early age spending much of his youth in English boarding schools similar to those attended by the Pevensie children Eustace Scrubb and Jill Pole During World War II many children were evacuated from London and other urban areas because of German air raids Some of these children including one named Lucy Lewis s goddaughter stayed with him at his home The Kilns near Oxford just as the Pevensies stayed with The Professor in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe br br br Influences from mythology and cosmology br Drew Trotter president of the Center for Christian Study noted that the producers of the film The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe felt that the books plots adhere to the archetypal monomyth pattern as detailed in Joseph Campbell s The Hero with a Thousand Faces br Lewis was widely read in medieval Celtic literature an influence reflected throughout the books and most strongly in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader The entire book imitates one of the immrama a type of traditional Old Irish tale that combines elements of Christianity and Irish mythology to tell the story of a hero s sea journey to the Otherworld br br br Planet Narnia br Michael Ward s book Planet Narnia proposes that each of the seven books related to one of the seven moving heavenly bodies or planets known in the Middle Ages according to the Ptolemaic geocentric model of cosmology a theme to which Lewis returned habitually throughout his work At that time each of these heavenly bodies was believed to have certain attributes and Ward contends that these attributes were deliberately but subtly used by Lewis to furnish elements of the stories of each book br br In The Lion the child protagonists become monarchs under sovereign Jove in Prince Caspian they harden under strong Mars in The Dawn Treader they drink light under searching Sol in The Silver Chair they learn obedience under subordinate Luna in The Horse and His Boy they come to love poetry under eloquent Mercury in The Magician s Nephew they gain life giving fruit under fertile Venus and in The Last Battle they suffer and die under chilling Saturn br Lewis s interest in the literary symbolism of medieval and Renaissance astrology is more overtly referenced in other works such as his study of medieval cosmology The Discarded Image and in his early poetry as well as in Space Trilogy Narnia scholar Paul F Ford finds Ward s assertion that Lewis intended The Chronicles to be an embodiment of medieval astrology implausible though Ford addresses an earlier version of Ward s thesis also called Planet Narnia published in the Times Literary Supplement Ford argues that Lewis did not start with a coherent plan for the books but Ward s book answers this by arguing that the astrological associations grew in the writing br br Jupiter was Lewis s favourite planet part of the habitual furniture of his mind The Lion was thus the first example of that idea that he wanted to try out Prince Caspian and The Dawn Treader naturally followed because Mars and Sol were both already connected in his mind with the merits of the Alexander technique at some point after commencing The Horse and His Boy he resolved to treat all seven planets for seven such treatments of his idea would mean that he had worked it out to the full br A quantitative analysis on the imagery in the different books of The Chronicles gives mixed support to Ward s thesis The Voyage of the Dawn Treader The Silver Chair The Horse and His Boy and The Magician s Nephew do indeed employ concepts associated with respectively Sol Luna Mercury and Venus far more often than chance would predict but The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Prince Caspian and The Last Battle fall short of statistical correlation with their proposed planets br br br Influences from literature br George MacDonald s Phantastes influenced the structure and setting of The Chronicles It was a work that was a great balm to the soul br Plato was an undeniable influence on Lewis s writing of The Chronicles Most clearly Digory explicitly invokes Plato s name at the end of The Last Battle to explain how the old version of Narnia is but a shadow of the newly revealed true Narnia Plato s influence is also apparent in The Silver Chair when the Queen of the Underland attempts to convince the protagonists that the surface world is not real She echoes the logic of Plato s Cave by comparing the sun to a nearby lamp arguing that reality is only that which is perceived in the immediate physical vicinity br The White Witch in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe shares many features both of appearance and character with the villainous Duessa of Edmund Spenser s Faerie Queene a work Lewis studied in detail Like Duessa she falsely styles herself Queen she leads astray the erring Edmund with false temptations she turns people into stone as Duessa turns them into trees Both villains wear opulent robes and deck their conveyances out with bells In The Magician s Nephew Jadis takes on echoes of Satan from John Milton s Paradise Lost she climbs over the wall of the paradisal garden in contempt of the command to enter only by the gate and proceeds to tempt Digory as Satan tempted Eve with lies and half truths Similarly the Lady of the Green Kirtle in The Silver Chair recalls both the snake woman Errour in The Faerie Queene and Satan s transformation into a snake in Paradise Lost br Lewis read Edith Nesbit s children s books as a child and was greatly fond of them He described The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe around the time of its completion as a children s book in the tradition of E Nesbit The Magician s Nephew in particular bears strong resemblances to Nesbit s The Story of the Amulet This novel focuses on four children living in London who discover a magic amulet Their father is away and their mother is ill as is the case with Digory They manage to transport the queen of ancient Babylon to London and she is the cause of a riot likewise Polly and Digory transport Queen Jadis to London sparking a very similar incident br Marsha Daigle Williamson argues that Dante s Divine Comedy had a significant impact on Lewis s writings In the Narnia series she identifies this influence as most apparent in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader and The Silver Chair Daigle Williamson identifies the plot of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader as a Dantean journey with a parallel structure and similar themes She likewise draws numerous connections between The Silver Chair and the events of Dante s Inferno br Colin Duriez writing on the shared elements found in both Lewis s and J R R Tolkien s works highlights the thematic similarities between Tolkien s poem Imram and Lewis s The Voyage of the Dawn Treader br br br Influences on other works br The Chronicles of Narnia is considered a classic of children s literature br br br Influences on literature br The Chronicles of Narnia has been a significant influence on both adult and children s fantasy literature in the post World War II era In the scholar Susan Cornell Poskanzer praised Lewis for his strangely powerful fantasies Poskanzer argued that children could relate to Narnia books because the heroes and heroines were realistic characters each with their own distinctive voice and personality Furthermore the protagonists become powerful kings and queens who decide the fate of kingdoms while the adults in the Narnia books tended to be buffoons which by inverting the normal order of things was pleasing to many youngsters However Poskanzer criticized Lewis for what she regarded as scenes of gratuitous violence which she felt were upsetting to children Poskanzer also noted Lewis presented his Christian message subtly enough as to avoid boring children with overt sermonizing br Examples include br Philip Pullman s fantasy series His Dark Materials is seen as a response to The Chronicles Pullman is a self described atheist who wholly rejects the spiritual themes that permeate The Chronicles yet his series nonetheless addresses many of the same issues and introduces some similar character types including talking animals In another parallel the first books in each series Pullman s Northern Lights and The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe both open with a young girl hiding in a wardrobe br Bill Willingham s comic book series Fables makes reference at least twice to a king called The Great Lion a thinly veiled reference to Aslan The series avoids explicitly referring to any characters or works that are not in the public domain br The novel Bridge to Terabithia by Katherine Paterson has Leslie one of the main characters reveal to Jesse her love of Lewis s books subsequently lending him The Chronicles of Narnia so that he can learn how to behave like a king Her book also features the island name Terabithia which sounds similar to Terebinthia a Narnian island that appears in Prince Caspian and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader Katherine Paterson herself acknowledges that Terabithia is likely to be derived from Terebinthia br br I thought I had made it up Then rereading The Voyage of the Dawn Treader by C S Lewis I realized that I had probably gotten it from the island of Terebinthia in that book However Lewis probably got that name from the terebinth tree in the Bible so both of us pinched from somewhere else probably unconsciously br Science fiction author Greg Egan s short story Oracle depicts a parallel universe in which an author nicknamed Jack Lewis s nickname has written novels about the fictional Kingdom of Nesica and whose wife is dying of cancer paralleling the death of Lewis s wife Joy Davidman Several Narnian allegories are also used to explore issues of religion and faith versus science and knowledge br Lev Grossman s New York Times best seller The Magicians is a contemporary dark fantasy about an unusually gifted young man obsessed with Fillory the magical land of his favourite childhood books Fillory is a thinly veiled substitute for Narnia and clearly the author expects it to be experienced as such Not only is the land home to many similar talking animals and mythical creatures it is also accessed through a grandfather clock in the home of an uncle to whom five English children are sent during World War II Moreover the land is ruled by two Aslan like rams named Ember and Umber and terrorised by The Watcherwoman She like the White Witch freezes the land in time The book s plot revolves heavily around a place very like the wood between the worlds from The Magician s Nephew an interworld waystation in which pools of water lead to other lands This reference to The Magician s Nephew is echoed in the title of the book br J K Rowling author of the Harry Potter series has said that she was a fan of the works of Lewis as a child and cites the influence of The Chronicles on her work I found myself thinking about the wardrobe route to Narnia when Harry is told he has to hurl himself at a barrier in King s Cross Station it dissolves and he s on platform Nine and Three Quarters and there s the train for Hogwarts Nevertheless she is at pains to stress the differences between Narnia and her world Narnia is literally a different world she says whereas in the Harry books you go into a world within a world that you can see if you happen to belong A lot of the humour comes from collisions between the magic and the everyday worlds Generally there isn t much humour in the Narnia books although I adored them when I was a child I got so caught up I didn t think CS Lewis was especially preachy Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn t very subliminal New York Times writer Charles McGrath notes the similarity between Dudley Dursley the obnoxious son of Harry s neglectful guardians and Eustace Scrubb the spoiled brat who torments the main characters until he is redeemed by Aslan br The comic book series Pakkins Land by Gary and Rhoda Shipman in which a young child finds himself in a magical world filled with talking animals including a lion character named King Aryah has been compared favorably to the Narnia series The Shipmans have cited the influence of C S Lewis and the Narnia series in response to reader letters br br br Influences on popular culture br As with any popular long lived work contemporary culture abounds with references to the lion Aslan travelling via wardrobe and direct mentions of The Chronicles Examples include br Charlotte Staples Lewis a character first seen early in the fourth season of the TV series Lost is named in reference to C S Lewis Lost producer Damon Lindelof said that this was a clue to the direction the show would take during the season The book Ultimate Lost and Philosophy edited by William Irwin and Sharon Kaye contains a comprehensive essay on Lost plot motifs based on The Chronicles br The second SNL Digital Short by Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell features a humorous nerdcore hip hop song titled Chronicles of Narnia Lazy Sunday which focuses on the performers plan to see The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe at a cinema It was described by Slate magazine as one of the most culturally significant Saturday Night Live skits in many years and an important commentary on the state of rap Swedish Christian power metal band Narnia whose songs are mainly about the Chronicles of Narnia or the Bible feature Aslan on all their album covers The song Further Up Further In from the album Room to Roam by Scottish Irish folk rock band The Waterboys is heavily influenced by The Chronicles of Narnia The title is taken from a passage in The Last Battle and one verse of the song describes sailing to the end of the world to meet a king similar to the ending of Voyage of the Dawn Treader C S Lewis is explicitly acknowledged as an influence in the liner notes of the compact disc br During interviews the primary creator of the Japanese anime and gaming series Digimon has said that he was inspired and influenced by The Chronicles of Narnia br Its influence extends even to fan fiction under the pen name Edonohana Rachel Manija Brown wrote No Reservations Narnia which imagined Anthony Bourdain exploring Narnia and its cuisine in the style of his No Reservations TV show and book Bourdain himself praised the fic s writing and frankly a bit frightening attention to detail br br br Christian themes br br Lewis had authored a number of works on Christian apologetics and other literature with Christian based themes before writing the Narnia books The character Aslan is widely accepted by literary academia as being based on Jesus Christ Lewis did not initially plan to incorporate Christian theological concepts into his Narnia stories Lewis maintained that the Narnia books were not allegorical preferring to term their Christian aspects a supposition br The Chronicles have consequently a large Christian following and are widely used to promote Christian ideas However some Christians object that The Chronicles promote soft sell paganism and occultism due to recurring pagan imagery and themes br br br Criticism br br br Consistency br Gertrude Ward noted that When Lewis wrote The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe he clearly meant to create a world where there were no human beings at all As the titles of Mr Tumnus books testify in this world human beings are creatures of myth while its common daily reality includes fauns and other creatures which are myth in our world This worked well for the first volume of the series but for later volumes Lewis thought up plots which required having more human beings in this world In Prince Caspian he still kept the original structure and explained that more humans had arrived from our world at a later time overrunning Narnia However later on he gave in and changed the entire concept of this world there have always been very many humans in this world and Narnia is just one very special country with a lot of talking animals and fauns and dwarves etc In this revised world with a great human empire to the south of Narnia and human principality just next door the White Witch would not have suspected Edmund of being a dwarf who shaved his beard there would be far more simple and obvious explanations for his origin And in fact in this revised world it is not entirely clear why were the four Pevensie children singled out for the Thrones of Narnia over so many other humans in the world Still we just have to live with these discrepancies and enjoy each Narnia book on its own merits br br br Accusations of gender stereotyping br In later years both Lewis and the Chronicles have been criticised often by other authors of fantasy fiction for gender role stereotyping though other authors have defended Lewis in this area Most allegations of sexism centre on the description of Susan Pevensie in The Last Battle when Lewis writes that Susan is no longer a friend of Narnia and interested in nothing nowadays except nylons and lipstick and invitations br Philip Pullman inimical to Lewis on many fronts calls the Narnia stories monumentally disparaging of women His interpretation of the Susan passages reflects this view br br Susan like Cinderella is undergoing a transition from one phase of her life to another Lewis didn t approve of that He didn t like women in general or sexuality at all at least at the stage in his life when he wrote the Narnia books He was frightened and appalled at the notion of wanting to grow up br In fantasy author Neil Gaiman s short story The Problem of Susan an elderly woman Professor Hastings deals with the grief and trauma of her entire family s death in a train crash Although the woman s maiden name is not revealed details throughout the story strongly imply that this character is the elderly Susan Pevensie The story is written for an adult audience and deals with issues of sexuality and violence and through it Gaiman presents a critique of Lewis s treatment of Susan as well as the problem of evil as it relates to punishment and salvation br Lewis supporters cite the positive roles of women in the series including Jill Pole in The Silver Chair Aravis Tarkheena in The Horse and His Boy Polly Plummer in The Magician s Nephew and particularly Lucy Pevensie in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe Alan Jacobs an English professor at Wheaton College asserts that Lucy is the most admirable of the human characters and that generally the girls come off better than the boys throughout the series Jacobs In her contribution to The Chronicles of Narnia and Philosophy Karin Fry an assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point notes that the most sympathetic female characters in The Chronicles are consistently the ones who question the traditional roles of women and prove their worth to Aslan through actively engaging in the adventures just like the boys Fry goes on to say br br The characters have positive and negative things to say about both male and female characters suggesting an equality between sexes However the problem is that many of the positive qualities of the female characters seem to be those by which they can rise above their femininity The superficial nature of stereotypical female interests is condemned br Nathan Ross notes that Much of the plot of Wardrobe is told exclusively from the point of view of Susan and Lucy It is the girls who witness Aslan being killed and coming back to life a unique experience from which the boys are excluded Throughout going through many highly frightening and shocking moments Susan and Lucy behave with grown up courage and responsibility Their experiences are told in full over several chapters while what the boys do at the same time preparing an army and going into battle is relegated to the background This arrangement of material clearly implies that what girls saw and did was the more important Given the commonly held interpretation that Aslan is Jesus Christ and that what the girls saw was a no less than a reenacting of the Crucifixion this order of priorities makes perfect sense br Taking a different stance altogether Monika B Hilder provides a thorough examination of the feminine ethos apparent in each book of the series and proposes that critics tend to misread Lewis s representation of gender As she puts it we assume that Lewis is sexist when he is in fact applauding the feminine heroic To the extent that we have not examined our own chauvinism we demean the feminine qualities and extol the masculine not noticing that Lewis does the opposite br br br Accusations of racism br In addition to sexism Pullman and others have also accused the Narnia series of fostering racism Over the alleged racism in The Horse and His Boy newspaper editor Kyrie O Connor wrote br br While the book s storytelling virtues are enormous you don t have to be a bluestocking of political correctness to find some of this fantasy anti Arab or anti Eastern or anti Ottoman With all its stereotypes mostly played for belly laughs there are moments you d like to stuff this story back into its closet br Gregg Easterbrook writing in The Atlantic stated that the Calormenes are unmistakable Muslim stand ins while novelist Philip Hensher raises specific concerns that a reader might gain the impression that Islam is a Satanic cult In rebuttal to this charge at an address to a C S Lewis conference Devin Brown argued that there are too many dissimilarities between the Calormene religion and Islam particularly in the areas of polytheism and human sacrifice for Lewis s writing to be regarded as critical of Islam br Nicholas Wanberg has argued echoing claims by Mervyn Nicholson that accusations of racism in the books are an oversimplification but he asserts that the stories employ beliefs about human aesthetics including equating dark skin with ugliness that have been traditionally associated with racist thought br Critics also argue whether Lewis s work presents a positive or negative view of colonialism Nicole DuPlessis favors the anticolonial view claiming the negative effects of colonial exploitations and the themes of animals rights and responsibility to the environment are emphasized in Lewis s construction of a community of living things Through the negative examples of illegitimate rulers Lewis constructs the correct relationship between humans and nature providing examples of rulers like Caspian who fulfil their responsibilities to the environment Clare Etcherling counters with her claim that those illegitimate rulers are often very dark skinned and that the only legitimate rulers are those sons and daughters of Adam and Eve who adhere to Christian conceptions of morality and stewardship either white English children such as Peter or Narnians who possess characteristics valued and cultivated by the British such as Caspian br br br Adaptations br

realistically Lewis never sold the film rights to the Narnia series In answering a letter with a question posed by a child in asking if the Narnia series could please be on television C S Lewis wrote
