Eddison br br Properly speaking wrote Warren Lewis the Inklings was neither a club nor a literary society though it partook of the nature of both There were no rules officers agendas or formal elections As was typical for university groups in their time and place the Inklings were all male br Readings and discussions of the members unfinished works were the principal purposes of meetings Tolkien s The Lord of the Rings Lewis s Out of the Silent Planet and Williams s All Hallows Eve were among the novels first read to the Inklings Tolkien s fictional Notion Club see Sauron Defeated was based on the Inklings Meetings were not all serious the Inklings amused themselves by having competitions to see who could read the notoriously bad prose of Amanda McKittrick Ros for the longest without laughing br The name was associated originally with a society of Oxford University s University College initiated by the then undergraduate Edward Tangye Lean around for the purpose of reading aloud unfinished compositions The society consisted of students and dons among them Tolkien and Lewis When Lean left Oxford in the society ended and Tolkien and Lewis transferred its name to their group at Magdalen College On the association between the two Inklings societies Tolkien later said although our habit was to read aloud compositions of various kinds and lengths this association and its habit would in fact have come into being at that time whether the original short lived club had ever existed or not br Until late Inklings readings and discussions were usually held on Thursday evenings in C S Lewis s rooms at Magdalen The Inklings and friends also gathered informally on Tuesdays at midday at a local public house The Eagle and Child familiarly and alliteratively known in the Oxford community as The Bird and Baby or simply The Bird The publican Charlie Blagrove let Lewis and friends use his private parlour for privacy the wall and door separating it from the public bar were removed in During the war years beer shortages occasionally rendered the Eagle and Child unable to open and the group instead met at other pubs including the White Horse and the Kings Arms Later pub meetings were at The Lamb and Flag across the street and in earlier years the Inklings also met irregularly in yet other pubs but The Eagle and Child is the best known br br The Marion E Wade
