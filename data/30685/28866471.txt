at the st Worldcon in Chengdu Sichuan China on October The awards will be presented at the nd Worldcon Glasgow in Scotland on August br br br Award br br The World Science Fiction Society WSFS gives out the Hugo Awards each year for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year The Hugos are widely considered the premier award in science fiction The award is named after Hugo Gernsback who founded the pioneering science fiction magazine Amazing Stories and who is considered one of the fathers of the science fiction genre Works are eligible for an award if they were published in the prior calendar year or translated into English in the prior calendar year There are no written rules as to which works qualify as science fiction or fantasy and the decision of eligibility in that regard is left up to the voters rather than to the organizing committee Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual World Science Fiction Convention or Worldcon and the presentation evening constitutes its central event The selection process is defined in the WSFS constitution as instant runoff voting with six nominees per category except in the case of a tie The awards are split over more than a dozen categories and include both written and dramatic works br For each category of Hugo the voter may rank No Award as one of their choices Voters are instructed that they should do so if they feel that none of the nominees are worthy of the award or if they feel the category should be abolished entirely A vote for No Award other than as one s first choice signifies that the voter believes the nominees ranked higher than No Award are worthy of a Hugo in that category while those ranked lower are not br The six works on the ballot for each category are the most nominated by members that year with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated With the exception of the first years of the awards did not include any recognition of runner up novels but since all of the candidates have been recorded Initial nominations are made by members in January through March while voting on the ballot of six nominations is performed roughly in April through July subject to change depending on when that year s Worldcon is held Prior to the final ballot was five works in each category Worldcons are generally held near the start of September and take place in a different city around the world each year br The idea of giving out awards at Worldcons was proposed by Harold Lynch for the convention The idea was based on the Academy Awards with the name Hugo being given by Robert A Madle The award trophy was created by Jack McKnight and Ben Jason in based on the design of hood ornaments of s cars It consisted of a finned rocket ship on a wooden base Each subsequent trophy with the exception of the trophy a plaque has been similar to the original design The rocket trophy was formally redesigned in and since then only the base of the trophy has changed each year There is no monetary or other remuneration associated with the Hugo other than the trophy br br br Retro Hugos br Retrospective Hugo Awards or Retro Hugos were added as a concept to the Hugo Awards in They are awards given for years in which no Hugos were originally awarded Prior to they could be awarded for works in a year or years prior after where there was a Worldcon but where no Hugos were awarded Retro Hugos are given by a Worldcon in the categories that are currently in use and are optional some Worldcons have chosen not to award them despite a year being eligible Even for years in which Retro Hugos are given not all categories receive enough nominations to receive a ballot In the eligible years were specified to be and which expanded the possible years to include those post in which no Worldcon was held at all Of the fifteen years eligible awards have been given for eight br br br History br br br s br The first Hugo Awards were presented at the th Worldcon in Philadelphia in which awarded Hugos in seven categories The awards presented that year were initially conceived as a one off event though the organizers hoped that subsequent conventions would also present them At the time Worldcons were completely run by their respective committees as independent events and had no oversight between years Thus there was no mandate for any future conventions to repeat the awards and no set rules for how to do so br The Worldcon chose not to but the awards were reinstated at the Worldcon and thereafter became traditional The award was called the Annual Science Fiction Achievement Award with Hugo Award being an unofficial but better known name The nickname was accepted as an official alternative name in and since the awards the nickname has been adopted as the official name of the award br For the first few years Hugo Awards had no published rules and were given for works published in the preceding year leading up to the convention which was not defined but generally covered the period between conventions rather than calendar years In though there were still no formal guidelines governing the awards several rules were instated which thereafter became traditional These included having a ballot for nominating works earlier in the year and separate from the voting ballot defining eligibility to include works published in the previous calendar year rather than the ambiguous preceding year and allowing voters to select No Award as an option if no nominated works were felt to be deserving of the award No Award won that year in two categories Dramatic Presentation and Best New Author The eligibility change additionally sparked a separate rule prohibiting the nomination of works which had been nominated for the awards as the two time periods overlapped br br br s br In after the formation of the WSFS to oversee each Worldcon committee formal rules were set down in the WSFS constitution mandating the presenting of the awards as one of the responsibilities of each Worldcon organizing committee The rules restricted voting to members of the convention at which the awards would be given while still allowing anyone to nominate works nominations were restricted to members of the convention or the previous year s convention in The guidelines also specified the categories that would be awarded which could only be changed by the World Science Fiction Society board These categories were for Best Novel Short Fiction short stories broadly defined Dramatic Presentation Professional Magazine Professional Artist and Best Fanzine was also the second year in which No Award won a category again for Dramatic Presentation br In the guidelines were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories which was codified as up to two categories for that year These additional awards were officially designated as Hugo Awards but were not required to be repeated by future conventions This was later adjusted to only allow one additional category while these special Hugo Awards have been given out in several categories only a few were ever awarded for more than one year br In categories for Novelette Fan Writer and Fan Artist were added and a category for Best Novella was added the following year these new categories had the effect of providing a definition for what word count qualified a work for what category which was previously left up to voters Novelettes had also been awarded prior to the codification of the rules The fan awards were initially conceived as separate from the Hugo Awards with the award for Best Fanzine losing its status but were instead absorbed into the regular Hugo Awards by the convention committee br br br s br While traditionally five works had been selected for nomination in each category out of the proposed nominees in this was set down as a formal rule barring ties In the WSFS removed the category for Best Professional Magazine and a Best Professional Editor award was instated as its replacement in order to recognize the increasing importance of original anthologies br After that year the guidelines were changed again to remove the mandated awards and instead allow up to ten categories which would be chosen by each convention though they were expected to be similar to those presented in the year before Despite this change no new awards were added or previous awards removed before the guidelines were changed back to listing specific categories in and both saw No Award win the Dramatic Presentation category for the third and fourth time No Award did not win any categories afterwards until br br br s and s br In the category for Best Non Fiction Book later renamed Best Related Work was added followed by a category for Best Semiprozine semi professional magazine in In members of the Church of Scientology were encouraged by people such as Charles Platt to nominate as a bloc Battlefield Earth written by the organization s founder L Ron Hubbard for the Best Novel award it did not make the final ballot Another campaign followed in to nominate Hubbard s Black Genesis it made the final ballot but finished behind No Award saw a work The Guardsman by Todd Hamilton and P J Beese withdrawn by its authors from the final ballot after a fan bought numerous memberships under false names all sent in on the same day in order to get the work onto the ballot br In the Best Original Art Work award was given as a special Hugo Award and was listed again in though not actually awarded and established afterward as an official Hugo Award It was then removed from this status in and has not been awarded since The Retro Hugos were created in the mid s and were first awarded in br br br Since br Another special Hugo Award for Best Web Site was given twice in and but never instated as a permanent category In the Dramatic Presentation award was split into two categories Long Form and Short Form This was repeated with the Best Professional Editor category in saw the addition of the Best Graphic Story category and in an award for Best Fancast was added Best Series was added as a permanent category in it was run the year prior as a special Hugo Award prior to being ratified at the business meeting Another special Hugo Award for Best Art Book was run in but was not repeated or made a permanent category The Hugo Awards featured a special Hugo award for video games It was thereafter proposed as a permanent category it was not repeated as a special Hugo Award in or but was ratified as the Best Game or Interactive Work category beginning in br br br Voting bloc campaigns br br In two groups of science fiction writers the Sad Puppies led by Brad R Torgersen and Larry Correia and the Rabid Puppies led by Vox Day each put forward a similar slate of suggested nominations which came to dominate the ballot The Sad Puppies campaign had run for two years prior on a smaller scale with limited success The leaders of the campaigns characterized them as a reaction to niche academic overtly leftist nominees and the Hugo becoming an affirmative action award that preferred female and non white authors and characters In response five nominees declined their nomination before and for the first time two after the ballot was published Multiple Hugo winner Connie Willis declined to present the awards The slates were characterized by The Guardian as a right wing orchestrated backlash and by The A V Club as a group of white guys and were linked with the Gamergate campaign Multiple Hugo winner Samuel R Delany characterized the campaigns as a response to socio economic changes such as minority authors gaining prominence and thus economic heft In all but the Best Dramatic Presentation Long Form category No Award placed above all nominees that were on either slate and it won all five categories that only contained slate nominees The two campaigns were repeated in with some changes and the Rabid Puppy slate again dominated the ballot in several categories with all five nominees in Best Related Work Best Graphic Story Best Professional Artist and Best Fancast br In response to the campaigns a set of new rules called E Pluribus Hugo was passed in and ratified in to modify the nominations process Intended to ensure that organized minority groups cannot dominate every finalist position in a category the new rules define a voting system in which nominees are eliminated one by one with each vote for an eliminated work then spread out over the uneliminated works they nominated until only the final shortlist remains These rules were ratified in to be used for the first time in A rule mandating that the final nominees must appear on at least five percent of ballots was also eliminated to ensure that all categories could reach a full set of nominees even when the initial pool of works was very large Each nominator is limited to five works in each category but the final ballot was changed to six in each additionally no more than two works by a given author or group or in the same dramatic series can be in one category on the final ballot br br br Ballot censorship br br In January the voting statistics for the Hugo Awards from the st World Science Fiction Convention which was held in Chengdu China came into question due to several authors being declared ineligible without explanation including Neil Gaiman R F Kuang Xiran Jay Zhao and Paul Weimer Leaked emails revealed that the authors were excluded due to self censorship by the Hugo Award administrators in order to appease the Chinese government known to have a strict censorship regime Additionally an unknown number of ballots from Chinese voters were rejected because an award administrator considered them to be similar to a recommendations list published by the Chinese SF magazine Science Fiction World and thus equivalent to a slate even though there was no rule against slates br Based on complaints about the Hugo award process and official statements made about those complaints Worldcon Intellectual Property WIP the non profit organization that holds the service marks for the World Science Fiction Society censured the director of WIP and two individuals who presided over the Hugo Administration Committee of the Chengdu Worldcon and reprimanded the chair of the WIP board of directors Both the director of WIP and chair of the WIP board of directors resigned Glasgow Chairperson Esther MacCallum Stewart announced in February that to ensure transparency in the awards selection they would keep a log of all decisions publish the reasons for any disqualification of potential finalists by April and publish the full voting statistics immediately after the awards ceremony on August br br br Voter fraud identified br In July the Hugo administration announced that roughly of all votes cast were determined to be fraudulently paid for to help one finalist win and these votes were subsequently invalidated from the final tally The Hugo administration commented that they have no evidence that Finalist A was at all aware of the fraudulent votes being cast for them let alone in any way responsible for the operation so Finalist A will not be identified additionally Finalist A did not win their category without the fraudulent votes The Guardian noted that only members of the World Science Fiction Society WSFS can nominate works for the Hugos and vote on finalists which costs a minimum of each year Based on the Hugo administration subcommittee s tally paying for memberships would have cost at least A US br br br Categories br br Worldcon committees may also give out special awards during the Hugo ceremony which are not voted on Unlike the additional Hugo categories which Worldcons may present these awards are not officially Hugo Awards and do not use the same trophy though they once did Two additional awards the Astounding Award for Best New Writer and the Lodestar Award for Best Young Adult Book are presented at the Hugo Award ceremony and voted on by the same process but are not formally Hugo Awards br br br Recognition br The Hugo Award is highly regarded by observers The Los Angeles Times has termed it among the highest honors bestowed in science fiction and fantasy writing a claim echoed by Wired who said that it was the premier award in the science fiction genre Justine Larbalestier in The Battle of the Sexes in Science Fiction referred to the awards as the best known and most prestigious of the science fiction awards and Jo Walton writing in An Informal History of the Hugos said it was undoubtedly science fiction s premier award The Guardian similarly acknowledged it as a fine showcase for speculative fiction as well as one of the most venerable democratic and international science fiction awards in existence James Gunn in The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction echoed The Guardian s statement of the award s democratic nature saying that because of its broad electorate the Hugos were the awards most representative of reader popularity Camille Bacon Smith in Science Fiction Culture said that at the time fewer than people voted on the final ballot she held however that this is a representative sample of the readership at large given the number of winning novels that remain in print for decades or become notable outside of the science fiction genre such as The Demolished Man or The Left Hand of Darkness The awards saw over nomination submissions and over voters on the final ballot while the awards received votes The awards saw nominating ballots and votes which was described as less than in but more than any year before then br Brian Aldiss in his book Trillion Year Spree The History of Science Fiction claimed that the Hugo Award was a barometer of reader popularity rather than artistic merit he contrasted it with the panel selected Nebula Award which provided more literary judgment though he did note that the winners of the two awards often overlapped Along with the Hugo Award the Nebula Award is also considered one of the premier awards in science fiction with Laura Miller of Salon com terming it science fiction s most prestigious award br The official logo of the Hugo Awards is often placed on the winning books cover as a promotional tool Gahan Wilson in First World Fantasy Awards claimed that noting that a book had won the Hugo Award on the cover demonstrably increased sales for that novel though Orson Scott Card said in his book How to Write Science Fiction Fantasy that the award had a larger effect on foreign sales than in the United States Spider Robinson in claimed that publishers were very interested in authors that won a Hugo Award more so than for other awards such as the Nebula Award Literary agent Richard Curtis said in his Mastering the Business of Writing that having the term Hugo Award on the cover even as a nominee was a powerful inducement to science fiction fans to buy a novel while Jo Walton claimed in that the Hugo is the only science fiction award that actually affects sales of a book br There have been several anthologies of Hugo winning short fiction The series The Hugo Winners edited by Isaac Asimov was started in as a collection of short story winners up to the previous year and concluded with the Hugos in Volume The New Hugo Winners edited originally by Asimov later by Connie Willis and finally by Gregory Benford has four volumes collecting stories from the to the Hugos The most recent anthology is The Hugo Award Showcase edited by Mary Robinette Kowal It contains most of the short stories novelettes and novellas that were nominated for the award br br
