Weird fiction is a subgenre of speculative fiction originating in the late th and early th centuries Weird fiction either eschews or radically reinterprets traditional antagonists of supernatural horror fiction such as ghosts vampires and werewolves Writers on the subject of weird fiction such as China Mi ville sometimes use the tentacle to represent this type of writing The tentacle is a limb type absent from most of the monsters of European folklore and gothic fiction but often attached to the monstrous creatures created by weird fiction writers such as William Hope Hodgson M R James Clark Ashton Smith and H P Lovecraft br Weird fiction often attempts to inspire awe as well as fear in response to its fictional creations causing commentators like Mi ville to paraphrase Goethe in saying that weird fiction evokes a sense of the numinous Although weird fiction has been chiefly used as a historical description for works through the s it experienced a resurgence in the s and s under the label of New Weird which continues into the st century br br br Definitions br John Clute defines weird fiction as a term used loosely to describe fantasy supernatural fiction and horror tales embodying transgressive material China Mi ville defines it as usually roughly conceived of as a rather breathless and generically slippery macabre fiction a dark fantastic horror plus fantasy often featuring nontraditional alien monsters thus plus science fiction Discussing the Old Weird Fiction published in the late th and early th centuries Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock says Old Weird fiction utilises elements of horror science fiction and fantasy to showcase the impotence and insignificance of human beings within a much larger universe populated by often malign powers and forces that greatly exceed the human capacities to understand or control them Jeff and Ann VanderMeer describe weird fiction as a mode of literature usually appearing within the horror fiction genre rather than a separate genre of fiction in its own right br br br History br br Although the term weird fiction did not appear until the th century Edgar Allan Poe is often regarded as the pioneering author of weird fiction Poe was identified by Lovecraft as the first author of a distinct type of supernatural fiction different from traditional Gothic literature and later commentators on the term have also suggested Poe was the first weird fiction writer Sheridan Le Fanu is also seen as an early writer working in the sub genre br Literary critics in the nineteenth century would sometimes use the term weird to describe supernatural fiction For instance the Scottish Review in an article praised Poe E T A Hoffmann and Walter Scott by saying the three writers had the power of weird imagination The Irish magazine The Freeman s Journal in an review of Dracula by Bram Stoker described the novel as wild and weird and not Gothic Weinstock has suggested there was a period of Old Weird Fiction that lasted from the late th to early th centuries S T Joshi and Mi ville have both argued that there was a period of Haute Weird between and when authors important to Weird Fiction such as Arthur Machen and Clark Ashton Smith were publishing their work br In the late nineteenth century a number of British writers associated with the Decadent movement wrote what was later described as weird fiction These writers included Machen M P Shiel Count Eric Stenbock and R Murray Gilchrist Other pioneering British weird fiction writers included Algernon Blackwood William Hope Hodgson Lord Dunsany Arthur Machen and M R James br The American pulp magazine Weird Tales published many such stories in the United States from March to September The magazine s editor Farnsworth Wright often used the term weird fiction to describe the type of material that the magazine published The writers who wrote for the magazine Weird Tales are thus closely identified with the weird fiction subgenre especially H P Lovecraft Clark Ashton Smith Fritz Leiber and Robert Bloch Other pulp magazines that published weird fiction included Strange Tales edited by Harry Bates and Unknown Worlds edited by John W Campbell br H P Lovecraft popularised the term weird fiction in his essays In Supernatural Horror in Literature Lovecraft gives his definition of weird fiction br br The true weird tale has something more than secret murder bloody bones or a sheeted form clanking chains according to rule A certain atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable dread of outer unknown forces must be present and there must be a hint expressed with a seriousness and portentousness becoming its subject of that most terrible conception of the human brain a malign and particular suspension or defeat of those fixed laws of Nature which are our only safeguard against the assaults of chaos and the daemons of unplumbed space br S T Joshi describes several subdivisions of the weird tale supernatural horror or fantastique the ghost story quasi science fiction fantasy and ambiguous horror fiction and argues that the weird tale is primarily the result of the philosophical and aesthetic predispositions of the authors associated with this type of fiction br Although Lovecraft was one of the few early th century writers to describe his work as weird fiction the term has enjoyed a contemporary revival in New Weird fiction Many horror writers have also situated themselves within the weird tradition including Clive Barker who describes his fiction as fantastique and Ramsey Campbell whose early work was influenced by Lovecraft
