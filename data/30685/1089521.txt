The Four Loves is a book by C S Lewis which explores the nature of love from a Christian and philosophical perspective through thought experiments The book was based on a set of radio talks from which had been criticised in the U S at the time for their frankness about sex br br Taking his start from St John s words God is Love Lewis initially thought to contrast Need love such as the love of a child for its mother and Gift love epitomized by God s love for humanity to the disparagement of the former However he swiftly happened on the insight that the natures of even these basic categorizations of love are more complicated than they at first seemed a child s need for parental comfort is a necessity not a selfish indulgence while conversely parental Gift love in excessive form can be a perversion of its own br br Lewis continues his examination by exploring the nature of pleasure distinguishing Need pleasures such as water for the thirsty from Pleasures of Appreciation such as the love of nature From the latter he developed what he called a third element in love Appreciative love to go along with Need love and Gift love br Throughout the rest of the book Lewis goes on to counterpoint that three fold qualitative distinction against the four broad types of loves indicated in his title br In his remaining four chapters Lewis treats love under four categories the highest does not stand without the lowest based in part on the four Greek words for love affection friendship eros and charity Lewis states that just as Lucifer a former archangel perverted himself by pride and fell into depravity so too can love commonly held to be the arch emotion become corrupt by presuming itself to be what it is not br A fictional treatment of these loves is the main theme of Lewis s novel Till We Have Faces br br Storge storg Greek is liking someone through the fondness of familiarity family members or people who relate in familiar ways that have otherwise found themselves bonded by chance An example is the natural love and affection of a parent for their child It is described as the most natural emotive and widely diffused of loves It is natural in that it is present without coercion emotive because it is the result of fondness due to familiarity and most widely diffused because it pays the least attention to those characteristics deemed valuable or worthy of love and as a result is able to transcend most discriminating factors Lewis describes it as a dependency based love which risks extinction if the needs cease to be met br Affection for Lewis included both Need love and Gift love He considered it responsible for nine tenths of all solid and lasting human happiness br However affection s strength is also what makes it vulnerable Affection has the appearance of being built in or ready made says Lewis and as a result people come to expect it irrespective of their behaviour and its natural consequences Both in its Need and its Gift form affection then is liable to go bad and to be corrupted by such forces as jealousy ambivalence and smothering br br Philia Greek is the love between friends as close as siblings in strength and duration The friendship is the strong bond existing between people who share common values interests or activities Lewis immediately differentiates friendship love from the other loves He describes friendship as the least biological organic instinctive gregarious and necessary the least natural of loves Our species does not need friendship in order to reproduce but to the classical and medieval worlds it is a higher level love because it is freely chosen br Lewis explains that true friendships like the friendship between David and Jonathan in the Bible are almost a lost art He expresses a strong distaste for the way modern society ignores friendship He notes that he cannot remember any poem that celebrated true friendship like that between David and Jonathan Orestes and Pylades Roland and Oliver Amis and Amiles Lewis goes on to say to the Ancients Friendship seemed the happiest and most fully human of all loves the crown of life and the school of virtue The modern world in comparison ignores it br Growing out of companionship friendship for Lewis was a deeply appreciative love though one which he felt few people in modern society could value at its worth because so few actually experienced true friendship br Nevertheless Lewis was not blind to what he considered the dangers of friendships such as its potential for cliquiness anti authoritarianism and pride br br Eros er s Greek for Lewis was love in the sense of being in love or loving someone as opposed to the raw sexuality of what he called Venus the illustration Lewis used was the distinction between wanting a woman and wanting one particular woman something that matched his classical view of man as a rational animal a composite both of reasoning angel and instinctual alley cat br Eros turns the need pleasure of Venus into the most appreciative of all pleasures but nevertheless Lewis warned against the modern tendency for Eros to become a god to people who fully submit themselves to it a justification for selfishness even a phallic religion br After exploring sexual activity and its spiritual significance in both a pagan and a Christian sense he notes how Eros or being in love is in itself an indifferent neutral force how Eros in all his splendour may urge to evil as well as good br While accepting that Eros can be an extremely profound experience he does not overlook the dark way in which it could lead even to the point of suicide pacts or murder as well as to furious refusals to part mercilessly chaining together two mutual tormentors each raw all over with the poison of hate in love br br Charity ag p Greek is the love that exists regardless of changing circumstances Lewis recognizes this selfless love as the greatest of the four loves and sees it as a specifically Christian virtue to achieve The chapter on the subject focuses on the need to subordinate the other three natural loves as Lewis puts it The natural loves are not self sufficient to the love of God who is full of charitable love to prevent what he termed their demonic self aggrandizement br br The Four Loves at Faded Page Canada br Quotations allusions in The Four Loves br The Four Loves on German ad fontes org
