Apes collectively Hominoidea are a clade of Old World simians native to sub Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia though they were more widespread in Africa most of Asia and Europe in prehistory which together with its sister group Cercopithecidae form the catarrhine clade cladistically making them monkeys Apes do not have tails due to a mutation of the TBXT gene In traditional and non scientific use the term ape can include tailless primates taxonomically considered Cercopithecidae such as the Barbary ape and black ape and is thus not equivalent to the scientific taxon Hominoidea There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea the gibbons or lesser apes and the hominids or great apes br br The family Hylobatidae the lesser apes include four genera and a total of species of gibbon including the lar gibbon and the siamang all native to Asia They are highly arboreal and bipedal on the ground They have lighter bodies and smaller social groups than great apes br The family Hominidae hominids the great apes include four genera comprising three extant species of orangutans and their subspecies two extant species of gorillas and their subspecies two extant species of panins bonobos and chimpanzees and their subspecies and humans in a single extant subspecies br Except for gorillas and humans hominoids are agile climbers of trees Apes eat a variety of plant and animal foods with the majority of food being plant foods which can include fruits leaves stalks roots and seeds including nuts and grass seeds Human diets are sometimes substantially different from that of other hominoids due in part to the development of technology and a wide range of habitation Humans are by far the most numerous of the hominoid species in fact outnumbering all other primates by a factor of several thousand to one br All non human hominoids are rare and threatened with extinction The eastern hoolock gibbon is the least threatened only being vulnerable to extinction Five gibbon species are critically endangered as are all species of orangutan and gorilla The remaining species of gibbon the bonobo and all four species of chimpanzees are endangered The chief threat to most of the endangered species is loss of tropical rainforest habitat though some populations are further imperiled by hunting for bushmeat The great apes of Africa are also facing threat from the Ebola virus Currently considered to be the greatest threat to survival of African apes Ebola infection is responsible for the death of at least one third of all gorillas and chimpanzees since br br br Name and terminology br br Ape from Old English apa is a word of uncertain origin The term has a history of rather imprecise usage and of comedic or punning usage in the vernacular Its earliest meaning was generally of any non human anthropoid primate as is still the case for its cognates in other Germanic languages br Later after the term monkey had been introduced into English ape was specialized to refer to a tailless therefore exceptionally human like primate Thus the term ape obtained two different meanings as shown in the Encyclop dia Britannica entry it could be used as a synonym for monkey and it could denote the tailless human like primate in particular br Some or recently all hominoids are also called apes but the term is used broadly and has several different senses within both popular and scientific settings Ape has been used as a synonym for monkey or for naming any primate with a human like appearance particularly those without a tail Biologists have traditionally used the term ape to mean a member of the superfamily Hominoidea other than humans but more recently to mean all members of Hominoidea So ape not to be confused with great ape now becomes another word for hominoid including humans br The taxonomic term hominoid is derived from and intended as encompassing the hominids the family of great apes Both terms were introduced by Gray The term hominins is also due to Gray intended as including the human lineage see also Hominidae Terminology Human taxonomy br The distinction between apes and monkeys is complicated by the traditional paraphyly of monkeys Apes emerged as a sister group of Old World Monkeys in the catarrhines which are a sister group of New World Monkeys Therefore cladistically apes catarrhines and related contemporary extinct groups such as Parapithecidae are monkeys as well for any consistent definition of monkey Old World monkey may also legitimately be taken to be meant to include all the catarrhines including apes and extinct species such as Aegyptopithecus in which case the apes Cercopithecoidea and Aegyptopithecus emerged within the Old World monkeys br The primates called apes today became known to Europeans after the th century As zoological knowledge developed it became clear that taillessness occurred in a number of different and otherwise distantly related species Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark was one of those primatologists who developed the idea that there were trends in primate evolution and that the extant members of the order could be arranged in an ascending series leading from monkeys to apes to humans Within this tradition ape came to refer to all members of the superfamily Hominoidea except humans As such this use of apes represented a paraphyletic grouping meaning that even though all species of apes were descended from a common ancestor this grouping did not include all the descendant species because humans were excluded from being among the apes br Traditionally the English language vernacular name apes does not include humans but phylogenetically humans Homo form part of the family Hominidae within Hominoidea Thus there are at least three common or traditional uses of the term ape non specialists may not distinguish between monkeys and apes that is they may use the two terms interchangeably or they may use ape for any tailless monkey or non human hominoid or they may use the term ape to just mean the non human hominoids br Modern taxonomy aims for the use of monophyletic groups for taxonomic classification br Some literature may now use the common name ape to mean all members of the superfamily Hominoidea including humans For example in his book Benton wrote The apes Hominoidea today include the gibbons and orang utan the gorilla and chimpanzee and humans Modern biologists and primatologists refer to apes that are not human as non human apes Scientists broadly other than paleoanthropologists may use the term hominin to identify the human clade replacing the term hominid See terminology of primate names br See below History of hominoid taxonomy for a discussion of changes in scientific classification and terminology regarding hominoids br br br Evolution br br Although the hominoid fossil record is still incomplete and fragmentary there is now enough evidence to provide an outline of the evolutionary history of humans Previously the divergence between humans and other extant hominoids was thought to have occurred to million years ago and several species of that time period such as Ramapithecus were once thought to be hominins and possible ancestors of humans But later fossil finds indicated that Ramapithecus was more closely related to the orangutan and new biochemical evidence indicates that the last common ancestor of humans and non hominins that is the chimpanzees occurred between and million years ago and probably nearer the lower end of that range more recent see Chimpanzee human last common ancestor CHLCA br br br Taxonomic classification and phylogeny br br Genetic analysis combined with fossil evidence indicates that hominoids diverged from the Old World monkeys about million years ago mya near the Oligocene Miocene boundary The gibbons split from the rest about mya and the hominid splits happened mya Pongo mya Gorilla and mya Homo Pan In a new genus and species were described Pliobates cataloniae which lived mya and appears to predate the split between Hominidae and Hylobatidae br br The families and extant genera and species of hominoids are br

History of hominoid taxonomy br br The history of hominoid taxonomy is complex and somewhat confusing Recent evidence has changed our understanding of the relationships between the hominoids especially regarding the human lineage and the traditionally used terms have become somewhat confused Competing approaches to methodology and terminology are found among current scientific sources Over time authorities have changed the names and the meanings of names of groups and subgroups as new evidence that is new discoveries of fossils and tools and of observations in the field plus continual comparisons of anatomy and DNA sequences has changed the understanding of relationships between hominoids There has been a gradual demotion of humans from being special in the taxonomy to being one branch among many This recent turmoil of history illustrates the growing influence on all taxonomy of cladistics the science of classifying living things strictly according to their lines of descent br Today there are eight extant genera of hominoids They are the four genera in the family Hominidae namely Homo Pan Gorilla and Pongo plus four genera in the family Hylobatidae gibbons Hylobates Hoolock Nomascus and Symphalangus The two subspecies of hoolock gibbons were recently moved from the genus Bunopithecus to the new genus Hoolock and re ranked as species a third species was described in January br In Carl Linnaeus relying on second or third hand accounts placed a second species in Homo along with H sapiens Homo troglodytes cave dwelling man Although the term Orang Outang is listed as a variety Homo sylvestris under this species it is nevertheless not clear to which animal this name refers as Linnaeus had no specimen to refer to hence no precise description Linnaeus may have based Homo troglodytes on reports of mythical creatures then unidentified simians or Asian natives dressed in animal skins Linnaeus named the orangutan Simia satyrus satyr monkey He placed the three genera Homo Simia and Lemur in the order of Primates br The troglodytes name was used for the chimpanzee by Blumenbach in but moved to the genus Simia The orangutan was moved to the genus Pongo in by Lac p de br Linnaeus s inclusion of humans in the primates with monkeys and apes was troubling for people who denied a close relationship between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom Linnaeus s Lutheran archbishop had accused him of impiety In a letter to Johann Georg Gmelin dated February Linnaeus wrote br br It is not pleasing to me that I must place humans among the primates but man is intimately familiar with himself Let s not quibble over words It will be the same to me whatever name is applied But I desperately seek from you and from the whole world a general difference between men and simians from the principles of Natural History I certainly know of none If only someone might tell me one If I called man a simian or vice versa I would bring together all the theologians against me Perhaps I ought to in accordance with the law of Natural History br Accordingly Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in the first edition of his Manual of Natural History proposed that the primates be divided into the Quadrumana four handed i e apes and monkeys and Bimana two handed i e humans This distinction was taken up by other naturalists most notably Georges Cuvier Some elevated the distinction to the level of order br However the many affinities between humans and other primates and especially the great apes made it clear that the distinction made no scientific sense In his book The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex Charles Darwin wrote br br The greater number of naturalists who have taken into consideration the whole structure of man including his mental faculties have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier and have placed man in a separate Order under the title of the Bimana and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana Carnivora etc Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus so remarkable for his sagacity and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana under the title of the Primates The justice of this conclusion will be admitted for in the first place we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana lately insisted upon by Bischoff Aeby and others apparently follow from their differently developed brains In the second place we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature and relate chiefly to the erect position of man such as the structure of his hand foot and pelvis the curvature of his spine and the position of his head br br br Changes in taxonomy and terminology br br br Characteristics br br The lesser apes are the gibbon family Hylobatidae of sixteen species all are native to Asia Their major differentiating characteristic is their long arms which they use to brachiate through trees Their wrists are ball and socket joints as an evolutionary adaptation to their arboreal lifestyle Generally smaller than the African apes the largest gibbon the siamang weighs up to kg lb in comparison the smallest great ape the bonobo is to kg to lb br The superfamily Hominoidea falls within the parvorder Catarrhini which also includes the Old World monkeys of Africa and Eurasia Within this grouping the two families Hylobatidae and Hominidae can be distinguished from Old World monkeys by the number of cusps on their molars hominoids have five in the Y molar pattern whereas Old World monkeys have only four in a bilophodont pattern br Further in comparison with Old World monkeys hominoids are noted for more mobile shoulder joints and arms due to the dorsal position of the scapula broader ribcages that are flatter front to back and a shorter less mobile spine with greatly reduced caudal tail vertebrae resulting in complete loss of the tail in extant hominoid species These are anatomical adaptations first to vertical hanging and swinging locomotion brachiation and later to developing balance in a bipedal pose Note there are primates in other families that also lack tails and at least one the pig tailed langur is known to walk significant distances bipedally The front of the ape skull is characterised by its sinuses fusion of the frontal bone and by post orbital constriction br br br Distinction from monkeys br br Cladistically apes catarrhines and extinct species such as Aegyptopithecus and Parapithecidaea are monkeys so one can only specify ape features not present in other monkeys br Unlike most monkeys apes do not possess a tail Monkeys are more likely to be in trees and use their tails for balance While the great apes are considerably larger than monkeys gibbons lesser apes are smaller than some monkeys Apes are considered to be more intelligent than monkeys which are considered to have more primitive brains br The enzyme urate oxidase has become inactive in all apes its function having been lost in two primate lineages during the middle Miocene first in the common ancestors of Hominidae and later in the common ancestor of Hylobatidae It has been hypothesized that in both incidents it was a mutation that occurred in apes living in Europe when the climate was getting colder leading to starvation during winter The mutation changed the biochemistry of the apes and made it easier to accumulate fat which allowed the animals to survive longer periods of starvation When they migrated to Asia and Africa this genetic trait remained br br br Behaviour br Major studies of behaviour in the field were completed on the three better known great apes for example by Jane Goodall Dian Fossey and Birut Galdikas These studies have shown that in their natural environments the non human hominoids show sharply varying social structure gibbons are monogamous territorial pair bonders orangutans are solitary gorillas live in small troops with a single adult male leader while chimpanzees live in larger troops with bonobos exhibiting promiscuous sexual behaviour Their diets also vary gorillas are foliovores while the others are all primarily frugivores although the common chimpanzee hunts for meat Foraging behaviour is correspondingly variable br In November scientists reported for the first time evidence that groups of primates including apes and particularly bonobos are capable of cooperating with each other br br br Diet br Apart from humans and gorillas apes eat a predominantly frugivorous diet mostly fruit but supplemented with a variety of other foods Gorillas are predominantly folivorous eating mostly stalks shoots roots and leaves with some fruit and other foods Non human apes usually eat a small amount of raw animal foods such as insects or eggs In the case of humans migration and the invention of hunting tools and cooking has led to an even wider variety of foods and diets with many human diets including large amounts of cooked tubers roots or legumes Other food production and processing methods including animal husbandry and industrial refining and processing have further changed human diets Humans and other apes occasionally eat other primates Some of these primates are now close to extinction with habitat loss being the underlying cause br br br Cognition br br All the non human hominoids are generally thought of as highly intelligent and scientific study has broadly confirmed that they perform very well on a wide range of cognitive tests though there is relatively little data on gibbon cognition The early studies by Wolfgang K hler demonstrated exceptional problem solving abilities in chimpanzees which K hler attributed to insight The use of tools has been repeatedly demonstrated more recently the manufacture of tools has been documented both in the wild and in laboratory tests Imitation is much more easily demonstrated in great apes than in other primate species Almost all the studies in animal language acquisition have been done with great apes and though there is continuing dispute as to whether they demonstrate real language abilities there is no doubt that they involve significant feats of learning Chimpanzees in different parts of Africa have developed tools that are used in food acquisition demonstrating a
