Games upon hosting the Summer Olympics br br br Toponymy br br London is an ancient name attested in the first century AD usually in the Latinised form Londinium Modern scientific analyses of the name must account for the origins of the different forms found in early sources Latin usually Londinium Old English usually Lunden and Welsh usually Llundein with reference to the known developments over time of sounds in those different languages It is agreed that the name came into these languages from Common Brythonic recent work tends to reconstruct the lost Celtic form of the name as Londonjon or something similar This was then adapted into Latin as Londinium and borrowed into Old English br Until the name London applied officially only to the City of London but since then it has also referred to the County of London and to Greater London br br br History br br br Prehistory br In remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the south foreshore upstream from Vauxhall Bridge Two of the timbers were radiocarbon dated to BC In foundations of a large timber structure dated to BC were found on the Thames s south foreshore downstream from Vauxhall Bridge Both structures are on the south bank of the Thames where the now underground River Effra flows into the Thames br br br Roman London br br Despite the evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area the first major settlement was founded by the Romans around AD about four years after their invasion of AD This only lasted until about AD when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it and burnt it to the ground br The next planned incarnation of Londinium prospered superseding Colchester as the principal city of the Roman province of Britannia in At its height in the nd century Roman London had a population of about br br br Anglo Saxon and Viking period London br With the early th century collapse of Roman rule the walled city of Londinium was effectively abandoned although Roman civilisation continued around St Martin in the Fields until about From about an Anglo Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic developed slightly west of the old Roman city By about the city had become a major port again but there is little evidence of large scale production From the s repeated Viking assaults brought decline Three are recorded those in and succeeded while the last in was rebuffed br The Vikings applied Danelaw over much of eastern and northern England its boundary running roughly from London to Chester as an area of political and geographical control imposed by the Viking incursions formally agreed by the Danish warlord Guthrum and the West Saxon king Alfred the Great in The Anglo Saxon Chronicle records that Alfred refounded London in Archaeological research shows this involved abandonment of Lundenwic and a revival of life and trade within the old Roman walls London then grew slowly until a dramatic increase in about br By the th century London was clearly the largest town in England Westminster Abbey rebuilt in Romanesque style by King Edward the Confessor was one of the grandest churches in Europe Winchester had been the capital of Anglo Saxon England but from this time London became the main forum for foreign traders and the base for defence in time of war In the view of Frank Stenton It had the resources and it was rapidly developing the dignity and the political self consciousness appropriate to a national capital br br br Middle Ages br br After winning the Battle of Hastings William Duke of Normandy was crowned King of England in newly completed Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day William built the Tower of London the first of many such in England rebuilt in stone in the south eastern corner of the city to intimidate the inhabitants In William II began building Westminster Hall near the abbey It became the basis of a new Palace of Westminster br In the th century the institutions of central government which had hitherto followed the royal English court around the country grew in size and sophistication and became increasingly fixed for most purposes at Westminster although the royal treasury came to rest in the Tower While the City of Westminster developed into a true governmental capital its distinct neighbour the City of London remained England s largest city and principal commercial centre and flourished under its own unique administration the Corporation of London In its population was some by it had grown to nearly With the Black Death in the mid th century London lost nearly a third of its population London was the

business in the city In the Hanseatic League set up a main trading base kontor of England in London called the Stalhof or Steelyard It remained until when the Hanseatic cities of L beck Bremen and Hamburg sold the property to South Eastern Railway Woollen cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from th th century London to the nearby shores of the Low Countries br Yet English maritime enterprise hardly reached beyond the seas of north west Europe The commercial route to Italy and the Mediterranean was normally through Antwerp and over the Alps any ships passing through the Strait of Gibraltar to or from England were likely to be Italian or Ragusan The reopening of the Netherlands to English shipping in January spurred a burst of commercial activity The Royal Exchange was founded Mercantilism grew and monopoly traders such as the East India Company were founded as trade expanded to the New World London became the main North Sea port with migrants arriving from England and abroad The population rose from about in to about in br br In the th century William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London during English Renaissance theatre Shakespeare s Globe Theatre

in Westminster in the Gunpowder Plot of November In the government of Charles I attempted to reform administration in the London area This called for the Corporation of the city to extend its jurisdiction and administration over expanding areas around the city Fearing an attempt by the Crown to diminish the Liberties of London coupled with a lack of interest in administering these additional areas or concern by city guilds of having to share power caused the Corporation s The Great Refusal a decision which largely continues to account for the unique governmental status of the City br br In the English Civil War the majority of Londoners supported the Parliamentary cause After an initial advance by the Royalists in culminating in the battles of Brentford and Turnham Green London was surrounded by a defensive perimeter wall known as the Lines of Communication The lines were built by up to people and were completed in under two months br The fortifications failed their only test when the New Model Army entered London in and they were levelled by Parliament the same year London was plagued by disease in the early th century culminating in the Great Plague of which

about to with a population density of per acre per hectare In addition to the growing number of stores selling goods such as Harding Howell Co one of the first department stores located on Pall Mall the streets had scores of street sellers London s overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics claiming lives in and in Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the London Underground the world s first urban rail network The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion in the capital and some surrounding counties it was abolished in when the London County Council was created out of county areas surrounding the capital br From the early years of the th century onwards teashops were found on High Streets across London and the rest of Britain with Lyons who opened the first of their chain of teashops in Piccadilly in leading the way The tearooms such as the Criterion in Piccadilly became a popular meeting place for women from the suffrage movement The city was the target of many attacks during the suffragette bombing and arson campaign between and which saw historic landmarks such as Westminster Abbey and St Paul s Cathedral bombed br br London was bombed

notably violent crime and murder by stabbing and other means have risen There were murders from the start of to mid April Funding cuts to police in London are likely to have contributed to this though other factors are involved However homicide figures fell in with recorded for the year and the murder rate in London is much lower than other major cities around the world br br br Geography br br br Scope br London also known as Greater London is one of nine regions of England and the top subdivision covering most of the city s metropolis The City of London at its core once comprised the whole settlement but as its urban area grew the Corporation of London resisted attempts to amalgamate the city with its suburbs causing London to be defined several ways br br Forty per cent of Greater London is covered by the London post town in which London forms part of postal addresses The London telephone area code covers a larger area similar in size to Greater London although some outer districts are excluded and some just outside included The Greater London boundary has been aligned to the M motorway in places br Further urban expansion is now prevented by the Metropolitan Green Belt although the built up area extends beyond the boundary in places producing a separately defined Greater London Urban Area Beyond this is the vast London commuter belt Greater London is split for some purposes into Inner London and Outer London and by the River Thames into North and South with an informal central London area The coordinates of the nominal centre of London traditionally the original Eleanor Cross at Charing Cross near the junction of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall are about N W br br br Status br Within London both the City of London and the City of Westminster have city status The City of London and the remainder of Greater London are both counties for the purposes of lieutenancies The area of Greater London includes areas that are part of the historic counties of Middlesex Kent Surrey Essex and Hertfordshire More recently Greater London has been defined as a region of England and in this context is known as London br It is the capital of the United Kingdom and of England by convention rather than statute The capital of England was moved to London from Winchester as the Palace of Westminster developed in the th and th centuries to become the permanent location of the royal court and thus the political capital of the nation br br br Topography br br Greater London encompasses a total area of square miles km an area which had a population of in and a population density of inhabitants per square mile km The extended area known as the London Metropolitan Region or the London Metropolitan Agglomeration comprises a total area of square miles km has a population of and a population density of inhabitants per square mile km br Modern London stands on the Thames its primary geographical feature a navigable river which crosses the city from the south west to the east The Thames Valley is a flood plain surrounded by gently rolling hills including Parliament Hill Addington Hills and Primrose Hill Historically London grew up at the lowest bridging point on the Thames The Thames was once a much broader shallower river with extensive marshlands at high tide its shores reached five times their present width br Since the Victorian era the Thames has been extensively embanked and many of its London tributaries now flow underground The Thames is a tidal river and London is vulnerable to flooding The threat has increased over time because of a slow but continuous rise in high water level caused by climate change and by the slow tilting of the British Isles as a result of post glacial rebound br br br Climate br br London has a temperate oceanic climate K ppen Cfb Rainfall records have been kept in the city since at least when records began at Kew At Kew the most rainfall in one month is inches mm in November and the least is inches mm in both December and July Mile End also had inches mm in April The wettest year on record is with a total fall of inches mm and the driest is with a total fall of inches mm The average annual precipitation amounts to about mm which is half the annual rainfall of New York City Despite relatively low annual precipitation London receives rainy days on the mm threshold annually London is vulnerable to climate change and there is concern among hydrological experts that households may run out of water before br Temperature extremes in London range from C F at Heathrow on July down to C F at Northolt on December Records for atmospheric pressure have been kept at London since The highest pressure ever reported is millibars inHg on January br Summers are generally warm sometimes hot London s average July high is C F On average each year London experiences days above C F and days above C F During the European heat wave prolonged heat led to hundreds of heat related deaths A previous spell of consecutive days above C F in England in also caused many heat related deaths A previous temperature of C F in August at the Greenwich station was later disregarded as non standard Droughts can also occasionally be a problem especially in summer most recently in summer and with much drier than average conditions prevailing from May to December However the most consecutive days without rain was days in the spring of br Winters are generally cool with little temperature variation Heavy snow is rare but snow usually falls at least once each winter Spring and autumn can be pleasant As a large city London has a considerable urban heat island effect making the centre of London at times C F warmer than the suburbs and outskirts br br br Areas br br Places within London s vast urban area are identified using area names such as Mayfair Southwark Wembley and Whitechapel These are either informal designations reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs br br Such names have remained in use through tradition each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character but without official boundaries Since Greater London has been divided into London boroughs in addition to the ancient City of London The City of London is the main financial district and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub in the Docklands to the east br The West End is London s main entertainment and shopping district attracting tourists West London includes expensive residential areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds The average price for properties in Kensington and Chelsea is over million with a similarly high outlay in most of central London br The East End is the area closest to the original Port of London known for its high immigrant population as well as for being one of the poorest areas in London The surrounding East London area saw much of London s early industrial development now brownfield sites throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway including the London Riverside and Lower Lea Valley which was developed into the Olympic Park for the Olympics and Paralympics br br br Architecture br br London s buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style partly because of their varying ages Many grand houses and public buildings such as the National Gallery are constructed from Portland stone Some areas of the city particularly those just west of the centre are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed buildings Few structures in central London pre date the Great Fire of these being a few trace Roman remains the Tower of London and a few scattered Tudor survivors in the city Further out is for example the Tudor period Hampton Court Palace br Part of the varied architectural heritage are the th century churches by Christopher Wren neoclassical financial institutions such as the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England to the early th century Old Bailey courthouse and the s Barbican Estate The Battersea Power Station by the river in the south west is a local landmark while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture most notably St Pancras and Paddington The density of London varies with high employment density in the central area and Canary Wharf high residential densities in inner London and lower densities in Outer London br br The Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London which originated nearby Marble Arch and Wellington Arch at the north and south ends of Park Lane respectively have royal connections as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington Nelson s Column built to commemorate Admiral Horatio Nelson is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar Square one of the focal points of central London Older buildings are mainly brick commonly the yellow London stock brick br In the dense areas most of the concentration is via medium and high rise buildings London s skyscrapers such as St Mary Axe dubbed The Gherkin Tower the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square are mostly in the two financial districts the City of London and Canary Wharf High rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul s Cathedral and other historic buildings This protective policy known as St Paul s Heights has been in operation by the City of London since Nevertheless there are a number of tall skyscrapers in central London including the storey Shard London Bridge the tallest building in the United Kingdom and Western Europe br Other notable modern buildings include The Scalpel Fenchurch Street dubbed The Walkie Talkie the former City Hall in Southwark the Art Deco BBC Broadcasting House plus the Postmodernist British Library in Somers

per cent green space or open water They indicate that species of flowering plant have been found growing there and that the tidal Thames supports species of fish They state that over species of bird nest in central London and that their members have recorded species of butterfly moths and more than kinds of spider around London London s wetland areas support nationally important populations of many water birds London has Sites of Special Scientific Interest SSSIs two national nature reserves and local nature reserves br Amphibians are common in the capital including smooth newts living by the Tate Modern and common frogs common toads palmate newts and great crested newts On the other hand native reptiles such as slowworms common lizards barred grass snakes and adders are mostly only seen in Outer London br br Among other inhabitants of London are red foxes so that there are now foxes for every square mile per square kilometre of London Other mammals found in Greater London are hedgehog brown rat mice rabbit shrew vole and grey squirrel In wilder areas of Outer London such as Epping Forest a wide variety of mammals are found including European hare badger field bank and water vole wood mouse yellow necked mouse mole shrew and weasel in addition to red fox grey squirrel and hedgehog A dead otter was found at The Highway in Wapping about a mile from the Tower Bridge which would suggest that they have begun to move back after being absent a hundred years from the city Ten of England s eighteen species of bats have been recorded in Epping Forest soprano Nathusius and common pipistrelles common noctule serotine barbastelle Daubenton s brown long eared Natterer s and Leisler s br Herds of red and fallow deer roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park A cull takes place each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained Epping Forest is also known for its fallow deer which can frequently be seen in herds to the north of the Forest A rare population of melanistic black fallow deer is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois Muntjac deer are also found in the forest While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature and whole herds of fallow deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London s green spaces br br br Demography br br London s continuous urban area extends beyond Greater London and numbered people in while its wider metropolitan area had a population of million depending on the definition used According to Eurostat London is the second most populous metropolitan area in Europe A net immigrants arrived there in the period br The region covers square miles km giving a

Some features of Cockney include Th fronting pronouncing th as f th inside a word is pronounced with a v H dropping and like most English accents a Cockney accent drops the r after a vowel John Camden Hotten in his Slang Dictionary of makes reference to Cockney use of a peculiar slang language Cockney rhyming slang when describing the costermongers of the East End Since the start of the st century the extreme form of the Cockney dialect is less common in parts of the East End itself with modern strongholds including other parts of London and suburbs in the home counties This is particularly pronounced in areas like Romford in the London Borough of Havering and Southend in Essex which have received significant inflows of older East End residents in recent decades br Estuary English is an intermediate accent between Cockney and Received Pronunciation It is widely spoken by people of all classes br Multicultural London English MLE is a multiethnolect becoming increasingly common in
