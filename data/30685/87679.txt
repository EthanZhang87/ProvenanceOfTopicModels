a village known as Battle Bridge which was an ancient crossing of the River Fleet originally known as Broad Ford later Bradford Bridge The river flowed along what is now the west side of Pancras Road until it was rerouted underground in The name Battle Bridge is linked to tradition that this was the site of a major battle between the Romans and the Celtic British Iceni tribe led by Boudica According to folklore King s Cross is the site of Boudica s final battle and some sources say she is buried under one of the platforms Platforms and have been suggested as possible sites Boudica s ghost is also reported to haunt passages under the station around platforms br br King s Cross station was built in as the London terminus of the Great Northern Railway GNR and was the fifth London terminal to be constructed It replaced a temporary station next to Maiden Lane now York Way that had been quickly constructed with the line s arrival in London in and had opened on August br The station took its name from the King s Cross building a monument to King George IV that stood in the area and was demolished in Construction was on the site of a smallpox hospital br Plans for the station were made in December under the direction of George Turnbull resident engineer for constructing the first miles km of the Great Northern Railway out of London The station s detailed design was by Lewis Cubitt the brother of Thomas Cubitt the architect of Bloomsbury Belgravia and Osborne House and Sir William Cubitt who was chief engineer of the Crystal Palace built in and consulting engineer to the Great Northern and South Eastern Railways The design comprised two great arched train sheds with a brick structure at the south end designed to reflect the arches behind Its main

for increased traffic demands An iron footbridge was built halfway down the train shed to connect all the platforms By half the traffic at King s Cross was suburban br A significant bottleneck in the early years of operations was at Gas Works tunnel underneath the Regent s Canal immediately to the north of the station which was built with a single up track and a single down track Commercial traffic was further impeded by having to cross over on level running lines to reach the goods yard Grade separation of goods traffic was achieved by constructing the skew bridge that opened in August and the second and third Gas Works tunnels opened in and respectively br On September a light engine and a coal train collided near the mouth of the Copenhagen Tunnel north of the station because of a signalman s error One person was killed and another was severely injured Bad weather contributed to occasional flooding in the tunnels One such incident in July suspended all traffic from the station

the number of running lines through the Gas Works tunnels from six to four At the same time electrification started with the installation of a kV overhead line to cater for suburban services as part of the Great Northern Suburban Electrification project The works were completed on April and electric services began running from King s Cross to Hertford Welwyn Garden City and Royston br The construction of the Victoria line and its interchange at King s Cross was seen by British Rail as an opportunity to modernise the station A single storey extension containing the main passenger concourse and ticket office designed in house was built at the front of the station in Although intended to be temporary it was still standing years later obscuring the Grade I listed fa ade of the original station Before the extension was built the fa ade was hidden behind a small terrace of shops The extension was demolished in late revealing the Lewis Cubitt architecture In its place the

the tube station caught fire killing people with smoke spreading to the main line station br In British Rail proposed building a new station with four platforms for international trains through the Channel Tunnel and four for Thameslink trains under King s Cross After six years of design work the plans were abandoned and the international terminal was constructed at St Pancras br British Rail completed electrification of the East Coast Main Line to Leeds and Edinburgh between and and electric InterCity rolling stock was introduced to work express services These began service between King s Cross and Leeds on October and to Edinburgh on July br br Before privatisation the King s Cross area had a reputation for run down buildings and prostitution in front of the main entrance There was a major clean up during the s and the station s atmosphere was much improved by the end of the decade br Following the privatisation of British Rail in express services into the station were taken over

and the semi circular structure has a radius of yards m and more than triangular roof panels half of which are glass br br Land between and behind Kings Cross and St Pancras stations is being redeveloped as King s Cross Central with around new homes sq ft m of offices and new roads In the restoration refurbished offices have opened on the east side of the station to replace ones lost on
