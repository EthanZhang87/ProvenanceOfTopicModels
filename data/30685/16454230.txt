the first time in a long while br In the season s finale it is revealed that the funeral Jack went to in the flash forwards was that of John Locke who had been seeking out the Oceanic Six in his efforts to convince them to return to the island br br br Season br br Season follows two timelines The first timeline takes place on the island where the survivors who were left behind erratically jump forward and backward through time In one of these time periods John speaks with Richard Alpert one of the Others who says that to save the island he must bring everyone back John goes to the same underground station Ben went to After moving the wheel himself John is transported to the Sahara in as the time shifts on the island stop and the survivors are stranded with the Dharma Initiative in In John contacts the Oceanic Six but no one wants to return The last one of the Oceanic Six he finds is a depressed Jack John tells Jack his father is alive on the island This seriously affects Jack and he begins taking flights hoping to crash on the island again Ben finds John and kills him After John s death the Oceanic Six are told to board the Ajira Airways Flight to return to the island and in order to go back they have to take John Locke s body in the plane They take the flight but some land in where they meet with the other survivors who are now part of the Dharma Initiative and others land in The survivors in are told by Daniel Faraday that if they detonate a nuclear bomb at the hatch s construction site the electromagnetic energy below it will be negated as a result the hatch would never be built and their future could be changed In John Locke apparently comes back to life He instructs Richard Alpert to speak with a time traveling John and tell him that he must bring everyone back to the island After this he goes to speak with Jacob The season finale reveals that John Locke is still dead and another entity has taken over his form to manipulate Ben into killing Jacob In Juliet detonates the fission core taken from the hydrogen bomb br br br Season br br Season the final season follows two timelines In the first timeline the survivors are sent to the present day as the death of Jacob allows his brother the Man in Black the human alter ego of the Smoke Monster to take over the island Having assumed the form of John Locke the Smoke Monster seeks to escape the island and forces a final war between the forces of good and evil br The second timeline called the flash sideways narrative follows the lives of the main characters in a setting where Oceanic never crashed though additional changes are revealed as other characters are shown living completely different lives than they did In the final episodes a flashback to the distant past shows the origins of the island s power and of the conflict between Jacob and the Man in Black who are revealed to be twin brothers with Jacob desperate to keep his brother from leaving the island after he is transmogrified by the power of the island and becomes the Smoke Monster br In this season Jacob s machinations are revealed everyone was pushed by fate and his manipulation to be on the Oceanic flight as many of the members of the flight were deemed candidates by Jacob to be the new protector of the island after his death The Man in Black s mission since the beginning of the series kill all of the candidates thereby allowing him to leave the island once and for all The ghost of Jacob appears to the last of the surviving candidates and Jack is appointed as the new protector Jack catches up with The Man In Black who says that he wants to go to the heart of the island to turn it off and therefore finally leave the island They reach the place but after doing this The Man In Black becomes mortal The Man In Black is killed by Kate but Jack is seriously injured Hurley one of the survivors becomes the new caretaker of the island Several of the survivors die in the conflict or stay on the island and the remaining escape in the Ajira Plane once and for all Jack returns to the heart of the island and turns it on again saving it Hurley as the new protector asks Ben to help him in his new job which he agrees to do Having saved the island Jack dies peacefully in the same place in which he woke up when he arrived on the island br The series finale reveals that the flash sideways timeline is actually a form of limbo in the afterlife where some of the survivors and other characters from the island are reunited after death In the last scene the survivors are all reunited in a church where they move on together br br br Mythology and interpretations br br Episodes of Lost include a number of mysterious elements ascribed to science fiction or supernatural phenomena The creators of the series refer to these elements as composing the mythology of the series and they formed the basis of fan speculation The show s mythological elements include a Smoke Monster that roams the island a mysterious group of inhabitants whom the survivors called The Others a scientific organization called the Dharma Initiative that placed several research stations on the island a sequence of numbers that frequently appears in the lives of the characters in the past present and future and personal connections synchronicity between the characters of which they are often unaware br At the heart of the series is a complex and cryptic storyline which spawned numerous questions and discussions among viewers Encouraged by Lost s writers and stars who often interacted with fans online viewers and TV critics alike took to widespread theorizing in an attempt to unravel the mysteries Theories mainly concerned the nature of the island the origins of the Monster and the Others the meaning of the numbers and the reasons for both the crash and the survival of some passengers Several of the more common fan theories were discussed and rejected by the show s creators the most common being that the survivors of Oceanic flight are dead and in purgatory Lindelof rejected speculation that spaceships or aliens influenced the events on the island or that everything seen was a fictional reality taking place in someone s mind Carlton Cuse dismissed the theory that the island was a reality TV show and the castaways unwitting housemates and Lindelof many times denied the theory that the Monster was a nanobot cloud similar to the one featured in Michael Crichton s novel Prey which happened to share the protagonist s name Jack br br br Recurring elements br There are several recurring elements and motifs on Lost which generally have no direct effect on the story itself but expand the show s literary and philosophical subtext These elements include frequent appearances of black and white which reflect the dualism within characters and situations as well as rebellion in almost all characters especially Kate dysfunctional family situations especially ones that revolve around the fathers of many characters as portrayed in the lives of nearly all the main characters apocalyptic references including Desmond s pushing the button to forestall the end of the world coincidence versus fate revealed most apparently through the juxtaposition of the characters Locke and Mr Eko conflict between science and faith embodied by the leadership tug of war between Jack and Locke and their stark disagreements on subjects such as the hatch the button and leaving the island the struggle between good and evil shown by the relationship between Jacob and the Man in Black several times by Locke using symbols such as his backgammon set also the white and black rocks that the Man in Black referred to as an inside joke and references to numerous works of literature including mentions and discussions of particular novels One notable reference to a novel is John Steinbeck s Of Mice and Men usually when Sawyer is seen reading it or referencing it There are also many allusions in characters names to famous historical thinkers and writers such as Ben Linus after chemist Linus Pauling John Locke after the philosopher and his alias Jeremy Bentham after the philosopher Danielle Rousseau after philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau Desmond David Hume after philosopher David Hume Juliet s ex husband after philosopher Edmund Burke Mikhail Bakunin after the anarchist philosopher Daniel Faraday after physicist Michael Faraday Eloise Hawking after physicist Stephen Hawking George Minkowski after mathematician Hermann Minkowski Richard Alpert the birth name of spiritual teacher Ram Dass Boone Carlyle after pioneer Daniel Boone and philosopher Thomas Carlyle and Charlotte Staples Lewis after author Clive Staples C S Lewis br br br Cast and characters br br Of the people on board Oceanic Flight there are initial survivors as well as one dog spread across the three sections of the plane crash Although a large cast made Lost more expensive to produce the writers benefited from added flexibility in story decisions According to series executive producer Bryan Burk You can have more interactions between characters and create more diverse characters more back stories more

Studios Bad Robot and Grass Skirt Productions Throughout its run the executive producers of the series were Damon Lindelof J J Abrams Bryan Burk Carlton Cuse Jack Bender Jeff Pinkner Edward Kitsis Adam Horowitz Jean Higgins and Elizabeth Sarnoff with Lindelof and Cuse serving as showrunners br br br Conception br The series was conceived by Lloyd Braun head of ABC at the time while he was on vacation in Hawaii during as a television adaptation of the Tom Hanks film Cast Away crossed with elements of the popular reality show Survivor Braun later pitched his ideas for Cast Away The Series at the network s gathering of executives at the Disney s Grand Californian Hotel Spa in Anaheim California describing the concept as parts Cast Away Survivor and Gilligan s Island with a Lord of the Flies element Many found the idea laughable but senior vice president Thom Sherman saw potential and decided to order an initial script from Spelling Television Spelling producer Ted Gold turned to writer Jeffrey Lieber who presented a pitch to ABC in September titled Nowhere which Sherman approved Unhappy with the eventual script by Lieber and a subsequent rewrite in January Braun contacted J J Abrams who had developed the TV series Alias for ABC to write a new pilot script Lieber would later receive a story credit for the Lost pilot and subsequently shared the created by credit with Abrams and Lindelof after a request for arbitration at the Writers Guild of America The one inviolable edict Braun made to Abrams was that the show s title must be Lost having conceived of the title and being angry at its change to Nowhere by Lieber br Although initially hesitant Abrams warmed to the idea on the condition that the series would have a supernatural angle to it and if he had a writing partner ABC executive Heather Kadin sent him Damon Lindelof who had long intended to meet Abrams as he wished to write for Alias Together Abrams and Lindelof created the series style and characters and also wrote a series bible that conceived and detailed the major mythological ideas and plot points for an ideal four to five season run for the show The novel idea of a story arc spanning several years was inspired by Babylon Because ABC felt that Alias was too serialized Lindelof and Abrams assured the network in the bible that the show would be self contained We promise that each episode requires NO knowledge of the episode s that preceded it there is no Ultimate Mystery which requires solving While such statements contradicted their true plans the ruse succeeded in persuading ABC to purchase the show The game Myst also set in a tropical island was noted as an influence by Lindelof as in its narrative No one told you what the rules were You just had to walk around and explore these environments and gradually a story was told br Abrams created the sound opening of the show and its title card being inspired by The Twilight Zone He withdrew from production of Lost partway through the first season to direct Mission Impossible III leaving Lindelof and new executive producer Carlton Cuse to develop much of the overall mythology of the series themselves However Abrams briefly returned to help co write the third season premiere along with Lindelof The development of the show was constrained by tight deadlines as it had been commissioned late in the season s development cycle Despite the short schedule the creative team remained flexible enough to modify or create characters to fit actors they wished to cast br Lost s two part pilot episode was the most expensive in the network s history reportedly costing between US and million compared to the average cost of an hour long pilot in of million The world premiere of the pilot episode was on July at San Diego Comic Con ABC s parent company Disney fired Braun before Lost s broadcast debut partly because of low ratings at the network and also because he had greenlighted such an expensive and risky project The series debuted on September becoming one of the biggest critical and commercial successes of the television season Along with fellow new series Desperate Housewives and Grey s Anatomy Lost helped to reverse the flagging fortunes of ABC and its great success likely caused the network to ignore that the show almost immediately broke Lindelof and Abrams promises to it regarding Lost s plots br br br Casting br Many of the first season roles were a result of the executive producers liking of various actors The main character Jack was going to die in the pilot and the role was planned for Michael Keaton However ABC executives were adamant that Jack live Before it was decided that Jack would live Kate was to emerge as the leader of the survivors she was conceived as a middle aged businesswoman whose husband had apparently died in the crash a role later fulfilled by the recurring character Rose Dominic Monaghan auditioned for the role of Sawyer who at the time was supposed to be a slick suit wearing city con man The producers enjoyed Monaghan s performance and changed the character of Charlie a washed up former rock star to fit him Jorge Garcia also auditioned for Sawyer and the part of Hurley was written for him When Josh Holloway auditioned for Sawyer the producers liked the edge he brought to the character he reportedly kicked a chair when he forgot his lines and got angry in the audition and his southern accent so they changed Sawyer to fit Holloway s acting Yunjin Kim auditioned for Kate but the producers wrote the character of Sun for her and the character of Jin portrayed by Daniel Dae Kim to be her husband Sayid played by Naveen Andrews was also not in the original script Locke and Michael were written with their actors in mind Emilie de Ravin who played Claire was cast in what was supposed to be a recurring role In the second season Michael Emerson was contracted to play Ben Henry Gale for three episodes His role was extended to eight episodes because of his acting skills and eventually for the whole of season three and later seasons br br br Filming br br Lost was filmed on Panavision mm cameras almost entirely on the Hawaiian island of Oahu given the easily accessible wide diversity of filming locations The original island scenes for the pilot were filmed at Mokul ia Beach near the northwest tip of the island Later beach scenes take place in secluded spots of the famous North Shore Cave scenes in the first season were filmed on a sound stage built at a Xerox parts warehouse which had been empty since an employee mass shooting took place there in In the sound stage and production offices moved to the Hawaii Film Office operated Hawaii Film Studio where the sets depicting Season s Swan Station and Season s Hydra Station interiors were built br Various urban areas in and around Honolulu are used as stand ins for locations around the world including California New York Iowa Miami South Korea Iraq Nigeria United Kingdom Paris Thailand Berlin Maldives and Australia For example scenes set in a Sydney Airport were filmed at the Hawaii Convention Center while a World War II era bunker was used as both an Iraqi Republican Guard installation and a Dharma Initiative research station Scenes set in Germany during the winter were filmed on Merchant St with crushed ice scattered everywhere to create snow and Russian store and automobile signs on the street Several scenes in the Season finale Through the Looking Glass were shot in Los Angeles including a hospital set borrowed from Grey s Anatomy Two scenes during season four were filmed in London because Alan Dale who portrays Widmore was at the time performing in the musical Spamalot and was unable to travel to Hawaii Extensive archives of filming locations are tracked at a repository at the Lost Virtual Tour br br br Promotion br During its six years of broadcasting Lost developed an extensive collection of promotional tools ranging from the traditional promotions of the TV show made by the channel to the creation of alternate reality games such as the Lost Experience Lost showed innovation in the use of new advertising strategies in the sector and the transformation of the conventional devices used previously br br br Music br br Lost features an orchestral score performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony Orchestra and composed by Michael Giacchino incorporating many recurring themes for subjects such as events locations and characters Giacchino achieved some of the sounds for the score using unusual instruments such as striking suspended pieces of the plane s fuselage On March the record label Var se Sarabande released the original television soundtrack for Lost s first season The soundtrack included select

of divided strings percussion harp and three trombones When it features pop songs they often originate from a diegetic source Examples include the various songs played on Hurley s portable CD player throughout the first season until its batteries died in the episode In Translation which featured Damien Rice s Delicate or the use of the record player in the second season which included Cass Elliot s Make Your Own Kind of Music and Petula Clark s Downtown in the second and third season premieres respectively Two episodes show Charlie on a street corner playing guitar and singing the Oasis song Wonderwall In the third season s finale Jack drives down the street listening to Nirvana s Scentless Apprentice right before he arrives to the Hoffs Drawlar Funeral Parlor and in the parallel scene in the fourth season s finale he arrives listening to Gouge Away by Pixies The third season also used Three Dog Night s Shambala on two occasions in the van The only two pop songs that have ever been used without an on screen source i e non diegetic are Ann Margret s Slowly in the episode I Do and I Shall Not Walk Alone written by Ben Harper and covered by The Blind Boys of Alabama in the episode Confidence Man Alternate music is used in several international broadcasts For example in the Japanese broadcast of Lost the theme song used varies by season season one uses Here I Am by Chemistry season two uses Losin by Yuna Ito and season three uses Lonely Girl by Crystal Kay br br br Allegations of toxic work environment br In May Maureen Ryan s book Burn It Down Power Complicity and a Call For Change in Hollywood cited claims made by cast member Harold Perrineau and writers Monica Owusu Breen and Melinda Hsu Taylor of an alleged toxic and racist environment fostered by Lindelof and Cuse Perrineau said he was fired by Lindelof after he asked about his character s death In response to the allegations Lindelof stated my level of fundamental inexperience as a manager and a boss my role as someone who was supposed to model a climate of creative danger and risk taking but provide safety and comfort inside of the creative process I failed in that endeavor Recurring cast member Mira Furlan also recalled an abusive on set experience in her memoir She regarded the entire cast as complicit with the exception of one main actress br br br Reception and impact br br br Critical reception br br Lost has been described by numerous critics as being among the greatest television series of all time Bill Carter television reporter of The New York Times defined Lost as the show with perhaps the most compelling continuing story line in television history Entertainment Weekly put the show on its end of the decade best of list saying Name another network drama that can so wondrously turn a into a In Entertainment Weekly also listed the show at in the Best Cult TV Shows from the Past Years with a hot and cold description Lost was initially celebrated as a moving character driven drama with a broad humanistic worldview that also presented itself as dramatic cryptography that demanded to be solved The appeal narrowed as seasons progressed and the mythology became more complex culminating in a still debated finale that was deeply meaningful to some and dissatisfying poppycock to others In TV Guide ranked Lost as the cult show In TV Guide ranked it as the sci fi show and the best series of all time In September The Guardian ranked the show st on its list of the best TV shows of the st century br br br Season br The first season received critical acclaim USA Today said a totally original fabulously enjoyable lost at sea series Lost had taken an outlandish Saturday serial setup and imbued it with real characters and honest emotions without sacrificing any of the old fashioned fun The Los Angeles Times praised the production values and said it knows the buttons it wants to push fear of flying fear of abandonment fear of the unknown and pushes them repeatedly like a kid playing a video game IGN noted that the first season succeeded first and foremost in character development Lost season one was ranked number one in the Best of TV Coverage Critic Top Ten Lists by Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe Tom Gliatto of People Weekly Charlie McCollum of the San Jose Mercury News and Robert Bianco of USA Today br br br Season br The second season received favorable reviews but it was noted that the season stumbled with some storylines going nowhere and some characters underutilized IGN also noted the addition of Desmond Hume as a standout new character The San Francisco Chronicle called Season an extended mostly unsatisfying foray into deeper mythology with very little payoff After winning Best Drama Series for season one Lost was snubbed by the Emmy Awards in Season Nearing the end of the second season USA Today listed the most popular fan theories during Season the island as a psychological experiment that the hatch had electromagnetic properties string theory of time and that everyone on the island had developed a collective consciousness that allowed them to appear in each other s past One fan interview by USA Today said that Real suspense comes from answers not questions Suspense comes not from wondering what s going on but from wondering what happens next If you withhold answers it becomes impossible to satisfy br br br Season br The first block of episodes of the third season was criticized for raising too many mysteries and not providing enough answers Complaints were also made about the limited screen time for many of the main characters in the first block Locke played by Terry O Quinn who had tied for the highest second season episode count appeared in only of episodes in the third season only two more than guest star M C Gainey who played Tom Reaction to two new characters Nikki and Paulo was generally negative and Lindelof even acknowledged that the couple was universally despised by fans The decision to split the season and the American time slot switch after the hiatus were also criticized Cuse acknowledged that No one was happy with the six episode run The second block of episodes was critically acclaimed however with the crew dealing with problems from the first block More answers were written into the show and Nikki and Paulo were killed off It was also announced that the series would end three seasons after the third season which Cuse hoped would tell the audience that the writers knew where the story was going br br br Season br Metacritic gave season four a weighted average of based on critical reviews For the first time since season one Lost received an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Drama Series Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle said that the Season episodes were roller coasters of fast action and revelation and that series was back on track In a survey conducted by TVWeek of professional critics Lost was voted the best show on television in the first half of by a wide margin apparently crack ing the top five on nearly every critic s submission and receiving nothing but praise The New York Times said the show reveled in critiques of capitalism using the fictional Mittelos Bioscience and the malevolent British industrialist character of Charles Widmore as examples The critic also said that the show was in the dark business of exploring just how futile the modern search for peace knowledge recovery or profit really is The critic did go on to say that the series was not as philosophically refined as The Sopranos or The Wire but that it has maximized the potential of narrative uncertainty and made it a beguiling constant br br br Season br The fifth season once again received mostly positive critical reception Season was given a weighted average of out of by Metacritic Variety said that The ABC series remains one of primetime s most uncompromising efforts and this year s latest wrinkle on flashbacks flash forwards and island disappearing flashes of light does nothing to alter that perception Alan Sepinwall of The Star Ledger said that season may finally be a day of reckoning between those viewers who embrace the show s science fiction trappings and those who prefer not to think about them Sepinwall also related that I loved every minute But I m also a geek who read Ray Bradbury and Isaac Asimov growing up br Heather Havrilesky of Salon com criticized the use of time travel saying that when a narrator brings magic or time travel or an act of God into the picture then uses it without restraint the story loses its anchor to real life The critic also asked Why does it matter what Locke and Richard Alpert and Daniel Faraday or anyone else does when they all seem as clueless and unfettered from reality as we are as viewers How can these characters have any concrete agenda or strategic approach or philosophical perspective on anything when the rug is pulled out from under them by another Act of God every few seconds br The New York Times also commented that what has been most dispiriting about the current season is the show s willingness to abandon many of the larger and more compelling themes that grounded the elaborate plot the struggles between faith and reason the indictments of extreme capitalism the futility of recovery All that remains is the reductively limned battle between fate and free will largely playing out now in Jack Shephard s belief that returning to the island is his Destiny The A V Club said of the fifth season finale Me I found the ending frustrating but in a good way This finale was entertaining as all get out to me and despite the occasional groaner moment I think this may be Lost s most purposeful surprising finale br br br Season br Season six opened to much hype and curiosity The A V Club asked I m guessing that one of the biggest fears of Lost fans as we ride out this sixth and final season bumps and all is that we re going to come to the end and find a big nothing in return for all we ve invested in these characters We don t just need answers we need justifications Why has whatever happened happened Who has called this particular meeting to order and does it really matter who showed up The episodes Dr Linus Ab Aeterno Happily Ever After and The Candidate opened to highly positive critical reception while the third to last episode Across

Place Like Home Parts as the best reviewed episode of Lost He described it as one of the most enthralling entertaining and satisfying conclusions I could have hoped for Carbot also noted that the discussions about the episode may never end saying Lost may be gone but it will hardly be forgotten Eric Deggans of the St Petersburg Times also gave the finale a perfect score stating Sunday s show was an emotional funny expertly measured reminder of what Lost has really centered on since its first moments on the prime time TV landscape faith hope romance and the power of redemption through belief in the best of what moves mankind Robert Bianco of USA Today rated the episode perfect as well deeming the finale can stand with the best any series has produced Hal Boedeker of Orlando Sentinel cited the finale being a stunner br The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph both reported that The End had received negative reviews and disappointed its viewers Alan Sepinwall of Star Ledger was less enthusiastic of the finale stating I m still wrestling with my feelings about The End I thought most of it worked like gangbusters But as someone who did spend at least part of the last six years dwelling on the questions that were unanswered be they little things like the outrigger shootout or why The Others left Dharma in charge of the Swan station after the purge or bigger ones like Walt I can t say I found The End wholly satisfying either as closure for this season or the series There are narrative dead ends in every season of Lost but it felt like season six had more than usual Mike Hale of The New York Times gave The End a mixed review as the episode showed that the series was shaky on the big picture on organizing the welter of mythic religious philosophical material it insisted on incorporating into its plot but highly skilled at the small one the moment to moment business of telling an exciting story Rendered insignificant were the particulars of what they had done on the island David Zurawik of the Baltimore Sun gave the episode a highly negative review writing If this is supposed to be such a smart and wise show unlike anything else on network TV blah blah blah why such a wimpy phony quasi religious white light huggy bear ending Once Jack stepped into the church it looked like he was walking into a Hollywood wrap party without food or music just a bunch of actors grinning idiotically for minutes and hugging one another br br br Ratings br Lost aired on the American Broadcasting Company ABC from September to May The pilot episode had million viewers
