fantasy and science fiction In multiple winner George R R Martin described winning the Hugo Nebula and the prestigious World Fantasy Award as the triple crown Others have also noted the award s prestige in the field such as Tachyon Publications and Best Anthology winner Gardner Dozois Stephen Jones of the Best New Horror series has said that winning the anthology award for their first volume in helped establish the series among readers and some publishers in multiple countries Winners such as Nnedi Okorafor Best Novel in have described the award as one of my greatest honors as a writer Editor and bookseller Rick Klaw in however noted that the consensus at the time in the bookselling community was that winning the novel category did not have any effect on sales and did not help keep the book in print with percent of prior winners out of print compared to percent of Hugo Award winners from the same time period br Two anthologies have been drawn from the World Fantasy Award winners First World Fantasy Awards An Anthology of the Fantastic in edited by Gahan Wilson and covering stories from the initial award year and The World Fantasy Awards Volume Two in edited by Stuart David Schiff and Fritz Leiber br br br Controversies br br br Graphic novels br At the awards graphic novel The Sandman issue A Midsummer Night s Dream scripted by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Charles Vess won the award for Best Short Story It was reported that the rules were subsequently changed to prevent another graphic novel from winning though the awards administration stated that comics and graphic novels were not intended to be eligible for that category and said that Comics are eligible in the Special Award Professional category We never made a change in the rules br br br H P Lovecraft bust br A minor controversy about the trophy occurred in when Donald Wandrei refused his Life Achievement award as he felt the award bust was a demeaning caricature of Lovecraft whom he had known personally Wandrei s rejected trophy was later recycled and given to another award winner br A larger controversy surrounding the bust began in the s when several authors began to object to using the author H P Lovecraft as the symbol of the awards given his outspoken racism though others such as Indian American Lovecraft scholar and World Fantasy Award winner S T Joshi claimed that Lovecraft s attitudes were not considered extreme at the time Winners Nnedi Okorafor and China Mi ville noted in that they felt conflicted about being honored by a bust of a man who hated people of color Several authors and editors argued for the trophy to be changed including a petition by author Daniel Jos Older in an editorial by The New York Review of Science Fiction editor Kevin J Maroney arguing that it should be changed as a courtesy to generations of writers whom the WFA hopes to honor and Best Novel winner Sofia Samatar s acceptance speech br In September the administrators of the World Fantasy Award announced they were in discussion about the future of the award trophy In November at the awards they announced that the Lovecraft bust would no longer be used beginning the following year Lenika Cruz associate editor of The Atlantic defended the decision stating that Lovecraft s removal is about more than just the writer himself it s not an indictment of his entire oeuvre S T Joshi however expressed anger at the decision and returned his two World Fantasy Awards and urged a boycott of the convention br br br br br br External links br World Fantasy Convention br
