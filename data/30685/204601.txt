Till We Have Faces A Myth Retold is a novel by C S Lewis It is a retelling of Cupid and Psyche based on its telling in a chapter of The Golden Ass of Apuleius This story had haunted Lewis all his life because he realized that some of the main characters actions were illogical As a consequence his retelling of the story is characterized by a highly developed character the narrator with the reader being drawn into her reasoning and her emotions This was his last novel and he considered it his most mature written in conjunction with his wife Joy Davidman br The first part of the book is written from the perspective of Psyche s older sister Orual as an accusation against the gods The story is set in the fictive kingdom of Glome a primitive city state whose people have occasional contact with civilized Hellenistic Greece In the second part of the book the narrator undergoes a change of mindset Lewis would use the term conversion and understands that her initial accusation was tainted by her own failings and shortcomings and that the gods are lovingly present in humans lives br br Trom King of Glome br Orual oldest daughter of Trom br Maia Psyche s Greek nickname for Orual Greek for

of Orual Psyche s older sister br It begins as the complaint of Orual as an old woman who is bitter at the injustice of the gods She has always been ugly but after her mother dies and her father the King of Glome remarries she gains a beautiful half sister Istra whom she loves as her own daughter and who is known throughout the novel by the Greek version of her name Psyche Psyche is so beautiful that the people of Glome begin to offer sacrifices to her as to a goddess The Priest of the goddess Ungit a powerful figure in the kingdom then informs the king that various plagues befalling the kingdom are a result of Ungit s jealousy so Psyche is sent as a human sacrifice to the unseen God of the Mountain at the command of Ungit the mountain god s mother Orual plans to rescue Psyche but falls ill and is unable to prevent anything br When she is well again Orual arranges to go to where Psyche was stranded on the mountain either to rescue her or to bury what remains of her She is stunned to find Psyche is alive free from the shackles in which she had been bound and furthermore says she does not need to be rescued in any way Rather Psyche relates that she lives in a beautiful castle that Orual cannot see as the God of the Mountain has made her a bride rather than a victim At one point in the narrative Orual believes she has a brief vision of this castle but then it vanishes like a mist Hearing that Psyche has been commanded by her new god husband not to look on his face all their meetings are in the nighttime Orual is immediately suspicious She argues that the god must be a monster or that Psyche has actually started to hallucinate after her abandonment and near death on the mountain that there is no such castle at all and that her husband is actually an outlaw who was hiding on the mountain and takes advantage of her delusions in order to have his way with her Orual says that because either possibility is one that she cannot abide by she must disabuse her sister of this illusion br She returns a second time bringing Psyche a lamp for her to use while her husband sleeps and when Psyche insists that she will not betray her husband by disobeying his command Orual threatens both Psyche and herself stabbing herself in the arm to show she is capable of following through on her threat Ultimately reluctantly Psyche agrees because of the coercion and her love for her sister br When Psyche disobeys her husband she is immediately banished from her beautiful castle and forced to wander as an exile The God of the Mountain appears to Orual stating that Psyche must now endure hardship at the hand of a force he himself could not fight likely his mother the goddess Ungit and that You too shall be Psyche which Orual attempts to interpret for the rest of her life usually taking it to mean that as Psyche suffers she must suffer also She decries the injustice of the gods saying that if they had shown her a picture of Psyche s happiness that was easier to believe she would not have ruined it From this day forward she vows that she will keep her face veiled at all times br Eventually Orual becomes a Queen and a warrior diplomat architect reformer politician legislator and judge though all the while remaining alone She drives herself through work to forget her grief and the love she has lost Psyche is gone her other family she never cared for and her beloved tutor the Fox has died Her main love interest throughout the novel Bardia the captain of the royal guard is married and forever faithful to his wife until his death To her the gods remain as ever silent unseen and merciless br While Bardia is on his deathbed Orual decides she can no longer stand the sight of her own kingdom and decides to leave it for the first time to visit neighboring kingdoms While resting on her journey she leaves her group at their camp and follows sounds from within a wood which turn out to be coming from a temple to the goddess Istra Psyche There Orual hears a version of Psyche s myth which shows her as deliberately ruining her sister s life out of envy In response she writes out her own story as set forth in the book to set the record straight Her hope is that it will be brought to Greece where she has heard that men are willing to question even the gods br br Orual begins the second part of the book stating that her previous accusation that the gods are unjust is wrong She does not have time to rewrite the whole book because she is very old and of ill health and will likely die before it can be redone so instead she is adding on to the end br She relates that since finishing part one of the book she has experienced a number of dreams and visions which at first she doubts the truth of except that they also start happening during daytime when she is fully awake She sees herself being required to perform a number of impossible tasks like sorting a giant mound of different seeds into separate piles with no allowance for error or collecting the golden wool from a flock of murderous rams or fetching a bowl of water from a spring on a mountain which cannot be climbed and furthermore is covered with poisonous beasts It is in the midst of this last vision that she is led to a huge chamber in the land of the dead and given the opportunity to read out her complaint in the gods hearing She discovers however that instead of reading the book she has written she reads off a paper that appears in her hand and contains her true feelings which are indeed much less noble than Part One of the book would suggest Orual thinks she has been speaking only a short time but then when stopped realizes she has been pouring out the story of all her inner conflict and turmoil for days repeating herself over and over and over again as the gods sat silently Still rather than being jealous of Psyche as the story she heard in the temple suggested she reveals that she was jealous of the gods because they were allowed to enjoy Psyche s love while she herself was not br The gods make no reply But Orual is content as she sees that the gods answer was really to hold up the mirror of her lies to herself and make her understand the truth of her own life and actions Then she is led by the ghost of the Fox into a sunlit arena in which she learns the story of what Psyche has been doing she has herself been assigned the impossible tasks from Orual s dreams but was able to complete them with supernatural help Orual then leaves the arena to enter another verdant field with a clear pool of water and a brilliant sky There she meets Psyche who has just returned from her last errand retrieving a box of beauty from the underworld which she then gives to Orual though Orual is hardly conscious of this because at that moment she begins to sense that something else is happening The God of the Mountain is coming to be with Psyche and judge Orual but the only thing he says is You also are Psyche before the vision ends The reader is led to understand that this phrase has actually been one of mercy the entire time br Orual awoken from the vision dies shortly thereafter but has just enough time to record her visions and to write that she no longer hates the gods but sees that their very presence though mysterious is the answer she always needed br br The idea of retelling the myth of Cupid and Psyche with the palace invisible had been in Lewis s mind ever since he was an undergraduate the retelling as he imagined it involved writing through the perspective of the elder sister He argued that this made the sister not simply envious and spiteful but ignorant as any mortal might be of the divine and jealous as anyone could be in their love He tried it in different verse forms when he considered himself primarily a poet so that one could say that he d been at work on Orual for years even though the version told in the book was very quickly written In his pre Christian days Lewis would imagine the story with Orual in the right and the gods in the wrong br One of the inconsistencies of Apuleius s version was the fact that the sisters could see the palace For Lewis the theme of belief is central to the story and he felt that Apuleius missed the chance to give his version of the story a true mythic quality that is to invoke what Rudolph Otto terms in his work The Idea of the Holy the idea of the numinous which is a feeling of awe in the presence of the spiritual or holy the supernatural Orual does not posses the belief system that will allow her to enter into the realm of the numinous as she briefly catches sight of the palace before it vanishes After this scene her resolve to protect Psyche from the love of others is the root of her jealousy and the crux of her accusation against the injustices of the gods Conversely Psyche from an early age exhibits the openness to embrace the numinous she feels a civic duty to heal the citizenry of Glome she willingly accepts her role as the Accursed and the conjoined penalty of death marriage to the Shadowbrute the god of the Grey Mountain br Another theme that Lewis felt Apuleius did not fully develop revolves around sacrifice Till We Have Faces is a retelling of Apuleius s original story Within Lewis s work there is also a retelling of the myth Orual has been telling her self represented by the segmenting of her narrative into Part the myth she tells of herself and Part the retelling to of herself with a new understanding of her self awareness and outer connections to others By the end of Part Orual realizes that her love for Psyche has become perverted it is a possessive love unwilling to share Psyche s love with others Bardia s widow Ansit points this out to Orual in a no holds barred confrontation after her husband s death Orual has consumed the lives of her loved ones just as Ungit consumes sacrifices This begins the dose of self awareness that leads to Orual s death of self or sacrifice of her self to others a higher more universal power On a societal or cultural level the need to temper the natural loves what Lewis would expand upon four years after TWHF in his book The Four Loves with the subjugation of storge affection philia friendship and eros romantic love to that of agape divine love is the basis for one s ability to retain the ordered nature of those three natural loves without the authority of agape divine love to govern them the breakdown of the natural loves would ensue as a result of the back biting nature of the three natural loves if left to their own devices This ideology goes as far back as Homer s era and the subject of the Trojan War which was used to exemplify to Greeks the effects of disordered love on socio cultural mores see Helen of Troy br br Lewis originally titled his working manuscripts Bareface The editor Gibb rejected the title Bareface on the ground that readers would mistake it for a Western In response Lewis said he failed to see why people would be deterred from buying the book if they thought it was a Western and that the working title was cryptic enough to be intriguing Nevertheless Lewis started considering an alternative title on February and chose Till We Have Faces which refers to a line from the book where Orual says How can the gods meet us face to face till we have faces He defended his choice in a letter to his long time correspondent Dorothea Conybeare explaining the idea that a human must be speaking with its own voice not one of its borrowed voices expressing its actual desires not what it imagines that it desires being for good or ill itself not any mask veil or persona br br Myths like fairy tales are typically set in an enigmatic location with a nebulous orientation toward time This draws the attention of the audience to the actions of the characters which signify the importance of the choices the characters make it forces the focus on the moralizing aspects of the characters rather than on their surroundings and it relies on archetypes to convey the anticipated actions Lewis does something different in his approach to his retelling of the Cupid and Psyche myth from Apuleius He makes the fictitious setting of TWHF as real as believable as historic as possible in order to establish the historicity of his version He painstakingly describes the geography of the region surrounding Glome and even goes so far as to have Orual speak in terms of how far places were distanced by would be units of measure Glome is built about as far back from the river as a woman can walk in the third of an hour for example br This grounding of the story in the historically concrete establishes the validity to the historicity of the story which is precisely what Lewis s intentions were to make the argument that myths are the embodiment of or basis for historical figures and their actions evolving culturally to epic proportions He was well aware of the concept of euhemerism which the more sophisticated Greeks had developed to explain epistemologically their pantheon Championed by Euhemerus and promulgated circa B C E this embryonic conception posits the notion that many of the gods were historical mortal personalities who became deified Lewis wrote to Clyde Kilby that TWHF is A work of supposed historical imagination A guess at what it might have been like in a little barbarous state on the borders of the Hellenistic world with Greek culture just beginning to affect it Doris T Myers makes the case that it is a synthesis of both historical fiction and modern fiction thus giving credence to the day in the lifeness historicity and its intermingling with Jungian psychological archetypes of the narrative to the work br br Lewis called Till We Have Faces far and away my best book This opinion was echoed by J R R Tolkien Robert Gorham Davis in the New York Times wrote that Lewis still does not have all the equipment of a major novelist but deemed it much more convincing than his religious novels He praised it for being firmly grounded in actual primitive religious practice and wrote that the novel s imaginative unity exerts a combination of
