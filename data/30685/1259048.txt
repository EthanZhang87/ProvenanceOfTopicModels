writers such as J R R Tolkien G K Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc The Guardian commented that Old Thunder A Life of Hilaire Belloc skates over Belloc s antisemitism the central disfiguring fact of his oeuvre br He chose the pen name Robert Williamson after a character in the Ulster Loyalist ballad The Old Orange Flute who like Pearce is an Orange Order member who converts to Roman Catholicism Pearce s biography of G K Chesterton Wisdom and Innocence A Life of G K Chesterton was published under the pseudonym of Robert Williamson by Hodder and Stoughton in Jay P Corrin reviewing the book for The Catholic Historical Review called it a venture of love and high praise but which adds little to existing biographies Its contribution Corrin wrote is its focus on Chesterton s religious vision and personal relationships contrasting his friendly style with the combative Belloc br Pearce s biography The Unmasking of Oscar Wilde focused on the conflict between Oscar Wilde s homosexuality and his lifelong attraction to the Roman Catholic Church and how it was finally settled by his reception into the Church on his deathbed in Paris br In a review for The Wildean Michael Seeney described Pearce s biography as badly written and muddled woefully poorly annotated and using odd sources without question Seeney wrote that it does not unmask anything but contains too much cod psychology and hyperbolic clich to be a workmanlike biography br In Pearce published a biography of Anglo South African poet and Catholic convert Roy Campbell followed in by an edited anthology of Campbell s poetry and verse translations br br br Tolkien br Pearce has written and published a variety of books of Tolkien studies His essay Letting the Catholic Out of the Baggins discusses why In the British people in a nationwide poll by the Folio Society voted The Lord of the Rings the greatest book of the th century and the outraged reactions of literary celebrities such as Howard Jacobson Griff Rhys Jones and Germaine Greer inspired Pearce to write the books Tolkien Man and Myth Tolkien a Celebration and Bilbo s Journey Discovering the Hidden Meaning in The Hobbit All of Pearce s Tolkien themed books consider his subject s person and writings from a Catholic perspective Bradley J Birzer writes in The J R R Tolkien Encyclopedia that scholars had hardly discussed Tolkien s Catholicism until Pearce s Tolkien Man and Myth describing the book as outstanding treating The Lord of the Rings as a theological thriller that inspired a whole new wave of Christian evaluations br Pearce has credited his previously published books of Tolkien studies and the wave of Tolkien enthusiasm caused by Peter Jackson s film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings with making him into a celebrity intellectual
