and look for new lands beyond the Eastern Ocean and as he intended they never came back br The above is a quote by Doctor Cornelius in the novel Prince Caspian br br br The seven noble Lords br br br Lord Bern br Bern was the first lord to be found by the crew of the Dawn Treader when they landed on Felimath one of the Lone Islands Caspian X Lucy Edmund Eustace and Reepicheep went ashore on Felimath and were taken prisoner by slavers br Caspian was bought as a slave by Lord Bern He spotted him along with the others being led across the islands by the slave traders who have just captured them He revealed his true identity to Caspian and Bern promised to treat him well Bern told Caspian that he bought him because he reminded him of his former master King Caspian IX Bern told Caspian that he arrived at the Lone Islands married a girl there and decided to stay Caspian then reveals that he was his former master s son Bern then introduces himself as Lord Bern and joins forces with Caspian and his crew to save the others Lucy Edmund Eustace and Reepicheep from the slave traders br When Caspian learns that the island s government has become corrupt not least by legalising slave trade he uses his official standing as Emperor of the Lone Islands to appoint Lord Bern as Duke of the Lone Islands ousting Governor Gumpus and dismissing his followers Caspian also announces that slavery is illegal in Narnia and declares all slaves free Lord Bern remains on Doorn in the city Narrowhaven Voyage of the Dawn Treader chp when the crew set sail again now in a position Duke of the Lone Islands to restore order to the islands br br br Lord Octesian br A bracelet bearing Octesian s family crest was found on Dragon Island where the Dawn Treader stopped for repairs after being caught in a storm br His true fate is never revealed but there are two theories about what happened to Lord Octesian when he was on Dragon Island he either was eaten by a dragon who was already there or else was himself turned into a dragon br In the film version Edmund Caspian and Eustace find his skeletal remains wrapped around various gold and jewelry implying that he was either killed by another dragon who was already there or had been starved to death after being tempted to stay on the island for its treasures despite the harsh conditions br br br Lord Restimar br Restimar s corpse in the form of a gold statue was found on Deathwater Island an island also known as Goldwater Island for a time where he had dived into a lake not realising that it turned everything in its waters to solid gold He was discovered by Reepicheep when Edmund found Restimar s armour Caspian later identified the solid gold body as Restimar s when Coriakin informed them that he had been the only one missing from the party when the remaining four lords arrived on Duffer Island br br br Lord Rhoop br Rhoop was found on the Dark Island which was also known as the island where dreams come true In this place people re experience terrible nightmares that they ve had He went to the island thinking that dreams meant daydreams and found himself trapped in nightmares for seven years He is a broken man by the time he is rescued so when the voyage sets anchor at Ramandu s Island the crew leave Rhoop behind to enjoy a blissful enchanted sleep without dreams He remains in this sleep until one of the members of Caspian s crew Reepicheep sails into the land of Aslan and he wakes up at the same time as the three other lords who were in a deep sleep there It is not stated if he ever recovers from his ordeal He is in fact the only Lord that witnessed the Dark Island br br br Lords Mavramorn Revilian and Argoz br These three lords are found on the Island of Ramandu and are the last to be discovered Their hair has grown exceptionally long when Caspian and his followers find them and they are in a deep sleep from which the travellers are unable to wake them br Ramandu s daughter then appears and tells the travellers that seven years earlier the three lords quarrelled over whether to remain at the island to sail onwards or to return to Narnia and that one of the lords in his anger picked up the knife which the White Witch had used centuries before to kill Aslan who was quickly thereafter resurrected This inappropriate handling of a sacred object caused the three lords to fall into an enchanted sleep in which they had remained for seven years br Caspian and his friends are told that the only way to awaken the three sleeping lords is to sail voluntarily to the end of the world or as close as possible and to leave behind at least one member of the crew After the Dawn Treader has sailed east for some time in this quest Aslan appears to Caspian and informs him that Reepicheep Edmund Lucy and Eustace are to continue on towards the end of the world but that the other crew members are to go back br This requirement is fulfilled and Reepicheep goes on towards the end of the world as he has always wished and the three children return to England Caspian marries Ramandu s daughter and the three lords awaken from their sleep whereupon they are greeted by Lord
