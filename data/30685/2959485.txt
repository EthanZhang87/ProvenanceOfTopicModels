The lost world is a subgenre of the fantasy or science fiction genres that involves the discovery of an unknown Earth civilization It began as a subgenre of the late Victorian adventure romance and remains popular into the st century br The genre arose during an era when Western archeologists discovered and studied civilizations around the world previously unknown to them through disciplines such as Egyptology Assyriology or Mesoamerican studies Thus real stories of archaeological finds inspired writings on the topic Between and the First World War the number of published lost world narratives set in every continent increased significantly br The genre has similar themes to mythical kingdoms such as Atlantis and El Dorado br br br History br King Solomon s Mines by H Rider Haggard is sometimes considered the first lost world narrative Haggard s novel shaped the form and influenced later lost world narratives including Rudyard Kipling s The Man Who Would Be King Arthur Conan Doyle s The Lost World Edgar Rice Burroughs The Land That Time Forgot A Merritt s The Moon Pool and H P Lovecraft s At the Mountains of Madness br Earlier works such as Edward Bulwer Lytton s Vril The Power of the Coming Race and Samuel Butler s Erewhon use a similar plot as a vehicle for Swiftian social satire rather than romantic adventure Other early examples are Simon Tyssot de Patot s Voyages et Aventures de Jacques Mass which includes a prehistoric fauna and flora and Robert Paltock s The Life and Adventures of Peter Wilkins an th century imaginary voyage inspired by both Defoe and Swift in which a man named Peter Wilkins discovers a race of winged people on an isolated island surrounded by high cliffs as in Burroughs s Caspak The Hollow Earth novel Symzonia has also been cited as the first of the lost world form and Jules Verne s Journey to the Center of the Earth and The Village in the Treetops popularized the theme of surviving pockets of prehistoric species J H Rosny a n would later publish The Amazing Journey of Hareton Ironcastle a novel where an expedition in the heart of Africa discovers a mysterious area with an ecosystem from another world with alien flora and fauna Edgar Allan Poe s The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket has certain lost world elements towards the end of the tale br James Hilton s Lost Horizon enjoyed popular success in using the genre as a takeoff for popular philosophy and social comment It introduced the name Shangri La a meme for the idealization of the lost world as a Paradise Similar books where the inhabitants of the lost world are seen as superior to the outsiders are Joseph O Neill s Land under England and Douglas Valder Duff s Jack Harding s Quest br Herg also explores the theme in his Tintin comics The Seven Crystal Balls and Prisoners of the Sun Here the protagonists encounter an unknown Inca kingdom in the Andes br br br Contemporary examples br Contemporary American novelist Michael Crichton invokes this tradition in his novel Congo which involves a quest for King Solomon s mines fabled to be in a lost African city called Zinj During the s James Gurney published a series of juvenile novels about a lost island called Dinotopia in which humans live alongside living dinosaurs br In video games it is most notably present in the Tomb Raider and Uncharted franchises br The Hanna Barbera action cartoon Space Ghost features a segment Dino Boy in the Lost Valley about a young boy named Todd who survives a plane crash and lands in a hidden prehistoric valley in South America In another Hanna Barbera cartoon Valley of the Dinosaurs science professor John Butler and his family wife Kim teenage daughter Katie young son Greg and dog Digger are on a rafting trip along the Amazon River in an uncharted river canyon when they are suddenly swept through a cavern and caught in a whirlpool Upon resurfacing they find themselves in a mysterious realm where humans coexist with various prehistoric creatures including dinosaurs The Butlers meet and befriend a clan of Neanderthal cavepeople br In movies the Indiana Jones franchise makes use of similar concepts Also comics make use of the idea such as the Savage Land in Marvel Comics and Themyscira in DC comics br br br Geographic settings br Early lost world novels were typically set in parts of the world as yet unexplored by Europeans Favorite locations were the interior of Africa many of Haggard s novels Burroughs Tarzan novels or inland South America Doyle s The Lost World Merritt s The Face in the Abyss as well as Central Asia Kipling s The Man Who Would Be King Haggard s Ayesha The Return of She Merritt s The Metal Monster Hilton s Lost Horizon and Australia James Francis Hogan s The Lost Explorer and Eureka by Owen Hall pseudonym of New Zealand politician Hugh Lusk br Later writers favored Antarctica especially as a refuge for prehistoric species Burroughs The Land That Time Forgot and its sequels were set on the island of Caprona a k a Caspak in the Southern Ocean In Edison Marshall s Dian of the Lost Land Cro Magnons Neanderthals and mammoths survive in the Moss Country a sheltered warm corner of the continent Dennis Wheatley s novel The Man Who Missed the War also deals with a warm and hidden area on the continent where there live humans such as the descendants of Atlantis In Jeremy Robinson s Antarktos Rising dinosaurs and Nephilim emerge as the icecap melts Mat Johnson s Pym describes giant white hominids living in ice caves Ian Cameron s The Mountains at the Bottom of the World has a relict population of Paranthropus living not quite in Antarctica but in the southern Chilean Andes Crusoe Warburton by Victor Wallace Germains describes an island in the far South Atlantic with a lost pre gunpowder empire br According to Allienne Becker there was a logical evolution from the lost world subgenre to the planetary romance genre When there were no longer any unexplored corners of our earth the Lost Worlds Romance turned to space br Brian Stableford makes a related point about Lost Worlds The motif has gradually fallen into disuse by virtue of increasing geographical knowledge these days lost lands have to be very well hidden indeed or displaced beyond some kind of magical or dimensional boundary Such displacement so transforms their significance that they are better thought of as Secondary Worlds or Otherworlds br Below is a list of classic lost world titles drawn from Lost Worlds The Ultimate Anthology Titles were selected from A Bibliography of the Science
