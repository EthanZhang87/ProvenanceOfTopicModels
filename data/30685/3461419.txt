God in the Dock is a collection of previously unpublished essays and speeches from C S Lewis collected from many sources after his death Its title implies God on Trial and the title is based on an analogy made by Lewis suggesting that modern human beings rather than seeing themselves as standing before God in judgement prefer to place God on trial while acting as his judge br This book was originally published in the United Kingdom as Undeceptions Essays on Theology and Ethics while a shorter book published by Fontana in and entitled God in the Dock Essays on Theology does not include many of the essays in this larger collection br br br Three sections br The editor states in the book s preface that the collection is a very mixed bag They are divided by the editor into Part I clearly theological Part II semi theological Part III basic theme is ethics and Part IV letters arranged in the chronological order in which they were published br br br Groundwork br The collection covers a wide range of topics but focuses primarily on Lewis view of Christianity The book is split into three sections the first of which contains essays such as Myth Became Fact The Grand Miracle and Is Theism Important These articles lay the groundwork for Lewis apologetics essentially establishing a starting point at which the true discrepancies between Christians and non Christians become clear br br br Argument br The second section of God in the Dock builds on that starting point and presents a persuasive argument for Christianity In articles including Revival or Decay and Modern Translations of the Bible Lewis defends authentic Christianity and draws a distinct line between Truth and Religion br Lewis had already noted a distinct split between the religious and secular observance of Christmas In Xmas and Christmas A Lost Chapter from Herodotus Lewis relates as satire the observance of two simultaneous holidays in Niatirb Britain backwards from the supposed view of the Greek historian and traveller One Exmas is observed by a flurry of compulsory commercial activity and expensive indulgence in alcoholic beverages The other Crissmas is observed in Niatirb s temples Lewis s narrator asks a priest why they kept Crissmas on the same day as Exmas He receives the reply br br It is not lawful O Stranger for us to change the date of Crissmas but would that Zeus would put it into the minds of the Niatirbians to keep Exmas at some other time or not to keep it at all For Exmas and the Rush distract the minds even of the few from sacred things And we indeed are glad that men should make merry at Crissmas but in Exmas there is no merriment left And when I asked him why they endured the Rush he replied It is O Stranger a racket br In the chapter Evil and God Lewis refers to mellontolatry or the worship of the future He considers this to be unproductive IF the future is simply where the world is going that is a random walk He believes that the world can hardly congratulate itself for having arrived at a future that is simply a place it has got to if that is all that it is Lewis in fact argues that there is more purpose than that but that some choose to worship that alone br Lewis also address those skeptical of the Resurrection of Jesus Even if one interprets the crucifixion of Jesus as a strictly historical event this doesn t preclude its subsequent mythologization But neither does it negate its historicity The claim of the Gospel writers is that Jesus resurrection is a specific historical event br br The heart of Christianity is a myth which is also a fact The old myth of the Dying God without ceasing to be myth comes down from the heaven of legend and imagination to the earth of history It happens at a particular date in a particular place followed by definable historical consequences We pass from a Balder or an Osiris dying nobody knows when or where to a historical Person crucified it is all in order under Pontius Pilate By becoming fact it does not cease to be myth that is the miracle br br br Specifics br The final section of the book focuses on specifics It addresses the logical fallacy Lewis named Bulverism as well as issues concerning religious observances such as Christmas It answers some of the questions non Christians have about Christianity br These essays are not actually logically connected rather they have been collected together from various sources by an editor not by the author Some essays may have fit into other sections but are organised by the collector of the essays as they are posthumously br br br Notes br br br
