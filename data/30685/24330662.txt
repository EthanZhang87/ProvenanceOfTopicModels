id: 24330662
In fiction and mythology a dark lord sometimes capitalized as Dark Lord or referred to as an evil overlord evil emperor etc depending on the work is an antagonistic archetype acting as the pinnacle of villainy and evil within a typically heroic narrative br br br Description br The term and similar concepts enjoy widespread popularity as a stock character and a villainous moniker in fantasy and related genres as well as in literary analysis of such works As the name implies a dark lord is characterized as a given setting s embodiment of evil darkness or death either metatextually or as literal figure within a work s mythopoeia in a position of immense power most often as a leader or emperor with a variety of minions and or lesser villains at their disposal to influence their conflict against a heroic protagonist in a primarily indirect way though they may additionally be depicted as wielding great physical or magical capabilities should a hero ever confront them personally br There is a wealth of literary folkloric and theological precedent for the idea of a dark lord including the Celtic Balor the Christian Lucifer known in Latin as the Princeps Tenebrarum the Prince of Darkness in Milton s Paradise Lost and various other chthonic figures or evil kings and sorcerers The concept was developed throughout the nineteenth century with characters such as Richard Wagner s Alberich or Bram Stoker s Count Dracula before crystalizing in with the character of Sauron in J R R Tolkien s epic fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings from which the archetype most often takes its name Later The Silmarillion would focus on the character of Morgoth of whom Sauron was the principal lieutenant and then successor while other works would further popularize and diversify the concept with antagonists such as Darkseid in the DC Universe Emperor Palpatine in the science fantasy Star Wars saga or Lord Voldemort in the Harry Potter series More recent works sometimes also move away from the archetype s mythic origins in favour of historical allusions to infamous conquerors and dictators such as Julius Caesar or Adolf Hitler br br br Characteristics br Dark lord figures are characterized by aspirations to power and identification with some fundamental force of evil or chaos such as a devil or antichrist figure The Encyclopedia of Fantasy notes that common features of a dark lord character include being already defeated but not destroyed aeons before and engaging in wounding of the land or other rituals of desecration br Japanese media often features an equivalent of this archetype called a demon king ma drawing from analogous figures in religion and folklore br Philip Pullman noted that the dark lord archetype in literature can often reflect the belief that evil in the real world is usually embodied in a single person and requires a high position to be effective and that this contrasts with Hannah Arendt s notion of the banality of evil br br br Notable examples br Alberich of Richard Wagner s Ring cycle a prototypical dark lord br Dracula of Bram Stoker s novel and later franchises br Sauron and Morgoth of J R R Tolkien s

In part due to the literary popularity of dark lords in fiction science fiction and fantasy fans have collected several satirical lists of resolutions for a competent evil overlord to avoid the well known clich blunders committed by dark lords supervillains and other archetypal antagonists in popular fiction For example one such resolution is I will not gloat over my enemies predicament to show my superiority I will shoot them Internet copies of these lists vary in number and order of entries br The most famous lists both referred to as the Evil Overlord List were developed concurrently Both were published to the Web in the early s The original if lesser known list was compiled in by members of the now defunct FidoNet Science Fiction and Fandom SFFAN email echo The FidoNet list originated with a Saturday Night Live skit featuring Bond Villains touting a book What Not to Do When You Capture James Bond The FidoNet list arose out of discussions regarding what sort of advice might be in that book and was compiled and published by Jack Butler It predated the following list but was only widely published later and is the more obscure of the two br The later produced and more famous version of the list was compiled in by Peter Anspach hence it is occasionally titled Peter s Evil Overlord List based on informal discussions at conventions and on online bulletin boards in the early s and has subsequently become one of the best known parodies of bad SF F writing frequently referenced online It was originally The Top Things I d Do If I Ever Became an Evil Overlord but grew to include over entries br Anspach and Butler acknowledge the existence of each other s lists and state that their two lists have been so cross pollinated over the years as to become effectively identical br The Evil Overlord List has led to spin offs including lists for stock characters including but not limited to heroes henchmen sidekicks the Evil Overlord s Accountant and Starfleet captains br In Australia a minor literary scandal erupted in when it emerged that award winning author Helen Darville plagiarised the list for her regular column in Brisbane s The Courier Mail newspaper which led to her being fired br Teresa Nielsen Hayden author and lecturer uses an expanded version of the list in her lectures on writing science fiction She recommends selecting five random clich s from the list and using them or their reverse Say you ve drawn A I will not turn into a snake It never helps You can have a character turn into a snake and find it doesn t help or do it and
