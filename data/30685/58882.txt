Coutances set out plans to develop it into a town in In that same year Stratford was granted a charter from King Richard I to hold a weekly market in the town giving it its status as a market town As

of the Old English str t from Latin stratum meaning street ford indicating a shallow part of a river or stream allowing it to be crossed by walking or driving and avon which is the Celtic word for river The street was a Roman road which connected Icknield Street in Alcester to the Fosse Way The ford which has been used as a crossing since Roman times later became the location of Clopton Bridge br A survey of uses the name Stratford for the first time to identify Old Stratford and the newer manors The name was used after that time to describe the area specifically surrounding the Holy Trinity Church and the street of the Old Town br br The Stratford area was settled during the Roman period as the area was crossed by a Roman road archaeological remains of a small Roman town have been found about mile km northeast of Stratford town centre at Tiddington now part of Stratford which was occupied from the st to the th century AD The remains of two further probable Roman settlements have been found within a few miles of modern day Stratford br br The settlement which later became known as Stratford was first inhabited by Anglo Saxons following their th century invasion of what would become known as Warwickshire but was then part of the Kingdom of Mercia It is likely that an Anglo Saxon monastery existed at the site of what is now Holy Trinity Church which was founded after the land was acquired by Egwin the third Bishop of Worcester The monastery was likely destroyed by Viking invaders in The land remained in the ownership of the Bishops of Worcester until the th century The area around Holy Trinity Church is still known as Old Town as it was the original area of settlement around the monastery The focus of the settlement at Stratford was later moved north closer to the river crossing which was better positioned for trade br Stratford then referred to as strete ford remained a village until the late th century when it was developed into a town by lord of the manor Bishop John of Coutances Coutances laid out a new town plan in around mile km north of the original settlement based on a grid system to expand Stratford and allow people to rent property in order to trade within the town Coutances granted his new tenants the right to rent property and transmit it at death This was called burgage tenure Each development plot or burgage consisted of around acres hectares A charter was granted to Stratford by King Richard I in which allowed a weekly market to be held in the town giving it its status as a market town These two charters which formed the foundations of Stratford s transformation from a village to a town make the town of Stratford over years old the town celebrated br its th anniversary in br br John of Coutances plans to develop Stratford into a town meant Stratford became a place of work for tradesmen and merchants By the town had approximately burgages town rental properties owned by a king or lord as well as shops stalls and other buildings Stratford s tradesmen established a guild known as the Guild of the Holy Cross for their business and religious requirements The guild developed into the town s main institution of local government and included the most important townsmen who elected officials to oversee local affairs They built a Guild Chapel in the th century and a Guildhall and almshouses on Church Street in around The guild established an educational institution in the late th century br Many of the town s earliest and most important buildings are located along what is known as Stratford s Historic Spine which was once the main route from the town centre to the parish church The route of the Historic Spine begins at Shakespeare s Birthplace in Henley Street It continues through Henley Street to the top end of Bridge Street and into the High Street where many Elizabethan buildings are located including Harvard House The route carries on through Chapel Street where Nash s House and New Place are sited Opposite New Place was The Falcon Hotel now Hotel Indigo at the corner of Scholars Lane It is a timber framed house with nearly ft frontage to the street and dating perhaps from the end of the th century The Historic Spine continues along Church Street where the Guild buildings are located dating back to the th century as well as th and th century properties The route then finishes in the Old Town which includes Hall s Croft and the Holy Trinity Church br br During Stratford s early expansion into a town the only access across the River Avon into and out of the town was over a wooden bridge which was first mentioned in The bridge could not be crossed at times due to the river rising and was described by antiquarian John Leland as a poor bridge of timber and no causeway to it whereby many poor folks and other refused to come to Stratford when the Avon was up or coming thither stood in jeopardy of life In a new masonry arch bridge was built to replace it called Clopton Bridge named after Hugh Clopton who paid for its construction a wealthy local man who later became the Lord Mayor of London The new bridge made it easier for people to trade within Stratford and for passing travellers to stay in the town br br The medieval structures of local governance underwent significant changes during the Tudor period The Guild of the Holy Cross was abolished in under King Edward VI s suppression of religious guilds and the inhabitants of Stratford petitioned the Crown for a charter of incorporation as a borough which they received in This allowed the formation a new Town Council which inherited the property and responsibilities of the abolished guild The Charter of Incorporation refounded Stratford s school as the King Edward VI School br The Cotswolds located close to Stratford was a major sheep producing area up until the latter part of the th century with Stratford one of its main centres for the processing marketing and distribution of sheep and wool Consequently Stratford became a centre for tanning during the th th centuries Glove making was an important industry which was at its zenith in the th and th centuries As was malting the processing of grain to turn it into malt br John Shakespeare originally a farmer had moved to Stratford in from the nearby village of Snitterfield and became a successful glover glove maker and businessman and an official on the Town Council He met and married Mary Arden a member of the local gentry in around Together they had eight children including Stratford s most famous son William Shakespeare in believed to be at the house now known as Shakespeare s Birthplace br br Stratford was the centre of considerable activity and some fighting during the English Civil War Being located at the junction of several main roads it was strategically important for both the Royalist and Parliamentarian armies Due to its close proximity to the Parliamentarian stronghold of Warwick Stratford remained under Parliamentarian control for the majority of the conflict although it was only directly occupied by troops for sporadic intervals In February Stratford was occupied by Royalist forces under Colonel Wagstaffe br It was recaptured by Parliamentarians under Lord Brooke on February after an engagement on the nearby road to Warwick Having secured the town Brooke returned to Warwick In one notable incident in February Stratford s Market Hall at the site of the current Town Hall was destroyed after three barrels of gunpowder which were being stored there blew up From

in trade it barely grew between the middle of the th century and the end of the th century with a survey of the town showing houses belonged to the lord of the manor in Growth continued to be slow throughout the th century with hearth tax returns showing that at most there were approximately houses in the town by However more substantial expansion began following several enclosure acts in the late th century with the first and largest development by John Payton who developed land on the north side of the old town creating several streets including John Street and Payton Street br In the actor David Garrick staged a major Shakespeare Jubilee over three days which saw the construction of a large rotunda and the influx of many visitors This contributed to the growing phenomenon of Bardolatry which made Stratford a tourist destination br Before the dominance of road and rail Stratford was an important gateway to the network of British canals The River Avon was made navigable through Stratford in by the construction of locks and weirs providing Stratford with a navigable link to the River Severn to the south west and to near Warwick to the north east this allowed in the words of Daniel Defoe a very great Trade for Sugar Oil Wine Tobacco Iron Lead and in a word all heavy goods which are carried by water almost as far as Warwick and in return the corn and especially the cheese is brought back from Gloucestershire and Warwickshire to Bristol br br Between and the Stratford upon Avon Canal was built linking the Avon at Stratford with Birmingham By the early th century Stratford was a flourishing inland port and an important centre of trade with many canal and river wharves along what is now Bancroft Gardens br The first railway in Warwickshire the Stratford

followed by the Stratford on Avon Railway s branch from Hatton from the north which opened in October Both branches initially had separate termini but they soon agreed to join the two branches and open the current Stratford upon Avon railway station which was opened in July Both branches later came under the control of the Great Western Railway The connection of Stratford to the growing national railway network helped enable the development of the modern tourism industry br br Stratford did not become a major centre of industry during the industrial revolution but some industries did grow up locally Edward Fordham Flower opened a large canal side brewery in Stratford in The Flower Sons Brewery on Clopton Road survived until when the company was taken over by Whitbread Several lime kilns were opened locally and the manufacture of tarpaulin and oilcloth flourished The advent of rail transport in the middle of the century caused a major decline in river and canal transport and the River Avon navigation through Stratford was abandoned in It was restored as a navigation by volunteers almost a century later in br Victorian Stratford s growth as a tourist destination was further
