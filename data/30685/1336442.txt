A high king is a king who holds a position of seniority over a group of other kings without the title of emperor Similar titles include great king and king of kings The high kings of history usually ruled over lands of cultural unity thus high kings differentiate from emperors who control culturally different lands and feudal monarchs where subordinates assume lesser positions High kings can be chosen by lesser rulers through elections or be put into power by force through conquest of weaker kingdoms br br br High kingship br In history and literature high kings may be found where there is a high degree of cultural unity along with sufficient political fragmentation that the high king s subordinates style themselves kings In this respect high kingships frequently differ from empires which are culturally as well as politically heterogeneous as well as from feudal monarchies where the subordinate rulers take lesser titles such as duke or count and may be at least in theory subject to appointment and dismissal by the sovereign br In this model a high king might be chosen from among a group of kings in his personal capacity for instance by election or on the basis of genealogical superiority Alternatively the high kingship might be attached to the kingship of one of the constituent kingdoms either permanently or when one kingdom is able to assert supremacy over the others The high king s authority over other kings is usually limited and in some high br kingships his duties are largely ceremonial or restricted to occasions such as war that create a need for a unified
