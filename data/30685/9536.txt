Edmund Spenser January O S was an English poet best known for The Faerie Queene an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the Tudor dynasty and Elizabeth I He is recognized as one of the premier craftsmen of nascent Modern English verse and he is considered one of the great poets in the English language br br br Life br Edmund Spenser was born in East Smithfield London around the year however there is still some ambiguity as to the exact date of his birth His parenthood is obscure but he was probably the son of John Spenser a journeyman clothmaker As a young boy he was educated in London at the Merchant Taylors School and matriculated as a sizar at Pembroke College Cambridge While at Cambridge he became a friend of Gabriel Harvey and later consulted him despite their differing views on poetry In he became for a short time secretary to John Young Bishop of Rochester In he published The Shepheardes Calender and around the same time married his first wife Machabyas Childe They had two children Sylvanus d and Katherine br In July Spenser went to Ireland in service of the newly appointed Lord Deputy Arthur Grey th Baron Grey de Wilton Spenser served under Lord Grey with Walter Raleigh at the Siege of Smerwick massacre When Lord Grey was recalled to England Spenser stayed on in Ireland having acquired other official posts and lands in the Munster Plantation Raleigh acquired other nearby Munster estates confiscated in the Second Desmond Rebellion Sometime between and Spenser acquired his main estate at Kilcolman near Doneraile in North Cork He later bought a second holding to the south at Rennie on a rock overlooking the river Blackwater in North Cork Its ruins are still visible today A short distance away grew a tree locally known as Spenser s Oak until it was destroyed in a lightning strike in the s Local legend claims that he penned some of The Faerie Queene under this tree br In Spenser brought out the first three books of his most famous work The Faerie Queene having travelled to London to publish and promote the work with the likely assistance of Raleigh He was successful enough to obtain a life pension of a year from the Queen He probably hoped to secure a place at court through his poetry but his next significant publication boldly antagonised the queen s principal secretary Lord Burghley William Cecil through its inclusion of the satirical Mother Hubberd s Tale He returned to Ireland He was at the centre of a literary circle whose members included his lifelong friend Lodowick Bryskett and Dr John Longe Archbishop of Armagh br In Spenser published a translation in verse of Joachim Du Bellay s sonnets Les Antiquit s de Rome which had been published in Spenser s version Ruines of Rome by Bellay may also have been influenced by Latin poems on the same subject written by Jean or Janis Vitalis and published in br By Spenser s first wife had died and in that year he married a much younger Elizabeth Boyle a relative of Richard Boyle st Earl of Cork He addressed to her the sonnet sequence Amoretti The marriage was celebrated in Epithalamion They had a son named Peregrine br In Spenser wrote a prose pamphlet titled A View of the Present State of Irelande This piece in the form of a dialogue circulated in manuscript remaining unpublished until the mid th century It is probable that it was kept out of print during the author s lifetime because of its inflammatory content The pamphlet argued that Ireland would never be totally pacified by the English until its indigenous language and customs had been destroyed if necessary by violence br In during the Nine Years War Spenser was driven from his home by the native Irish forces of Aodh N ill His castle at Kilcolman was burned and Ben Jonson who may have had private information asserted that one of his infant children died in the blaze br br In the year after being driven from his home Spenser travelled to London where he died at the age of forty six for want of bread according to Ben Jonson one of Jonson s more doubtful statements since Spenser had a payment to him authorised by the government and was due his pension His coffin was carried to his grave deliberately near that of Geoffrey Chaucer in what became known as Poets Corner in Westminster Abbey by other poets probably including Shakespeare who threw many pens and pieces of poetry into his grave His second wife survived him and remarried twice His sister Sarah who had accompanied him to Ireland married into the Travers family and her descendants were prominent landowners in Cork for centuries br br br Rhyme and reason br Thomas Fuller in Worthies of England included a story where the Queen told her treasurer William Cecil to pay Spenser for his poetry The treasurer however objected that the sum was too much She said Then give him what is reason Without receiving his payment in due time Spenser gave the Queen this quatrain on one of her progresses br br She immediately ordered the treasurer to pay Spenser the original br This story seems to have attached itself to Spenser from Thomas Churchyard who apparently had difficulty in getting payment of his pension the only other pension Elizabeth awarded to a poet Spenser seems to have had no difficulty in receiving payment when it was due as the pension was being collected for him by his publisher Ponsonby br br br The Shepheardes Calender br br The Shepheardes Calender is Edmund Spenser s first major work which appeared in It emulates Virgil s Eclogues of the first century BCE and the Eclogues of Mantuan by Baptista Mantuanus a late medieval early renaissance poet An eclogue is a short pastoral poem that is in the form of a dialogue or soliloquy Although all the months together form an entire year each month stands alone as a separate poem Editions of the late th and early th centuries include woodcuts for each month poem and thereby have a slight similarity to an emblem book which combines a number of self contained pictures and texts usually a short vignette saying or allegory with an accompanying illustration br br br The Faerie Queene br br Spenser s masterpiece is the epic poem The Faerie Queene The first three books of The Faerie Queene were published in and the second set of three books was published in Spenser originally indicated that he intended the poem to consist of twelve books so the version of the poem we have today is incomplete Despite this it remains one of the longest poems in the English language It is an allegorical work and can be read as Spenser presumably intended on several levels of allegory including as praise of Queen Elizabeth I In a completely allegorical context the poem follows several knights in an examination of several virtues In Spenser s A Letter of the Authors he states that the entire epic poem is cloudily enwrapped in allegorical devises and that the aim behind The Faerie Queene was to fashion a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline br br br Shorter poems br Spenser published numerous relatively short poems in the last decade of the th century almost all of which consider love or sorrow In he published Complaints a collection of poems that express complaints in mournful or mocking tones Four years later in Spenser published Amoretti and Epithalamion This volume contains eighty eight sonnets commemorating his courtship of Elizabeth Boyle In Amoretti Spenser uses subtle humour and parody while praising his beloved reworking Petrarchism in his treatment of longing for a woman Epithalamion similar to Amoretti deals in part with the unease in the development of a romantic and sexual relationship It was written for his wedding to his young bride Elizabeth Boyle Some have speculated that the attention to disquiet in general reflects Spenser s personal anxieties at the time as he was unable to complete his most significant work The Faerie Queene In the following year Spenser released Prothalamion a wedding song written for the daughters of a duke allegedly in hopes to gain favour in the court br br br The Spenserian stanza and sonnet br Spenser used a distinctive verse form called the Spenserian stanza in several works including The Faerie Queene The stanza s main metre is iambic pentameter with a final line in iambic hexameter having six feet or stresses known as an Alexandrine and the rhyme scheme is ababbcbcc He also used his own rhyme scheme for the sonnet In a Spenserian sonnet the last line of every quatrain is linked with the first line of the next one yielding the rhyme scheme ababbcbccdcdee Men Call you Fayre is a fine Sonnet from Amoretti The poet presents the concept of true beauty in the poem He addresses the sonnet to his beloved Elizabeth Boyle and presents his courtship Like all Renaissance men Edmund Spenser believed that love is an inexhaustible source of beauty and order In this Sonnet the poet expresses his idea of true beauty The physical beauty will finish after a few days it is not a permanent beauty He emphasises beauty of mind and beauty of intellect He considers his beloved is not simply flesh but is also a spiritual being The poet opines that he is beloved born of heavenly seed and she is derived from fair spirit The poet states that because of her clean mind pure heart and sharp intellect men call her fair and she deserves it At the end the poet praises her spiritual beauty and he worships her because of her Divine Soul br br br Influences br Though Spenser was well read in classical literature scholars have noted that his poetry does not rehash tradition but rather is distinctly his This individuality may have resulted to some extent from a lack of comprehension of the classics Spenser strove to emulate such ancient Roman poets as Virgil and Ovid whom he studied during his schooling but many of his best known works are notably divergent from those of his predecessors The language of his poetry is purposely archaic reminiscent of earlier works such as The Canterbury Tales of Geoffrey Chaucer and Il Canzoniere of Petrarch whom Spenser greatly admired br An Anglican and a devotee of the Protestant Queen Elizabeth Spenser was particularly offended by the anti Elizabethan propaganda that some Catholics circulated Like most Protestants near the time of the Reformation Spenser saw a Catholic church full of corruption and he determined that it was not only the wrong religion but the anti religion This sentiment is an important backdrop for the battles of The Faerie Queene br Spenser was called the Poet s Poet by Charles Lamb and was admired by John Milton William Blake William Wordsworth John Keats Lord Byron Alfred Tennyson and others Among his contemporaries Walter Raleigh wrote a commendatory poem to The Faerie Queene in in which he claims to admire and value Spenser s work more so than any other in the English language John Milton in his Areopagitica mentions our sage and serious poet Spenser whom I dare be known to think a better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas In the th century Alexander Pope compared Spenser to a mistress whose faults we see but love her with them all br br br A View of the Present State of Irelande br br In his work A View of the Present State of Irelande Spenser discussed future plans to establish control over Ireland the most recent Irish uprising led by Hugh O Neill having demonstrated the futility of previous efforts The work is partly a defence of Lord Arthur Grey de Wilton who was appointed Lord Deputy of Ireland in and who greatly influenced Spenser s thinking on Ireland br The goal of the piece was to show that Ireland was in great need of reform Spenser believed that Ireland is a diseased portion of the State it must first be cured and reformed before it could be in a position to appreciate the good sound laws and blessings of the nation In A View of the Present State of Ireland Spenser categorises the evils of the Irish people into three prominent categories laws customs and religion According to Spenser these three elements worked together in creating the supposedly disruptive and degraded people who inhabited the country One example given in the work is the Irish law system termed Brehon law which at the time trumped the established law as dictated by the Crown The Brehon system had its own court and methods of punishing infractions committed Spenser viewed this system as a backward custom which contributed to the degradation of the Irish people A particular legal punishment viewed with distaste by Spenser was the Brehon method of dealing with murder which was to impose an raic fine on the murderer s family From Spenser s viewpoint the appropriate punishment for murder was capital punishment Spenser also warned of the dangers that allowing the education of children in the Irish language would bring Soe that the speach being Irish the hart must needes be Irishe for out of the aboundance of the hart the tonge speaketh br He pressed for a scorched earth policy in Ireland noting its effectiveness in the Second Desmond Rebellion br br Out of everye corner of the woode and glenns they came creepinge forth upon theire handes for theire legges could not beare them they looked Anatomies of death they spake like ghostes crying out of theire graves they did eate of the carrions happye wheare they could find them yea and one another soone after in soe much as the verye carcasses they spared not to scrape out of theire graves and if they found a plott of water cresses or shamrockes theyr they flocked as to a feast in a shorte space there were none almost left and a most populous and plentyfull countrye suddenly lefte voyde of man or beast yett sure in all that warr
