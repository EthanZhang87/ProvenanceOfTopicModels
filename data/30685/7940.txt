Dungeons Dragons commonly abbreviated as D D or DnD is a fantasy tabletop role playing game RPG originally created and designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson The game was first published in by Tactical Studies Rules Inc TSR It has been published by Wizards of the Coast later a subsidiary of Hasbro since The game was derived from miniature wargames with a variation of the game Chainmail serving as the initial rule system D D s publication is commonly recognized as the beginning of modern role playing games and the role playing game industry and also deeply influenced video games especially the role playing video game genre br D D departs from traditional wargaming by allowing each player to create their own character to play instead of a military formation These characters embark upon adventures within a fantasy setting A Dungeon Master DM serves as referee and storyteller for the game while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur and playing the role of the inhabitants of the game world known as non player characters NPCs The characters form a party and they interact with the setting s inhabitants and each other Together they solve problems engage in battles explore and gather treasure and knowledge In the process player characters earn experience points XP to level up and become increasingly powerful over a series of separate gaming sessions Players choose a class when they create their character which gives them special perks and abilities every few levels br The early success of D D led to a proliferation of similar game systems Despite the competition D D has remained the market leader in the role playing game industry In the game was split into two branches the relatively rules light game system of basic Dungeons Dragons and the more structured rules heavy game system of Advanced Dungeons Dragons abbreviated as AD D AD D nd Edition was published in In a new system was released as D D rd edition continuing the edition numbering from AD D a revised version was released in June These rd edition rules formed the basis of the d System which is available under the Open Game License OGL for use by other publishers D D th edition was released in June The th edition of D D the most recent was released during the second half of br In D D remained the best known and best selling role playing game in the US with an estimated million people having played the game and more than US billion in book and equipment sales worldwide The year had the most number of players in its history million to million in North America alone D D th edition sales were up percent in from the year before and soared another percent in the game s biggest sales year yet The game has been supplemented by many premade adventures as well as commercial campaign settings suitable for use by regular gaming groups D D is known beyond the game itself for other D D branded products references in popular culture and some of the controversies that have surrounded it particularly a moral panic in the s which attempted to associate it with Satanism and suicide The game has won multiple awards and has been translated into many languages br br Dungeons Dragons is a structured yet open ended role playing game It is normally played indoors with the participants seated around a tabletop Typically one player takes on the role of Dungeon Master DM while the others each control a single character representing an individual in a fictional setting When working together as a group the player characters PCs are often described as a party of adventurers with each member often having their own area of specialty that contributes to the success of the group as a whole During the course of play each player directs the actions of their character and their interactions with other characters in the game This activity is performed through the verbal impersonation of the characters by the players while employing a variety of social and other useful cognitive skills such as logic basic mathematics and imagination A game often continues over a series of meetings to complete a single adventure and longer into a series of related gaming adventures called a campaign br The results of the party s choices and the overall storyline for the game are determined by the DM according to the rules of the game and the DM s interpretation of those rules The DM selects and describes the various non player characters NPCs that the party encounters the settings in which these interactions occur and the outcomes of those encounters based on the players choices and actions Encounters often take the form of battles with monsters a generic term used in D D to describe potentially hostile beings such as animals aberrant beings or mythical creatures In addition to jewels and gold coins magic items form part of the treasure that the players often seek in a dungeon Magic items are generally found in treasure hoards or recovered from fallen opponents sometimes a powerful or important magic item is the object of a quest The game s extensive rules which cover diverse subjects such as social interactions magic use combat and the effect of the environment on PCs help the DM to make these decisions The DM may choose to deviate from the published rules or make up new ones if they feel it is necessary br The most recent versions of the game s rules are detailed in three Fifth Edition core rulebooks The Player s Handbook the Dungeon Master s Guide and the Monster Manual br The only items required to play the game are the rulebooks a character sheet for each player and a number of polyhedral dice Many players also use miniature figures on a grid map as a visual aid if desired particularly during combat Some editions of the game presume such usage Many optional accessories are available to enhance the game such as expansion rulebooks pre designed adventures and various campaign settings br br Before the game begins each player creates their player character and records the details described below on a character sheet First a player determines their character s ability scores which consist of Strength Dexterity Constitution Intelligence Wisdom and Charisma Each edition of the game has offered differing methods of determining these scores The player then chooses a race species a character class such as a fighter rogue or wizard an alignment a moral and ethical outlook and other features to round out the character s abilities and backstory which have varied in nature through differing editions br During the game players describe their PCs intended actions to the DM who then describes the result or response Trivial actions such as picking up a letter or opening an unlocked door are usually automatically successful The outcomes of more complex or risky actions such as scaling a cliff or picking a lock are determined by rolling dice Different polyhedral dice are used for different actions For example a twenty sided die is used to determine whether a hit is made in combat with other dice such as four six eight ten or even twelve sided die used to determine how much damage was dealt Factors contributing to the outcome include the character s ability scores skills and the difficulty of the task In circumstances where a character is attempting to avoid a negative outcome such as when dodging a trap or resisting the effect of a spell a saving throw can be used to determine whether the resulting effect is reduced or avoided In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character s class levels and ability scores In circumstances where a character is attempting to complete a task such as picking a lock deactivating a trap or pushing a boulder a Difficulty Class must be hit or exceeded Relevant ability bonuses are added to help players succeed br As the game is played each PC changes over time and generally increases in capability Characters gain or sometimes lose experience skills and wealth and may even alter their alignment or gain additional character classes The key way characters progress is by earning experience points XP which happens when they defeat an enemy or accomplish a difficult task Acquiring enough XP allows a PC to advance a level which grants the character improved class features abilities and skills XP can be lost in some circumstances such as encounters with creatures that drain life energy or by use of certain magical powers that come with an XP cost br Hit points HP are a measure of a character s vitality and health and are determined by the class level and Constitution of each character They can be temporarily lost when a character sustains wounds in combat or otherwise comes to harm and loss of HP is the most common way for a character to die in the game Death can also result from the loss of key ability scores or character levels When a PC dies it is often possible for the dead character to be resurrected through magic although some penalties may be imposed as a result If resurrection is not possible or not desired the player may instead create a new PC to resume playing the game br br A typical Dungeons Dragons game consists of an adventure which is roughly equivalent to a single story or quest The DM can either design an original adventure or follow one of the many premade adventures also known as modules that have been published throughout the history of Dungeons Dragons Published adventures typically include a background story illustrations maps and goals for players to achieve Some may include location descriptions and handouts although they are not required for gameplay Although a small adventure entitled Temple of the Frog was included in the Blackmoor rules supplement in the first stand alone D D module published by TSR was s Steading of the Hill Giant Chief written by Gygax br A linked series of adventures is commonly referred to as a campaign The locations where these adventures occur such as a city country planet or entire fictional universe are referred to as campaign settings or worlds D D settings are based in various fantasy genres and feature different levels and types of magic and technology Popular commercially published campaign settings for Dungeons Dragons include Greyhawk Dragonlance Forgotten Realms Mystara Spelljammer Ravenloft Dark Sun Planescape Birthright and Eberron br In addition to first party campaigns and modules two campaigns based on popular culture have been created The first based on Stranger Things was released in May A campaign based on the Rick and Morty vs Dungeons and Dragons comic book series was later released in November br Alternatively DMs may develop their own fictional worlds to use as campaign settings either planning the adventure ahead or expanding on it as the players progress br br The wargames from which Dungeons Dragons evolved used miniature figures to represent combatants D D initially continued the use of miniatures in a fashion similar to its direct precursors The original D D set of required the use of the Chainmail miniatures game for combat resolution By the publication of the game editions combat was mostly resolved verbally Thus miniatures were no longer required for gameplay although some players continued to use them as a visual reference br In the s numerous companies began to sell miniature figures specifically for Dungeons Dragons and similar games Licensed miniature manufacturers who produced official figures include Grenadier Miniatures Citadel Miniatures Ral Partha and TSR itself Most of these miniatures used the mm scale br Periodically Dungeons Dragons has returned to its wargaming roots with supplementary rules systems for miniatures based wargaming Supplements such as Battlesystem and and a new edition of Chainmail provided rule systems to handle battles between armies by using miniatures br br An immediate predecessor of Dungeons Dragons was a set of medieval miniature rules written by Jeff Perren These were expanded by Gary Gygax whose additions included a fantasy supplement before the game was published as Chainmail When Dave Wesely entered the Army in his friend and fellow Napoleonics wargamer Dave Arneson began a medieval variation of Wesely s Braunstein games where players control individuals instead of armies Arneson used Chainmail to resolve combat As play progressed Arneson added such innovations as character classes experience points level advancement armor class and others Having partnered previously with Gygax on Don t Give Up the Ship Arneson introduced Gygax to his Blackmoor game and the two then collaborated on developing The Fantasy Game the game that became Dungeons Dragons with the final writing and preparation of the text being done by Gygax The name was chosen by Gygax s two year old daughter Cindy upon being presented with a number of choices of possible names she exclaimed Oh Daddy I like Dungeons Dragons best although less prevalent versions of the story gave credit to his then wife Mary Jo br Many Dungeons Dragons elements appear in hobbies of the mid to late th century For example character based role playing can be seen in improvisational theater Game world simulations were well developed in wargaming Fantasy milieux specifically designed for gaming could be seen in Glorantha s board games among others Ultimately however Dungeons Dragons represents a unique blending of these elements br The world of D D was influenced by world mythology history pulp fiction and contemporary fantasy novels The importance of Tolkien s The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit as an influence on D D is controversial The presence in the game of halflings elves half elves dwarves orcs rangers and the like as well as the convention of diverse adventurers forming a group draw comparisons to these works The resemblance was even closer before the threat of copyright action from Tolkien Enterprises prompted the name changes of hobbit to halfling ent to treant and balrog to balor For many years Gygax played down the influence of Tolkien on the development of the game However in an interview in he acknowledged that Tolkien s work had a strong impact though he also said that the list of other influential authors was long br The D D magic system in which wizards memorize spells that are used up once cast and must be re memorized the next day was heavily influenced by the Dying Earth stories and novels of Jack Vance The original alignment system which grouped all characters and creatures into Law Neutrality and Chaos was derived from the novel Three Hearts and Three Lions by Poul Anderson A troll described in this work influenced the D D definition of that monster br Other influences include the works of Robert E Howard Edgar Rice Burroughs A Merritt H P Lovecraft Fritz Leiber L Sprague de Camp Fletcher Pratt Roger Zelazny and Michael Moorcock Monsters spells and magic items used in the game have been inspired by hundreds of individual works such as A E van Vogt s Black Destroyer Coeurl the Displacer Beast Lewis Carroll s Jabberwocky vorpal sword and the Book of Genesis the clerical spell Blade Barrier was inspired by the flaming sword which turned every way at the gates of Eden br br Dungeons Dragons has gone through several revisions Parallel versions and inconsistent naming practices can make it difficult to distinguish between the different editions br br The original Dungeons Dragons now referred to as OD D was a small box set of three booklets published in With a very limited production budget of only with only budgeted for artwork it was amateurish in production and assumed the player was familiar with wargaming Nevertheless it grew rapidly in popularity first among wargamers and then expanding to a more general audience of college and high school students Roughly copies of the game were sold in the first year followed by in and many more in the following years This first set went through many printings and was supplemented with several official additions such as the original Greyhawk and Blackmoor supplements both as well as magazine articles in TSR s official publications and many fanzines br br In early TSR created the first element of a two pronged strategy that would divide D D for nearly two decades A Dungeons Dragons Basic Set boxed edition was introduced that cleaned up the presentation of the essential rules made the system understandable to the general public and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores Later in the first part of Advanced Dungeons Dragons AD D was published which brought together the various published rules options and corrections then expanded them into a definitive unified game for hobbyist gamers TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones the Basic Set directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules br As a result of this parallel development the basic game included many rules and concepts which contradicted comparable ones in AD D John Eric Holmes the editor of the basic game preferred a lighter tone with more room for personal improvisation AD D on the other hand was designed to create a tighter more structured game system than the loose framework of the original game Between and three hardcover rulebooks commonly referred to as the core rulebooks were released the Player s Handbook PHB the Dungeon Master s Guide DMG and the Monster Manual MM Several supplementary books were published throughout the s notably Unearthed Arcana which included a large number of new rules Confusing matters further the original D D boxed set remained in publication until since it remained a healthy seller for TSR br br In the s the rules for Advanced Dungeons Dragons and basic Dungeons Dragons remained separate each developing along different paths br In the basic version of Dungeons Dragons was revised by Tom Moldvay to make it even more novice friendly It was promoted as a continuation of the original D D tone whereas AD D was promoted as an advancement of the mechanics An accompanying Expert Set originally written by David Zeb Cook allowed players to continue using the simpler ruleset beyond the early levels of play In revisions of those sets by Frank Mentzer were released revising the presentation of the rules to a more tutorial format These were followed by Companion Master and Immortals sets Each set covered game play for more powerful characters than the previous The first four sets were compiled in as a single hardcover book the Dungeons Dragons Rules Cyclopedia which was released alongside a new introductory boxed set br Advanced Dungeons Dragons nd Edition was published in again as three core rulebooks the primary designer was David Zeb Cook The Monster Manual was replaced by the Monstrous Compendium a loose leaf binder that was subsequently replaced by the hardcover Monstrous Manual in In the core rulebooks were slightly revised although still referred to by TSR as the nd Edition and a series of Player s Option manuals were released as optional rulebooks br The release of AD D nd Edition deliberately excluded some aspects of the game that had attracted negative publicity References to demons and devils sexually suggestive artwork and playable evil aligned character types such as assassins and half orcs were removed The edition moved away from a theme of s and s sword and sorcery fantasy fiction to a mixture of medieval history and mythology The rules underwent minor changes including the addition of non weapon proficiencies skill like abilities that originally appeared in st Edition supplements The game s magic spells were divided into schools and spheres A major difference was the promotion of various game settings beyond that of traditional fantasy This included blending fantasy with other genres such as horror Ravenloft science fiction Spelljammer and apocalyptic Dark Sun as well as alternative historical and non European mythological settings br br In a near bankrupt TSR was purchased by Wizards of the Coast Following three years of development Dungeons Dragons rd edition was released in The new release folded the Basic and Advanced lines back into a single unified game It was the largest revision of the D D rules to date and served as the basis for a multi genre role playing system designed around sided dice called the d System The rd Edition rules were designed to be internally consistent and less restrictive than previous editions of the game allowing players more flexibility to create the characters they wanted to play Skills and feats were introduced into the core rules to encourage further customization of characters The new rules standardized the mechanics of action resolution and combat In Dungeons Dragons v was released as a revision of the rd Edition rules This release incorporated hundreds of rule changes mostly minor and expanded the core rulebooks br In early Wizards of the Coast s R D team started to develop Dungeons Dragons th Edition prompted mainly by the feedback obtained from the D D playing community and a desire to make the game faster more intuitive and with a better play experience than under the rd Edition The new game was developed through a number of design phases spanning from May until its release Dungeons Dragons th Edition was announced at Gen Con in August and the initial three core books were released June th Edition streamlined the game into a simplified form and introduced numerous rules changes Many character abilities were restructured into Powers These altered the spell using classes by adding abilities that could be used at will per encounter or per day Likewise non magic using classes were provided with parallel sets of options Software tools including player character and monster building programs became a major part of the game This edition added the D D Encounters program a weekly event held at local stores designed to draw players back to the game by giving the busy gamer the chance to play D D once a week as their schedules allow In the past D D games could take months even years and players generally had to attend every session so that the story flow wasn t interrupted With Encounters players can come and go as they choose and new players can easily be integrated into the story continuity br br On January Wizards of the Coast announced that it was working on a th edition of the game The company planned to take suggestions from players and let them playtest the rules Public playtesting began on May At Gen Con in August Mike Mearls lead developer for th Edition said that Wizards of the Coast had received feedback from more than playtesters but that the entire development process would take two years adding I can t emphasize this enough we re very serious about taking the time we need to get this right The release of the th Edition coinciding with D D s th anniversary occurred in the second half of br Since the release of th edition dozens of Dungeons Dragons books have been published including new rulebooks campaign guides and adventure modules had the most number of players in its history million to million in North America alone Mary Pilon for Bloomberg reported that sales of th edition Dungeon Dragons were up percent in from the year before and soared another percent in the game s biggest sales year yet In million people watched others play D D on Twitch immersing themselves in the world of the game without ever having to pick up a die or cast a spell In Wizards of the Coast organized a massive live stream event the Stream of Many Eyes where ten live streamed sessions of Dungeons Dragons were performed on Twitch over three days This event won the Content Marketing Institute s award for best In Person Event Content Marketing Strategy Dungeons Dragons continued to have a strong presence on Twitch throughout this included a growing number of celebrity players and dungeon masters such as Joe Manganiello Deborah Ann Woll and Stephen Colbert Wizards of the Coast has created produced and sponsored multiple web series featuring Dungeons Dragons These shows have typically aired on the official Dungeons Dragons Twitch and YouTube channels br In Wizards of the Coast announced that Dungeons Dragons had its th annual year of growth in with a percent increase in sales of their introductory box sets as well as a increase on sales in Europe a rate which has more than quadrupled since In terms of player demographics in of identified as female and identified as male of players are considered Gen Z years old or younger of players are in the age range of and of players are aged In January the Los Angeles Times reported that according to Liz Schuh head of publishing and licensing for Dungeons Dragons revenue was up in compared with the seventh consecutive year of growth and in during the COVID pandemic virtual play rose aided by online platforms such as Roll and Fantasy Grounds Sarah Parvini for the Los Angeles Times wrote players and scholars attribute the game s resurgent popularity not only to the longueurs of the pandemic but also to its reemergence in pop culture on the Netflix series Stranger Things whose main characters play D D in a basement on the sitcom The Big Bang Theory or via the host of celebrities who display their love for the game online br Following an apology issued by Wizards of the Coast for offensive and racist material included in Spelljammer Adventures in Space and the announced revisions to the product in September Christopher Perkins Wizards game design architect announced a new inclusion review process for the Dungeons Dragons studio in November This process will now require every word illustration and map to be reviewed at several steps in development by multiple outside cultural consultants prior to publication The previous process only included cultural consultants at the discretion of the product lead for a project All products being reprinted will also go through this new review process and be updated as needed br br In September it was announced that a backwards compatible evolution of th edition would be released in to mark the th anniversary of the game In August Wizards announced that the next phase of major changes for Dungeons Dragons would occur under the One D D initiative which includes a public playtest of the next version of Dungeons Dragons and an upcoming virtual tabletop simulator with D environments developed using Unreal Engine Revised editions of the Player s Handbook Monster Manual and Dungeon Master s Guide are scheduled to be released in br In April Hasbro announced that Wizards would acquire the D D Beyond digital toolset and game companion from Fandom the official transfer to Wizards occurred in May At the Hasbro Investor Event in October it was announced that Dan Rawson former COO of Microsoft Dynamics was appointed to the newly created position of Senior Vice President for the Dungeons Dragons brand Rawson will act as the new head of the franchise Dicebreaker highlighted that Rawson s role is part of Wizards plans to apply more resources to the digital side of D D following the purchase of D D Beyond by Hasbro earlier in the year Wizards of the Coast CEO Cynthia Williams and Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks at a December Hasbro investor focused web seminar called the Dungeons Dragons brand under monetized They highlighted the high engagement of fans with the brand however the majority of spending is by Dungeon Masters who are only roughly of the player base Williams commented that the increased investment in digital will unlock the type of recurrent spending you see in digital games br br Early in the game s history TSR took no action against small publishers production of D D compatible material and even licensed Judges Guild to produce D D materials for several years such as City State of the Invincible Overlord This attitude changed in the mid s when TSR took legal action to try to prevent others from publishing compatible material This angered many fans and led to resentment by the other gaming companies Although TSR took legal action against several publishers in an attempt to restrict third party usage it never brought any court cases to completion instead settling out of court in every instance TSR itself ran afoul of intellectual property law in several cases br With the launch of Dungeons Dragons s rd Edition Wizards of the Coast made the d System available under the Open Game License OGL and d System trademark license Under these licenses authors were free to use the d System when writing games and game supplements The OGL has allowed a wide range of unofficial commercial derivative work based on the mechanics of Dungeons and Dragons to be produced since it is credited with increasing the market share of d products and leading to a boom in the RPG industry in the early s br With the release of the fourth edition Wizards of the Coast introduced its Game System License which represented a significant restriction compared to the very open policies embodied by the OGL In part as a response to this some publishers such as Paizo Publishing with its Pathfinder Roleplaying Game who previously produced materials in support of the D D product line decided to continue supporting the rd Edition rules thereby competing directly with Wizards of the Coast Others such as Kenzer Company returned to the practice of publishing unlicensed supplements and arguing that copyright law does not allow Wizards of the Coast to restrict third party usage br During the s there has been a trend towards reviving and recreating older editions of D D known as the Old School Revival This in turn inspired the creation of retro clones games that more closely recreate the original rule sets using material placed under the OGL along with non copyrightable mechanical aspects of the older rules to create a new presentation of the games br br Alongside the publication of the th Edition Wizards of the Coast established a two pronged licensing approach The core of the th Edition rules have been made available under the OGL while publishers and independent creators have also been given the opportunity to create licensed materials directly for Dungeons Dragons and associated properties like the Forgotten Realms under a program called the DM s Guild The DM s Guild does not function under the OGL but uses a community agreement intended to foster liberal cooperation among content creators br Wizards of the Coast has started to release th Edition products that tie into other intellectual properties such as Magic The Gathering with the Guildmasters Guide to Ravnica and Mythic Odysseys of Theros source books Two th Edition starter box sets based on TV shows Stranger Things and Rick and Morty were released in Source books based on Dungeons Dragons live play series have also been released Acquisitions Incorporated and Explorer s Guide to Wildemount br Between November and December there was reported speculation that Wizards was planning on discontinuing the OGL for Dungeons Dragons based on unconfirmed leaks In response to the speculation Wizards stated in November We will continue to support the thousands of creators making third party D D content with the release of One D D in Limited details on the update to the OGL including the addition of revenue reporting and required royalties were released by Wizards in December Linda Codega for Io in January reported on the details from a leaked full copy of the OGL including updated terms such as no longer authorizing use of the OGL Codega highlighted that if the original license is in fact no longer viable every single licensed publisher will be affected by the new agreement The main takeaway from the leaked OGL draft document is that WotC is keeping power close at hand A week after the leak Wizards issued a response which walked back several changes to the OGL this response did not contain the updated OGL The Motley Fool highlighted that Hasbro pulled an abrupt volte face and had its subsidiary D D Beyond publish a mea culpa on its website On January following feedback received during the open comment period for the draft OGL Wizards of the Coast announced that the System Reference Document SRD would be released under an irrevocable Creative Commons license CC BY effective immediately and Wizards would no longer pursue deauthorizing the OGL a br br Eric Goldberg reviewed Dungeons Dragons in Ares Magazine March rating it a out of and commented that Dungeons and Dragons is an impressive achievement based on the concept alone and also must be credited with cementing the marriage between the fantasy genre and gaming Eric Goldberg again reviewed Dungeons Dragons in Ares Magazine and commented that D D is the FRP game played most often in most places In the book The Complete Book of Wargames game designer Jon Freeman asked What can be said about a phenomenon Aside from Tactics II and possibly PanzerBlitz the first modern tactical wargame this is the most significant war game since H G Wells However Freeman did have significant issues with the game pointing out On the other hand beginning characters are without exception dull virtually powerless and so fragile which was not encouraging for newcomers He also called the magic system stupid feeling that many of the spells were redundant and the effects of the majority are hopelessly vague He found essential elements such as saving throws hit points and experience points undefined or poorly explained the ratio of substance to holes compares unfavorably with the head of a tennis racquet He also noted the rules were presented in the most illiterate display of poor grammar misspellings and typographical errors in professional wargaming Despite all these issues Freeman concluded As it was given birth it is fascinating but misshapen in its best incarnations it s perhaps the most exciting and attractive specimen alive br The game had more than three million players around the world by and copies of the rules were selling at a rate of about per year by Beginning with a French language edition in Dungeons Dragons has been translated into many languages beyond the original English By the game had been translated into languages and sold over million copies in countries worldwide By consumers had spent more than billion on Dungeons Dragons products and the game had been played by more than million people As many as six million people played the game in David M Ewalt in his book Of Dice and Men praised that the game allows for a personal fantastical experience and stated that even though it s make believe the catharsis is real br br The various editions of Dungeons Dragons have won many Origins Awards including All Time Best Roleplaying Rules of Best Roleplaying Rules of Best Roleplaying Game of and Best Role Playing Game and Best Role Playing Supplement of for the flagship editions of the game Both Dungeons Dragons and Advanced Dungeons Dragons are Origins Hall of Fame Games inductees as they were deemed sufficiently distinct to merit separate inclusion on different occasions The independent Games magazine placed Dungeons Dragons on their Games list from through then entered the game into the magazine s Hall of Fame in Games magazine included Dungeons Dragons in their Top Games of saying The more players the merrier Advanced Dungeons Dragons was ranked nd in the reader poll of Arcane magazine to determine the most popular roleplaying games of all time Dungeons Dragons was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in and into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in br br Later editions would lead to inevitable comparisons between the game series Scott Taylor for Black Gate in rated Dungeons Dragons as in the top ten role playing games of all time saying The grand daddy of all games D D just keeps on going and although there might always be edition wars between players that just says that it effectively stays within the consciousness of multiple generations of players as a relevant piece of entertainment br Griffin McElroy for Polygon in wrote The game has shifted in the past four decades bouncing between different rules sets philosophies and methods of play Role playing character customization and real life improvisational storytelling has always been at the game s core but how those ideas are interpreted by the game system has changed drastically edition to edition Dieter Bohn for The Verge in wrote Every few years there s been a new version of D D that tries to address the shortcomings of the previous version and also make itself more palatable to its age The third edition got a reputation which it didn t necessarily deserve for being too complex and rules focused The fourth edition got a reputation which it didn t necessarily deserve for being too focused on miniatures and grids too mechanical Meanwhile the company that owns D D had released a bunch of its old material for free as a service to fans and some of that was built up into a competing game called Pathfinder Pathfinder ultimately became more popular by some metrics than D D itself Bohn highlighted that the th Edition was designed for one purpose to bring D D back to its roots and win back everybody who left during the edition wars Henry Glasheen for SLUG Magazine in highlighted that after jumping ship during the th Edition era he was drawn back to Dungeons Dragons with th Edition and he considers it the new gold standard for D based tabletop RPGs Glasheen wrote Fifth Edition is a compelling reason to get excited about D D again and while some will welcome the simplicity I fully expect that plenty of people will stick to whatever system suits them best However this edition is easily my favorite ranking even higher than D D my first love in D D br Christian Hoffer for ComicBook com in highlighted the continuing fan debate on Dungeons Dragons and Pathfinder s current editions which centers on Dungeons Dragons th Edition s market dominance Hoffer wrote The reality is that Dungeons Dragons Fifth Edition is likely the most popular tabletop roleplaying game ever made even more so than previous editions of the games E has brought millions of new players to tabletop roleplaying games Many of those newer players have never heard of other roleplaying games even popular ones like Vampire The Masquerade or Cyberpunk or Pathfinder Many content creators and publishers see E as their main path to survival and relevance even if it s not their preferred gaming system In December James Whitbrook of Gizmodo highlighted D D s continued social influence with the release of related media such as the film Honor Among Thieves the Dungeons Dragons Adventures FAST channel and the video game Baldur s Gate with the video game s blockbuster success credited for a increase in Wizards of the Coast s earnings over However Whitbrook opined that not even these successes could save Dungeons Dragons from the greed of its owners with the OGL controversy and major layoffs by Hasbro bookending what should ve been one of the greatest years for Dungeons Dragons the game has ever seen more popular than ever more accessible than ever more culturally relevant than ever and in doing so transformed it into a golden era sullied with dark marks overshadowed by grim caveats a reflection that those with the most power in these spaces never really take the lessons they espoused to learn from their mistakes br br At various times in its history Dungeons Dragons has received negative publicity in particular from some Christian groups for alleged promotion of such practices as devil worship witchcraft suicide and murder and for the presence of naked breasts in drawings of female humanoids in the original AD D manuals mainly monsters such as harpies succubi etc These controversies led TSR to remove many potentially controversial references and artwork when releasing the nd Edition of AD D Many of these references including the use of the names devils and demons were reintroduced in the rd edition The moral panic over the game led to problems for fans of D D who faced social ostracism unfair treatment and false association with the occult and Satanism regardless of an individual fan s actual religious affiliation and beliefs However the controversy was also beneficial in evoking the Streisand Effect by giving the game widespread notoriety that significantly increased sales in the early s in defiance of the moral panic br Dungeons Dragons has been the subject of rumors regarding players having difficulty separating fantasy from reality even leading to psychotic episodes The most notable of these was the saga of James Dallas Egbert III the facts of which were fictionalized in the novel Mazes and Monsters and later made into a TV movie in starring Tom Hanks William Dear the private investigator hired by the Egbert family to find their son when he went missing at college wrote a book titled The Dungeon Master refuting any connection with D D and Egbert s personal issues The game was blamed for some of the actions of Chris Pritchard who was convicted in of murdering his stepfather Research by various psychologists starting with Armando Simon has concluded that no harmful effects are related to the playing of D D Dungeons Dragons has also been cited as encouraging people to socialize weekly or biweekly teaching problem solving skills which can be beneficial in adult life and teaching positive moral decisions br br D D has been compared unfavorably to other role playing games of its time Writing for Slate in Erik Sofge makes unfavorable comparisons between the violent incentives of D D and the more versatile role playing experience of GURPS He claims that for decades gamers have argued that since D D came first its lame morally repulsive experience system can be forgiven But the damage is still being done New generations of players are introduced to RPGs as little more than a collective fantasy of massacre This criticism generated backlash from D D fans Writing for Ars Technica Ben Kuchera responded that Sofge had experienced a small minded Dungeon Master who only wanted to kill things and that better game experiences are possible br In Polygon reported that the D D team announced that it would be making changes to portions of its th edition product line that fans have called out for being insensitive Sebastian Modak for The Washington Post reported that the tabletop community has widely approved these changes Modak wrote that in its statement addressing mistakes around portrayals of different peoples in the D D universe Wizards of the Coast highlighted its recent efforts in bringing in more diverse voices to craft the new D D sourcebooks coming out in These conversations around depictions of race and alleged treatment of employees of marginalized backgrounds and identities have encouraged players to seek out other tabletop roleplaying experiences Matthew Gault for Wired reported positively on the roundtable discussions Wizards of the Coast has hosted with fans and community leaders on diversity and inclusion However Gault also highlighted that other efforts such as revisions to old material and the release of new material have been less great and at times minimal Gault wrote WotC appears to be trying to change things but it keeps stumbling and it s often the fans who pick up the pieces WotC is trying to make changes but it often feels like lip service The loudest voices criticizing D D right now are doing it out of love They don t want to see it destroyed
