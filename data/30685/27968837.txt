Christian theology is the theology the systematic study of the divine and religion of Christian belief and practice It concentrates primarily upon the texts of the Old Testament and of the New Testament as well as on Christian tradition Christian theologians use biblical exegesis rational analysis and argument Theologians may undertake the study of Christian theology for a variety of reasons such as in order to br br help them better understand Christian tenets br make comparisons between Christianity and other traditions br defend Christianity against objections and criticism br facilitate reforms in the Christian church br assist in the propagation of Christianity br draw on the resources of the Christian tradition to address some present situation or perceived need br education in Christian philosophy especially in Neoplatonic philosophy br Christian theology has permeated much of non ecclesiastical Western culture especially in pre modern Europe although Christianity is a worldwide religion br br br Theological spectrum br Conservative Christianity br Liberal Christianity br Progressive Christianity br Moderate Christianity br br br Christian

seminaries and ministerial formation br br br Systematic theology br Systematic theology as a discipline of Christian theology formulates an orderly rational and coherent account of Christian faith and beliefs Systematic theology draws on the foundational sacred texts of Christianity while simultaneously investigating the development of Christian doctrine throughout history particularly through the ecumenical councils of the early church such as the First Council of Nicea and philosophical evolution Inherent to a system of theological thought is the development of a method one which can

Biblical revelation br br Revelation is the revealing or disclosing or making something obvious through active or passive communication with God and can originate directly from God or through an agent such as an angel A person recognised as having experienced such contact is often called a prophet Christianity generally considers the Bible as divinely or supernaturally revealed or inspired Such revelation does not always require the presence of God or an angel For instance in the concept which Catholics call interior locution supernatural revelation can include just an inner voice heard by the recipient br Thomas Aquinas first described two types of revelation in Christianity general revelation and special revelation br br General revelation occurs through observation of the created order Such observations can logically lead to important conclusions such as the existence of God and some of God s attributes General revelation is also an element of Christian apologetics br Certain specifics such as the Trinity and the Incarnation as revealed in the teachings of the Scriptures can not otherwise be deduced except by special revelation br br br Biblical inspiration br br The Bible contains many passages in which the authors claim divine inspiration for their message or report the effects of such inspiration on others Besides the direct accounts of written revelation such as Moses receiving the Ten Commandments inscribed on tablets of stone the Prophets of the Old Testament frequently claimed that their message was of divine origin by prefacing the revelation using the following phrase Thus says the LORD for example Kgs Chr Jer Ezek Zech etc The Second Epistle of Peter claims that no prophecy of Scripture was ever produced by the will of man but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit The Second Epistle of Peter also implies that Paul s writings are inspired Pet br Many Christians cite a verse in Paul s letter to Timothy Timothy as evidence that all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable Here St Paul is referring to the Old Testament since the scriptures have been known by Timothy from infancy verse Others offer an alternative reading for the passage for example theologian C H Dodd suggests that it is probably to be rendered as Every inspired scripture is also useful A similar translation appears in the New English Bible in the Revised English Bible and as a footnoted alternative in the New Revised Standard Version The Latin Vulgate can be so read Yet others defend the traditional interpretation Daniel B Wallace calls the alternative probably not the best translation br Some modern English versions of the Bible renders theopneustos with God breathed NIV or breathed out by God ESV avoiding the word inspiration which has the Latin root insp r re to blow or breathe into br br br Biblical authority br Christianity generally regards the agreed collections of books known as the Bible as authoritative and as written by human authors under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit Some Christians believe that the Bible is inerrant totally without error and free from contradiction including the historical and scientific parts or infallible inerrant on issues of faith and practice but not necessarily on matters of history or science br Some Christians infer that the Bible cannot both refer to itself as being divinely inspired and also be errant or fallible For if the Bible were divinely inspired then the source of inspiration being divine would not be subject to fallibility or error in that which is produced For them the doctrines of the divine inspiration infallibility and inerrancy are inseparably tied together The idea of biblical integrity is a further concept of infallibility by suggesting that current biblical text is complete and without error and that the integrity of biblical text has never been corrupted or degraded Historians note or claim that the doctrine of the Bible s infallibility was adopted hundreds of years after the books of the Bible were written br br br Biblical canon br br The content of the Protestant Old Testament is the same as the Hebrew Bible canon with changes in the division and order of books but the Catholic Old Testament contains additional texts known as the deuterocanonical books Protestants recognize books in their Old Testament canon while Roman Catholic and Eastern Christians recognize books as canonical Both Catholics and Protestants use the same book New Testament canon br Early Christians used the Septuagint a Koine Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures Christianity subsequently endorsed various additional writings that would become the New Testament In the th century a series of synods most notably the Synod of Hippo in AD produced a list of texts equal to the book canon of the Old Testament that Catholics use today and the book canon of the New Testament that all use A definitive list did not come from any early ecumenical council Around Jerome produced the Vulgate a definitive Latin edition of the Bible the contents of which at the insistence of the Bishop of Rome accorded with the decisions of the earlier synods This process effectively set the New Testament canon although examples exist of other canonical lists in use after this time br During the th century Protestant Reformation certain reformers proposed different canonical lists of the Old Testament The texts which appear in the Septuagint but not in the Jewish canon fell out of favor and eventually disappeared from Protestant canons Catholic Bibles classify these texts as deuterocanonical books whereas Protestant contexts label them as the Apocrypha br br br Theology proper God br br In Christianity God is the creator and preserver of the universe God is the sole ultimate power in the universe but is distinct from it The Bible never speaks of God as impersonal Instead it refers to him in personal terms who speaks sees hears acts and loves God is understood to have a will and personality and is an all powerful divine and benevolent being He is represented in Scripture as being primarily concerned with people and their salvation br br br Attributes of God br br br Classification br Many Reformed theologians distinguish between the communicable attributes those that human beings can also have and the incommunicable attributes those which belong to God alone br br br Enumeration br Some attributes ascribed to God in Christian theology are br br Aseity That God is so independent that he does not need us It is based on Acts where it says that God is not served by human hands as if he needed anything NIV This is often related to God s self existence and his self sufficiency br Eternity That God exists beyond the temporal realm br Graciousness That God extends His favor and gifts to human beings unconditionally as well as conditionally br Holiness That God is separate from sin and incorruptible Noting the refrain of Holy holy holy in Isaiah and Revelation br Immanence That although God is transcendent and holy He is also accessible and can be dynamically experienced br Immutability That God s essential nature is unchangeable br Impassibility That God does not experience emotion or suffering a more controversial doctrine disputed especially by open theism br Impeccability That God is incapable of error sin br Incorporeality That God is without physical composition A related concept is the spirituality of God which is derived from Jesus statement in John God is spirit br Love That God is care and compassion John says God is love br Mission That God is the supreme liberator While the Mission of God is not traditionally included in this list David Bosch has argued that mission is not primarily an activity of the church but an attribute of God br Omnibenevolence That God is omnibenevolent Omnibenevolence of God refers to him being all good br Omnipotence That God is supremely or all powerful br Omnipresence That God is the supreme being existing everywhere and at all times the all perceiving or all conceiving foundation of reality br Omniscience That God is supremely or all knowing br Oneness That God is without peer also that every divine attribute is instantiated in its entirety the qualitative infinity of God See also Monotheism and Divine simplicity br Providence That God watches over His creation with interest and dedication While the Providence of God usually refers to his activity in the world it also implies his care for the universe and is thus an attribute A distinction is usually made between general providence which refers to God s continuous upholding the existence and natural order of the universe and special providence which refers to God s extraordinary intervention in the life of people See also Sovereignty br Righteousness That God is the greatest or only measure of human conduct The righteousness of God may refer to his holiness to his justice or to his saving activity through Christ br Transcendence That God exists beyond the natural realm of physical laws and thus is not bound by them He is also wholly Other and incomprehensible apart from general or special self revelation br Triune The Christian God is understood by trinitarian Christians to be a threeness of Father Son and Holy Spirit that is fully consistent with His oneness a single infinite being who is both within and beyond nature Because the persons of the Trinity represent a personal relation even on the level of God to Himself He is personal both in His relation toward us and in His relation toward Himself br Veracity That God is the Truth all human beings strive for He is also impeccably honest Titus refers to God who does not lie br Wisdom That God fully comprehends human nature and the world and will see His will accomplished in heaven and on earth Romans speaks about the only wise God br br br Monotheism br br Some Christians believe that the God worshiped by the Hebrew people of the pre Christian era had always revealed himself as he did through Jesus but that this was never obvious until Jesus was born see John Also though the Angel of the Lord spoke to the Patriarchs revealing God to them some believe it has always been only through the Spirit of God granting them understanding that men have been able to perceive later that God himself had visited them br This belief gradually developed into the modern formulation of the Trinity which is the doctrine that God is a single entity Yahweh but that there is a trinity in God s single being the meaning of which has always been debated This mysterious Trinity has been described as hypostases in the Greek language subsistences in Latin and persons in English Nonetheless Christians stress that they only believe in one God br Most Christian churches teach the Trinity as opposed to Unitarian monotheistic beliefs Historically most Christian churches have taught that the nature of God is a mystery something that must be revealed by special revelation rather than deduced through general revelation br Christian orthodox traditions Catholic Eastern Orthodox and Protestant follow this idea which was codified in and reached its full development through the work of the Cappadocian Fathers They consider God to be a triune entity called the Trinity comprising the three Persons God the Father God the Son and God the Holy Spirit described as being of the same substance The true nature of an infinite God however is commonly described as beyond definition and the word person is an imperfect expression of the idea br Some critics contend that because of the adoption of a tripartite conception of deity Christianity is a form of tritheism or polytheism This concept dates from Arian teachings which claimed that Jesus having appeared later in the Bible than his Father had to be a secondary lesser and therefore distinct god For Jews and Muslims the idea of God as a trinity is heretical it is considered akin to polytheism Christians overwhelmingly assert that monotheism is central to the Christian faith as the very Nicene Creed among others which gives the orthodox Christian definition of the Trinity does begin with I believe in one God br In the rd century Tertullian claimed that God exists as the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit the three personae of one and the same substance To trinitarian Christians God the Father is not at all a separate god from God the Son of whom Jesus is the incarnation and the Holy Spirit the other hypostases Persons of the Christian Godhead According to the Nicene Creed the Son Jesus Christ is eternally begotten of the Father indicating that their divine Father Son relationship is not tied to an event within time or human history br In Christianity the doctrine of the Trinity states that God is one being who exists simultaneously and eternally as a mutual indwelling of three Persons the Father the Son incarnate as Jesus and the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost Since earliest Christianity one s salvation has been very closely related to the concept of a triune God although the Trinitarian doctrine was not formalized until the th century At that time the Emperor Constantine convoked the First Council of Nicaea to which all bishops of the empire were invited to attend Pope Sylvester I did not attend but sent his legate The council among other things decreed the original Nicene Creed br br br Trinity br br For most Christians beliefs about God are enshrined in the doctrine of Trinitarianism which holds that the three persons of God together form a single God The Trinitarian view emphasizes that God has a will and that God the Son has two wills divine and human though these are never in conflict see Hypostatic union However this point is disputed by Oriental Orthodox Christians who hold that God the Son has only one will of unified divinity and humanity see Miaphysitism br The Christian doctrine of the Trinity teaches the unity of Father Son and Holy Spirit as three persons in one Godhead The doctrine states that God is the Triune God existing as three persons or in the Greek hypostases but one being Personhood in the Trinity does not match the common Western understanding of person as used in the English language it does not imply an individual self actualized center of free will and conscious activity To the ancients personhood was in some sense individual but always in community as well p Each person is understood as having the one identical essence or nature not merely similar natures Since the beginning of the rd century the doctrine of the Trinity has been stated as the one God exists in three Persons and one substance Father Son and Holy Spirit br Trinitarianism belief in the Trinity is a mark of Catholicism Eastern and Oriental Orthodoxy as well as other prominent Christian sects arising from the Protestant Reformation such as Anglicanism Methodism Lutheranism Baptist and Presbyterianism The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church describes the Trinity as the central dogma of Christian theology This doctrine contrasts with Nontrinitarian positions which include Unitarianism Oneness and Modalism A small minority of Christians hold non trinitarian views largely coming under the heading of Unitarianism br Most if not all Christians believe that God is spirit an uncreated omnipotent and eternal being the creator and sustainer of all things who works the redemption of the world through his Son Jesus Christ With this background belief in the divinity of Christ and the Holy Spirit is expressed as the doctrine of the Trinity which describes the single divine ousia substance existing as three distinct and inseparable hypostases persons the Father the Son Jesus Christ the Logos and the Holy Spirit br The Trinitarian doctrine is considered by most Christians to be a core tenet of their faith Nontrinitarians typically hold that God the Father is supreme that Jesus although still divine Lord and Savior is the Son of God and that the Holy Spirit is a phenomenon akin to God s will on Earth The holy three are separate yet the Son and the Holy Spirit are still seen as originating from God the Father br The New Testament does not have the term Trinity and nowhere discusses the Trinity as such Some emphasize however that the New Testament does repeatedly speak of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit to compel a trinitarian understanding of God The doctrine developed from the biblical language used in New Testament passages such as the baptismal formula in Matthew and by the end of the th century it was widely held in its present form br br br God the Father br br In many monotheist religions God is addressed as the father in part because of his active interest in human affairs in the way that a father would take an interest in his children who are dependent on him and as a father he will respond to humanity his children acting in their best interests In Christianity God is called Father in a more literal sense besides being the creator and nurturer of creation and the provider for his children The Father is said to be in unique relationship with his only begotten monogenes son Jesus Christ which implies an exclusive and intimate familiarity No one knows the Son except the Father and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him br In Christianity God the Father s relationship with humanity is as a father to children in a previously unheard of sense and not just as the creator and nurturer of creation and the provider for his children his people Thus humans in general are sometimes called children of God To Christians God the Father s relationship with humanity is that of Creator and created beings and in that respect he is the father of all The New Testament says in this sense that the very idea of family wherever it appears derives its name from God the Father and thus God himself is the model of the family br However there is a deeper legal sense in which Christians believe that they are made participants in the special relationship of Father and Son through Jesus Christ as his spiritual bride Christians call themselves adopted children of God br In the New Testament God the Father has a special role in his relationship with the person of the Son where Jesus is believed to be his Son and his heir According to the Nicene Creed the Son Jesus Christ is eternally begotten of the Father indicating that their divine Father Son relationship is not tied to an event within time or human history See Christology The Bible refers to Christ called The Word as present at the beginning of God s creation not a creation himself but equal in the personhood of the Trinity br In Eastern Orthodox theology God the Father is the principium beginning the source or origin of both the Son and the Holy Spirit which gives intuitive emphasis to the threeness of persons by comparison Western theology explains the origin of all three hypostases or persons as being in the divine nature which gives intuitive emphasis to the oneness of God s being br br br Christology and Christ br br Christology is the field of study within Christian theology which is primarily concerned with the nature person and works of Jesus Christ held by Christians to be the Son of God Christology is concerned with the meeting of the human Son of Man and divine God the Son or Word of God in the person of Jesus br Primary considerations include the Incarnation the relationship of Jesus s nature and person with the nature and person of God and the salvific work of Jesus As such Christology is generally less concerned with the details of Jesus s life what he did or teaching than with who or what he is There have been and are various perspectives by those who claim to be his followers since the church began after his ascension The controversies ultimately focused on whether and how a human nature and a divine nature can co exist in one person The study of the inter relationship of these two natures is one of the preoccupations of the majority tradition br Teachings about Jesus and testimonies about what he accomplished during his three year public ministry are found throughout the New Testament Core biblical teachings about the person of Jesus Christ may be summarized that Jesus Christ was and forever is fully God divine and fully human in one sinless person at the same time and that through the death and resurrection of Jesus sinful humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation and the promise of eternal life via his New Covenant While there have been theological disputes over the nature of Jesus Christians believe that Jesus is God incarnate and true God and true man or both fully divine and fully human Jesus having become fully human in all respects suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man yet he did not sin As fully God he defeated death and rose to life again Scripture asserts that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of his virgin mother Mary without a human father The biblical accounts of Jesus s ministry include miracles preaching teaching healing Death and resurrection The apostle Peter in what has become a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the st century said You are the Christ the Son of the living God Most Christians now wait for the Second Coming of Christ when they believe he will fulfill the remaining Messianic prophecies br br br Christ br Christ is the English term for the Greek Khrist s meaning the anointed one It is a translation of the Hebrew M a usually transliterated into English as Messiah The word is often misunderstood to be the surname of Jesus due to the numerous mentions of Jesus Christ in the Christian Bible The word is in fact used as a title hence its common reciprocal use Christ Jesus meaning Jesus the Anointed One or Jesus the Messiah Followers of Jesus became known as Christians because they believed that Jesus was the Christ or Messiah prophesied about in the Old Testament or Tanakh br br br Trinitarian ecumenical councils br br The Christological controversies came to a head over the persons of the Godhead and their relationship with one another br Christology was a fundamental concern from the First Council of Nicaea until the Third Council of Constantinople In this time period the Christological views of various groups within the broader Christian community led to accusations of heresy and infrequently subsequent religious persecution In some cases a sect s unique Christology is its chief distinctive feature in these cases it is common for the sect to be known by the name given to its Christology br The decisions made at First Council of Nicaea and re ratified at the First Council of Constantinople after several decades of ongoing controversy during which the work of Athanasius and the Cappadocian Fathers were influential The language used was that the one God exists in three persons Father Son and Holy Spirit in particular it was affirmed that the Son was homoousios of one substance with the Father The Creed of the Nicene Council made statements about the full divinity and full humanity of Jesus thus preparing the way for discussion about how exactly the divine and human come together in the person of Christ Christology br Nicaea insisted that Jesus was fully divine and also human What it did not do was make clear how one person could be both divine and human and how the divine and human were related within that one person This led to the Christological controversies of the th and th centuries of the Christian era br The Chalcedonian Creed did not put an end to all Christological debate but it did clarify the terms used and became a point of reference for all other Christologies Most of the major branches of Christianity Catholicism Eastern Orthodoxy Anglicanism Lutheranism and Reformed subscribe to the Chalcedonian Christological formulation while many branches of Eastern Christianity Syrian Orthodoxy Assyrian Church Coptic Orthodoxy Ethiopian Orthodoxy and Armenian Apostolicism reject it br br br Attributes of Christ br br br God as Son br br According to the Bible the second Person of the Trinity because of his eternal relation to the first Person God as Father is the Son of God He is considered by Trinitarians to be coequal with the Father and Holy Spirit He is all God and all human the Son of God as to his divine nature while as to his human nature he is from the lineage of David The core of Jesus s self interpretation was his filial consciousness his relationship to God as child to parent in some unique sense see Filioque controversy His mission on earth proved to be that of enabling people to know God as their Father which Christians believe is the essence of eternal life br God the Son is the second person of the Trinity in Christian theology The doctrine of the Trinity identifies Jesus of Nazareth as God the Son united in essence but distinct in person with regard to God the Father and God the Holy Spirit the first and third persons of the Trinity God the Son is co eternal with God the Father and the Holy Spirit both before Creation and after the End see Eschatology So Jesus was always God the Son though not revealed as such until he also became the Son of God through incarnation Son of God draws attention to his humanity whereas God the Son refers more generally to his divinity including his pre incarnate existence So in Christian theology Jesus was always God the Son though not revealed as such until he also became the Son of God through incarnation br The exact phrase God the Son is not in the New Testament Later theological use of this expression reflects what came to be standard interpretation of New Testament references understood to imply Jesus s divinity but the distinction of his person from that of the one God he called his Father As such the title is associated more with the development of the doctrine of the Trinity than with the Christological debates There are over places in the New Testament where Jesus is given the title the Son of God but scholars don t consider this to be an equivalent expression God the Son is rejected by anti trinitarians who view this reversal of the most common term for Christ as a doctrinal perversion and as tending towards tritheism br Matthew cites Jesus as saying Blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called sons of God The gospels go on to document a great deal of controversy over Jesus being the Son of God in a unique way The book of the Acts of the Apostles and the letters of the New Testament however record the early teaching of the first Christians those who believed Jesus to be both the Son of God the Messiah a man appointed by God as well as God himself This is evident in many places however the early part of the book of Hebrews addresses the issue in a deliberate sustained argument citing the scriptures of the Hebrew Bible as authorities For example the author quotes Psalm as addressed by the God of Israel to Jesus br br Hebrews About the Son he says Your throne O God will last for ever and ever br The author of Hebrews description of Jesus as the exact representation of the divine Father has parallels in a passage in Colossians br br Colossians in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form br John s gospel quotes Jesus at length regarding his relationship with his heavenly Father It also contains two famous attributions of divinity to Jesus br br John the Word was God in context the Word is Jesus see Christ the Logos br John Thomas said to him My Lord and my God br The most direct references to Jesus as God are found in various letters br br Romans Christ who is God over all br Titus our great God and Savior Jesus Christ br Peter our God and Savior Jesus Christ br The biblical basis for later trinitarian statements in creeds is the early baptism formula found in Matthew br br Matthew Go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name note the singular of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit See also Great Commission br br br Person of Christ br br Only divine br Docetism from the Greek verb to seem taught that Jesus was fully divine and his human body was only illusory At a very early stage various Docetic groups arose in particular the gnostic sects which flourished in the nd century AD tended to have Docetic theologies Docetic teachings were attacked by St Ignatius of Antioch early nd century and appear to be targeted in the canonical Epistles of John dates are disputed but range from the late st century among traditionalist scholars to the late nd century among critical scholars br The Council of Nicaea rejected theologies that entirely ruled out any humanity in Christ affirming in the Nicene Creed the doctrine of the Incarnation as a part of the doctrine of the Trinity That is that the second person of the Trinity became incarnate in the person Jesus and was fully human br br Only human br br The early centuries of Christian history also had groups at the other end of the spectrum arguing that Jesus was an ordinary mortal The Adoptionists taught that Jesus was born fully human and was adopted as God s Son when John the Baptist baptised him because of the life he lived Another group known as the Ebionites taught that Jesus was not God but the human Moshiach messiah anointed prophet promised in the Hebrew Bible br Some of these views could be described as Unitarianism although that is a modern term in their insistence on the oneness of God These views which directly affected how one understood the Godhead were declared heresies by the Council of Nicaea Throughout much of the rest of the ancient history of Christianity Christologies that denied Christ s divinity ceased to have a major impact on the life of the church br br How can he be both br br What sort of divinity br br Arianism affirmed that Jesus was divine but taught that he was nevertheless a created being there was a time when he was not in existence and was therefore less divine than God the Father The matter boiled down to one iota Arianism taught Homoiousia the belief that Jesus s divinity is similar to that of God the Father as opposed to Homoousia the belief that Jesus s divinity is the same as that of God the Father Arius opponents additionally included in the term Arianism the belief that Jesus s divinity is different from that of God the Father Heteroousia br Arianism was condemned by the Council of Nicea but remained popular in the northern and western provinces of the empire and continued to be the majority view of western Europe well into the th century Indeed even the Christian legend of Constantine s death bed baptism involves a bishop who in recorded history was an Arian br In the modern era a number of denominations have rejected the Nicene doctrine of the Trinity including the Christadelphians and the Jehovah s Witnesses br br What sort of amalgamation br The Christological debates following the Council of Nicaea sought to make sense of the interplay of the human and divine in the person of Christ while upholding the doctrine of the Trinity Apollinaris of Laodicea taught that in Jesus the divine component took the place of the human nous thinking not to be confused with thelis meaning intent This however was seen as a denial of Jesus s true humanity and the view was condemned at the First Council of Constantinople br Subsequently Nestorius of Constantinople initiated a view that effectively separated Jesus into two persons one divine and one human the mechanism of this combination is known as hypostases and contrasts with hypostasis the view that there is no separation Nestorius theology was deemed heretical at the First Council of Ephesus Though as seen by the writings of Babai the Great the Christology of the Church of the East is highly similar to that of Chalcedon many orthodox Christians particularly in the West consider this group to be the perpetuation of Nestorianism the modern Assyrian Church of the East has at times shunned this term as it implies acceptance of the entire theology of Nestorius br Various forms of Monophysitism taught that Christ only had one nature that the divine had either dissolved Eutychianism or that the divine joined with the human as one nature in the person of Christ Miaphysitism A notable monophysite theologian was Eutyches c Monophysitism was rejected as heresy at the Council of Chalcedon in which affirmed that Jesus Christ had two natures divine and human joined in one person in hypostatic union see Chalcedonian creed While Eutychianism was suppressed into oblivion by the Chalcedonians and Miaphysites the Miaphysite groups who dissented from the Chalcedonian formula have persisted as the Oriental Orthodox Church br As theologians continued to search for a compromise between the Chalcedonian definition and the Monophysites other Christologies developed that partially rejected the full humanity of Christ Monothelitism taught that in the one person of Jesus there were two natures but only a divine will Closely related to this is Monoenergism which held to the same doctrine as the Monothelites but with different terminology These positions were declared heresy by the Third Council of Constantinople the Sixth Ecumenical Council br br br Incarnation br br The Incarnation is the belief in Christianity that the second person in the Christian Godhead also known as God the Son or the Logos Word became flesh when he was miraculously conceived in the womb of the Virgin Mary The word Incarnate derives from Latin in in or into caro carnis flesh meaning to make into flesh or to become flesh The incarnation is a fundamental theological teaching of orthodox Nicene Christianity based on its understanding of the New Testament The incarnation represents the belief that Jesus who is the non created second hypostasis of the triune God took on a human body and nature and became both man and God In the Bible its clearest teaching is in John And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us br br In the Incarnation as traditionally defined the divine nature of the Son was joined but not mixed with human nature in one divine Person Jesus Christ who was both truly God and truly man The Incarnation is commemorated and celebrated each year at Christmas and also reference can be made to the Feast of the Annunciation different aspects of the mystery of the Incarnation are celebrated at Christmas and the Annunciation br This is central to the traditional faith held by most Christians Alternative views on the subject See Ebionites and the Gospel according to the Hebrews have been proposed throughout the centuries see below but all were rejected by mainstream Christian bodies br In recent decades an alternative doctrine known as Oneness has been espoused among various Pentecostal groups see below but has been rejected by the remainder of Christendom br br Description and development of the traditional doctrine br In the early Christian era there was considerable disagreement amongst Christians regarding the nature of Christ s Incarnation While all Christians believed that Jesus was indeed the Son of God the exact nature of his Sonship was contested together with the precise relationship of the Father Son and Holy Ghost referred to in the New Testament Though Jesus was clearly the Son what exactly did this mean Debate on this subject raged most especially during the first four centuries of Christianity involving Jewish Christians Gnostics followers of the Presbyter Arius of Alexandra and adherents of St Athanasius the Great among others br Eventually the Christian Church accepted the teaching of St Athanasius and his allies that Christ was the incarnation of the eternal second person of the Trinity who was fully God and fully a man simultaneously All divergent beliefs were defined as heresies This included Docetism which said that Jesus was a divine being that took on human appearance but not flesh Arianism which held that Christ was a created being and Nestorianism which maintained that the Son of God and the man Jesus shared the same body but retained two separate natures The Oneness belief held by certain modern Pentecostal churches is also seen as heretical by most mainstream Christian bodies br The most widely accepted the early Christian Church made definitions of the Incarnation and the nature of Jesus at the First Council of Nicaea in the Council of Ephesus in and the Council of Chalcedon in These councils declared that Jesus was both fully God begotten from but not created by the Father and fully man taking his flesh and human nature from the Virgin Mary These two natures human and divine were hypostatically united into the one personhood of Jesus Christ br br Fortuitous and Necessary Incarnation br The link between the Incarnation and the Atonement within systematic theological thought is complex Within traditional models of the Atonement such as Substitution Satisfaction or Christus Victor Christ must be Divine in order for the Sacrifice of the Cross to be efficacious for human sins to be removed or conquered In his work The Trinity and the Kingdom of God Jurgen Moltmann differentiated between what he called a fortuitous and a necessary Incarnation The latter gives a soteriological emphasis to the Incarnation the Son of God became a man so that he could save us from our sins The former on the other hand speaks of the Incarnation as a fulfilment of the Love of God of his desire to be present and living amidst humanity to walk in the garden with us br Moltmann favours fortuitous incarnation primarily because he feels that to speak of an incarnation of necessity is to do an injustice to the life of Christ Moltmann s work alongside other systematic theologians opens up avenues of liberation Christology br br br Hypostatic union br br In short this doctrine states that two natures one human and one divine are united in the one person of Christ The Council further taught that each of these natures the human and the divine was distinct and complete This view is sometimes called Dyophysite meaning two natures by those who rejected it br Hypostatic union from the Greek for substance is a technical term in Christian theology employed in mainstream Christology to describe the union of two natures humanity and divinity in Jesus Christ A brief definition of the doctrine of two natures can be given as Jesus Christ who is identical with the Son is one person and one hypostasis in two natures a human and a divine br The First Council of Ephesus recognised this doctrine and affirmed its importance stating that the humanity and divinity of Christ are made one according to nature and hypostasis in the Logos br The First Council of Nicaea declared that the Father and the Son are of the same substance and are co eternal This belief was expressed in the Nicene Creed br Apollinaris of Laodicea was the first to use the term hypostasis in trying to understand the Incarnation Apollinaris described the union of the divine and human in Christ as being of a single nature and having a single essence a single hypostasis br The Nestorian Theodore of Mopsuestia went in the other direction arguing that in Christ there were two natures dyophysite human and divine and two hypostases in the sense of essence or person that co existed br The Chalcedonian Creed agreed with Theodore that there were two natures in the Incarnation However the Council of Chalcedon also insisted that hypostasis be used as it was in the Trinitarian definition to indicate the person and not the nature as with Apollinarius br Thus the Council declared that in Christ there are two natures each retaining its own properties and together united in one subsistence and in one single person br As the precise nature of this union is held to defy finite human comprehension the hypostatic union is also referred to by the alternative term mystical union br The Oriental Orthodox Churches having rejected the Chalcedonian Creed were known as Monophysites because they would only accept a definition that characterized the incarnate Son as having one nature The Chalcedonian in two natures formula was seen as derived from and akin to a Nestorian Christology Contrariwise the Chalcedonians saw the Oriental Orthodox as tending towards Eutychian Monophysitism However the Oriental Orthodox have in modern ecumenical dialogue specified that they have never believed in the doctrines of Eutyches that they have always affirmed that Christ s humanity is consubstantial with our own and they thus prefer the term Miaphysite to refer to themselves a reference to Cyrillian Christology which used the phrase mia physis tou theou logou sesarkomene br In recent times leaders from the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches have signed joint statements in an attempt to work towards reunification br br br Other Christological concerns br The sinlessness of Christ br br Although Christian orthodoxy holds that Jesus was fully human the Epistle to the Hebrews for example states that Christ was holy and without evil The question concerning the sinlessness of Jesus Christ focuses on this seeming paradox Does being fully human require that one participate in the fall of Adam or could Jesus exist in an unfallen status as Adam and Eve did before the fall according to Genesis br br Kinds of sinlessness br Evangelical writer Donald Macleod suggests that the sinless nature of Jesus Christ involves two elements First Christ was free of actual sin Studying the gospels there is no reference to Jesus praying for the forgiveness of sin nor confessing sin The assertion is that Jesus did not commit sin nor could he be proven guilty of sin he had no vices In fact he is quoted as asking Can any of you prove me guilty of sin in John Secondly he was free from inherent sin original sin or ancestral sin br br Temptation of Christ br The temptation of Christ shown in the gospels affirms that he was tempted Indeed the temptations were genuine and of a greater intensity than normally experienced by human beings He experienced all the frail weaknesses of humanity Jesus was tempted through hunger and thirst pain and the love of his friends Thus the human weaknesses could engender temptation Nevertheless MacLeod notes that one crucial respect in which Christ was not like us is that he was not tempted by anything within himself br The temptations Christ faced focused upon his person and identity as the incarnate Son of God MacLeod writes Christ could be tempted through his sonship The temptation in the wilderness and again in Gethsemane exemplifies this arena of temptation Regarding the temptation of performing a sign that would affirm his sonship by throwing himself from the pinnacle of the temple MacLeod observes The sign was for himself a temptation to seek reassurance as if to say the real question is my own sonship I must forget all else and all others and all further service until that is clear MacLeod places this struggle in the context of the incarnation he has become a man and must accept not only the appearance but the reality br br Communication of attributes br The communion of attributes Communicatio idiomatum of Christ s divine and human natures is understood according to Chalcedonian theology to mean that they exist together with neither overriding the other That is both are preserved and coexist in one person Christ had all the properties of God and humanity God did not stop being God and become man Christ was not half God and half human The two natures did not mix into a new third kind of nature Although independent they acted in complete accord when one nature acted so did the other The natures did not commingle merge infuse each other or replace each other One was not converted into the other They remained distinct yet acted with one accord br br Virgin Birth br br The Gospel according to Matthew and Gospel according to Luke suggest a virgin birth of Jesus Christ Some now disregard or even argue against this doctrine to which most denominations of Christianity ascribe This section looks at the Christological issues surrounding belief or disbelief in the virgin birth br A non virgin birth would seem to require some form of adoptionism This is because a human conception and birth would seem to yield a fully human Jesus with some other mechanism required to make Jesus divine as well br A non virgin birth would seem to support the full humanity of Jesus William Barclay states The supreme problem of the virgin birth is that it does quite undeniably differentiate Jesus from all men it does leave us with an incomplete incarnation br Barth speaks of the virgin birth as the divine sign which accompanies and indicates the mystery of the incarnation of the Son br Donald MacLeod gives several Christological implications of a virgin birth br br Highlights salvation as a supernatural act of God rather than an act of human initiative br Avoids adoptionism which is virtually required if a normal birth br Reinforces the sinlessness of Christ especially as it relates to Christ being outside the sin of Adam original sin br Relationship of Persons br The discussion of whether the three distinct persons in the Godhead of the Trinity were of greater equal or lesser by comparison was also like many other areas of early Christology a subject of debate In Athenagoras of Athens c writings we find a very developed trinitarian doctrine On the one end of the spectrum was modalism a doctrine stating that the three persons of the Trinity were equal to the point of erasing their differences and distinctions On the other end of the spectrum were tritheism as well as some radically subordinationist views the latter of which emphasized the primacy of the Father of Creation to the deity of Christ and Jesus s authority over the Holy Spirit During the Council of Nicea the modalist bishops of Rome and Alexandria aligned politically with Athanasius whereas the bishops of Constantinople Nicomedia Antioch and Jerusalem sided with the subordinationists as middle ground between Arius and Athanasius br br br Approaches to Christology br Theologians like Jurgen Moltmann and Walter Kasper have characterized Christologies as anthropological or cosmological These are also termed Christology from below and Christology from above respectively An anthropological Christology starts with the human person of Jesus and works from his life and ministry toward what it means for him to be divine whereas a cosmological Christology works in the opposite direction Starting from the eternal Logos a cosmological Christology works toward his humanity Theologians typically begin on one side or the other and their choice inevitably colors their resultant Christology As a starting point these options represent diverse yet complementary approaches each poses its own difficulties Both Christologies from above and from below must come to terms with the two natures of Christ human and divine Just as light can be perceived as a wave or as a particle so Jesus must be thought in terms of both his divinity and humanity You cannot talk about either or but must talk about both and br br Cosmological approaches br Christologies from above start with the Logos the second Person of the Trinity establish his eternality his agency in creation and his economic Sonship Jesus s unity with God is established by the Incarnation as the divine Logos assumes a human nature This approach was common in the early church e g St Paul and St John in the Gospels The attribution of full humanity to Jesus is resolved by stating that the two natures mutually share their properties a concept termed communicatio idiomatum br br Anthropological approaches br Christologies from below start with the human being Jesus as the representative of the new humanity not with the pre existent Logos Jesus lives an exemplary life one to which we aspire in religious experience This form of Christology lends itself to mysticism and some of its roots go back to emergence of Christ mysticism in the th century East but in the West it flourished between the th and th centuries A recent theologian Wolfhart Pannenberg contends that the resurrected Jesus is the eschatological fulfillment of human destiny to live in nearness to God br br Political approaches br The Christian faith is inherently political because allegiance to Jesus as risen Lord relativises all earthly rule and authority Jesus is called Lord over times in Paul s epistles alone and is thus the principal confession of faith in the Pauline epistles Further N T Wright argues that this Pauline confession is the core of the gospel of salvation The Achilles heel of this approach is the loss of eschatological tension between this present age and the future divine rule that is yet to come This can happen when the state co opts Christ s authority as was often the case in imperial Christology Modern political Christologies seek to overcome imperialist ideologies br br br Works of Christ br Resurrection of Jesus br br The resurrection is perhaps the most controversial aspect of the life of Jesus Christ Christianity hinges on this point of Christology both as a response to a particular history and as a confessional response Some Christians claim that because he was resurrected the future of the world was forever altered Most Christians believe that Jesus s resurrection brings reconciliation with God II Corinthians the destruction of death I Corinthians and forgiveness of sins for followers of Jesus Christ br After Jesus had died and was buried the New Testament states that he appeared to others in bodily form Some skeptics say his appearances were only perceived by his followers in mind or spirit The gospels state that the disciples believed they witnessed Jesus s resurrected body and that led to the beginning of the faith They had previously hid in fear of persecution after Jesus s death After seeing Jesus they boldly proclaimed the message of Jesus Christ despite tremendous risk They obeyed Jesus s mandate to be reconciled to God through repentance Luke baptism and obedience Matthew br br Offices as Prophet Priest and King br Jesus Christ the Mediator of humankind fulfills the three offices of Prophet Priest and King Eusebius of the early church worked out this threefold classification which during the Reformation played a substantial role in scholastic Lutheran Christology and in John Calvin s and John Wesley s Christology br br br Pneumatology Holy Spirit br br Pneumatology is the study of the Holy Spirit Pneuma is Greek for breath which metaphorically describes a non material being or influence In Christian theology pneumatology refers to the study of the Holy Spirit In Christianity the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost is the Spirit of God Within mainstream Trinitarian Christian beliefs he is the third person of the Trinity As part of the Godhead the Holy Spirit is equal with God the Father and with God the Son The Christian theology of the Holy Spirit was the last piece of Trinitarian theology to be fully developed br Within mainstream Trinitarian Christianity the Holy Spirit is one of the three persons of the Trinity who make up the single substance of God As such the Holy Spirit is personal and as part of the Godhead he is fully God co equal and co eternal with God the Father and Son of God He is different from the Father and the Son in that he proceeds from the Father or from the Father and the Son as described in the Nicene Creed His sacredness is reflected in the New Testament gospels which proclaim blasphemy against the Holy Spirit as unforgivable br The English word comes from two Greek words pneuma spirit and logos teaching about Pneumatology would normally include study of the person of the Holy Spirit and the works of the Holy Spirit This latter category would normally include Christian teachings on new birth spiritual gifts charismata Spirit baptism sanctification the inspiration of prophets and the indwelling of the Holy Trinity which in itself covers many different aspects Different Christian denominations have different theological approaches br Christians believe that the Holy Spirit leads people to faith in Jesus and gives them the ability to live a Christian lifestyle The Holy Spirit dwells inside every Christian each one s body being his temple Jesus described the Holy Spirit as paracletus in Latin derived from Greek The word is variously translated as Comforter Counselor Teacher Advocate guiding people in the way of the truth The Holy Spirit s action in one s life is believed to produce positive results known as the Fruit of the Holy Spirit The Holy Spirit enables Christians who still experience the effects of sin to do things they never could do on their own These spiritual gifts are not innate abilities unlocked by the Holy Spirit but entirely new abilities such as the ability to cast out demons or simply bold speech Through the influence of the Holy Spirit a person sees more clearly the world around him or her and can use his or her mind and body in ways that exceed his or her previous capacity A list of gifts that may be bestowed include the charismatic gifts of prophecy tongues healing and knowledge Christians holding a view known as cessationism believe these gifts were given only in New Testament times Christians almost universally agree that certain spiritual gifts are still in effect today including the gifts of ministry teaching giving leadership and mercy The experience of the Holy Spirit is sometimes referred to as being anointed br After his resurrection Christ told his disciples that they would be baptized with the Holy Spirit and would receive power from this event a promise that was fulfilled in the events recounted in the second chapter of Acts On the first Pentecost Jesus s disciples were gathered in Jerusalem when a mighty wind was heard and tongues of fire appeared over their heads A multilingual crowd heard the disciples speaking and each of them heard them speaking in his or her native language br The Holy Spirit is believed to perform specific divine functions in the life of the Christian or the church These include br br Conviction of sin The Holy Spirit acts to convince the unredeemed person both of the sinfulness of their actions and of their moral standing as sinners before God br Bringing to conversion The action of the Holy Spirit is seen as an essential part of the bringing of the person to the Christian faith The new believer is born again of the Spirit br Enabling the Christian life The Holy Spirit is believed to dwell in the individual believers and enable them to live a righteous and faithful life br As a comforter or Paraclete one who intercedes or supports or acts as an advocate particularly in times of trial br Inspiration and interpretation of scripture The Holy Spirit both inspires the writing of the scriptures and interprets them to the Christian and church br The Holy Spirit is also believed to be active especially in the life of Jesus Christ enabling him to fulfill his work on earth Particular actions of the Holy Spirit include br br Cause of his birth According to the gospel accounts of the birth of Jesus the beginning of His incarnate existence was due to the Holy Spirit br Anointing him at his baptism br Empowerment of his ministry The ministry of Jesus following his baptism in which the Holy Spirit is described in the gospels as descending on Him like a dove is conducted in the power and at the direction of the Holy Spirit br Fruit of the Spirit br br Christians believe the Fruit of the Spirit consists of virtuous characteristics engendered in the Christian by the action of the Holy Spirit They are those listed in Galatians But the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self control The Roman Catholic Church adds to this list generosity modesty and chastity br br Gifts of the Spirit br br Christians believe that the Holy Spirit gives gifts to Christians These gifts consist of specific abilities granted to the individual Christian They are frequently known by the Greek word for gift Charisma from which the term charismatic derives The New Testament provides three different lists of such gifts which range from the supernatural healing prophecy tongues through those associated with specific callings teaching to those expected of all Christians in some degree faith Most consider these lists not to be exhaustive and other have compiled their own lists Saint Ambrose wrote of the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit poured out on a believer at baptism Spirit of Wisdom Spirit of Understanding Spirit of Counsel Spirit of Strength Spirit of Knowledge Spirit of Godliness Spirit of Holy Fear br It is over the nature and occurrence of these gifts particularly the supernatural gifts sometimes called charismatic gifts that the greatest disagreement between Christians with regard to the Holy Spirit exists br One view is that the supernatural gifts were a special dispensation for the apostolic ages bestowed because of the unique conditions of the church at that time and are extremely rarely bestowed in the present time This is the view of some in the Catholic Church and many other mainstream Christian groups The alternate view espoused mainly by Pentecostal denominations and the charismatic movement is that the absence of the supernatural gifts was due to the neglect of the Holy Spirit and his work by the church Although some small groups such as the Montanists practiced the supernatural gifts they were rare until the growth of the Pentecostal movement in the late th century br Believers in the relevance of the supernatural gifts sometimes speak of a Baptism of the Holy Spirit or Filling of the Holy Spirit which the Christian needs to experience in order to receive those gifts Many churches hold that the Baptism of the Holy Spirit is identical with conversion and that all Christians are by definition baptized in the Holy Spirit br br br Cosmology Things created br br And God said Let there be light and there was light And God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness And God called the light Day and the darkness he called Night And the evening and the morning were the first day br Genesis br The various authors of the Old and New Testament provide glimpses of their insight regarding cosmology The cosmos was created by God by divine command in the best known and most complete account in the Bible that of Genesis br br br World br br Within this broad understanding however there are a number of views regarding exactly how this doctrine ought to be interpreted br br Some Christians particularly Young and Old Earth creationists interpret Genesis as an accurate and literal account of creation br Others may understand these to be instead spiritual insights more vaguely defined br It is a tenet of Christian faith Catholic Eastern Orthodox and Protestant that God is the creator of all things from nothing and has made human beings in the Image of God who by direct inference is also the source of the human soul In Chalcedonian Christology Jesus is the Word of God which was in the beginning and thus is uncreated and hence is God and consequently identical with the Creator of the world ex nihilo br Roman Catholicism uses the phrase special creation to refer to the doctrine of immediate or special creation of each human soul In the International Theological Commission then under the presidency of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger published a paper in which it accepts the current scientific accounts of the history of the universe commencing in the Big Bang about billion years ago and of the evolution of all life on earth including humans from the micro organisms commencing about billion years ago The Roman Catholic Church allows for both a literal and allegorical interpretation of Genesis so as to allow for the possibility of Creation by means of an evolutionary process over great spans of time otherwise known as theistic evolution It believes that the creation of the world is a work of God through the Logos the Word idea intelligence reason and logic br br In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God all things were made through him and without him was not anything made that was made br The New Testament claims that God created everything by the eternal Word Jesus Christ his beloved Son In him br br all things were created in heaven and on earth all things were created through him and for him He is before all things and in him all things hold together br br br Anthropology Humanity br br Christian anthropology is the study of humanity especially as it relates to the divine This theological anthropology refers to the study of the human anthropology as it relates to God It differs from the social science of anthropology which primarily deals with the comparative study of the physical and social characteristics of humanity across times and places br One aspect studies the innate nature or constitution of the human known as the nature of mankind It is concerned with the relationship between notions such as body soul and spirit which together form a person based on their descriptions in the Bible There are three traditional views of the human constitution trichotomism dichotomism and monism in the sense of anthropology br br br Components br Soul br br The semantic domain of Biblical soul is based on the Hebrew word nepes which presumably means breath or breathing being This word never means an immortal soul or an incorporeal part of the human being that can survive death of the body as the spirit of dead This word usually designates the person as a whole or its physical life In the Septuagint nepes is mostly translated as psyche and exceptionally in the Book of Joshua as empneon that is breathing being br The New Testament follows the terminology of the Septuagint and thus uses the word psyche with the Hebrew semantic domain and not the Greek that is an invisible power or ever more for Platonists immortal and immaterial that gives life and motion to the body and is responsible for its attributes br In Patristic thought towards the end of the nd century psyche was understood in more a Greek than a Hebrew way and it was contrasted with the body In the rd century with the influence of Origen there was the establishing of the doctrine of the inherent immortality of the soul and its divine nature Origen also taught the transmigration of the souls and their preexistence but these views were officially rejected in in the Fifth Ecumenical Council Inherent immortality of the soul was accepted among western and eastern theologians throughout the middle ages and after the Reformation as evidenced by the Westminster Confession br br Spirit br The spirit Hebrew ruach Greek pneuma which can also mean breath is likewise an immaterial component It is often used interchangeably with soul psyche although trichotomists believe that the spirit is distinct from the soul br br When Paul speaks of the pneuma of man he does not mean some higher principle within him or some special intellectual or spiritual faculty of his but simply his self and the only questions is whether the self is regarded in some particular aspect when it is called pneuma In the first place it apparently is regarded in the same way as when it is called psyche viz as the self that lives in man s attitude in the orientation of his will br Body Flesh br The body Greek soma is the corporeal or physical aspect of a human being Christians have traditionally believed that the body will be resurrected at the end of the age br Flesh Greek sarx is usually considered synonymous with body referring to the corporeal aspect of a human being The apostle Paul contrasts flesh and spirit in Romans br br br Origin of humanity br br The Bible teaches in the book of Genesis the humans were created by God Some Christians believe that this must have involved a miraculous creative act while others are comfortable with the idea that God worked through the evolutionary process br The book of Genesis also teaches that human beings male and female were created in the image of God The exact meaning of this has been debated throughout church history br br br Death and afterlife br br Christian anthropology has implications for beliefs about death and the afterlife The Christian church has traditionally taught that the soul of each individual separates from the body at death to be reunited at the resurrection This is closely related to the doctrine of the immortality of the soul For example the Westminster Confession chapter XXXII states br br The bodies of men after death return to dust and see corruption but their souls which neither die nor sleep having an immortal subsistence immediately return to God who gave them br Intermediate state br br The question then arises where exactly does the disembodied soul go at death Theologians refer to this subject as the intermediate state The Old Testament speaks of a place called sheol where the spirits of the dead reside In the New Testament hades the classical Greek realm of the dead takes the place of sheol In particular Jesus teaches in Luke Lazarus and Dives that hades consists of two separate sections one for the righteous and one for the unrighteous His teaching is consistent with intertestamental Jewish thought on the subject br Fully developed Christian theology goes a step further on the basis of such texts as Luke and Philippians it has traditionally been taught that the souls of the dead are received immediately either into heaven or hell where they will experience a foretaste of their eternal destiny prior to the resurrection Roman Catholicism teaches a third possible location Purgatory though this is denied by Protestants and Eastern Orthodox br br the souls of the righteous being then made perfect in holiness are received into the highest heavens where they behold the face of God in light and glory waiting for the full redemption of their bodies And the souls of the wicked are cast into hell where they remain in torments and utter darkness reserved to the judgment of the great day Westminster Confession br Some Christian groups which stress a monistic anthropology deny that the soul can exist consciously apart from the body For example the Seventh day Adventist Church teaches that the intermediate state is an unconscious sleep this teaching is informally known as soul sleep br br Final state br In Christian belief both the righteous and the unrighteous will be resurrected at the last judgment The righteous will receive incorruptible immortal bodies Corinthians while the unrighteous will be sent to hell Traditionally Christians have believed that hell will be a place of eternal physical and psychological punishment In the last two centuries annihilationism has become popular br br br Mariology br br The study of the Blessed Virgin Mary doctrines about her and how she relates to the Church Christ and the individual Christian is called Mariology Catholic Mariology is the Marian study specifically in the context of the Catholic Church Examples of Mariology include the study of and doctrines regarding her Perpetual Virginity her Motherhood of God and by extension her Motherhood Intercession for all Christians her Immaculate Conception and her Assumption into heaven br br br Angelology br br Most descriptions of angels in the Bible describe them in military terms For example in terms such as encampment Gen command structure Ps Matt Rev and combat Jdg Job Rev br Its specific hierarchy differs slightly from the Hierarchy of Angels as it surrounds more military services whereas the Hierarchy of angels is a division of angels into non military services to God br br br Members of the heavenly host br br Cherubim are depicted as accompanying God s chariot throne Ps Exodus refers to two Cherub statues placed on top of the Ark of the Covenant the two cherubim are usually interpreted as guarding the throne of God Other guard like duties include being posted in locations such as the gates of Eden Gen Cherubim were mythological winged bulls or other beasts that were part of ancient Near Eastern traditions br br This angelic designation might be given to angels of various ranks An example would be Raphael who is ranked variously as a Seraph Cherub and Archangel This is usually a result of conflicting schemes of hierarchies of angels br br It is not known how many angels there are but one figure given in Revelation for the number of many angels in a circle around the throne as well as the living creatures and the elders was ten thousand times ten thousand which would be million br br br Demonology Fallen angels br br In most of Christianity a fallen angel is an angel who has been exiled or banished from Heaven Often such banishment is a punishment for disobeying or rebelling against God see War in Heaven The best known fallen angel is Lucifer Lucifer is a name frequently given to Satan in Christian belief This usage stems from a particular interpretation as a reference to a fallen angel of a passage in the Bible Isaiah that speaks of someone who is given the name of Day Star or Morning Star in Latin Lucifer as fallen from heaven The Greek etymological synonym of Lucifer Phosphoros light bearer is used of the morning star in Peter and elsewhere with no reference to Satan But Satan is called Lucifer in many writings later than the Bible notably in Milton s Paradise Lost among others because according to Milton Satan was brighter once amidst the host of Angels than that star the stars among br Allegedly fallen angels are those which have committed one of the seven deadly sins Therefore are banished from heaven and suffer in hell for all eternity Demons from hell would punish the fallen angel by ripping out their wings as a sign of insignificance and low rank br br br Heaven br br Christianity has taught Heaven as a place of eternal life in that it is a shared plane to be attained by all the elect rather than an abstract experience related to individual concepts of the ideal The Christian Church has been divided over how people gain this eternal life From the th to the late th century Christendom was divided between the Catholic view the Eastern Orthodox view the Coptic view the Jacobite view the Abyssinian view and Protestant views See also Christian denominations br Heaven is the English name for a transcendental realm wherein human beings who have transcended human living live in an afterlife in the Bible and in English the term heaven may refer to the physical heavens the sky or the seemingly endless expanse of the universe beyond the traditional literal meaning of the term in English br Christianity maintains that entry into Heaven awaits such time as When the form of this world has passed away JPII One view expressed in the Bible is that on the day Christ returns the righteous dead are resurrected first and then those who are alive and judged righteous will be brought up to join them to be taken to heaven I Thess br Two related and often confused concepts of heaven in Christianity are better described as the resurrection of the body which is exclusively of biblical origin as contrasted with the immortality of the soul which is also evident in the Greek tradition In the first concept the soul does not enter heaven until the last judgement or the end of time when it along with the body is resurrected and judged In the second concept the soul goes to a heaven on another plane such as the intermediate state immediately after death These two concepts are generally combined in the doctrine of the double judgement where the soul is judged once at death and goes to a temporary heaven while awaiting a second and final physical judgement at the end of the world JPII also see eschatology afterlife br One popular medieval view of Heaven was that it existed as a physical place above the clouds and that God and the Angels were physically above watching over man Heaven as a physical place survived in the concept that it was located far out into space and that the stars were lights shining through from heaven br Many of today s biblical scholars such as N T Wright in tracing the concept of Heaven back to its Jewish roots see Earth and Heaven as overlapping or interlocking Heaven is known as God s space his dimension and is not a place that can be reached by human technology This belief states that Heaven is where God lives and reigns whilst being active and working alongside people on Earth One day when God restores all things Heaven and Earth will be forever combined into the New Heavens and New Earth of the World to Come br br Religions that teach about heaven differ on how and if one gets into it typically in the afterlife In most entrance to Heaven is conditional on having lived a good life within the terms of the spiritual system A notable exception to this is the sola fide belief of many mainstream Protestants which teaches that one does not have to live a perfectly good life but that one must accept Jesus Christ as one s Lord and Saviour and then Jesus Christ will assume the guilt of one s sins believers are believed to be forgiven regardless of any good or bad works one has participated in br Many religions state that those who do not go to heaven will go to a place without the presence of God Hell which is eternal see annihilationism Some religions believe that other afterlives exist in addition to Heaven and Hell such as Purgatory One belief universalism believes that everyone will go to Heaven eventually no matter what they have done or believed on earth Some forms of Christianity believe Hell to be the termination of the soul br Various saints have had visions of heaven Corinthians The Eastern Orthodox concept of life in heaven is described in one of the prayers for the dead a place of light a place of green pasture a place of repose whence all sickness sorrow and sighing are fled away br The Church bases its belief in Heaven on some main biblical passages in the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures Old and New Testaments and collected church wisdom Heaven is the Realm of the Blessed Trinity the angels and the saints br The essential joy of heaven is called the beatific vision which is derived from the vision of God s essence The soul rests perfectly in God and does not or cannot desire anything else than God After the Last Judgment when the soul is reunited with its body the body participates in the happiness of the soul It becomes incorruptible glorious and perfect Any physical defects the body may have laboured under are erased Heaven is also known as paradise in some cases The Great Gulf separates heaven from hell br Upon dying each soul goes to what is called the particular judgement where its own afterlife is decided i e Heaven after Purgatory straight to Heaven or Hell This is different from the general judgement also known as the Last judgement which will occur when Christ returns to judge all the living and the dead br The term Heaven which differs from The Kingdom of Heaven see note below is applied by the biblical authors to the realm in which God currently resides Eternal life by contrast occurs in a renewed unspoilt and perfect creation which can be termed Heaven since God will choose to dwell there permanently with his people as seen in Revelation There will no longer be any separation between God and man The believers themselves will exist in incorruptible resurrected and new bodies there will be no sickness no death and no tears Some teach that death itself is not a natural part of life but was allowed to happen after Adam and Eve disobeyed God see original sin so that mankind would not live forever in a state of sin and thus a state of separation from God br Many evangelicals understand this future life to be divided into two distinct periods first the Millennial Reign of Christ the one thousand years on this earth referred to in Revelation secondly the New Heavens and New Earth referred to in Revelation and This millennialism or chiliasm is a revival of a strong tradition in the Early Church that was dismissed by Saint Augustine of Hippo and the Roman Catholic Church after him br Not only will the believers spend eternity with God they will also spend it with each other John s vision recorded in Revelation describes a New Jerusalem which comes from Heaven to the New Earth which is seen to be a symbolic reference to the people of God living in community with one another Heaven will be the place where life will be lived to the full in the way that the designer planned each believer loving the Lord their God with all their heart and with all their soul and with all their mind and loving their neighbour as themselves adapted from Matthew the Great Commandment a place of great joy without the negative aspects of earthly life See also World to Come br br Purgatory br Purgatory is the condition or temporary punishment in which it is believed the souls of those who die in a state of grace are made ready for Heaven This is a theological idea that has ancient roots and is well attested in early Christian literature while the poetic conception of purgatory as a geographically situated place is largely the creation of medieval Christian piety and imagination br The notion of purgatory is associated particularly with the Latin Church of the Catholic Church in the Eastern Catholic Churches it is a doctrine though often without using the name Purgatory Anglicans of the Anglo Catholic tradition generally also hold to the belief John Wesley the founder of Methodism believed in an intermediate state between death and the final judgment and in the possibility of continuing to grow in holiness there The Eastern Orthodox Churches believe in the possibility of a change of situation for the souls of the dead through the prayers of the living and the offering of the Divine Liturgy and many Eastern Orthodox especially among ascetics hope and pray for a general apocatastasis A similar belief in at least the possibility of a final salvation for all is held by Mormonism Judaism also believes in the possibility of after death purification and may even use the word purgatory to present its understanding of the meaning of Gehenna However the concept of soul purification may be explicitly denied in these other faith traditions br br br Hell br br Hell in Christian beliefs is a place or a state in which the souls of the unsaved will suffer the consequences of sin The Christian doctrine of Hell derives from the teaching of the New Testament where Hell is typically described using the Greek words Gehenna or Tartarus Unlike Hades Sheol or Purgatory it is eternal and those damned to Hell are without hope In the New Testament it is described as the place or state of punishment after death or last judgment for those who have rejected Jesus In many classical and popular depictions it is also the abode of Satan and of Demons Such is not the case in the Book of Revelation where Satan is thrown into Hell only at the end of Christ s millenium long reign on this Earth br Hell is generally defined as the eternal fate of unrepentant sinners after this life Hell s character is inferred from biblical teaching which has often been understood literally Souls are said to pass into Hell by God s irrevocable judgment either immediately after death particular judgment or in the general judgment Modern theologians generally describe Hell as the logical consequence of the soul using its free will to reject the will of God It is considered compatible with God s justice and mercy because God will not interfere with the soul s free choice br Only in the King James Version of the bible is the word Hell used to translate certain words such as sheol Hebrew and both hades and Gehenna Greek All other translations reserve Hell only for use when Gehenna is mentioned It is generally agreed that both sheol and hades do not typically refer to the place of eternal punishment but to the underworld or temporary abode of the dead br Traditionally the majority of Protestants have held that Hell will be a place of unending conscious torment both physical and spiritual although some recent writers such as C S Lewis and J P Moreland have cast Hell in terms of eternal separation from God Certain biblical texts have led some theologians to the conclusion that punishment in Hell though eternal and irrevocable will be proportional to the deeds of each soul e g Matthew Luke br Another area of debate is the fate of the unevangelized i e those who have never had an opportunity to hear the Christian gospel those who die in infancy and mentally disabled people Some Protestants agree with Augustine that people in these categories will be damned to Hell for original sin while others believe that God will make an exception in these cases br A significant minority believe in the doctrine of conditional immortality which teaches that those sent to Hell will not experience eternal conscious punishment but instead will be extinguished or annihilated after a period of limited conscious punishment Prominent evangelical theologians who have adopted conditionalist beliefs include John Wenham Edward Fudge Clark Pinnock and John Stott although the latter has described himself as an agnostic on the issue of annihilationism Conditionalists typically reject the traditional concept of the immortality of the soul br Some Protestants such as George MacDonald Karl Randall Keith DeRose and Thomas Talbott also however in a minority believe that after serving their sentence in Gehenna all souls are reconciled to God and admitted to heaven or ways are found at the time of death of drawing all souls to repentance so that no hellish suffering is experienced This view is often called Christian universalism its conservative branch is more specifically called Biblical or Trinitarian Universalism and is not to be confused with Unitarian Universalism See universal reconciliation apocatastasis and the problem of Hell br br br Theodicy Allowance of evil br br Theodicy can be said to be defense of God s goodness and omnipotence in view of the existence of evil Specifically Theodicy is a specific branch of theology and philosophy which attempts to reconcile belief in God with the perceived existence of evil As such theodicy can be said to attempt to justify the behaviour of God at least insofar as God allows evil br Responses to the problem of evil have sometimes been classified as defenses or theodicies However authors disagree on the exact definitions Generally a defense attempts to show that there is no logical incompatibility between the existence of evil and the existence of God A defense need not argue that this is a probable or plausible explanation only that the defense is logically possible A defense attempts to answer the logical problem of evil br A theodicy on the other hand is a more ambitious attempt to provide a plausible justification for the existence of evil A theodicy attempts to answer the evidential problem of evil Richard Swinburne maintains that it does not make sense to assume there are greater goods unless we know what they are i e we have a successful theodicy br As an example some authors see arguments including demons or the fall of man as not logically impossible but not very plausible considering our knowledge about the world Thus they are seen as defenses but not good theodicies C S Lewis writes in his book The Problem of Pain br br We can perhaps conceive of a world in which God corrected the results of this abuse of free will by His creatures at every moment so that a wooden beam became soft as grass when it was used as a weapon and the air refused to obey me if I attempted to set up in it the sound waves that carry lies or insults But such a world would be one in which wrong actions were impossible and in which therefore freedom of the will would be void nay if the principle were carried out to its logical conclusion evil thoughts would be impossible for the cerebral matter which we use in thinking would refuse its task when we attempted to frame them br Another possible answer is that the world is corrupted due to the sin of mankind Some answer that because of sin the world has fallen from the grace of God and is not perfect Therefore evils and imperfections persist because the world is fallen William A Dembski argues that the effects of Adam s sin recorded in the Book of Genesis were back dated by God and hence applied to the earlier history of the universe br Evil is sometimes seen as a test or trial for humans Irenaeus of Lyons and more recently John Hick have argued that evil and suffering are necessary for spiritual growth This is often combined with the free will argument by arguing that such spiritual growth requires free will decisions A problem with this is that many evils do not seem to cause any kind of spiritual growth or even permit it as when a child is abused from birth and becomes seemingly inevitably a brutal adult br The problem of evil is often phrased in the form Why do bad things happen to good people Christianity teach that all people are inherently sinful due to the fall of man and original sin for example Calvinist theology follows a doctrine called federal headship which argues that the first man Adam was the legal representative of the entire human race A counterargument to the basic version of this principle is that an omniscient God would have predicted this when he created the world and an omnipotent God could have prevented it br The Book of Isaiah clearly claims that God is the source of at least some natural disasters but Isaiah doesn t attempt to explain the motivation behind the creation of evil In contrast the Book of Job is one of the most widely known formulations of the problem of evil in Western thought In it Satan challenges God regarding his servant Job claiming that Job only serves God for the blessings and protection that he receives from him God allows Satan to plague Job and his family in a number of ways with the limitation that Satan may not take Job s life but his children are killed Job discusses this with three friends and questions God regarding his suffering which he finds to be unjust God responds in a speech and then more than restores Job s prior health wealth and gives him new children br Bart D Ehrman argues that different parts of the Bible give different answers One example is evil as punishment for sin or as a consequence of sin Ehrman writes that this seems to be based on some notion of free will although this argument is never explicitly mentioned in the Bible Another argument is that suffering ultimately achieves a greater good possibly for persons other than the sufferer that would not have been possible otherwise The Book of Job offers two different answers suffering is a test and you will be rewarded later for passing it another that God in his might chooses not to reveal his reasons Ecclesiastes sees suffering as beyond human abilities to comprehend Apocalyptic parts including the New Testament see suffering as due to cosmic evil forces that God for mysterious reasons has given power over the world but which will soon be defeated and things will be set right br br br Hamartiology Sin br br The Greek word in the New Testament that is translated in English as sin is hamartia which literally means missing the target John states Everyone who sins breaks the law in fact sin is lawlessness Jesus clarified the law by defining its foundation Jesus replied Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind This is the first and greatest commandment And the second is like it Love your neighbor as yourself All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments Matthew br Hamartiology Greek hamartia missing the mark sin logia sayings or discourse is the branch of Christian theology more specifically systematic theology which is the study of sin with a view to articulating a doctrine of it br Substantial branches of hamartiological understanding subscribe to the doctrine of original sin which was taught by the Apostle Paul in Romans and popularized by Saint Augustine Augustine taught that all the descendants of Adam and Eve are guilty of Adam s sin without their own personal choice br In contrast Pelagius argued that humans enter life as essentially tabulae rasae The fall that occurred when Adam and Eve disobeyed God was held by his group to have affected humankind only minimally But few theologians continue to hold this hamartiological viewpoint br A third branch of thinking takes an intermediate position arguing that after the fall of Adam and Eve humans are born impacted by sin such that they have very decided tendencies toward sinning which by personal choice all accountable humans but Jesus soon choose to indulge br The degree to which a Christian believes humanity is impacted by either a literal or metaphorical fall determines their understanding of related theological concepts like salvation justification and sanctification br Christian views on sin are mostly understood as legal infraction or contract violation and so salvation tends to be viewed in legal terms similar to Jewish thinking br br br Sin br br In religion sin is the concept of acts that violate a rule of God The term sin may also refer to the state of having committed such a violation Commonly the moral code of conduct is decreed by a divine entity i e Divine law br Sin is often used to mean an action that is prohibited or considered wrong in some religions notably some sects of Christianity sin can refer not only to physical actions taken but also to thoughts and internalized motivations and feelings Colloquially any thought word or act considered immoral shameful harmful or alienating might be termed sinful br An elementary concept of sin regards such acts and elements of Earthly living that one cannot take with them into transcendental living Food for example is not of transcendental living and therefore its excessive savoring is considered a sin A more developed concept of sin deals with a distinction between sins of death mortal sin and the sins of human living venial sin In that context mortal sins are said to have the dire consequence of mortal penalty while sins of living food casual or informal sexuality play inebriation may be regarded as essential spice for transcendental living even though these may be destructive in the context of human living obesity infidelity br Common ideas surrounding sin in various religions include br br Punishment for sins from other people from God either in life or in afterlife or from the Universe in general br The question of whether an act must be intentional to be sinful br The idea that one s conscience should produce guilt for a conscious act of sin br A scheme for determining the seriousness of the sin br Repentance from expressing regret for and determining not to commit sin and atonement repayment for past deeds br The possibility of forgiveness of sins often through communication with a deity or intermediary in Christianity often referred to as salvation Crime and justice are related secular concepts br In Western Christianity sin is lawlessness John and so salvation tends to be understood in legal terms similar to Jewish law Sin alienates the sinner from God It has damaged and completely severed the relationship of humanity to God That relationship can only be restored through acceptance of Jesus Christ and his death on the cross as a sacrifice for mankind s sin see Salvation and Substitutionary atonement br In Eastern Christianity sin is viewed in terms of its effects on relationships both among people and between people and God Sin is seen as the refusal to follow God s plan and the desire to be like God and thus in direct opposition to him see the account of Adam and Eve in the Book of Genesis To sin is to want control of one s destiny in opposition to the will of God br to do some rigid beliefs br In the Russian variant of Eastern Orthodox Christianity sin sometimes is regarded as any mistake made by people in their life From this point of view every person is sinful because every person makes mistakes during his life When person accuses others in sins he always must remember that he is also sinner and so he must have mercy for others remembering that God is also merciful to him and to all humanity br br br Fall of man br br The fall of man or simply the fall refers in Christian doctrine to the transition of the first humans from a state of innocent obedience to God to a state of guilty disobedience to God In the Book of Genesis chapter Adam and Eve live at first with God in a paradise but are then deceived or tempted by the serpent to eat fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil which had been forbidden to them by God After doing so they become ashamed of their nakedness and God consequently expelled them from paradise The fall is not mentioned by name in the Bible but the story of disobedience and expulsion is recounted in both Testaments in different ways The Fall can refer to the wider theological inferences for all humankind as a consequence of Eve and Adam s original sin Examples include the teachings of Paul in Romans and Cor br Some Christian denominations believe the fall corrupted the entire natural world including human nature causing people to be born into original sin a state from which they cannot attain eternal life without the gracious intervention of God Protestants hold that Jesus death was a ransom by which humanity was offered freedom from the sin acquired at the fall In other religions such as Judaism Islam and Gnosticism the term the fall is not recognized and varying interpretations of the Eden narrative are presented br Christianity interprets the fall in a number of ways Traditional Christian theology accepts the teaching of St Paul in his letter to the Romans For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God and of St John s Gospel that God so loved the world that he sent his only son Jesus Christ that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life br The doctrine of original sin as articulated by Augustine of Hippo s interpretation of Paul of Tarsus provides that the fall caused a fundamental change in human nature so that all descendants of Adam are born in sin and can only be redeemed by divine grace Sacrifice was the only means by which humanity could be redeemed after the fall Jesus who was without sin died on the cross as the ultimate redemption for the sin of humankind br br br Original sin br br Thus the moment Adam and Eve ate the fruit from the tree which God had commanded them not to do sinful death was born it was an act of disobedience thinking they could become like gods that was the sin Since Adam was the head of the human race he is held responsible for the evil that took place for which reason the fall of man is referred to as the sin of Adam This sin caused Adam and his descendants to lose unrestricted access to God Himself The years of life were limited Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned Romans In Christian theology the death of Jesus on the cross is the atonement to the sin of Adam For as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive Corinthians As a result of that act of Christ all who put their trust in Christ alone now have unrestricted access to God through prayer and in presence br Original sin which Eastern Christians usually refer to as ancestral sin is according to a doctrine proposed in Christian theology humanity s state of sin resulting from the fall of man This condition has been characterized in many ways ranging from something as insignificant as a slight deficiency or a tendency toward sin yet without collective guilt referred to as a sin nature to something as drastic as total depravity or automatic guilt by all humans through collective guilt br Those who uphold the doctrine look to the teaching of Paul the Apostle in Romans and Corinthians for its scriptural base and see it as perhaps implied in Old Testament passages such as Psalm and Psalm br br The Apostolic Fathers and the Apologists mostly dealt with topics other than original sin The doctrine of original sin was first developed in nd century Bishop of Lyon Irenaeus s struggle against Gnosticism The Greek Fathers emphasized the cosmic dimension of the fall namely that since Adam human beings are born into a fallen world but held fast to belief that man though fallen is free It was in the West that precise definition of the doctrine arose br Augustine of Hippo taught that original sin was both an act of foolishness insipientia and of pride and disobedience to the God of Adam and Eve He thought it was a most subtle job to discern what came first self centeredness or failure in seeing truth The sin would not have taken place if satan hadn t sown into their senses the root of evil radix Mali The sin of Adam and Eve wounded their nature affecting human intelligence and will as well as affections and desires including sexual desire The consequences of the fall were transmitted to their descendants in the form of concupiscence which is a metaphysical term and not a psychological one Thomas Aquinas explained Augustine s doctrine pointing out that the libido concupiscence which makes the original sin pass from parents to children is not a libido actualis i e sexual lust but libido habitualis i e a wound of the whole of human nature Augustine insisted that concupiscence was not a being but bad quality the privation of good or a wound The bishop of Hippo admitted that sexual concupiscence libido might have been present in the perfect human nature in the paradise and that only later it had become disobedient to human will as a result of the first couple s disobedience to God s will in the original sin The original sin have made humanity a massa damnata mass of perdition condemned crowd In Augustine s view termed Realism all of humanity was really present in Adam when he sinned and therefore all have sinned Original sin according to Augustine consists of the guilt of Adam which all humans inherit As sinners humans are utterly depraved in nature lack the freedom to do good and cannot respond to the will of God without divine grace Grace is irresistible results in conversion and leads to perseverance br Augustine s formulation of original sin was popular among Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther and John Calvin and also within Roman Catholicism in the Jansenist movement but this movement was declared heretical by the Catholic Church There are wide ranging disagreements among Christian groups as to the exact understanding of the doctrine about a state of sinfulness or absence of holiness affecting all humans even children with some Christian groups denying it altogether br The notion of original sin as interpreted by Augustine of Hippo was affirmed by the Protestant Reformer John Calvin Calvin believed that humans inherit Adamic guilt and are in a state of sin from the moment of conception This inherently sinful nature the basis for the Calvinistic doctrine of total depravity results in a complete alienation from God and the total inability of humans to achieve reconciliation with God based on their own abilities Not only do individuals inherit a sinful nature due to Adam s fall but since he was the federal head and representative of the human race all whom he represented inherit the guilt of his sin by imputation br br New Testament br The scriptural basis for the doctrine is found in two New Testament books by Paul the Apostle Romans and Corinthians in which he identifies Adam as the one man through whom death came into the world br br br Total depravity br br Total depravity also called absolute inability and total corruption is a theological doctrine that derives from the Augustinian concept of original sin It is the teaching that as a consequence of the fall of man every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of sin and apart from the efficacious or prevenient grace of God is utterly unable to choose to follow God or choose to accept salvation as it is freely offered br It is also advocated to various degrees by many Protestant confessions of faith and catechisms including those of Lutheranism Arminianism and Calvinism br Total depravity is the fallen state of man as a result of original sin The doctrine of total depravity asserts that people are by nature not inclined or even able to love God wholly with heart mind and strength but rather all are inclined by nature to serve their own will and desires and to reject the rule of God Even religion and philanthropy are wicked to God to the extent that these originate from a human imagination passion and will and are not done to the glory of God Therefore in Reformed theology if God is to save anyone He must predestine call elect individuals to salvation since fallen man does not want to indeed is incapable of choosing God br Total depravity does not mean however that people are as evil as possible Rather it means that even the good which a person may intend is faulty in its premise false in its motive and weak in its implementation and there is no mere refinement of natural capacities that can correct this condition Thus even acts of generosity and altruism are in fact egoist acts in disguise All good consequently is derived from God alone and in no way through man br br br Comparison among Protestants br This table summarizes three Protestant beliefs on depravity br br br Soteriology Salvation br br Christian soteriology is the branch of Christian theology that deals with one s salvation It is derived from the Greek s t rion salvation from s t r savior preserver English logy br Atonement is a doctrine that describes how human beings can be reconciled to God In Christian theology the atonement refers to the forgiving or pardoning of one s sin through the death of Jesus Christ by crucifixion which made possible the reconciliation between God and creation Within Christianity there are three main theories for how such atonement might work the ransom theory the satisfaction theory and the moral influence theory Christian soteriology is unlike and not to be confused with collective salvation br br br Traditional focus br Christian soteriology traditionally focuses on how God ends the separation people have from him due to sin by reconciling them with himself Rom Many Christians believe they receive the forgiveness of sins Acts life Rom and salvation Thess bought by Jesus through his innocent suffering death and resurrection from the dead three days later Matt br Christ s death resurrection ascension and sending of the Holy Spirit is called The Paschal Mystery Christ s human birth is called the Incarnation Either or both are considered in different versions of soteriology br While not neglecting the Paschal Mystery many Christians believe salvation is brought through the Incarnation itself in which God took on human nature so that humans could partake in the divine nature Peter As St Athanasius put it God became human so that we might become divine St Athanasius De inc PG B This grace in Christ Cor is received as a gift of God that cannot be merited by works done prior to one s conversion to Christianity Eph which is brought about by hearing God s Word Rom and harkening to it This involves accepting Jesus Christ as the personal saviour and Lord over one s life br br br Distinct schools br Protestant teaching originating with Martin Luther teaches that salvation is received by grace alone and that one s sole necessary response to this grace is faith alone Older Christian teaching as found in Catholic and Orthodox theology is that salvation is received by grace alone but that one s necessary response to this grace comprises both faith and works James Rom Gal br br br Catholic soteriology br Human beings exists because God wanted to share His life with them In this sense every human being is God s child In a fuller sense to come to salvation is to be reconciled to God through Christ and to be united with His divine Essence via Theosis in the beatific vision of the Godhead The graces of Christ s passion death and resurrection are found in the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church br br br Comparison among Protestants br br br Ecclesiology Church br Ecclesiology from Greek ekkl si congregation church and logia is the study of the theological understanding of the Christian church including the institutional structure sacraments and practices especially the worship of God thereof Specific areas of concern include the church s role in salvation its origin its relationship to the historical Christ its discipline its destiny and its leadership Ecclesiology is therefore the study of the church as a thing in and of itself br Different ecclesiologies give shape to very different institutions Thus in addition to describing a broad discipline of theology ecclesiology may be used in the specific sense of a particular church or denomination s character self described or otherwise This is the sense of the word in such phrases as Roman Catholic ecclesiology Lutheran ecclesiology and ecumenical ecclesiology br br Issues addressed by ecclesiology br Ecclesiology asks the questions br br Who is the Church Is it a visible or earthly corporation or a unified visible society a church in the sense of a specific denomination or institution for instance Or is it the body of all believing Christians see invisible church regardless of their denominational differences and disunity What is the relationship between living Christians and departed Christians the cloud of witnesses do they those on Earth and those in Heaven constitute together the Church br Must one join a church That is what is the role of corporate worship in the spiritual lives of believers Is it in fact necessary Can salvation be found outside of formal membership in a given faith community and what constitutes membership Baptism Formal acceptance of a creed Regular participation br What is the authority of the Church Who gets to interpret the doctrines of the Church Is the organizational structure itself either in a single corporate body or generally within the range of formal church structures an independent vehicle of revelation or of God s grace Or is the Church s authority instead dependent on and derivative of a separate and prior divine revelation external to the organization with individual institutions being the Church only to the extent that they teach this message For example is the Bible a written part of a wider revelation entrusted to the Church as faith community and therefore to be interpreted within that context Or is the Bible the revelation itself and the Church is to be defined as a group of people who claim adherence to it br What does the Church do What are the sacraments divine ordinances and liturgies in the context of the Church and are they part of the Church s mission to preach the Gospel What is the comparative emphasis and relationship between worship service spiritual formation and mission and is the Church s role to create disciples of Christ or some other function Is the Eucharist the defining element of the rest of the sacramental system and the Church itself or is it secondary to the act of preaching Is the Church to be understood as the vehicle for salvation or the salvific presence in the world or as a community of those already saved br How should the Church be governed What was the mission and authority of the Apostles and is this handed down through the sacraments today What are the proper methods of choosing clergy such as bishops and priests and what is their role within the context of the Church Is an ordained clergy necessary Who are the leaders of a church Must there be a policy making board of leaders within a church and what are the qualifications for this position and by what process do these members become official ordained leaders Must leaders and clergy be ordained and is this possible only by those who have been ordained by others br br br Ecclesiastical polity br br Ecclesiastical polity is the operational and governance structure of a church or Christian denomination It also denotes the ministerial structure of the church and the authority relationships between churches Polity is closely related to Ecclesiology the study of doctrine and theology relating to church organization br Issues of church governance appear in the first chapters of the Acts of the Apostles the first act recorded after the ascension is the election of Matthias to replace Judas Iscariot Over the years a system of episcopal polity developed br During the Protestant Reformation arguments were made that the New Testament prescribed structures quite different from that of the Catholic Church of the day and different Protestant bodies used different types of polity It was during this period that Richard Hooker wrote Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity to defend the polity of the Church of England against the Puritans br Episcopal polity is used in several closely related senses Most commonly it refers to the field of church governance in the abstract but it also can refer to the governance of a particular Christian body In this sense it is used as a term in civil law Polity is sometimes used as a shorthand for the church governance structure itself br Though each church or denomination has its own characteristic structure there are three general types of polity br br Episcopal polity br br Churches having episcopal polity are governed by bishops The title bishop comes from the Greek word episkopos which literally translates into overseer In regard to Catholicism bishops have authority over the diocese which is both sacramental and political as well as performing ordinations confirmations and consecrations the bishop supervises the clergy of the diocese and represents the diocese both secularly and in the hierarchy of church governance br Bishops in this system may be subject to higher ranking bishops variously called archbishops metropolitans or patriarchs depending upon the tradition see also Bishop for further explanation of the varieties of bishops They also meet in councils or synods These synods subject to presidency by higher ranking bishops may govern the dioceses which are represented in the council though the synod may also be purely advisory br Note that the presence of the office of bishop within a church is not proof of episcopal polity For example in Mormonism the bishop occupies the office that in an Anglican church would be occupied by a priest br Also episcopal polity is not usually a simple chain of command br Instead some authority may be held not only by synods and colleges of bishops but by lay and clerical councils Further patterns of authority are subject to a wide variety of historical rights and honors which may cut across simple lines of authority br Episcopal polity is the predominant pattern in Catholic Eastern Orthodox Oriental Orthodox and Anglican churches It is also common in Methodist and Lutheran churches Among churches with episcopal polity different theories of autonomy are expressed So in Roman Catholicism the church is viewed as a single polity headed by the pope but in Eastern Orthodoxy the various churches retain formal autonomy but are held to be unified by shared doctrine and conciliarity that is the authority of councils such as ecumenical councils Holy Synods and the former standing council the Endemusa Synod br br Presbyterian polity br br Many Reformed churches notably those in the Presbyterian and Continental Reformed traditions are governed by a hierarchy of councils The lowest level council governs a single local church and is called the session or consistory its members are called elders The minister of the church sometimes referred to as a teaching elder is a member of and presides over the session lay representatives ruling elders or informally just elders are elected by the congregation The session sends representatives to the next level higher council called the presbytery or classis In some Presbyterian churches there are higher level councils synods or general assemblies Each council has authority over its constituents and the representatives at each level are expected to use their own judgment Hence higher level councils act as courts of appeal for church trials and disputes and it is not uncommon to see rulings and decisions overturned br Presbyterian polity is of course the characteristic governance of Presbyterian churches and also of churches in the Continental Reformed tradition Elements of presbyterian polity are also found in other churches For example in the Episcopal Church in the United States of America governance by bishops is paralleled by a system of deputies who are lay and clerical representatives elected by parishes and at the national level by the dioceses Legislation in the general convention requires the separate consent of the bishops and of the deputies br Note that in episcopal polity a presbyter refers to a priest br br Congregational polity br br Congregationalist polity dispenses with titled positions such as bishop as a requirement of church structure The local congregation rules itself though local leaders and councils may be appointed br Members may be sent from the congregation to associations that are sometimes identified with the church bodies formed by Lutherans Presbyterians Anglicans and other non congregational Protestants The similarity is deceptive however because the congregationalist associations do not exercise control over their members other than ending their membership in the association Many congregationalist churches are completely independent in principle One major exception is Ordination where even congregationalist churches often invite members of the vicinage or association to ordain their called pastor br It is a principle of congregationalism that ministers do not govern congregations by themselves They may preside over the congregation but it is the congregation which exerts its authority in the end br Congregational polity is sometimes called Baptist polity as it is the characteristic polity of Baptist churches br br br Priesthood br br Laity Priesthood of all believers br Clergy Bishop Priest Pastor Elder br br br Church discipline br br br Missiology br br br Sacrament br br A sacrament as defined in Hexam s Concise Dictionary of Religion is what Roman Catholics believe to be a rite in which God is uniquely active Augustine of Hippo defined a Christian sacrament as a visible sign of an invisible reality The Anglican Book of Common Prayer speaks of them as an outward and visible sign of an inward and invisible Grace Examples of sacraments would be Baptism and the Eucharist Therefore a sacrament is a religious symbol or often a rite which conveys divine grace blessing or sanctity upon the believer who participates in it or a tangible symbol which represents an intangible reality As defined above an example would be baptism in water representing and conveying the grace of the gift of the Holy Spirit the Forgiveness of Sins and membership into the Church Anointing with holy anointing oil is another example which is often synonymous with receiving the Holy Spirit and salvation Another way of looking at Sacraments is that they are an external and physical sign of the conferral of Sanctifying Grace br Throughout the Christian faith views concerning which rites are sacramental that is conferring sanctifying grace and what it means for an external act to be sacramental vary widely Other religious traditions also have what might be called sacraments in a sense though not necessarily according to the Christian meaning of the term br br General definitions and terms br In the majority of Western Christianity the generally accepted definition of a sacrament is that it is an outward sign that conveys spiritual grace through Christ Christian churches denominations and sects are divided regarding the number and operation of the sacraments Sacraments are generally held to have been instituted by Jesus Christ although in some cases this point is debated They are usually administered by the clergy to a recipient or recipients and are generally understood to involve visible and invisible components The invisible component manifested inwardly is understood to be brought about by the action of the Holy Spirit God s grace working in the sacrament s participants while the visible or outward component entails the use of such things as water oil and bread and wine that is blessed or consecrated the laying on of hands or a particularly significant covenant that is marked by a public benediction such as with marriage or absolution of sin in the reconciliation of a penitent br As defined by the Roman Catholic Church recognised by the Eastern Orthodox churches Oriental Orthodox though these two do not categorically define the number and Independent Catholic and Old Catholic Church br The Orthodox Churches Eastern and Oriental typically do not limit the number of sacraments viewing all encounters with reality in life as sacramental in some sense and their acknowledgement of the number of sacraments at seven as an innovation of convenience not found in the Church Fathers It came into use although infrequently later on from later encounters with the West and its Sacramental Theology Other denominations and traditions both in eastern and western Christianity may affirm only Baptism and Eucharist as sacraments these include many of the Protestant denominations and some of the Old Believers in the Orthodox communion some of whom reject all sacraments except Baptism br Since some post Reformation denominations do not regard clergy as having a classically sacerdotal or priestly function they avoid the term sacrament preferring the terms sacerdotal function ordinance or tradition This belief invests the efficacy of the ordinance in the obedience and participation of the believer and the witness of the presiding minister and the congregation This view stems from a highly developed concept of the priesthood of all believers In this sense the believer himself or herself performs the sacerdotal role br br br Eucharist br br Transsubstantiation Roman Catholicism br Anglican Eucharistic theology br Sacramental Union Lutheran br Eucharist also called Communion or the Lord s Supper and other names is a Christian sacrament or ordinance generally considered to be a re enactment of the Last Supper the final meal that Jesus Christ shared with his disciples before his arrest and eventual crucifixion The consecration of bread and a cup within the rite recalls the moment at the Last Supper when Jesus gave his disciples bread saying This is my body and wine saying This is my blood br There are different interpretations of the significance of the Eucharist but there is more of a consensus among Christians about the meaning of the Eucharist than would appear from the confessional debates over the sacramental presence the effects of the Eucharist and the proper auspices under which it may be celebrated br The phrase the Eucharist may refer not only to the rite but also to the consecrated bread leavened or unleavened and wine or in some Protestant denominations unfermented grape juice used in the rite and in this sense communicants may speak of receiving the Eucharist as well as celebrating the Eucharist br Eucharist is from Greek eucharistia meaning thanksgiving The verb the usual word for to thank in the Septuagint and the New Testament is found in the major texts concerning the Lord s Supper including the earliest br br For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said This is my body which is for you Do this in remembrance of me Corinthians br The Lord s Supper derives from Corinthians br br When you come together it is not the Lord s Supper you eat for as you eat each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else One remains hungry another gets drunk br br Communion is a translation other translations are participation sharing fellowship of the Greek koin n a in Corinthians The King James Version has br The cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ The bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ br br The Last Supper appears in all three Synoptic Gospels Matthew Mark and Luke and in the First Epistle to the Corinthians while the last named of these also indicates something of how early Christians celebrated what Paul the Apostle called the Lord s Supper As well as the Eucharistic dialogue in John chapter br In his First Epistle to the Corinthians c Paul the Apostle gives the earliest recorded description of Jesus s Last Supper The Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said This is my body which is for you Do this in remembrance of me In the same way also the cup after supper saying This cup is the new covenant in my blood Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me br The synoptic gospels first Mark and then Matthew and Luke depict Jesus as presiding over the Last Supper References to Jesus s body and blood foreshadow his crucifixion and he identifies them as a new covenant In the gospel of John the account of the Last Supper has no mention of Jesus taking bread and wine and speaking of them as his body and blood instead it recounts his humble act of washing the disciples feet the prophecy of the betrayal which set in motion the events that would lead to the cross and his long discourse in response to some questions posed by his followers in which he went on to speak of the importance of the unity of the disciples with him and each other br The expression The Lord s Supper derived from St Paul s usage in Corinthians may have originally referred to the Agape feast the shared communal meal with which the Eucharist was originally associated The Agape feast is mentioned in Jude But The Lord s Supper is now commonly used in reference to a celebration involving no food other than the sacramental bread and wine br The Didache Greek teaching is an early Church order including among other features instructions for baptism and the Eucharist Most scholars date it to the early nd century and distinguish in it two separate Eucharistic traditions the earlier tradition in chapter and the later one preceding it in chapter The Eucharist is mentioned again in chapter br Ignatius of Antioch one of the Apostolic Fathers and a direct disciple of the Apostle John mentions the Eucharist as the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ and Justin Martyr speaks of it as more than a meal the food over which the prayer of thanksgiving the word received from Christ has been said is the flesh and blood of this Jesus who became flesh and the deacons carry some to those who are absent br br Eucharistic theology br br Many Christian denominations classify the Eucharist as a sacrament Some Protestants prefer to call it an ordinance viewing it not as a specific channel of divine grace but as an expression of faith and of obedience to Christ br Most Christians even those who deny that there is any real change in the elements used recognize a special presence of Christ in this rite though they differ about exactly how where and when Christ is present Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy teach that the consecrated elements truly become the body and blood of Jesus Christ Transubstantiation is the metaphysical explanation given by Roman Catholics as to how this transformation occurs Lutherans believe that the body and blood of Jesus are present in with and under the forms of bread and wine a concept known as the sacramental union The Reformed churches following the teachings of John Calvin believe in a spiritual or pneumatic real presence of Christ by the power of the Holy Spirit and received by faith Anglicans adhere to a range of views although the Anglican church officially teaches the real presence Some Christians reject the concept of the real presence believing that the Eucharist is only a memorial of the death of Christ br The Baptism Eucharist and Ministry document of the World Council of Churches attempting to present the common understanding of the Eucharist on the part of the generality of Christians describes it as essentially the sacrament of the gift which God makes to us in Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit Thanksgiving to the Father Anamnesis or Memorial of Christ the sacrament of the unique sacrifice of Christ who ever lives to make intercession for us the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ the sacrament of his

the Greek roots last and discourse study is the study of the end of things whether the end of an individual life the end of the age or the end of the world Broadly speaking it is the study of the destiny of man as revealed in the Bible br Eschatology is concerned with the afterlife beginning with death and the personal judgment which follows the death of the individual and which is followed by the destination of heaven or hell In Catholic theology heaven is sometimes preceded by purgatory Eschatology also concerns itself with events which are said to happen at the end of this age the return of Jesus the resurrection of the dead the Rapture the Tribulation and following these things the Millennium or thousand years of peace which has been interpreted both literally and symbolically Finally eschatology concerns itself with the end of the world and its associated events the Last Judgment the banishment of Death Hades and Satan and his followers to the Lake of Fire and the creation of a new heaven and earth Millenarianists Seventh Day Adventists Jehovah s Witnesses and other recently founded sects have been influential in the modern development of these doctrines though their roots are biblical br Eschatology is an ancient branch of study in Christian theology with study of the last things and the Second Coming of Christ first touched on by Ignatius of Antioch c AD then given more consideration by the Christian apologist in Rome Justin Martyr c Treatment of eschatology continued in the West in the teachings of the influential theologian of Roman North Africa Tertullian c and was given fuller reflection and speculation soon after in the East by the master theologian Origen c br Martin Luther John Calvin and other th century reformers wrote long tracts about the End Times but interest in eschatology dwindled after the Reformation until the late th century when it became popular in the Reformed Pentecostal and Evangelical sects It was increasingly recognized as a formal division of theological study during the th century br The second coming of Christ is the central event in Christian eschatology Most Christians believe that death and suffering will continue to exist until Christ s return Others believe that suffering will gradually be eliminated prior to his coming and that the elimination of injustice is our part in preparing for that event Needless to say there are a variety of viewpoints concerning the order and significance of eschatological events br br br Approaches to interpretation br br The Preterist approach from the Latin praeteritus gone by seeks parallels between Revelation and the events of the st century such as Herod s attempt to kill the infant Christ the struggle of Christianity to survive the persecutions of Judaism and the Roman Empire the fall of Jerusalem in AD the desecration of the temple in the same year and the growth of Christianity from a sect within Judaism to an independent religion br The Historicist method takes a broader historical approach and seeks parallels between Revelation and the major people and events of history especially those which have had a direct effect on Israel and the Church br The Futurist method approaches Revelation as chiefly referring to events that have not yet come to pass but will take place at the end of this age and at the end of the world The main focus is the return of Christ br The Idealist model also known as Spiritualist or Symbolic model approaches the images of Revelation as symbols representing larger themes and concepts rather than actual people and events It sees in Revelation an allegorical representation of the ongoing struggle of the forces of light and darkness and the ultimate triumph of good over evil br br br See also br
