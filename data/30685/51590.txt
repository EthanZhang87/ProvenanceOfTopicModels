Umbria UM bree Italian umbrja is a region of central Italy It includes Lake Trasimeno and Marmore Falls and is crossed by the Tiber It is the only landlocked region on the Apennine Peninsula The regional capital is Perugia br The region is characterized by hills mountains valleys and historical towns such as the university centre of Perugia Assisi a World Heritage Site associated with St Francis of Assisi Terni Norcia Citt di Castello Gubbio Spoleto Orvieto Todi Castiglione del Lago Narni Amelia Spello and other small cities br br br Geography br Umbria is bordered by Tuscany to the west and the north Marche to the east and Lazio to the south Partly hilly and mountainous and partly flat and fertile owing to the valley of the Tiber its topography includes part of the central Apennines with the highest point in the region at Monte Vettore on the border of the Marche at metres feet the lowest point is Attigliano metres feet It is the only Italian region having neither a coastline nor a common border with other countries The comune of Citt di Castello has an exclave named Monte Ruperto within Marche Contained within Umbria is the hamlet of Cospaia which was a tiny republic from to created by accident br Umbria is crossed by two valleys the Umbrian valley Valle Umbra stretching from Perugia to Spoleto and the Tiber Valley Val Tiberina north and west of the first one from Citt di Castello to the border with Lazio The Tiber River forms the approximate border with Lazio although its source is just over the Tuscan border The Tiber s three principal tributaries flow southward through Umbria The Chiascio basin is relatively uninhabited as far as Bastia Umbra About kilometres miles farther on it joins the Tiber at Torgiano The Topino cleaving the Apennines with passes that the Via Flaminia and successor roads follow makes a sharp turn at Foligno to flow NW for a few kilometres before joining the Chiascio below Bettona The third river is the Nera flowing into the Tiber further south at Terni its valley is called the Valnerina The upper Nera cuts ravines in the mountains the lower in the Tiber basin has created a wide floodplain br In antiquity the plain was covered by a pair of shallow interlocking lakes the Lacus Clitorius and the Lacus Umber They were drained by the Romans over several hundred years An earthquake in the th century and the political collapse of the Roman Empire resulted in the refilling of the basin It was drained a second time almost a thousand years later during a year period Benedictine monks started the process in the th century and the draining was completed by an engineer from Foligno in the th century br The eastern part of the region being crossed by many faults has been often hit by earthquakes the last ones have been that of which hit Nocera Umbra Gualdo Tadino Assisi and Foligno and those of which struck Norcia and the Valnerina br In literature Umbria is referred to as Il cuore verde d Italia or The green heart of Italy The phrase is taken from a poem by Giosu Carducci the subject of which is the source of the Clitunno River in Umbria br br br History br br br Antiquity br The region is named for the Umbri people an Italic people which was absorbed by the expansion of the Romans The Umbri unlike the Etruscans with few exceptions did not live in an urban society but occupied small dwellings located in the Apennines Pliny the Elder recounted a fanciful derivation for the tribal name from the Greek ombros a shower which led to the idea that they had survived the Deluge familiar from Greek mythology allowing them to claim to be the most ancient race in Italy In fact they belonged to a broader family of neighbouring peoples with similar roots Their language was Umbrian one of the Italic languages related to Latin and Oscan The town of Gubbio houses today the longest and most important document of any of the Osco Umbrian group of languages the Iguvine Tablets written in Umbrian at the turn of the nd and st centuries BC The northern part of the region was occupied by Gallic tribes br The Umbri probably sprang like neighbouring peoples from the creators of the Terramara and Proto Villanovan culture in northern and central Italy who entered north eastern Italy at the beginning of the Bronze Age br The Etruscans were the chief enemies of the Umbri The Etruscan invasion extended from the western seaboard towards the north and east from about to BC They eventually drove the Umbrians towards the Apennine uplands and captured Umbrian towns Nevertheless the Umbrian population does not seem to have been eradicated in the conquered districts The border between Etruria and Umbria was the Tiber river as testified by the ancient name of Todi Tular border br After the downfall of the Etruscans Umbrians aided the Samnites in their struggle against Rome BC Later communications with Samnium were impeded by the Roman fortress of Narnia founded BC on the place of the umbrian Nequinum conquered in BC Romans defeated the Samnites and their Gallic allies in the battle of Sentinum BC Allied Umbrians and Etruscans had to return home and defend each of their territories against simultaneous Roman attacks leaving the Samnites without their help at Sentinum br The Roman victory at Sentinum initiated a period of integration under the Roman rulers who established some colonies such as Spoletium and built the via Flaminia BC The via Flaminia became a principal vector for Roman development in Umbria During Hannibal s invasion during the second Punic war the battle of Lake Trasimene was fought inside the borders of today s Umbria but the local people did not aid the invader br During the Roman civil war between Mark Antony and Octavian BC the city of Perugia supported Antony and was almost completely destroyed by Octavian In Pliny the Elder s time independent communities still existed in Umbria and the abundance of inscriptions and the high proportion of recruits in the imperial army attest to its population Under Augustus Umbria became the Regio VI of Roman Italy br Modern Umbria is different from Roman Umbria Roman Umbria extended through most of what is now the northern Marche to Ravenna but excluded the west bank of the Tiber which belonged to Etruria Thus Perugia was an Etruscan city and the area around Norcia was in the Sabine territory br After the collapse of the Roman empire Ostrogoths and Byzantines struggled for supremacy in the region and the decisive battle of the war between these two peoples took place near modern Gualdo Tadino br br br Middle Ages br Soon after the end of the Gothic war the Lombards invaded Italy and founded the duchy of Spoleto covering much of today s southern Umbria but the Byzantine were able to keep in the region a corridor along the Via Flaminia linking Rome with the Exarchate of Ravenna and the Pentapolis The Lombard king controlled also the northern part of the region ruled directly by Pavia When Charlemagne conquered most of the Lombard kingdoms some Umbrian territories were given to the Pope who established temporal power over them Some cities acquired a form of autonomy named comune These cities were frequently at war with each other often in a context of more general conflicts either between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire or between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines br In the early th century the signorie arose and the most important of them were those of the Vitelli in Citt di Castello of the Baglioni in Perugia and of the Trinci in Foligno but the region was subsumed by the middle of the same century into the Papal States by Cardinal Albornoz who in this way prepared the return of the pope from Avignon to Rome Citt di Castello was subsumed later into the Papal States by Cesare Borgia During the th century Renaissance spread in the northern part of the region It was in this period that humanists started to use again the ancient denomination of Umbria to name the area which until then had been named Ducato after the Duchy of Spoleto in the southern part of it The supremacy of the pope on Umbria was reinforced in th century through the erection of a fortress in Perugia by Pope Paul III named after him Rocca Paolina The papacy ruled the region uncontested until the end of the th century br br br Modern history br After the French Revolution and the French conquest of Italy Umbria became part of the ephemeral Roman Republic and later part of the Napoleonic Empire under the name of department of Trasim ne br After Napoleon s defeat the Pope regained Umbria and ruled it until In that year during Italian Risorgimento Umbria with Marche and part of Emilia Romagna were annexed by Piedmontese King Victor Emmanuel II and the people of Perugia destroyed in the same year the Rocca Paolina symbol of the papal oppression The region of Umbria with capital Perugia became part of the Kingdom of Italy in the following year The region whose economy was mainly based on agriculture experienced a dramatic economic shift at the end of the th century with the founding of the Acciaierie di Terni a major steelwork placed in Terni because of its abundance of electric power due to the Marmore waterfall and its secluded position br The region of Umbria at the time was somewhat larger than today comprising Rieti to the south now part of Lazio Rieti was detached and added to the Province of Rome Lazio in In the region of Umbria was divided into the provinces of Perugia and Terni br During WWII the industrial centers of the region like Terni and Foligno were heavily bombed and in became a battlefield between the allied forces and the Germans retreating towards the Gothic Line In Umbria was incorporated into the Italian Republic as a region comprising the two provinces of Perugia and Terni br br br Economy br The present economic structure emerged from a series of transformations which took place mainly in the s and s During this period there was rapid expansion among small and medium sized firms and a gradual retrenchment among the large firms which had hitherto characterised the region s industrial base This process of structural adjustment is still going on br Economically the most important region is the upper Tiber valley with Citt di Castello Terni steelworks stainless steel titanium alloy steel and processing companies automotive stainless steel tubes industrial food facility account for to of Umbria s GDP In Terni there are also many multinational companies in the fields of chemistry hydroelectric power renewable sources of energy and textiles Alcantara Cashmere In the rest of the region the ornamental ceramics industry is much esteemed br Umbrian agriculture is noted for its tobacco olive oil and vineyards which produce wines Regional varietals include the white Orvieto which draws agri tourists to the vineyards in the area surrounding the medieval town of the same name A notable wine is the Grechetto of Todi Other noted wines produced in Umbria are Torgiano and Rosso di Montefalco The Umbrian wineries are at the center of the Cantine Aperte or Open Cellars event when local wine makers open their wineries to the public Another typical Umbrian product is the black truffle found in Valnerina an area that produces of this product in Italy br The food industry in Umbria produces processed pork meats confectionery pasta and the traditional products of Valnerina in preserved form truffles lentils cheese br The unemployment rate stood at in br br br Tourism br Umbria has many small and picturesque villages of them have been selected by I Borghi pi belli d Italia English The most beautiful Villages of Italy a non profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities br br br Umber br br Umbria is the region where the Umber pigment was originally extracted The name comes from terra d ombra or earth of Umbria the Italian name of the pigment The word also may be related to the Latin word umbra meaning shadow Umber is a natural brown or reddish brown earth pigment that contains iron oxide and manganese oxide br In the th century natural umber pigments began to be replaced by pigments made with synthetic iron oxide and manganese oxide Natural umber pigments are still being made with Cyprus as a prominent source br br br Government and politics br br Umbria was a former stronghold of the Italian Communist Party forming with Tuscany Emilia Romagna and Marche what was then known as Italy s Red Regions Umbria was considered a stronghold of the Democratic Party and left leaning parties for over years however in the candidate of the centre right coalition Donatella Tesei won the region s presidential election against her centre left rival Vincenzo Bianconi garnering of the vote br br br Demographics br br As of the Italian national institute of statistics ISTAT estimated that foreign born immigrants live in Umbria equal to of the total population of the region br br br Administrative divisions br Umbria is divided into two provinces br br br Festivals br br One of the most important festivals in Umbria is the festival of the Ceri Candles also known as Saint Ubaldo Day in Gubbio The race has been held every year since on the th day of May The festival is focused around a race consisting of three teams of cerioli carrying large symbolic candles topped by saints including St Ubald the patron saint of Gubbio S Giorgio St George and S Antonio Anthony the Great and run through throngs of cheering supporters The cerioli are clad in the distinctive colors of yellow blue or black according to the saint they support with white trousers and red belts and neckbands They travel up much of the mountain from the main square in front of the Palazzo dei Consoli to the basilica of St Ubaldo each team carrying a statue of their saint mounted on a wooden octagonal prism similar to an hour glass shape metres tall and weighing about kg lb br The race has strong devotional civic and historical overtones and is one of the best known folklore manifestations in Italy and therefore the Ceri were chosen as the heraldic emblem on the coat of arms of Umbria as a modern administrative region br Umbria is not only known for its historical recollections such as the festival of the Ceri Calendimaggio in Assisi and the giostra della Quintana in Foligno but also for one of the biggest jazz music festivals called Umbria Jazz Umbria Jazz was born as a festival in and since has been held in the Umbrian capital Perugia in July it has become the fixed appointment of all jazz and good music lovers
