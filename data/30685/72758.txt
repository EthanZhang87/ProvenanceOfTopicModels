cutting review br The station is available on FM in most of Great Britain parts of Ireland and the north of France LW throughout the UK and in parts of Northern Europe and the Atlantic north of the Azores to about degrees west DAB Digital TV including Freeview Freesat Sky and Virgin Media and on the Internet Freesat Sky and Virgin have a separate channel for Radio LW output in mono in addition to the FM output br The longwave signal is part of the Royal Navy s system of letters of last resort In the event of a suspected catastrophic attack on Britain submarine captains in addition to other checks check for a broadcast signal from Radio on longwave to verify the annihilation of organised society in Great Britain br BBC Radio broadcasts a wide variety of speech related programming including news drama comedy science and history Music is broadcast as in documentaries relating to various forms of both popular and classical music and the long running music based Desert Island Discs Sport is also not part of the station s output apart from during news bulletins although between and the station s long wave frequency was used to broadcast ball by ball commentaries of most Test cricket matches played by England Consequently for around days a year listeners had to rely on FM broadcasts or DAB for mainstream Radio broadcasts the number relying solely on long wave was now a small minority The cricket broadcasts took precedence over on the hour news bulletins but not the Shipping Forecast carried since Radio s move to long wave in because long wave can be received clearly at sea br br br History br br Initially the power was watts on metres kHz LO was allowed to transmit for seven minutes after which the operator had to listen on the wavelength for three minutes for possible instructions to close down On November the station was transferred to the new British Broadcasting Company which in took up the nearby Savoy Hill for its broadcasting studios At midnight on New Year s Eve the twelve chimes of Big Ben were broadcast for the first time to mark the new year br In the company became the British Broadcasting Corporation On March LO was replaced by the BBC Regional Programme and the BBC National Programme The letters LO continued to be used internally as a designation in the BBC for technical operations in the London area for example the numbering of all recordings made in London contained LO The code LO was changed to LN in the early s br When the British Broadcasting Company first began transmissions on November from station LO in the Strand which it had inherited from the Marconi Company one of six commercial companies which created but technology did not yet exist either for national coverage or joint programming between transmitters Whilst it was possible to combine large numbers of trunk telephone lines to link transmitters for individual programmes the process was expensive and not encouraged by the General Post Office as it tied up large parts of the telephone network The stations that followed the establishment of LO in London were therefore autonomously programmed using local talent and facilities br By May simultaneous broadcasting was technically possible at least between main transmitters and relay stations the quality was not felt to be high enough to provide a national service or regular simultaneous broadcasts In it was felt that technical standards had improved enough for London to start to provide the majority of the output cutting the local stations back to providing items of local interest br br br Main stations br Each of these main stations were broadcast at approximately kilowatt kW br br br Relay stations br Each of these relay stations were broadcast at approximately watts W br br The BBC Home Service was the predecessor of Radio and broadcast between and It had regional variations and was broadcast on medium wave with a network of VHF FM transmitters being added from Radio replaced it on September when the BBC restructured and renamed its domestic radio stations in response to the challenge of offshore radio It moved to long wave in November taking over the kHz frequency metres previously held by Radio later moved to kHz as a result of international agreements aimed at avoiding interference all ITU Region MW LW broadcast frequencies are divisible by At this point Radio became available across all of the UK for the first time and the station officially became known as Radio UK a title that remained until September br For a time during the s Radio carried regional news bulletins Monday to Saturday These were broadcast twice at breakfast at lunchtime and at There were also programme variations for the parts of England not served by BBC Local Radio stations These included Roundabout East Anglia a VHF opt out of the Today programme broadcast from BBC East s studios in Norwich each weekday from a m to a m Roundabout East Anglia came to an end in August ahead of the launch of BBC Radio Norfolk br All regional news bulletins broadcast from BBC regional news bases around England ended in August apart from in the southwest as until January there was no BBC Local Radio in the southwest so these news bulletins and its weekday morning regional programme Morning Sou West continued to be broadcast from the BBC studios in Plymouth on VHF and on the Radio medium wave Plymouth relay until December br The launch of Radio on August saw the removal of Open University schools programming children s programmes and the Study on Options adult education slot from Radio s FM frequencies Consequently the full Radio schedule became available on FM for the first time However adult educational and Open University programming returned to Radio in when Radio was closed to make way for the launch of BBC Radio Live and were broadcast until the end of the s on Sunday evenings on longwave only br Between January and March FM broadcasts were replaced by a continuous news service devoted to the Gulf War Radio News FM with the main Radio service transferring to long wave Before this Radio s FM frequencies had occasionally been used for additional news coverage generally for live coverage of statements and debates in Parliament br By the start of the s Radio had become available on FM in most of the UK previously FM coverage had been restricted mainly to England and south Wales This meant that it was possible for the main Radio service to be transferred from LW to FM and this took place on September with opt outs extra shipping forecasts Daily Service and Yesterday in Parliament joined in by Test Match Special Longwave also occasionally opted out at other times such as to broadcast special services the most recent being when Pope Benedict XVI visited Britain in br On May the BBC announced that Radio will stop broadcasting opt outs on long wave with the last opt outs airing on March The two displaced programmes Daily Service and Yesterday in Parliament moved to BBC Radio Extra The daily amount of Shipping Forecasts was reduced to be broadcast times on weekdays and times on weekends Test Match Special moved to BBC Radio Sports Extra on July These end ahead of a planned switch off of long wave transmissions by br BBC Radio s medium wave frequencies were switched off on April which previously served as relays in areas with a weak LW signal to provide reception of BBC Radio LW such as Northern Ireland and south west England Most were turned off at PM BST and broadcast an endless closedown loop informing listeners to retune to other methods of reception The final transmitter to change into the closedown loop was the Plymouth relay on kHz at PM BST These relays stopped broadcasting the closedown loop and fell silent completely by April br br br Programmes and schedules br br br Daily schedule br An online schedule page lists the running order of programmes br br br Production br The station

news programmes such as Today The World at One and PM which by early had returned to Broadcasting House after years at BBC Television Centre in White City The news returning to Broadcasting House has also meant that newsreaders can provide cover for continuity which regularly occurs at each night and on a Sunday This has reduced the total number of continuity announcers required each day down from four to three br The Greenwich Time Signal popularly known as the pips is broadcast every hour to herald the news bulletin except at midnight and and on Sunday when the chimes of Big Ben are played There is no Greenwich Time Signal at on Saturday or and on Sunday due to the Saturday Afternoon drama and the omnibus edition of The Archers respectively Only pips broadcast on FM and LW are accurate

affairs history culture science religion arts drama and light entertainment A number of the programmes on Radio take the form of a magazine show featuring numerous small contributions over the course

particularly on the popular morning news magazine Today as part of a reported perception of a general malaise at the BBC Conversely the journalist Mehdi Hasan has criticised the station for an overtly socially and culturally conservative approach br There has been criticism of Today in particular for a lack of female broadcasters In September Radio employed the first female continuity announcers Hylda Bamber and Barbara Edwards For quite some time the introduction of female newsreaders led to complaints from listeners women discussing topics of feminist interest led to similar complaints In addition there has been long running criticism by atheist and humanist groups of Thought for the Day a slot dedicated exclusively to religious discussion during Radio s flagship morning news programme
