Sesame Workshop Inc SW originally known as the Children s Television Workshop Inc CTW is an American nonprofit organization that has been responsible for the production of several educational children s programs including its first and best known Sesame Street that have been televised internationally Television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and foundation executive Lloyd Morrisett developed the idea to form an organization to produce Sesame Street a television series which would help children especially those from low income families prepare for school They spent two years from to researching developing and raising money for the new series Cooney was named as the Workshop s first executive director which was termed one of the most important television developments of the decade br Sesame Street premiered on National Educational Television NET as a series run in the United States on November and moved to NET s successor the Public Broadcasting Service PBS in late The Workshop was formally incorporated in Gerald S Lesser and Edward L Palmer were hired to perform research for the series they were responsible for developing a system of planning production and evaluation and the interaction between television producers and educators later termed the CTW model The CTW applied this system to its other television series including The Electric Company and Contact The early s were a challenging period for the Workshop difficulty finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments harmed the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by br Following the success of Sesame Street the CTW developed other activities including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs the publications of books and music and international co productions In the CTW partnered with MTV Networks to create an educational channel called Noggin The Workshop produced a variety of original series for Noggin including The Upside Down Show Sponk and Out There On June the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop to better represent its activities beyond television br By income from the organization s international co productions of the series was million By the Sesame Street Muppets accounted for million per year in licensing and merchandising fees As of Sherrie Westin is the Workshop s president br br During the late s of all American households owned a television set and preschool children watched an average of hours of television per week Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school they earned better grades and learned more effectively Children from low income families however had fewer resources than children from higher income families to prepare them for school Research had shown that children from low income minority backgrounds tested substantially lower than middle class children in school related skills and that they continued to have educational deficits throughout school The topic of developmental psychology had grown during this period and scientists were beginning to understand that changes of early childhood education could increase children s cognitive growth br br In the winter of Joan Ganz Cooney hosted what she called a little dinner party at her apartment near Gramercy Park Attending were her husband Tim Cooney her boss Lewis Freedman and Lloyd and Mary Morrisett whom the Cooneys knew socially Cooney was a producer of documentary films at New York public television station WNDT now WNET and won an Emmy for a documentary about poverty in America Lloyd Morrisett was a vice president at Carnegie Corporation and was responsible for funding educational research but had been frustrated in his efforts because they were unable to reach the large numbers of children in need of early education and intervention Cooney was committed to using television to change society and Morrisett was interested in using television to reach greater numbers of needy kids The conversation during the party which according to writer Michael Davis was the start of a five decade long professional relationship between Cooney and Morrisett turned to the possibilities of using television to educate young children A week later Cooney and Freedman met with Morrisett at the office of Carnegie Corporation to discuss doing a feasibility study for creating an educational television program for preschoolers Cooney was chosen to perform the study br In the summer of Cooney took a leave of absence from WNDT and funded by Carnegie Corporation traveled the U S and Canada interviewing experts in child development education and television She reported her findings in a fifty five page document entitled The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education The report described what the new series which became Sesame Street would be like and proposed the creation of a company that managed its production which eventually became known as the Children s Television Workshop CTW br br For the next two years Cooney and Morrisett researched and developed the new show acquiring million funding for Sesame Street and establishing the CTW Due to her professional experience Cooney always assumed the show s natural network would be PBS Morrisett was amenable to broadcast it by commercial stations but all three major networks rejected the idea Davis considering Sesame Street s licensing income years later termed their decision a billion dollar blunder Morrisett was responsible for fund acquisition and was so successful at it that writer Lee D Mitgang later said that it defied conventional media wisdom Cooney was responsible for the show s creative development and for hiring the production and research staff for the CTW The Carnegie Corporation provided their initial million grant and Morrisett using his contacts procured additional multimillion dollar grants from the U S federal government the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Ford Foundation Morrisett s friend Harold Howe who was the commissioner for the U S Department of Education promised million half of the new organization s budget The Carnegie Corporation donated an additional million Mitgang stated Had Morrisett been any less effective in lining up financial support Cooney s report likely would have become just another long forgotten foundation idea Funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic problems experienced by commercial networks but caused difficulty for procuring future funding br Cooney s proposal included using in house formative research that would inform and improve production and independent summative evaluations to test the show s effect on its young viewers learning In Morrisett recruited Harvard University professor Gerald S Lesser whom he had met while they were both psychology students at Yale to help develop and lead the Workshop s research department In the Markle Foundation donated to Harvard to form the Center for Research in Children s Television which served as a research agency for the CTW Harvard produced about major research studies about Sesame Street and its effect on young children Lesser also served as the first chairman of the Workshop s advisory board a position he held until his retirement in According to Lesser the CTW s advisory board was unusual because instead of rubber stamping the Workshop s decisions like most boards for other children s television shows it contributed significantly to the series design and implementation Lesser reported in Children and Television Lessons from Sesame Street his book about the beginnings of Sesame Street and the Children s Television Workshop that about of the Workshop s initial budget was spent on research br CTW s summative research was done by the Workshop s first research director Edward L Palmer whom they met at the curriculum seminars Lesser conducted in Boston in the summer of In the summer of Palmer began to create educational goals define the Workshop s research activities and hire his research team Lesser and Palmer were the only scientists in the U S studying the interaction of children and television at the time They were responsible for developing a system of planning production and evaluation and the interaction between television producers and educators later called the CTW model Cooney observed of the CTW model From the beginning we the planners of the project designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers researchers and television producers collaborating as equal partners She described the collaboration as an arranged marriage br The CTW devoted of its initial budget to outreach and publicity In what television historian Robert W Morrow called an extensive campaign that Lesser stated would demand at least as much ingenuity as production and research the Workshop promoted the show with educators the broadcast industry and the show s target audience which consisted of inner city children and their families They hired Evelyn Payne Davis from the Urban League whom Michael Davis called remarkable unsinkable and indispensable as the Workshop s first Vice President of Community Relations and manager of the Workshop s Community Educational Services CES division Bob Hatch was hired to publicize their new series both before its premiere and to take advantage of the media attention concerning Sesame Street during its first year of production br According to Davis despite her involvement with the project s initial research and development Cooney s installment as CTW s executive director was questionable due to her lack of executive experience untested financial management skills and lack of experience with children s television and education Davis also speculated that sexism was involved stating Doubters also questioned whether a woman could gain the full confidence of a quorum of men from the federal government and two elite philanthropies institutions whose wealth exceeded the gross national product of entire countries At first Cooney did not fight for the position However she had the help of her husband and Morrisett and the project s investors soon realized they could not begin without her She was eventually named to the post in February As one of the first female executives in American television her appointment was termed one of the most important television developments of the decade The formation of the Children Television Workshop was announced at a press conference at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City on May br After her appointment Cooney hired Bob Davidson as her assistant he was responsible for making agreements with approximately public television stations to broadcast the new series She assembled a team of producers Jon Stone was responsible for writing casting and format David Connell assumed control of animation and volume production and Samuel Gibbon served as the show s chief liaison between the production staff and the research team Stone Connell and Gibbon had worked on another children s show Captain Kangaroo together Cooney later said about Sesame Street s original team of producers collectively we were a genius CTW s first children s show Sesame Street premiered on November The CTW was not incorporated until because its creators wanted to see if the series was a success before they hired lawyers and accountants Morrisett served as the first chairperson of CTW s board of trustees a job he had for years br br During the second season of Sesame Street to capitalize on the momentum the Workshop was enjoying and the attention it received from the press the Workshop created its second series The Electric Company in Morrisett used the same fund acquisition techniques as he had used for Sesame Street The Electric Company stopped production in but continued in reruns until it eventually became one of the most widely used TV shows in American classrooms and was revived in Starting in the early s the Workshop ventured into adult programming but found that it was difficult to make their programs accessible to all socio economic groups In it produced a medical program for adults termed Feelin Good hosted by Dick Cavett which was broadcast until According to writer Cary O Dell the show lacked a clear direction and never found a large audience In the Workshop broadcast an adult drama called Best of Families which was set in New York City around the turn of the th century However it lasted for only six or seven episodes and helped the Workshop decide to emphasize children s programs only br br Throughout the s the CTW s main non television efforts changed from promotion to the development of educational materials for preschool settings Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities in Appalachia in Native American communities and in migrant worker camps In the early s the CTW created the Preschool Education Program PEP whose goal was to assist preschools by combining television viewing books hands on activities and other media in using the series as an educational resource The Workshop also provided materials to non English speaking children and adults Starting in the Workshop expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers Other efforts by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners health and wellness and safety br According to Cooney and O Dell the s were a problematic period for the Workshop A series of poor investments in video games motion picture production theme parks and other business ventures hurt the organization financially Cooney brought in Bill Whaley during the late s to work on their licensing agreements but he was unable to compensate for the CTW s losses until when licensing revenues stabilized and its portfolio investments increased Despite financial troubles the Workshop continued to produce new shows throughout the decade Contact premiered in and ran for seven seasons The CTW found that finding funding for this series and other science oriented series like Square One Television which was broadcast from to was easy because the National Science Foundation and other foundations were interested in funding science education br br Cooney stepped down as chairman and chief executive officer of the CTW in when she was replaced by David Britt who was her chief lieutenant in the executive ranks through the mid s and whom Cooney termed her right hand for many years Britt had worked for her at the CTW since and had served as its president and chief operating officer since At that time Cooney became chairman of the Workshop s executive board which managed its businesses and licensing and became more involved with the organization s creative efforts The Workshop had a reorganization in and dismissed about percent of its staff In for the first time in the series history they accepted funds from corporations for Sesame Street and its other programs a policy criticized by consumer advocate Ralph Nader The Workshop defended the acceptance of corporate sponsorship stating that it compensated for a decrease of government subsidies br Also in the CTW invested million in an educational cable channel called Noggin Noggin was a joint venture between the CTW and Viacom s MTV Networks and it launched on February Gary Knell explained that creating a new channel allowed the CTW to more easily ensure that our programming gets out there While the Workshop would eventually produce various new shows for Noggin the channel s early lineup consisted mostly of older shows from the CTW s library br In profits earned from the Noggin deal along with the revenue caused partly by the Tickle Me Elmo craze enabled the CTW to purchase The Jim Henson Company s rights to the Sesame Street Muppets from the German media company EM TV which had acquired Henson earlier that year The transaction valued at million also included a small interest Henson had in the Noggin cable channel Gary Knell stated Everyone most especially the puppeteers were thrilled that we were able to bring them home It protected Sesame Street and allowed our international expansion to continue Owning these characters has allowed us to maximize their potential We are now in control of our own destiny br The CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop in June to better represent its non television activities and interactive media Also in Gary Knell succeeded Britt as president and CEO of the Workshop according to Davis he presided over an especially fertile period in the nonprofit s history Under Knell s management Sesame Workshop produced a variety of original shows for Noggin The first was an interactive game show called Sponk which was meant to model good collaboration and teamwork skills Sesame Workshop also co produced a Sesame Street spin off Play with Me Sesame for Noggin In April Noggin premiered an overnight block for teenagers called The N Sesame Workshop created its first ever teen drama series Out There for The N br In August Sesame Workshop sold its share of Noggin to Viacom The buyout was partially caused by SW s need to pay off debt Sesame Workshop remained involved with the network s programming as Viacom entered a multi year production deal with Sesame Workshop shortly after the split and continued to broadcast the company s shows The last collaboration between Noggin and Sesame Workshop was The Upside Down Show which premiered in br Outside of Noggin Knell was also instrumental in the creation of the cable channel Sprout in Sprout launched as PBS Kids Sprout was founded as a partnership between the Workshop Comcast PBS and HIT Entertainment all of whom contributed older programming from their archive libraries to the new network After seven years as a partner the Workshop divested its stake in Sprout to NBCUniversal in December br In the Sesame Workshop founded The Joan Ganz Cooney Center an independent non profit organization that studies how to improve children s literacy by using and developing digital technologies grounded in detailed educational curriculum just as was done during the development of Sesame Street br br The recession which resulted in budget reductions for many nonprofit arts organizations severely affected the organization in it had to dismiss of its staff Despite earning about million from licensing revenue royalties and foundation and government funding in the Workshop s total revenue was down and its operating loss doubled to million In it responded by dismissing of its staff saying that it was necessary to strategically focus their resources because of today s rapidly changing digital environment In Knell left Sesame Workshop to become the chief executive of National Public Radio NPR H Melvin Ming who had been the organization s chief financial officer since and chief operating officer since was named as his replacement In H Melvin Ming retired and was succeeded by former HIT Entertainment and Nickelodeon executive Jeffery D Dunn Dunn s appointment was the first time someone not affiliated with CTW or Sesame Workshop became its manager although he had associations with the organization previously In Dunn retired and was replaced by Sherrie Rollins Westin who had served as president of SW s Social Impact and Philanthropy Division for six years br In The Hollywood Reporter reported that Sesame Workshop s operating income was approximately million after the majority of its funds earned from grants licensing deals and royalties went back into its content its total operating costs were over million per year Operating costs included salaries million in rent for its Lincoln Center corporate offices its production facilities in Queens and the costs of producing content for its YouTube channels and other outlets The organization employed about people including several highly skilled puppeteers Royalties and distribution fees which accounted for million in made up the Workshop s biggest revenue source Donations brought in million or percent of its income Licensing revenue from games toys and clothing earned the organization million br br After Sesame Street s initial success the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show since its funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects not sustain them Although the organization was what Cooney termed the darling of the federal government for a brief period of two or three years its first ten years of existence was marked by conflicts between the two in the US Department of Education refused to deliver a million check until the last day of the CTW s fiscal year According to Davis the federal government was opposed to funding public television but the Workshop used Cooney s prestige and fame and the fact that there would be great public outcry if the series was de funded to withstand the government s attacks on PBS Eventually the CTW got its own line item in the federal budget By the U S government donated about four percent of the Workshop s budget or less than million a year br br For the first time a public broadcasting series had the potential to earn a great deal of money Immediately after its premiere Sesame Street gained attention from marketers so the Workshop explored sources such as licensing arrangements publishing and international sales and became as Cooney envisioned a multiple media institution Licensing became the foundation of as writer Louise Gikow stated the Sesame Workshop endowment which had the potential to fund the organization and future productions and projects Muppet creator Jim Henson owned the trademarks to the Muppet characters he was reluctant to market them at first but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys books and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW The producers demanded complete control of all products and product decisions throughout its history any product line associated with the series had to be educational inexpensive and not advertised during broadcastings of Sesame Street As Davis reported Cooney stressed restraint prudence and caution in their marketing and licensing efforts In the early s the CTW negotiated with Random House to establish and manage a non broadcast materials division Random House and the CTW named Christopher Cerf to assist the CTW in publishing books and other materials that emphasized the series curriculum By the Sesame Workshop had over licensing agreements and its total revenue in was million A million children play with Sesame Street themed toys per day br Soon after the premiere of Sesame Street producers educators and officials of other nations began requesting that a version of the series be broadcast in their countries CBS executive Michael Dann was required to quit his job at that network due to a change of corporate policy preceding the so called rural purge upon his ouster he became vice president of the CTW and Cooney s assistant Dann then began developing foreign versions of Sesame Street by arranging what were eventually termed co productions or independent programs with their own sets characters and curriculum goals By Sesame Street had expanded into countries The New York Times reported in that income from the CTW s international co productions of the series was million By the Sesame Street Muppets accounted for between million and million per year in licensing and merchandising fees divided between the Workshop and Henson Associates The Workshop began pursuing funding from corporate sponsors in consumer advocate Ralph Nader urged parents to protest the move by boycotting the show In the Workshop made a deal with Apple to develop original content including live action puppet and animated series for Apple s streaming service In Parade Magazine reported that the organization had received two million grants from the MacArthur Foundation and from the LEGO Foundation the funds were used to undertake the largest early childhood intervention in the history of humanitarian response to help refugee children and families br br In the CTW established a department managing the development of nonbroadcast materials based upon Sesame Street The Workshop decided that all materials its licensing program created would underscore and amplify the series curriculum Coloring books for example were prohibited because the Workshop felt they would restrict children s imaginations The CTW published Sesame Street Magazine in which incorporated the show s curriculum goals in a magazine format As with the series research was performed for the magazine initially by CTW s research department for a year and a half and then by the Magazine Research Group in br Working with Random House editor Jason Epstein the CTW hired Christopher Cerf to manage Sesame Street s book publishing program During the division s first year Cerf earned for the CTW He quit to become more involved with writing and composing music for the series and was replaced eventually by Bill Whaley Ann Kearns vice president of licensing for the CTW in stated that Whaley was responsible for expanding the licensing to other products and for creating a licensing model used by other children s series As of the Workshop had published over book titles and as researcher Renee Cherow O Leary stated in the print materials produced by CTW have been an enduring part of the legacy of Sesame Street In one of these books for example the death of the Sesame Street character Mr Hooper was featured in a book entitled I ll Miss You Mr Hooper published soon after the series featured it in In Parade Magazine reported that million copies of The Monster at the End of the Book and Another Monster at the End of this Book had been sold making them the top two best selling e books sold Its YouTube channel had almost million subscribers br br According to director Jon Stone the music of Sesame Street was unlike any other children s program on television For the first time the show s songs fulfilled a specific purpose and was related to its curriculum Cooney observed in her initial report that children had an affinity for commercial jingles so many of the show s songs were like television advertisements br To attract the best composers and lyricists and to encourage them to compose more music for the series the CTW allowed songwriters to retain the rights to the songs they wrote For the first time in children s television the writers earned lucrative profits which as Davis reported helped the show sustain the level of public interest in the show Scriptwriters often wrote their own lyrics to accompany their scripts Songwriters of note were Joe Raposo Jeff Moss Christopher Cerf Tony Geiss and Norman Stiles Many of the songs written for Sesame Street have become what writer David Borgenicht termed timeless classics These songs included Can You Tell Me How to Get to Sesame Street I Love Trash Rubber Duckie Bein Green and Sing Many Sesame Street songs were recorded by well known artists such as Barbra Streisand Lena Horne Dizzy Gillespie Paul Simon and Jose Feliciano By there were albums of Sesame Street music produced br The show s first album Sesame Street Book Record recorded in was a major success and won a Grammy Award Parade Magazine reported in that the show s music had been honored with children s Grammys According to Gikow Raposo won three Emmys and four Grammys for his work for the series br br Soon after Sesame Street debuted in the US the CTW was asked independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the series in their countries Cooney remarked To be frank I was really surprised because we thought we were creating the quintessential American show We thought the Muppets were quintessentially American and it turns out they re the most international characters ever created She hired former CBS executive Mike Dann who quit commercial television to become her assistant as a CTW vice president One of Dann s tasks was to manage offers to produce versions of Sesame Street in other countries In response to Dann s appointment television critic Marvin Kitman said After Dann sells Sesame Street in Russia and Czechoslovakia he might try Mississippi where it is considered too controversial for educational TV This was a reference to the May decision by the state s PBS station to not air the series By summer Dann had made the first international agreements for what the CTW came to term co productions br br The earliest international versions were what CTW vice president Charlotte Cole and her colleagues termed fairly simple consisting of dubbed versions of the series with local language voice overs and instructional cutaways Dubbed versions of the series continued to be produced if the country s needs and resources warranted it Eventually a variant of the CTW model was used to create and produce independently produced preschool television series in other countries By there were twenty co productions In there were more than million viewers of all international versions of Sesame Street and by the show s th anniversary in million children viewed over versions of Sesame Street in languages In Doreen Carvajal of The New York Times reported that income from the co productions and international licensing accounted for million As Cole and her colleagues reported in Children s Television Workshop CTW can be regarded as the single largest informal educator of young children in the world br br Ten years after the premiere of Sesame Street the CTW began experimenting with new technologies In it began to plan the development of a theme park Sesame Place which opened in in Langhorne Pennsylvania Three international parks Parque Plaza Sesamo in Monterrey Mexico since Universal Studios Japan and Vila Sesamo Kids Land in Brazil were later built One of the park s features was a computer gallery which was developed by a small in house team and included computer programs The team evolved into the Children s Computer Workshop CCW in which was disbanded and became the Interactive Technologies division of the CTW in the late s As Sesame Street researcher Shalom M Fisch stated no television series could be as interactive as computer games even participatory shows like Blue s Clues or the Sesame Street segment Elmo s World The CTW has chosen to take advantage of the contingent feedback inherent in interactive computer games by developing and creating educational software based upon the television series content and curriculum br In the Sesame Workshop began to offer clips and full length episodes on the websites Hulu YouTube and iTunes where Word on the Street segments became the most popular webcast Sesame Workshop won a Peabody Award in for its website sesamestreet org In the Workshop began offering for a subscription fee a library of over
