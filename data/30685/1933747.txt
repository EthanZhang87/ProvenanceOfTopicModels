the Emerald Sea was released in book form in April br Sanderson also collaborated with Unknown Worlds Entertainment to create the lore and setting for the video game Moonbreaker which was released via early access in September br Sanderson announced a further secret project novel set for a release in March br br The Cosmere is the name of the universe in which Elantris Mistborn Warbreaker The Stormlight Archive White Sand Tress of the Emerald Sea Yumi and the Nightmare Painter The Sunlit Man and stories contained in Arcanum Unbounded The Cosmere Collection are all set This idea came from Sanderson s desire to create an epic length series without requiring readers to buy a ridiculous number of books Because of that he hides connections to his other works within each book creating a hidden epic He has estimated that the Cosmere sequence could conclude with at least books br The story of the Cosmere is about a mysterious being called Adonalsium who existed on a world known as Yolen Adonalsium was killed by a group of at least eighteen conspirators causing its power to shatter into sixteen different Shards each of which bears immense power Sixteen of those people referred to as Vessels then took these Shards and traveled to new worlds populating them with different systems of magic or extending on ones already present In one case the Shards Ruin and Preservation worked together to actually create a planet and its people Scadrial as featured in Mistborn br Each Shard has an Intent such as Ambition or Honor and a Vessel s personality is changed over time to bring them more in line with their Intent One such Shard Odium has killed or splintered several other Shards On Sel he splintered Devotion and Dominion accidentally creating the Dor from which Seons and Skaze have emerged On Roshar Odium splintered Honor and brought about the Everstorm and the True Desolation He has also splintered Ambition in the Threnody system A man known as Hoid is seen or mentioned in most Cosmere books He travels the so called Shardworlds using the people of those worlds to further an unknown agenda br Sanderson has indicated that an upcoming work in the series will be in the Cyberpunk genre a marked departure from the setting of the high fantasy and urban fantasy settings that have featured in the Cosmere universe to date br br The idea of hard magic and soft magic was popularized by Sanderson for world building and creating magic systems in fictional settings The terminology of hard and soft originate from hard and soft sciences which lends itself towards hard science fiction and soft science fiction Both terms are approximate ways of characterizing two ends of a spectrum Hard magic systems follow specific rules the magic is controlled and explained to the reader in the narrative detailing the mechanics behind the way the magic works and can be used for building settings that revolve around the magic system Soft magic systems may not have clearly defined rules or limitations or they may provide limited exposition regarding their workings They are used to create a sense of wonder in the reader br Sanderson s three laws of magic are creative writing guidelines that can be used to create magic systems for fantasy stories br br An author s ability to solve conflict with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic br Weaknesses limits and costs are more interesting than powers br The author should expand on what is already a part of the magic system before something entirely new is added as this may otherwise entirely change how the magic system fits into the fictional world br Additionally there is a zeroth law br br Always err on the side of what s awesome br br Sanderson is adjunct faculty at Brigham Young University teaching a creative writing course once per year Sanderson also participates in the weekly podcast Writing Excuses with authors Dan Wells Mary Robinette Kowal and web cartoonist Howard Tayler He began hosting the podcast Intentionally Blank with Dan Wells in June where they discuss random things they enjoy br br Sanderson has been nominated for and also won
