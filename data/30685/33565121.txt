whose anime adaptation was broadcast from to revolutionized the magical girl genre by combining transforming hero elements from live action tokusatsu hero shows like Super Sentai and Kamen Rider with traditionally feminine interests such as romance and fashion Up until then magical girl series were comedic and the characters use of magic only exacerbated social conflict A key attribute of the transformations in Sailor Moon is that they focused on exaggerating the characters beauty through make up and fashion negating the link between cuteness and weakness traditionally seen in women In addition unlike previous magical girl series Sailor Moon featured a team of magical girls as the main characters with male characters supporting them in battle The format of using fighting transforming heroines became popular and were used in other magical girl series following Sailor Moon Series that attempted to capitalize on Sailor Moon s success include Akazukin Chacha whose anime

Moon Pretty Cure drew influences from tokusatsu hero shows but unlike the former it was heavily focused on action and used the same talents who worked on Kamen Rider and Super Sentai This helped the series achieve widespread demographic appeal outside of young girls br At the same time the target demographic of magical girl shows expanded With more late night anime being produced in the early s magical girl shows aimed at an older male demographic were produced a notable one being Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha a spin off originating from the adult game series Triangle Heart As the series were targeted towards older audiences this allowed for dark and mature themes to be explored including death and the price of magical power The magical girl genre earned renewed popularity in the s with

ordinary schoolgirl who changes into an adorable costume with cute accessories she then uses a sceptre or a similar weapon to channel magical energy in order to fight against the forces of evil This format has allowed magical girls to be viewed as superheroines especially in the West during the girl power movement of the s Comparisons have been drawn to Western superheroines like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Wonder Woman but unlike the former transforming heroine series use femininity to weaponize and also features young girls instead of women while older women are typically portrayed as villains in magical girl series br br br Romance and friendship br A common goal for magical girl characters since the s is romance that eventually results in marriage While heterosexual romance
