In folklore and fantasy an enchanted forest is a forest under or containing enchantments Such forests are described in the oldest folklore from regions where forests are common and occur throughout the centuries to modern works of fantasy They represent places unknown to the characters and situations of liminality and transformation The forest can feature as a place of threatening danger or one of refuge or a chance at adventure br br br Folktales br The forest as a place of magic and danger is found among folklore wherever the natural state of wild land is forest a forest is a location beyond which people normally travel where strange things might occur and strange people might live the home of monsters witches and fairies Peasants who seldom if ever traveled far from their villages could not conclusively say that it was impossible that an ogre could live an hour away Hence in fairy tales Hansel and Gretel found a cannibalistic witch in the forest Vasilissa the Beautiful encountered Baba Yaga herself Molly Whuppie and her sisters ran into a giant It was in a forest that the king of The Grateful Prince lost his way and rashly promised his child for aid where the heroines and their wicked stepsisters of The Three Little Men in the Wood and The Enchanted Wreath met magical tests and where Brother and Sister found the streams that their evil stepmother had enchanted In Beauty and the Beast Belle s father is lost in the forest when he finds the Beast s castle The evil cat spirits of Schippeitaro live in the forest br Indeed in Grimm s Fairy Tales the hero always goes into the forest It is not itself enchanted but it contains enchantments and being outside normal human experience acts as a place of transformation The German fairy tale has an unusual tendency to take place in the forest even such neighboring countries as France or Italy are less like to have fairy tales situated in the forest br Even in folklore forests can also be places of magical refuge Snow White found refuge with dwarfs from her stepmother The Girl Without Hands found a hut to stay in when she had been slandered to her husband and Genevieve of Brabant found not only a refuge from slander but a doe magically came to her aid Even Brother and Sister hid in the forest after their stepmother turned the brother into a deer br At other times the marvels they meet are beneficial In the forest the hero of a fairy tale can meet and have mercy on talking animals that aid him The king in many variants of the ballad The Famous Flower of Serving Men finds an enchanted hind that leads him astray uncanny but it brings him to a talking bird that reveals to him a murder and that a servant of his is actually a woman whom the king then marries It is in the forest that the dwarf of Rumpelstiltskin and the fairy of Whuppity Stoorie reveal their true names and therefore the heroines of those tales have a way to free themselves In Schippeitaro the cats reveal their fear of the dog Schippeitaro when the hero of the tale spends the night in the forest br The creatures of the forest need not be magical to have much the same effect Robin Hood and the Green Man living in the greenwood has affinities to the enchanted forest Even in fairy tales robbers may serve the roles of magical beings in an Italian variant of Snow White Bella Venezia the heroine takes refuge not with dwarfs but with robbers br br br Mythology br The danger of the folkloric forest is an opportunity for the heroes of legend Among the oldest of all recorded tales the Sumerian

and found herself accused of adultery by him escaped to the forest br This forest could easily bewilder the knights Despite many references to its pathlessness the forest repeatedly confronts knights with forks and crossroads of a labyrinthine complexity The significance of their encounters is often explained to the knights particularly those searching for the Holy Grail by hermits acting as wise old men or women Still despite their perils and chances of error such forests are places where the knights may become worthy and find the object of their quest one romance has a maiden urging Sir Lancelot on his quest for the Holy Grail which quickens with life and greenness like the forest Dante Alighieri used this image in the opening of the Divine Comedy story Inferno where he depicted his
