Omegaverse also known as A B O an abbreviation for alpha beta omega is a subgenre of speculative erotic fiction and originally a subgenre of erotic slash fan fiction Its premise is that a dominance hierarchy exists in humans which are divided into dominant alphas neutral betas and submissive omegas This hierarchy determines how people interact with one another in romantic erotic and sexual contexts br br br Genre characteristics br The Omegaverse has abstract premises for which it could be considered a fantasy genre according to the conventions established by Todorov but the high specification of its characteristic elements suggests that it could also be considered a literary genre in itself Its main peculiarity is that characters have two sexes a main one male or female decided by their external sexual organs and a secondary one that manifests during puberty determined by their internal reproductive system It s usually chosen from one of the following each of which also corresponds to some distinctive character traits br br Alpha socially and in some interpretations even biologically dominant physically built short tempered and a natural leader br Beta depending on the story they are regular human beings or have a mix of Alpha and Omega traits or their own unique traits br Omega submissive and gentle calm and a peacemaker br Omegaverse fiction typically focuses on wolf or other canid like behavior in humans especially as it pertains to sexual intercourse and sexuality which is described as instinctual responding to animalistic physiological stimuli This includes rutting and heat cycles pheromonal attraction between Alphas and Omegas penises with knots used to knot or tie the partner to an Alpha during copulation an action known as knotting scent marking imprinting breeding mating rites pack structures and potentially permanent psychic bonds with a mate Between Alphas and Betas only females can carry on a pregnancy but male Omegas are often envisaged as being able to become pregnant via a uterus connected to the rectum and Alphas can impregnate regardless of their main gender To make penetration and impregnation easier male Omegas often have self lubricating anuses br Since Omegaverse is a type of folksonomy some of its aspects are included or excluded at the discretion of the story author Sometimes Betas are absent or other intermediate designations such as Deltas and Gammas are added The genre often features other fantasy elements such as the presence of werewolves or other fantastical creatures Some works introduce a rigid caste system where Alphas are depicted as the upper class elites while Omegas are at the bottom tier and face discrimination and oppression because of their physiology creating an example of biological determinism In darker stories this results in non consensual or dubiously consensual intercourses forced pregnancies kidnapping of Omegas and sexual slavery br Omegaverse works are most frequently focused on male male couples composed of an Alpha and an Omega though heterosexual Omegaverse works have been produced and by about on Archive of Our Own were labeled male female Some subvert the genre tropes telling stories about illicit relationships between Alphas Omegas who hide their smell using chemical pheromones so that they are not a victim of biological prejudices or dominant Omegas and submissive Alphas Non traditional couples are often featured in Japanese Omegaverse works br While the terms A B O and Omegaverse can be used interchangeably the first one often refers only to the sexual dynamics while the second one is preferred when the story is set in a new ideological world Some prefer to avoid use of the term A B O because it resembles the racial slur abo br br br History br br br Tropes origins br The tropes commonly associated with the genre are not exclusive to it they can be found across fandoms of various media but came together in the Omegaverse in what Professor Kristina Busse has described as a seemingly perfect storm The concept of mating and heat cycles among humans was popularized by the episode Amok Time of the American television series Star Trek which introduces the concept of pon farr the Vulcan mating cycle wherein Vulcan males must mate or die which became a popular plot concept for fan works in the Star Trek fandom particularly fan fiction focused on the Kirk Spock pairing Ursula K Le Guin also wrote in her novel The Left Hand of Darkness about an extraterrestrial androgynous world with hermaphroditic characters and mating cycles named kemmer Animal transformations like werewolves are included in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Twilight Teen Wolf and Harry Potter with the latter s fandom popularizing bestiality kinks br br br Genre history br The origin of the Omegaverse is typically attributed to the fandom surrounding the American television series Supernatural as a fusion between werewolves and the male pregnancy subgenre of erotic fan fiction Another source of inspiration could have been the science fiction drama Dark Angel where Supernatural actor Jensen Ackles plays a soldier with feline DNA and female characters go into heat The first works recognized as A B O were published in mid that year in May a writing prompt was shared on a LiveJournal community dedicated to Supernatural mentioning alpha males having knots on their penises and bitch males without the knots inspiring user tehdirtiestsock to write I ain t no lady but you d be the tramp a real person fiction work focused on actors Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as an Alpha and an Omega which was published on July Despite not using the term omega the story created many of the characteristics later associated with the Omegaverse genre br Over the next few months other anonymous authors shared similar stories until on November a new writing prompt mentioned Alpha Beta and Omega men for the first time spurring the creation of three works By June the term Omegaverse and its dynamics had become commonplace the following month the first femslash Omegaverse work was published and the first use of the tropes outside the Supernatural fandom was recorded br The genre subsequently expanded in popularity to other fan communities first to those focused around Sherlock and X Men First Class then it quickly reached other fandoms like those of television series Hannibal Teen Wolf Glee Doctor Who and movie The Avengers A Chinese translation of an A B O Sherlock fanfic posted on website Suiyuanju around October introduced Omegaverse to Chinese slash fan circles from which it spread to danmei original novels br In the notion of fated mates was introduced In Omegaverse gained strong traction in Japan acquiring market value with the publication of the first A B O manga in In the discrimination and power dynamics between Alphas Betas and Omegas began to be outlined and the idea of the mark or bite that chemically and biologically links couples together was created while in the concept of the inner wolf an animal instinct guiding Alphas and Omegas arose Through her work Kanraku Alpha Enigma manga artist Shinshi Nakai subsequently tried to add the Enigma a new type of character who can mutate their secondary gender but the novelty was resisted by Omegaverse fans and had no impact or continuity br br br Reception and analysis br Omegaverse has become both extremely popular and controversial in fandom circles Some condemn it as revolting and sick affirming that it reinforces patriarchal values and a rape culture objecting to its roots in bestiality fiction and the power imbalances between genders Conversely others appreciate how it deconstructs bodies and gender roles offering subversive social commentary on queer identity and oppression br Academic opinions are equally divided between those who believe Omegaverse shows a new type of gender essentialism combined with homophobic and heteronormative elements and those who see the space to give it a transgender reading Delgado D az Ubillus Bre a and Cappello do not believe that the Omegaverse is linked to queer theory or transidentity despite containing allegories to gender identity and the female condition Omegas both male and female could be considered embodiments of the traditional role of women as housewives and mothers whose purpose however is only that of frameworks to plots ranging from melodrama to horror br According to researcher Milena Popova the features of the A B O genre allow for the exploration of themes of power desire pleasure intimacy romance control and consent in a variety of ways and it is used by writers and readers as a tool to articulate and think through consent issues in unequal relationships Similarly Laura Campillo Arnaiz argues that dark Omegaverse works serve to gain control on the feelings of helplessness and humiliation that characterize it creating a cathartic experience br According to Paige Hartenburg the Omegaverse is connected to LGBTQ trauma and corrective narratives hence it writes queerness through the impact it leaves on the body with its violence and heteronormic tendencies responding to larger structures that attempt to confine narrative authority to a single group and in all its intricacies both problematic in its highly patriarchal troupes sic and emblematic of considerable community trauma the Omegaverse is a genre representative of the dissolving relationship between queer fandom spaces and mainstream creatives br Angie Fazekas wrote that i n the omegaverse fans use traditional tropes of gender and sexuality to imagine a universe where queer sexuality is the norm and normative gender roles are often skewed and upended but that they fail to offer real progressiveness since like most of the other fan fictions their works are predominantly focused on relationships between white men br br br Impact br The Omegaverse exploded in popularity in quickly becoming a frequent subject of fan fiction writers As of July over Omegaverse fan works had been published on the fan fiction website Archive of Our Own and over as of In addition to these derivative works Omegaverse has emerged as its own genre of original commercial erotic fiction roughly Omegaverse novels were published on Amazon from January to June It has also become a subgenre of both commercial and non commercial yaoi manga featuring male male couples Given the positive reception in Japan South Korea started its own production of Omegaverse manhwas as well as China although the censorship applied in this latter country has limited the genre popularity br Beginning in the Dom Sub Universe subgenre gained popularity particularly in yaoi works in Japan it uses BDSM elements positing dominant and submissive as secondary genders and draws inspirations from Omegaverse in its depiction of caste systems In the Cakeverse a small part of the human population is divided into forks who have no sense of taste and cakes people with a particular flavor that makes them irresistible to forks br br br br br br Citations br br br
