Sword and sorcery S S or heroic fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy characterized by sword wielding heroes engaged in exciting and violent adventures Elements of romance magic and the supernatural are also often present Unlike works of high fantasy the tales though dramatic focus on personal battles rather than world endangering matters The genre originated from the early s works of Robert E Howard The term sword and sorcery was coined by Fritz Leiber in the April issue of the fantasy fanzine Ancalagon to describe Howard and the stories that were influenced by his works In parallel with sword and sorcery the term heroic fantasy is used although it is a more loosely defined genre br Sword and sorcery tales eschew overarching themes of good vs evil in favor of situational conflicts that often pit morally gray characters against one another to enrich themselves or to defy tyranny br Sword and sorcery is grounded in real world social and societal hierarchies and is grittier darker and more violent with elements of cosmic often Lovecraftian creatures that aren t a staple of mainstream fantasy The main character is often a barbarian with antihero traits br br American author Fritz Leiber coined the term sword and sorcery in in response to a letter from British author Michael Moorcock in the fanzine Amra demanding a name for the sort of fantasy adventure story written by Robert E Howard Moorcock had initially proposed the term epic fantasy Leiber replied in the journal Ancalagon April suggesting sword and sorcery as a good popular catchphrase for the field He expanded on this in the July issue of Amra commenting br br I feel more certain than ever that this field should be called the sword and sorcery story This accurately describes the points of culture level and supernatural element and also immediately distinguishes it from the cloak and sword historical adventure story and quite incidentally from the cloak and dagger international espionage story too br The term heroic fantasy has been used to avoid the garish overtones of sword and sorcery This name was coined by L Sprague de Camp However it has also been used to describe a broader range of fantasy including High fantasy br br Sword and sorcery stories take place in a fictional world where magic exists The setting can be an Earth in the mythical past or distant future an imaginary other world or an alien planet Sometimes sword and sorcery stories are influenced by horror or science fiction Sword and sorcery however does not seek to give a scientific explanation for miraculous events unlike actual science fiction br The main character in sword and sorcery stories is usually a powerful warrior who fights against supernatural evil The typical protagonist is a violent self respecting and emotional barbarian who values freedom The main character often has the characteristics of an antihero Although the main character mostly behaves heroically he may ally with an enemy or sacrifice an ally in order to survive A hero s main weapons are cunning and physical strength Magic on the other hand is usually only used by the villains of the story who are usually wizards witches or supernatural monsters Most sword and sorcery heroes are masculine male characters while female characters are usually underdeveloped A recurring theme in the genre is a damsel in distress However some sword and sorcery stories have a female protagonist and the genre s traditional emphasis on male protagonists has declined since the last decades of the th century br In his introduction to the Ace edition of Conan The Barbarian L Sprague de Camp described the typical sword and sorcery story as br br A story of action and adventure laid in a more or less imaginary world where magic works and where modern science and technology have not yet been discovered The setting may as in the Conan stories be this Earth as it is conceived to have been long ago or as it will be in the remote future or it may be another planet or another dimension br Such a story combines the color and dash of the historical costume romance with the atavistic supernatural thrills of the weird occult or ghost story When well done it provides the purest fun of fiction of any kind It is escape fiction wherein one escapes clear out of the real world into one where all men are strong all women beautiful all life adventurous and all problems simple and nobody even mentions the income tax or the dropout problem or socialized medicine br br The circular structure is common in sword and sorcery series the hero stays forever young and every day is like the first for him The main character s victory over his enemies is not final but in the next short story a new threat arises against which the hero has to fight once again The world has a wide variety of exciting and exotic locations designed to act as a stage for the main character s exploits Many sword and sorcery tales have turned into lengthy series of adventures Their lower stakes and less than world threatening dangers make this more plausible than a repetition of the perils of high fantasy So too does the nature of the heroes most sword and sorcery protagonists travellers by nature find peace after adventure deathly dull br Sword and sorcery resembles high fantasy but is darker and more jagged The scale of the struggles depicted is smaller and the main character usually pursues personal gain such as wealth or love The opposition between good and evil characteristic of fantasy also exists in sword and sorcery literature but it is less absolute and the events often take place in a morally gray area These features are especially emphasized in newer works of the genre The stories are fast paced and action oriented with lots of violent fight scenes Sword and sorcery is by nature a light and escapist genre whose main purpose is to entertain the reader There is usually no deep message or social statements in the works of this genre br It is typical for the topics that sword and sorcery deals with to be relatively limited The genre has sometimes been criticized for excessive violence misogyny and even fascist attitudes br br In his introduction to the reference Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers by L Sprague de Camp Lin Carter notes that the heritage of sword and sorcery is illustrious and can be traced back to mythology including the labors of Hercules as well as to classical epics such as Homer s Odyssey the Norse sagas and Arthurian legend br It also has been influenced by historical fiction For instance the work of Sir Walter Scott was influenced by Scottish folklore and ballads But few of Scott s stories contain fantastic elements in most the appearance of such is explained away Its themes of adventure in a strange society were influenced by adventures set in foreign lands by Sir H Rider Haggard and Edgar Rice Burroughs Haggard s works such as King Solomon s Mines and She A History of Adventure included many fantastic elements Some of Haggard s characters such as Umslopogaas an axe wielding Zulu warrior who encountered supernatural phenomena and loved to fight bore similarities to sword and sorcery heroes Haggard also wrote Eric Brighteyes a violent historical novel based on the Icelandic Sagas some writers such as David Pringle have stated that Eric Brighteyes resembles a modern sword and sorcery novel br Sword and sorcery s immediate progenitors are the swashbuckling tales of Alexandre Dumas p re The Three Musketeers etc Rafael Sabatini Scaramouche etc and their pulp magazine imitators such as Talbot Mundy Harold Lamb and H Bedford Jones who all influenced Howard Mundy in particular proved influential early sword and sorcery writers such as Robert E Howard C L Moore and Fritz Leiber were admirers of Mundy s fiction However these historical swashbucklers lack the supernatural element even though Dumas fiction contained many fantasy tropes which defines the genre br Another influence was early fantasy fiction This type of fiction includes the short stories of Lord Dunsany s such as The Fortress Unvanquishable Save for Sacnoth and The Distressing Tale of Thangobrind the Jeweller These works of Dunsany s feature warriors who clash with monsters and wizards in realms of Dunsany s creation The Worm Ouroboros by E R Eddison a heroic romance written in a mock archaic style was an inspiration to later writers of sword and sorcery such as Fritz Leiber The Poictesme novels of James Branch Cabell such as Jurgen A Comedy of Justice have been cited as a stimulus to early sword and sorcery writing Cabell s novels depict picaresque exploits in imaginary lands and were an influence on Leiber and Jack Vance A Merritt s novels The Ship of Ishtar and Dwellers in the Mirage have also been cited as influences on sword and sorcery as they feature men from the then contemporary world being drawn into dangerous adventures involving swordplay and magic All these authors influenced sword and sorcery for the plots characters and landscapes used br Also many early sword and sorcery writers such as Howard and Clark Ashton Smith were influenced by the Middle Eastern tales of the Arabian Nights whose stories of magical monsters and evil sorcerers were an influence on the genre to be br Sword and sorcery s frequent depictions of smoky taverns and fetid back alleys draw upon the picaresque genre for example Rachel Bingham notes that Fritz Leiber s city of Lankhmar bears considerable similarity to th century Seville as depicted in Miguel de Cervantes tale Rinconete y Cortadillo br Sword and sorcery proper only truly began in the pulp fantasy magazines where it emerged from weird fiction The magazine Weird Tales which published Howard s Conan stories and C L Moore s Jirel of Joiry tales as well as key influences like H P Lovecraft and Smith was especially important Lovecraft s fiction especially his Dream Cycle of Dunsany inspired fantasy stories was a source of inspiration for the first generation of sword and sorcery writers br The Weird Tales story The Shadow Kingdom by Robert E Howard is often regarded as the first true sword and sorcery tale because it pits a heroic warrior Kull of Atlantis against supernatural evil in an imaginary world of the writer s devising br Howard published only three stories featuring Kull in Weird Tales He revised an unsold Kull story By This Axe I Rule into The Phoenix on the Sword which introduced a new character Conan the Barbarian When The Phoenix on the Sword was published in it proved popular with the Weird Tales readers and Howard wrote more tales of Conan of which were published in the magazine br br The success of Howard s work encouraged other Weird Tales writers to create similar tales of adventure in imagined lands Clark Ashton Smith wrote his tales of the Hyperborean cycle and Zothique for Weird Tales in the s These stories revolved around the exploits of warriors and sorcerers in lands of the remote past or remote future and often had downbeat endings C L Moore inspired by Howard Smith and H P Lovecraft created the Jirel of Joiry stories for Weird Tales which brought in the first sword and sorcery heroine Moore s future husband Henry Kuttner created Elak of Atlantis a Howard inspired warrior hero for Weird Tales in br Following a change of ownership in Weird Tales ceased to publish sword and sorcery stories However the pulp magazine Unknown Worlds continued to publish sword and sorcery fiction by Fritz Leiber and Norvell W Page Leiber s stories revolved around a duo of heroes called Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser and dealt with their adventures in the world of Nehwon No When backwards Leiber s stories featured more emphasis on characterisation and humour than previous sword and sorcery fiction and his characters became popular with Unknown s readers Page s sword and sorcery tales centred on Prester John a Howard inspired gladiator adventurer whose exploits took place in Central Asia in the first century CE br With the diminution of pulp magazine sales in the late s the focus of sword and sorcery shifted to small press books Arkham House published collections by Robert E Howard Clark Ashton Smith and Fritz Leiber that included some of their sword and sorcery work Writer Jack Vance published the book The Dying Earth in The Dying Earth described the adventures of rogues and wizards on a decadent far future Earth where magic had replaced science br br In the s American paperback publisher Lancer Books began to reissue Robert E Howard s Conan stories in paperback with cover illustrations by artist Frank Frazetta These editions became surprise bestsellers selling millions of copies to a largely young readership The commercial success of the Conan books encouraged other publishers to put out new and reprinted books in the style of Howard s work br From the s until the s under the guiding force of Carter a select group of writers formed the Swordsmen and Sorcerers Guild of America SAGA to promote and enlarge the sword and sorcery genre From to five anthologies featuring short works by SAGA members were published Edited by Carter these were collectively known as Flashing Swords Because of these and other anthologies such as the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series his own fiction and his criticism Carter is considered one of the most important popularizers of genre fantasy in general and S S in particular br Despite such authors efforts some critics use sword and sorcery as a dismissive or pejorative term During the s influenced by the success of the feature film Conan the Barbarian many fantasy films some cheaply made were released in a subgenre that would be called sword sorcery br Examples of these films would include The Beastmaster film The Sword and the Sorcerer two Italian Hercules films starring Lou Ferrigno Krull film a Conan sequel Conan the Destroyer and Red Sonja which like the Conan films also starred Arnold Schwarzenegger One could potentially include the earlier releases of Hawk the Slayer and Clash of the Titans film which whetted the public s appetites for such films and the live action adaptation of the Conan inspired toy range and subsequent cartoon series Masters of the Universe film which essentially ended the subgenre s s run br After the cinema and literary boom of the early to mid s sword and sorcery once again dropped out of favor with epic fantasy largely taking its place in the fantasy genre There was though another resurgence in sword and sorcery at the end of the th century Sometimes called the new or literary sword and sorcery this development places emphasis on literary technique and draws from epic fantasy and other genres to broaden the genre s typical scope Stories may feature the wide ranging struggles of national or world spanning concerns common to high fantasy but told from the point of view of characters more common to S S and with the sense of adventure common to the latter Writers associated with this include Steven Erikson Joe Abercrombie and Scott Lynch magazines such as Black Gate and the ezines Flashing Swords not to be confused with the Lin Carter anthologies and Beneath Ceaseless Skies publish short fiction in the style According to the literary critic Higashi Masao regarding Japanese works Guin Saga and Sorcerous Stabber Orphen they were initially planned by their authors as novels that could be classified as belonging to the European sword and sorcery subgenre but had various major elements that distanced themselves from the typical novels in the genre br In the s sword and sorcery boomed in popularity in Britain and other parts of the world br br Despite the importance of C L Moore Leigh Brackett Andre Norton and other female authors as well as Moore s early heroine sword and sorcery has been characterized as having a masculine bias Female characters were generally distressed damsels to be rescued or protected or otherwise served as a reward for a male hero s adventures Women who had adventures of their own often did so to counter the threat of rape or to gain revenge for same Marion Zimmer Bradley s Sword and Sorceress anthology series onwards tried the reverse encouraging female writers and protagonists The stories feature skillful swordswomen and powerful sorceresses working from a variety of motives br Jessica Amanda Salmonson similarly sought to broaden the range of roles for female characters in sword and sorcery through her own stories and through editing the World Fantasy Award winning Amazons and Amazons II anthologies both drew on real and folkloric female warriors often from areas outside of Europe br Early sword and sorcery writer Robert E Howard had espoused feminist views in his personal and professional life He wrote to his friends and associates defending the achievements and capabilities of women Strong female characters in Howard s works of fiction include Dark Agnes de Chastillon first appearing in Sword Woman circa the early modern pirate Helen Tavrel The Isle of Pirates Doom as well as two pirates and Conan the Barbarian supporting characters B lit Queen of the Black Coast and Valeria of the Red Brotherhood Red Nails br Introduced as the co star in a non fantasy historical story by Howard entitled The Shadow of the Vulture Red Sonya of Rogatino later inspired a fantasy heroine named Red Sonja who first appeared in the comic book series Conan the Barbarian written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by Barry Windsor Smith Red Sonja got her own comic book title and eventually a series of novels by David C Smith and Richard L Tierney as well as Richard Fleischer s film adaptation in br br The genre has been defined by Robert E Howard s work especially his tales of Conan the Barbarian and Kull of Atlantis mostly in Weird Tales from and respectively br Other books and series that define the genre of sword and sorcery include br br Clark Ashton Smith s Hyperborean and Zothique tales beginning with The Tale of Satampra Zeiros and The Empire of the Necromancers in and respectively br C L Moore s Jirel of Joiry tales beginning with Black God s Kiss which introduced the first notable sword and sorcery heroine br Fritz Leiber s Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser sequence beginning with Two Sought Adventure br Michael Moorcock s Elric sequence beginning with The Dreaming City published in Science Fantasy notable for its adherence to counterstereotype br L Sprague de Camp s Swords and Sorcery the first sword

sorcery protagonist L Sprague de Camp and Lin Carter had created Juma of Kush as a secondary character in a short story published in br Gardner Fox s Kothar and Kyrik novels and Crom the Barbarian the first sword and sorcery comic series br Other pulp fantasy fiction such as Edgar Rice Burroughs Barsoom series and Leigh Brackett s Sea Kings of Mars have a similar feel to sword and sorcery But because alien science replaces the supernatural these books are usually described as planetary romance or sword and planet They fall more in the area of science fiction Despite this planetary romance closely aligns with sword and sorcery and the work of Burroughs Brackett and others in the former field have been significant in creating and spreading S S proper Sword and sorcery often blurs the lines between fantasy and science fiction drawing elements from both like the weird fiction it sprang from br Another notable sword and sorcery anthology series from through called Swords Against
