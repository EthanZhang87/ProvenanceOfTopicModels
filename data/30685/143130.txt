A leprechaun Irish lucharach n leipreach n luchorp n is a diminutive supernatural being in Irish folklore classed by some as a type of solitary fairy They are usually depicted as little bearded men wearing a coat and hat who partake in mischief In later times they have been depicted as shoe makers who have a hidden pot of gold at the end of the rainbow br Leprechaun like creatures rarely appear in Irish mythology and only became prominent in later folklore br br br Etymology br The Anglo Irish Hiberno English word leprechaun is descended from Old Irish luchorp n or luprac n via various Middle Irish forms such as luchrap n lupracc n or var luchrup n br br br Modern forms br The current spelling leipreach n is used throughout Ireland but there are numerous regional variants br John O Donovan s supplement to O Reilly s Irish English Dictionary defines lugharc n lugrac n luprac n as a sprite a pigmy a fairy of a diminutive size who always carries a purse containing a shilling br The Irish term leithbr gan in O Reilly s Dictionary has also been recognized as an alternative spelling br Other variant spellings in English have included lubrican leprehaun and lepreehawn Some modern Irish books use the spelling lioprach n The first recorded instance of the word in the English language was in Dekker s comedy The Honest Whore Part As for your Irish lubrican that spirit Whom by preposterous charms thy lust hath rais d In a wrong circle br br br Meanings br The word may have been coined as a compound of the roots l or laghu from Greek small and corp from Latin corpus body or so it had been suggested by Whitley Stokes Research published in suggests the word derives from the Luperci and associated Roman festival of Lupercalia br Folk etymology derives the word from leith half and br g brogue because of the frequent portrayal of the leprechaun as working on a single shoe as evident in the alternative spelling leithbr gan br br br Early attestations br br The earliest known reference to the leprechaun appears in the medieval tale known as the Echtra Fergus mac L ti Adventure of Fergus son of L ti The saga exists in two widely divergent versions The first of these is written in Dublin Trinity College MS pp b a better known as H CIH iii and has been dated to the eighth century Binchy The second version is a copy of the th century text written on a single leaf inserted into London British Library MS Harley f CIH ii The saga was rewritten in the th century as a burlesque version The text contains an episode in which Fergus mac L ti King of Ulster falls asleep on the beach and wakes to find himself being dragged into the sea by three l chorp in He captures his abductors who grant him three wishes in exchange for release br br br Folklore br The leprechaun is said to be a solitary creature whose principal occupation is making and cobbling shoes and who enjoys practical jokes In McAnally s account the Leprechaun was not a professional cobbler but was frequently seen mending his own shoes as he runs about so much he wears them out with great frequency This is he claims the perfect opportunity for a human being to capture the Leprechaun refusing to release him until the Leprechaun gives his captor supernatural wealth br br br Classification br The leprechaun has been classed as a solitary fairy by the writer and amateur folklorist William Butler Yeats Yeats was part of the revivalist literary movement greatly influential in calling attention to the leprechaun in the late th century This classification by Yeats is derived from D R McAnally Irish Wonders derived in turn from John O Hanlon br It is stressed that the leprechaun though some may call it fairy is clearly to be distinguished from the Aos S or the good people of the fairy mounds sidhe and raths Leprachaun being solitary is one distinguishing characteristic but additionally the leprachaun is thought to only engage in pranks on the level of mischief and requiring special caution but in contrast the Aos S may carry out deeds more menacing to humans e g the spiriting away of children br This identification of leprechaun as a fairy has been consigned to popular notion by modern folklorist Diarmuid Gioll in Gioll in observes that the dwarf of Teutonic and other traditions as well as the household familiar are more amenable to comparison br According to William Butler Yeats the great wealth of the leprechauns comes from the treasure crocks buried of old in war time which they have uncovered and appropriated According to David Russell McAnally the leprechaun is the son of an evil spirit and a degenerate fairy and is not wholly good nor wholly evil br br br Appearance br br The leprechaun originally had a different appearance depending on where in Ireland he was found Before the th century it was generally held that the leprechaun wore red not green Samuel Lover writing in describes the leprechaun as quite a beau in his dress notwithstanding for he wears a red square cut coat richly laced with gold and inexpressible of the same cocked hat shoes and buckles br According to Yeats the solitary fairies like the leprechaun wear red jackets whereas the trooping fairies wear green Yeats leprechaun wore a jacket with seven rows of buttons with seven buttons to each row Yeats describes that on the western coast the red jacket is covered by a frieze one whereas in Ulster the creature wears a cocked hat and when he is up to anything unusually mischievous he leaps onto a wall and spins balancing himself on the point of the hat with his heels in the air br According to McAnally the universal leprechaun is described as follows br br He is about three feet high and is dressed in a little red jacket or roundabout with red breeches buckled at the knee gray or black stockings and a hat cocked in the style of a century ago over a little old withered face Round his neck is an Elizabethan ruff and frills of lace are at his wrists On the wild west coast where the Atlantic winds bring almost constant rains he dispenses with ruff and frills and wears a frieze overcoat over his pretty red suit so that unless on the lookout for the cocked hat ye might pass a Leprechawn on the road and never know it s himself that s in it at all br This dress varied by region In McAnally s account there were differences between leprechauns or Logherymans from different regions br br The Northern Leprechaun or Logheryman wore a military red coat and white breeches with a broad brimmed high pointed hat on which he would sometimes stand upside down br The Lurigadawne of Tipperary wore an antique slashed jacket of red with peaks all round and a jockey cap also sporting a sword which he uses as a magic wand br The Luricawne of Kerry was a fat pursy little fellow whose jolly round face rivals in redness the cut a way jacket he wears that always has seven rows of seven buttons in each row br The Cluricawne of Monaghan wore a swallow tailed evening coat of red with green vest white breeches black stockings shiny shoes and a long cone hat without a brim sometimes used as a weapon br In a poem entitled The Lepracaun or Fairy Shoemaker th century Irish poet William Allingham describes the appearance of the leprechaun as br br A wrinkled wizen d and bearded Elf br Spectacles stuck on his pointed nose br Silver buckles to his hose br br Leather apron shoe in his lap br The modern image of the leprechaun sitting on a toadstool having a red beard and green hat etc is a more modern invention or borrowed from other strands of European folklore The most likely explanation for the modern day Leprechaun appearance is that green is a traditional national Irish color dating back as far as The hat might be derived from the style of outdated fashion still common in Ireland in the th century This style of fashion was commonly worn by Irish immigrants to the United States since some Elizabethan era clothes were still common in Ireland in the th century long after they were out of fashion as depicted by the Stage Irish The buckle shoes and other garments also have their origin in the Elizabethan period in Ireland br br br Similar creatures br The leprechaun is similar to the clurichaun and the far darrig in that he is a solitary creature Some writers even go as far as to substitute these second two less well known spirits for the leprechaun in stories or tales to reach a wider audience The clurichaun is considered by some to be merely a leprechaun on a drinking spree br br br In politics br In the politics of the Republic of Ireland leprechauns have been used to refer to the twee aspects of the tourism field in Ireland This can be seen from this example of John A Costello addressing the Oireachtas in br br For many years we were afflicted with the miserable trivialities of our tourist advertising Sometimes it descended to the lowest depths to the caubeen and the shillelagh not to speak of the leprechaun br br br Popular culture br br Films animated cartoons and advertising have popularised a specific image of leprechauns which bears little resemblance to anything found in the cycles of Irish folklore Some argue that the popularised image of the leprechaun is little more than a series of stereotypes based on derogatory anti Irish th century caricatures br Many Celtic music groups have used the term leprechaun as part of their naming convention or as an album title Some popular forms of American music including heavy metal celtic metal punk rock and jazz have also made use of the mythological character br Famous leprechaun characters include br br Lucky the mascot of Lucky Charms cereal created by General Mills br The Notre Dame Leprechaun official mascot of the Fighting Irish sports teams at the University of Notre Dame br Lucky the Leprechaun mascot of the Boston Celtics who is featured on the team s logo br Hornswoggle a character created by professional wrestler Dylan Mark Postl who competed under the persona for the majority of his WWE tenure br The American horror slasher film Leprechaun and its sequels feature a killer leprechaun portrayed by Warwick Davis br Nobel Prize winning economist Paul Krugman coined the term leprechaun economics to describe distorted or unsound economic data which he first used in a tweet on July in response to the publication by the Irish Central Statistics Office CSO that Irish GDP had grown by and Irish GNP had grown by in the Irish national accounts The growth was subsequently shown to be due to Apple restructuring its double Irish tax scheme which the EU Commission had fined bn in Irish unpaid taxes the largest corporate tax fine in history The term has been used many times since br In the U S Leprechauns are often associated with St Patrick s Day along with the color green and shamrocks br br br Darby O Gill br The Disney film Darby O Gill and the Little People based on Herminie Templeton Kavanagh s Darby O Gill books which features a leprechaun king is a work in which Fergus mac L ti was featured parenthetically In the film the captured leprechaun king grants three wishes like Fergus in the saga br While the film project was in development Walt Disney was in contact with and consulting S amus Delargy and the Irish Folklore Commission but never asked for leprechaun material even though a large folkloric repository on such subject was housed by the commission br br br See also br Crichton Leprechaun br Irish mythology in popular culture br Leprechaun traps br Mooinjer veggey
