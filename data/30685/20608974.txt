title: Sol (Roman mythology)
id: 20608974
Sol is the personification of the Sun and a god in ancient Roman religion It was long thought that Rome actually had two different consecutive sun gods The first Sol Indiges Latin the deified sun was thought to have been unimportant disappearing altogether at an early period Only in the late Roman Empire scholars argued did the solar cult re appear with the arrival in Rome of the Syrian Sol Invictus Latin the unconquered sun perhaps under the influence of the Mithraic mysteries Publications from the mid s have challenged the notion of two different sun gods in Rome pointing to the abundant evidence for the continuity of the cult of Sol and the lack of any clear differentiation either in name or depiction between the early and late Roman sun god br br br Etymology br br The Latin sol for Sun is believed to originate in the Proto Indo European language as a continuation of the heteroclitic Seh ul Sh en and thus cognate to other solar deities in other Indo European languages Germanic Sol Sanskrit Surya Avestan Hvare khshaeta Greek Helios Lithuanian Saul Also compare Latin sol to Etruscan usil Today Romance languages still use reflexes of sol e g Italian sole Portuguese sol Spanish sol Romanian soare and French soleil as the main word for sun br br br In the Roman Republic br According to Roman sources the worship of Sol was introduced by Titus Tatius shortly after the foundation of Rome In Virgil he is the grandfather of Latinus the son of Sol s daughter Circe who lived not far from Rome at Monte Circeo A shrine to Sol stood on the banks of the Numicius near many important shrines of early Latin religion br In Rome Sol had an old temple in the Circus Maximus according to Tacitus CE and this temple remained important in the first three centuries CE There was also an old shrine for Sol on the Quirinal where an annual sacrifice was offered to Sol Indiges on August to commemorate Caesar s victory at Pharsala BCE The Roman ritual calendars or fasti also mention a feast for Sol Indiges on December and a sacrifice for Sol and Luna on August Traditionally scholars have considered Sol Indiges to represent an earlier more agrarian form in which the Roman god Sol was worshipped and considered him to be very different from the late Roman Sol Invictus who they believed was a predominantly Syrian deity Neither the epithet indiges which fell out of use sometime after Caesar nor the epithet invictus are used with any consistency however making it impossible to differentiate between the two br br br Sol Invictus br br Sol Invictus English translated as Unconquered Sun was long thought to have been a foreign state supported sun god introduced from either Emesa or Palmyra in Syria by the emperor Aurelian in and overshadowing other Eastern cults in importance until the abolition of classical Roman religion under Theodosius I However the evidence for this is meager at best and the notion that Aurelian introduced a new cult of the sun ignores the abundant evidence on coins in images in inscriptions and in other sources for a strong presence of the sun god in Rome throughout the imperial period Tertullian died CE writes that the Circus Maximus was dedicated primarily to Sol During the reign of Aurelian a new college of pontiffs for Sol was established There is some debate over the significance of the date December for the cult of Sol According to a single late source the Romans held a festival on December of Dies Natalis Invicti the birthday of the unconquered one Most scholars assume Sol Invictus was meant although our source for this festival does not state so explicitly br December was commonly indicated as the date of the winter solstice with the first detectable lengthening of daylight hours The Philocalian calendar of AD part VI gives a festival of NATALIS INVICTI on December There is limited evidence that this festival was celebrated before the mid th century The same Philocalian calendar part VIII also mentions the birth of Jesus Christ stating that the Lord Jesus Christ was born eight days before the calends of January that is on December Since the th century there have been speculations that the near solstice date of December for Christmas was selected because it was the date of the festival of DIES NATALIS SOLIS INVICTI but historians of late antiquity make no mention of this and others speculate Aurelian chose December to shadow early Christian celebrations already on the rise When the festival on December was instituted is not clear which makes it hard to assess what impact if any it had on the establishment of Christmas br There were also festivals on other days in December including the th mentioned above as well as August Gordon points out that none of these other festivals are linked to astronomical events br Throughout the th century the cult of Sol continued to be maintained by high ranking pontiffs including the renowned Vettius Agorius Praetextatus br br br Connection to emperors br br According to the Historia Augusta Elagabalus the teenaged Severan heir adopted the name of his deity and brought his cult image from Emesa to Rome Once installed as emperor he neglected Rome s traditional State deities and promoted his own as Rome s most powerful deity This ended with his murder in The Historia Augusta equates the deity Elagabalus with Jupiter and Sol fuit autem Heliogabali vel Iovis vel Solis sacerdos He was also a priest of Heliogabalus or Jove or Sol While this has been seen as an attempt to import the Syrian sun god to Rome the Roman cult of Sol had existed in Rome at least since the early Republic br As the Cult of Sol grew and Sol took on attributes of other deities Sol began to be used as a way to display imperial power The radiate crown shown on some emperor s portraits on coins minted in the rd century was associated with Sol and may have been influenced by earlier depictions of Alexander the Great Some coins minted in the th century depict Sol on one side Constantine I wore the radiate crown though some argue that it was intended to represent the Holy Nails and not Sol br br br Identification with other deities br Sol was most notably identified with Phoebus Apollo such equation famously occurs in Varro and Ovid The Greek assimilation of Apollo and Helios was already established in Rome by the end of the republic br Various Roman philosophers speculated on the nature of the sun without arriving at any consensus A typical example is Nigidius a scholar of the st century BCE His works have not survived but writing five centuries later Macrobius reports that Nigidius argued that Sol was to be identified with Janus and that he had a counterpart Jana who was Luna As such they were to be regarded as the highest of the gods receiving their sacrifices before all the others Such speculations appear to have been restricted to an erudite elite and had no impact on the well attested cult of Sol as independent deity No ancient source aside from Macrobius mentions the equation of Sol with Janus br br br Connection to Mithras br Sol appears many times in depictions of Mithras such as the Tauroctony of Mithras killing the bull and looking at Sol over his shoulder They appear in other scenes together from Mithras ascending behind Sol s chariot shaking hands and some depictions of Sol kneeling to Mithras Mithras was known as Sol Invictus even though Sol is a separate deity a paradoxical relationship where they are each other but separate They are separate deities but due to some similarities a connection between them can be created which can lead to one over taking the other br br br See also br Amshuman br Black Sun alchemy br Guaraci br List of solar
