Folk rock is a fusion genre of rock music with heavy influences from pop English and American folk music It typically combines elements of folk and rock music together it arose in the United States Canada and the United Kingdom in the mid s In the U S folk rock emerged from the folk music revival Performers such as Bob Dylan and the Byrds several of whose members had earlier played in folk ensembles attempted to blend the sounds of rock with their pre existing folk repertoire adopting the use of electric instrumentation and drums in a way previously discouraged in the U S folk community The term folk rock was initially used in the U S music press in June to describe the Byrds music br The commercial success of the Byrds cover version of Dylan s Mr Tambourine Man and their debut album of the same name along with Dylan s own recordings with rock instrumentation on the albums Bringing It All Back Home Highway Revisited and Blonde on Blonde encouraged other folk acts such as Simon Garfunkel to use electric backing on their records and new groups such as Buffalo Springfield to form Dylan s controversial appearance at the Newport Folk Festival on July where he was backed by an electric band was also a pivotal moment in the development of the genre br During the late s in Britain and Europe a distinct eclectic British folk rock style was created by Pentangle Fairport Convention and Alan Stivell Inspired by British psychedelic folk and the North American style of folk rock British folk rock bands began to incorporate elements of traditional British folk music into their repertoire leading to other variants including the overtly English folk rock of the Albion Band and Celtic rock br br br Definition and etymology br Folk rock refers to the blending of elements of folk and rock music which arose in the U S and UK in the mid s The genre was pioneered by the Byrds who began playing traditional folk music and songs by Bob Dylan with rock instrumentation in a style heavily influenced by the Beatles and other British Invasion bands br The term folk rock was coined in the June issue of the American music magazine Billboard by the journalist Eliot Siegel Siegel used the term principally to describe the music of the Byrds who had issued their debut album in the U S that month In the same article he wrote that Billy J Kramer Jackie DeShannon and Sonny Cher had all started incorporating folk oriented material on singles and he listed Rising Sons Joe and Eddie and the Lovin Spoonful as new folk rock acts Dylan also contributed to the creation of the genre with his recordings utilizing rock instrumentation on the albums Bringing It All Back Home Highway Revisited and Blonde on Blonde br In a broader sense folk rock encompasses similarly inspired musical genres and movements in different regions of the world Folk rock may lean more towards either folk or rock in instrumentation playing and vocal style and choice of material While the original genre draws on music of Europe and North America there is no clear delineation of which other culture s music might be included as influences br br br Antecedents br br br Folk revival br br The American folk music revival began during the s building on the interest in protest folk singers such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger it reached a peak in popularity in the mid s with artists such as Bob Dylan and Joan Baez In Seeger formed the Weavers whose mainstream popularity set the stage for the folk revival of the s and early s and also served to bridge the gap between folk popular music and topical song The Weavers sound and repertoire of traditional folk material and topical songs directly inspired the Kingston Trio a three piece folk group who came to prominence in with their hit recording of Tom Dooley The Kingston Trio provided the template for a flood of collegiate folk groups between and br At roughly the same time as these collegiate folk vocal groups came to national prominence a second group of urban folk revivalists influenced by the music and guitar picking styles of folk and blues artist such as Woody Guthrie Lead Belly Brownie McGhee and Josh White also came to the fore Many of these urban revivalists were influenced by recordings of traditional American music from the s and s which had been reissued by Folkways Records Harry Smith s Anthology of American Folk Music was particularly influential While this urban folk revival flourished in many cities New York City with its burgeoning Greenwich Village coffeehouse scene and population of topical folk singers was widely regarded as the centre of the movement Out of this fertile environment came such folk protest luminaries as Bob Dylan Tom Paxton Phil Ochs and Peter Paul and Mary many of whom would transition into folk rock performers as the s progressed br br The vast majority of the urban folk revivalists shared a disdain for the values of mainstream American mass culture and led many folk singers to begin composing their own protest material The influence of this folk protest movement would later manifest itself in the sociopolitical lyrics and mildly anti establishment sentiments of many folk rock songs including hit singles such as Eve of Destruction Like a Rolling Stone For What It s Worth and Let s Live for Today br During the s and early s in the UK a parallel folk revival referred to as the second British folk revival was led by folk singers Ewan MacColl and Bert Lloyd Both viewed British folk music as a vehicle for leftist political concepts and an antidote to the American dominated popular music of the time However it was not until and the advent of the skiffle craze that the British folk revival crossed over into the mainstream and connected with British youth culture Skiffle renewed popularity of folk music forms in Britain and led directly to the progressive folk movement and the attendant British folk club scene Among the leading lights of the progressive folk movement were Bert Jansch and John Renbourn who would later form the folk rock band Pentangle in the late s Other notable folk rock artists with roots in the progressive folk scene were Donovan Al Stewart John Martyn and Paul Simon br br br The Beatles and the British Invasion br br Beginning in and lasting until roughly a wave of British beat groups including the Beatles the Rolling Stones the Dave Clark Five Gerry the Pacemakers the Kinks and Herman s Hermits amongst others dominated the U S music charts These groups were all heavily influenced by American rock n roll blues and R B musical genres they had been introduced to via homegrown British rock n roll singers imported American records and the music of the skiffle craze These UK groups known collectively as the British Invasion reintroduced American youth culture to the broad potential of rock and pop music as a creative medium and to the wealth of musical culture to be found within the United States br br Of particular importance to the development of folk rock by the British Invasion were the subtle folk influences evident in such Beatles compositions as I ll Be Back Things We Said Today and I m a Loser with the latter song being directly inspired by folk singer songwriter Bob Dylan In the opinion of Roger McGuinn of the Byrds writers who attempt to define the origins of folk rock don t realise that the Beatles were responsible as far back as He cites She Loves You as one of the first examples where the Beatles introduced folk chord changes into rock music and so initiated the new genre These songs were all influential in providing a template for successfully assimilating folk based chord progressions and melodies into pop music This melding of folk and rock n roll in the Beatles music became even more explicit during with the release of You ve Got to Hide Your Love Away a folk derived song with introspective lyrics again influenced by Dylan Although the Beatles themselves utilized folk as just one of many styles evident in their music the underlying folk influences in a number of their songs would prove to be important to folk rock musicians attempting to blend their own folk influences with beat music br The effect that the music of these British bands and the Beatles in particular had on young Americans was immediate almost overnight folk along with many other forms of homegrown music became pass for a large proportion of America s youth who instead turned their attention to the influx of British acts The influence of these acts also impacted on the collegiate folk and urban folk communities with many young musicians quickly losing interest in folk music and instead embracing the rock n roll derived repertoire of the British Invasion Future members of many folk rock acts including the Byrds Jefferson Airplane the Lovin Spoonful the Mamas the Papas and Buffalo Springfield all turned their backs on traditional folk music during and as a direct result of the influence of the Beatles and the other British Invasion bands Author and music historian Richie Unterberger has noted that the Beatles impact on American popular culture effectively sounded the death knell for the American folk music revival br In addition to The Beatles the two British groups that were arguably the most influential on the development of folk rock were the Animals and the Searchers The Animals released a rock interpretation of the traditional folk song The House of the Rising Sun in the U S in August The song reached number on the Billboard Hot singles chart and stayed there for three weeks selling over a million copies in just five weeks in the U S The band s arrangement of The House of the Rising Sun which transmuted the song from an acoustic folk lament to a full bore electric rock song would go on to influence many folk rock acts but none more so than Dylan himself who cited it as a key factor in his decision to record and perform with an electric rock band in br br br Electric Twelve String Guitar in Folk Music br The Searchers were influential in popularizing the jangly sound of the electric twelve string guitar Many musicians in the collegiate and urban folk movements were already familiar with acoustic twelve string guitars via the music of folk and blues singer Lead Belly However the Searchers use of amplified twelve strings provided another example of how conventional folk elements could be incorporated into rock music to produce new and exciting sounds The Beatles lead guitarist George Harrison also influenced this trend towards jangly guitars in folk rock with his use of a Rickenbacker twelve string guitar on the Beatles mid s recordings This relatively clean jangly sound without distortion or other guitar effects became a cornerstone of folk rock instrumentation and was used in many American folk rock records made during and br br br Other precursors br br Although folk rock mainly grew out of a mix of American folk revival and British Invasion influences there were also a few examples of proto folk rock that were important in the development of the genre Of these secondary influences Unterberger has cited the self penned folk influenced material of San Francisco s the Beau Brummels as arguably the most important Despite their Beatlesque image the band s use of minor chords haunting harmonies and folky acoustic guitar playing as heard on their debut single Laugh Laugh was stylistically very similar to the later folk rock of the Byrds Released in December Laugh Laugh peaked at number on the Billboard Hot in early while its similarly folk flavored follow up Just a Little did even better reaching number on the U S singles chart The high profile success of the Beau Brummels music was important in demonstrating that a hybrid of folk and rock could potentially be translated into mainstream commercial success br Pre dating the Beau Brummels commercial breakthrough by almost two years singer songwriter Jackie DeShannon s April single Needles and Pins marked according to Unterberger the earliest appearance of the ringing guitar sound that would become a mainstay of early folk rock This use of cyclical chiming guitar riffs was repeated on DeShannon s late recording of her own composition When You Walk in the Room The following year both songs would become hits for the Liverpudlian band the Searchers who chose to place even greater emphasis on the jangly guitar playing in the songs In addition a number of DeShannon s songs from the period including When You Walk in the Room displayed a greater degree of lyrical maturity and sensuality than was usual for pop songs of the time This heightened degree of emotional introspection was inspired by her love of Bob Dylan s folk songwriting and represents one of the first attempts by an American artist to absorb folk sensibilities into rock music br In the UK the folk group the Springfields featuring Dusty Springfield had been releasing folk oriented material featuring full band arrangements since the early s including renditions of Lonesome Traveler Allentown Jail and Silver Threads and Golden Needles Although these records owed more to orchestral pop than rock they were nonetheless influential on up and coming folk rock musicians on both sides of the Atlantic In mid folk singer songwriter Donovan was also experimenting with adding electrified instrumentation to some of his folk and blues styled material as evidenced by songs such as You re Gonna Need Somebody on Your Bond and Sunny Goodge Street In spite of his folky persona and repertoire Donovan himself had always considered himself a pop star rather than a folk singer As a result he had been thinking of a way in which to introduce folk styled acoustic guitars and socially conscious lyrics into pop music for several years prior to his breakthrough as a recording artist By January he had recorded the self penned hit Sunshine Superman with a full electric backing band br Other bands and solo artists who were blurring the boundaries between folk and rock in the early s include Judy Henske Richard and Mimi Fari a and the Mugwumps the latter of which were a New York band featuring future members of the Lovin Spoonful and the Mamas the Papas Also of note are the Australian band the Seekers who had relocated to England in and reached number on the UK Singles Chart with I ll Never Find Another You in February Unterberger has noted that although it was not strictly a folk song I ll Never Find Another You was heavily influenced by Peter Paul and Mary and featured a cyclical twelve string guitar part that sounded similar to the guitar style that Jim McGuinn of the Byrds would popularize later that same year br There are also a few antecedents to folk rock present in pre British Invasion American rock n roll including Elvis Presley s cover of the Bill Monroe bluegrass standard Blue Moon of Kentucky Buddy Holly s self penned material which strongly influenced both Dylan and the Byrds Ritchie Valens recording of the Mexican folk song La Bamba Lloyd Price s rock n roll adaptation of the African American folk song Stagger Lee originally recorded by Mississippi John Hurt in Jimmie Rodgers rock n roll flavored renditions of traditional folk songs and the folk and country influenced recordings featured on the Everly Brothers album Songs Our Daddy Taught Us br br br s br br br The Byrds br br The moment when all of the separate influences that served to make up folk rock finally coalesced into an identifiable whole was with the release of the Byrds recording of Bob Dylan s Mr Tambourine Man The term folk rock was coined by the U S music press to describe the band s sound in June at roughly the same time as Mr Tambourine Man peaked at number on the Billboard chart Within three months it had become the first folk rock smash hit reaching number on both the Billboard Hot and the UK Singles Chart The single s success initiated the folk rock boom of and during which a profusion of Byrds influenced acts flooded the American and British charts In particular the Byrds influence can be discerned in mid s recordings by acts such as the Lovin Spoonful Barry McGuire the Mamas the Papas Simon Garfunkel Jefferson Airplane the Turtles We Five Love and Sonny Cher br It was during the rehearsals at World Pacific that the band began to develop the blend of folk music and Beatles style pop that would characterize their sound However this hybrid was not deliberately created it evolved organically out of some of the band members own folk music roots and their desire to emulate the Beatles The band s folk influences lack of experience with rock music forms and Beatleseque instrumentation all combined to color both their self penned material and their folk derived repertoire The band themselves soon realized that there was something unique about their music and with Dickson s encouragement they began to actively attempt to bridge the gap between folk and rock br Mr Tambourine Man s blend of abstract lyrics folk influenced melody complex harmonies jangly string Rickenbacker guitar playing and Beatles influenced beat resulted in a synthesis that effectively created the subgenre of folk rock The song s lyrics alone took rock and pop songwriting to new heights never before had such intellectual and literary lyrics been combined with rock instrumentation by a popular music group br Dylan s material would provide much of the original grist for the folk rock mill not only in the U S but in the UK as well with many pop and rock acts covering his material in a style reminiscent of the Byrds Their reworking of Mr Tambourine Man along with the Animals rock interpretation of The House of the Rising Sun itself based on Dylan s earlier cover helped to give Dylan the impetus to start recording with an electric backing band br As the s dawned folk rock evolved away from the jangly template pioneered by the Byrds but their influence could still be heard in the music of bands like Fairport Convention and Pentangle The Byrds themselves continued to enjoy commercial success with their brand of folk rock throughout most notably with their number single Turn Turn Turn By the start of however the group had begun to move away from folk rock and into the new musical frontier of psychedelic rock The folk rock sound of the Byrds has continued to influence many bands over the years including Big Star Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers R E M the Long Ryders the Smiths the Bangles the Stone Roses and Teenage Fanclub among others br br br Bob Dylan br br Five days before the Byrds entered Columbia Studios in Hollywood to record his song Mr Tambourine Man Bob Dylan completed the recording sessions for his fifth album Bringing It All Back Home Of the eleven tracks on the album seven featured Dylan backed by a full electric rock band in stark contrast to his earlier acoustic folk albums Dylan s decision to record with an electric backing band had been influenced by a number of factors including the Beatles coupling of folk derived chord progressions and beat music the Byrds rock adaptation of Mr Tambourine Man which Dylan had heard at a Byrds rehearsal in late and the Animals hit cover of The House of the Rising Sun br Bringing It All Back Home was released on March peaking at number on the Billboard Top LPs chart and on the UK Album Chart The album s blend of rhythm and blues derived rock and abstract poetic lyrics was immediately influential in demonstrating that intelligent lyrical content could be wedded with rock n roll The songs on the album saw Dylan leaving folk music far behind Even with this folkier acoustic material Dylan s biting apocalyptical and often humorous lyrics went far beyond those of contemporary folk music particularly the folk protest music with which he had been previously associated br On July Dylan released the groundbreaking Like a Rolling Stone a six minute long scathing put down directed at a down and out society girl which again featured Dylan backed by an electric rock band Released just as the Byrds cover of Mr Tambourine Man topped the charts in the United States the song was instrumental in defining the burgeoning folk rock scene and in establishing Dylan as a bona fide rock star rather than a folksinger Like a Rolling Stone managed to reach the Top on both sides of the Atlantic Five days after the release of Like a Rolling Stone on July Dylan made a controversial appearance at the Newport Folk Festival performing three songs with a full band He was met with derisive booing and jeering from the festival s purist folk music crowd but in the years since the incident Dylan s Newport Folk Festival appearance has become widely regarded as a pivotal moment in the synthesis of folk and rock br Dylan followed Like a Rolling Stone with the wholly electric album Highway Revisited and the non album single Positively th Street which itself has been widely interpreted as a rebuke to the folk purists who had rejected his new electric music Throughout and hit singles like Subterranean Homesick Blues Like a Rolling Stone Positively th Street and I Want You among others along with the Bringing It All Back Home Highway Revisited and Blonde on Blonde albums proved to be hugely influential on the development and popularity of folk rock Although Dylan s move away from acoustic folk music served to outrage and alienate much of his original fanbase his new folk rock sound gained him legions of new fans during the mid s The popularity and commercial success of the Byrds and Bob Dylan s blend of folk and rock music influenced a wave of imitators and emulators that retroactively became known as the folk rock boom br br br Tom Wilson br br Although he started out as a jazz musician the young African American Columbia Records producer Tom Wilson became known as the mid wife of folk rock for his seminal work behind the scenes As Bob Dylan s producer during the key transitional albums The Times They Are A Changin Another Side of Bob Dylan and Bringing It All Back Home he was a key architect of Dylan s electric sound He is perhaps even better known however for first discovering Simon Garfunkel at the tail end of the folk movement and then transforming them into folk rock superstars with the unauthorized rock remix that made a number one hit out of their previously underappreciated song The Sound of Silence br br br Other musicians br br Music critic Richie Unterberger has noted that the commercial success of the Byrds cover version of Dylan s Mr Tambourine Man along with Dylan s own contributions to the genre on the albums Bringing It All Back Home Highway Revisited and Blonde on Blonde initiated an explosion of emulators and imitators Their success led record producer Tom Wilson to add electric guitar bass and drums overdubs to The Sounds of Silence a song which had been recorded by the folk duo Simon Garfunkel in and first released on their album Wednesday Morning A M The reissued single rose to number on the Billboard pop chart in late became a hit around the world and set the duo on one of the most successful careers in pop and rock music Simon and Garfunkel have been described as folk rock s greatest duo and one whose fame and influence would persist well beyond folk rock s heyday br One of the first bands to craft a distinctly American sound in response to the British Invasion was the Beach Boys while not a folk rock band themselves they directly influenced the genre and at the height of the folk rock boom in had a hit with a cover of the s West Indian folk song Sloop John B which they had learned from the Kingston Trio who had learned it from the Weavers br Much of the early folk rock music emerged during a time of general global upheaval the Vietnam War and new concerns for the world by young people In the United States the heyday of folk rock was arguably between the mid sixties and the mid seventies when it aligned itself with the hippie movement and became an important medium for expressing radical ideas Cities such as San Francisco Denver New York City and Phoenix became centers for the folk rock culture playing on their central locations among the original folk circuits The unplugged and simplified sound of the music reflected the genre s connection to a critical view of a technological and consumerist society Unlike pop music s escapist lyrics arguably a fantasy distraction from the problems in life folk artists attempted to communicate concerns for peace global awareness and other touchstones of the era Bands whose music was significantly folk rock in sound during the mid to late s included Donovan the Lovin Spoonful the Mamas the Papas the Youngbloods Love and in their early years Jefferson Airplane br In the mid s singer songwriter Gordon Lightfoot began moving his folk songs into a folk rock direction with recordings such as the percussion driven Black Day in July about the Detroit riot He would rise to top the charts in the s with a number of his folk rock recordings such as Sundown and Carefree Highway and eventually become known as a folk rock legend Some artists who originally produced with a harder edged rock sound found the ability to communicate more easily and felt more genuine in this method of delivery In this category was Cat Stevens who began in London much like the Byrds did in the United States but toned down the sound more frequently with acoustic instruments He performed songs that contained concern for the environment war and the future of the world in general The Canadian singer songwriter Joni Mitchell won many Grammy Awards with her folk rock pop songs br br br Related movements br br br British folk rock br br British folk rock developed in Britain during the mid to late s by the bands Fairport Convention and Pentangle It uses traditional British music and self penned compositions in a traditional style and is played on a combination of traditional and rock instruments This incorporation of traditional British folk music influences gives British folk rock its distinctly British character and flavour It evolved out of the psychedelia influenced folk rock of British acts such as Donovan the Incredible String Band and Tyrannosaurus Rex but was also heavily influenced by such American folk rock bands as the Byrds Love and Buffalo Springfield British folk rock was at its most significant and popular during the late s and s when in addition to Fairport and Pentangle it was taken up by groups such as Steeleye Span and the Albion Band br Steeleye Span founded by Fairport Convention bass player Ashley Hutchings was made up of traditionalist folk musicians who wished to incorporate electrical amplification and later overt rock elements into their music This in turn spawned the conspicuously English folk rock music of the Albion Band a group that also included Hutchings In Brittany folk rock was developed by Alan Stivell who began to mix his Breton Irish and Scottish roots with rock music and later by French bands like Malicorne During this same period folk rock was adopted and developed in the surrounding Celtic cultures of Ireland Scotland Wales Brittany and Cornwall to produce Celtic rock and its derivatives br br br Country folk br br A subgenre originally arising from the early s folk and country influenced music of singer songwriter artists such as Bob Dylan and Bobby Bare as well as from folk revivalist vocal groups like the Kingston Trio During the late s many folk rock artists including Dylan Ian and Sylvia and the Byrds began to incorporate a strong country influence into their music drawing heavily on Hank Williams Merle Haggard and Buck Owens amongst others resulting in the concurrent offshoot of country rock This successful blending of country folk and rock styles led to pioneering country folk records by folk influenced singer songwriters such as John Denver and Neil Young during the s Country folk music usually displays a softer more laid back feel than the majority of country music and is often complemented by introspective lyrics thus preserving its folk singer songwriter roots Since the s the country folk subgenre has been perpetuated by artists including John Prine Nanci Griffith Kathy Mattea Mary Chapin Carpenter and Iris DeMent br br br Celtic rock br br A subgenre of folk rock that combines traditional Celtic instrumentation with rock rhythms often influenced by a wide variety of pop and rock music styles It emerged from the electric folk music of the late s and was pioneered by bands such as Horslips who blended Gaelic mythology traditional Irish music and rock The British singer songwriter Donovan was also influential in developing Celtic rock during the late s with his albums The Hurdy Gurdy Man Barabajagal and Open Road the latter of which actually featured a song entitled Celtic Rock br The subgenre was further popularised in by Thin Lizzy who had a hit with Whiskey in the Jar a traditional Irish song performed entirely in the rock idiom Throughout the s Celtic rock held close to its folk roots drawing heavily on traditional Celtic fiddle pipe and harp tunes as well as traditional vocal styles but making use of rock band levels of amplification and percussion In the s and beyond Celtic rock was perpetuated by bands such as the Pogues the Waterboys Runrig Black and the Prodigals A more recent folk rock band based in England is the BibleCode Sundays Celtic rock is also popular in Spain where bands such as Celtas Cortos have had a large following since the early s br br br Medieval folk rock br br Medieval folk rock developed as a subgenre of electric folk from about as performers particularly in England Germany and Brittany adopted medieval and renaissance music as a basis for their music in contrast to the early modern and nineteenth century ballads that dominated the output of Fairport Convention This followed the trend explored by Steeleye Span and exemplified by their album Below the Salt Acts in this area included Gryphon Gentle Giant and Third Ear Band In Germany Ougenweide originally formed in as an acoustic folk group opted to draw exclusively on High German medieval music when they electrified setting the agenda for future German electric folk In Brittany as part of the Celtic rock movement medieval music was focused on by bands like Ripaille from and Saga de Ragnar Lodbrock from However by the end of the s almost all of these performers had either disbanded or moved like Gentle Giant and Gryphon into the developing area of progressive rock In the s as part of the wider resurgence of folk music in general new medieval folk rock acts began to appear including the Ritchie Blackmore project Blackmore s Night German bands such as In Extremo Subway to Sally or Schandmaul and English bands like Circulus br br br Progressive folk rock br br In Britain the tendency to electrify brought several progressive folk acts into rock This includes the acoustic duo Tyrannosaurus Rex who became the electric combo T Rex Others probably influenced by the electric folk pioneered by Fairport Convention from moved towards more traditional material a category including Dando Shaft Amazing Blondel and Jack the Lad an offshoot of northern progressive folk group Lindisfarne who were one of the most successful UK bands of the early s Examples of bands that remained firmly on the border between progressive folk and progressive rock were the short lived but later reunited Comus and more successfully Renaissance who combined folk and rock with elements of classical music br br br Folk metal br br Folk metal is a fusion genre of heavy metal music and traditional folk music that developed in Europe during the s It is characterised by the widespread use of folk instruments and to a lesser extent traditional singing styles for example Dutch Heidevolk Danish Sylvatica and Spanish Stone of Erech It also sometimes features soft instrumentation influenced by folk rock br The earliest folk metal bands were Skyclad from England Cruachan from Ireland and Mago de Oz from Spain Skyclad s debut album The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth was released in and would be considered a thrash metal album with some folk influences unlike Cruachan s early work which embraced the folk element as a defining part of their sound It was not until and that other early contributors in the genre began to emerge from different regions of Europe and beyond Among these early groups the German band Subway to Sally spearheaded a different regional variation that over time became known as medieval metal Despite their contributions folk metal remained little known with few representatives during the s It was not until the early s when the genre exploded into prominence particularly in Finland with the efforts of such groups as Finntroll Ensiferum Korpiklaani Turisas and Moonsorrow br The music of folk metal is characterised by its diversity with bands known to perform different styles of both heavy metal music and folk music A large variety of folk instruments are used in the genre with many bands consequently featuring six or more members in their regular line ups A few bands are also known to rely on keyboards to simulate the sound of folk instruments Lyrics
