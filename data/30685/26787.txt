ideas and has sometimes been described as an exploration of the potential consequences of scientific social and technological innovations or as an outlet to anticipate future scientific and technological innovations Besides providing entertainment it can also criticize present day society and explore alternatives It is also often said to inspire a sense of wonder br br According to Isaac Asimov Science fiction can be defined as that branch of literature which deals with the reaction of human beings to changes in science and technology Robert A Heinlein wrote that A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read realistic speculation about possible future events based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world past and present and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method br American science fiction author and editor Lester del Rey wrote Even the devoted aficionado or fan has a hard time trying to explain what science fiction is and the lack of a full satisfactory definition is because there are no easily delineated limits to science fiction br Another definition comes from The Literature Book by DK and is scenarios that are at the time of writing technologically impossible extrapolating from present day science or that deal with some form of speculative science based conceit such as a society on Earth or another planet that has developed in wholly different ways from our own br Part of the reason that it is so difficult to pin down an agreed definition of science fiction is because there is a tendency among science fiction enthusiasts to act as their own arbiter in deciding what exactly constitutes science fiction Damon Knight summed up the difficulty saying Science fiction is what we point to when we say it David Seed says it may be more useful to talk about science fiction as the intersection of other more concrete genres and subgenres br br Forrest J Ackerman has been

for those that are more serious or thoughtful br br Some scholars assert that science fiction had its beginnings in ancient times when the line between myth and fact was blurred Written in the nd

society constructs gender roles the role reproduction plays in defining gender and the inequitable political or personal power of one gender over others Some works have illustrated these themes using

a society s past present and potential future social relationships with the Other More specifically Science Fiction offers a medium and representation of Alterity and differences in social identity br br Science fiction is often said to inspire a sense of wonder Science fiction editor publisher and critic David Hartwell wrote Science fiction s appeal lies in combination of the rational the believable with the miraculous It is an appeal to the sense of wonder br br Carl Sagan said One of the great benefits of science fiction is that it can convey bits and pieces hints and phrases of knowledge unknown or inaccessible to the reader works you ponder over as the water is running out of the bathtub or as you walk through the woods in an early winter snowfall br In Isaac Asimov commented on the changes then occurring in the science fiction community And because today s real life so resembles day before yesterday s fantasy the old time fans are restless Deep within whether they admit it or not is a feeling of disappointment and even outrage that the outer world has invaded their private domain They feel the loss of a sense of wonder because what was once truly confined to wonder has now become prosaic and mundane br br The study of science fiction or science fiction studies is the critical assessment interpretation and discussion of science fiction literature film TV shows new media fandom and fan fiction Science fiction scholars study science fiction to better understand it and its relationship to science technology politics other genres and culture at large

Science Fiction Research Association and the Science Fiction Foundation The field has grown considerably since the s with the establishment of more journals organizations and conferences as well as science fiction degree granting programs such as those offered by the University of Liverpool br br Science fiction has historically been sub divided between hard science fiction and soft science fiction with the division centering on the feasibility of the science central to the story However this distinction has come under increasing scrutiny in the st century Some authors such as Tade Thompson and Jeff VanderMeer have pointed out that stories that focus explicitly on physics astronomy mathematics and engineering tend to be considered hard science fiction while stories that focus on botany mycology zoology and the social sciences tend to be categorized as soft regardless of the relative rigor of the science br Max Gladstone defined hard science fiction as stories where the math works but pointed out that this ends up with stories that often seem weirdly dated as scientific paradigms shift over time Michael Swanwick dismissed the traditional definition of hard SF altogether instead saying that it was defined by characters striving to solve problems in the right way with determination a touch of stoicism and the consciousness that the universe is not on his or her side br Ursula K Le Guin also criticized the more traditional view on the difference between hard and soft SF The hard science fiction writers dismiss everything except well physics astronomy and maybe chemistry Biology sociology anthropology that s not science to them that s soft stuff They re not that interested in what human beings do really But I am I draw on the social sciences a great deal br br Many critics remain skeptical of the literary value of science fiction and other forms of genre fiction though some accepted authors have written works argued by opponents to constitute science fiction Mary Shelley wrote a number of scientific romance novels in the Gothic literature tradition including Frankenstein or The Modern Prometheus Kurt Vonnegut was a highly respected American author whose works have been argued by some to contain science fiction premises or themes br Other science fiction authors whose works are widely considered to be serious literature include Ray Bradbury

advanced including humans on Earth br David Barnett has pointed out that there are books such as The Road by Cormac McCarthy Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell The Gone Away World by Nick Harkaway The Stone Gods by Jeanette Winterson and Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood which use recognizable science fiction tropes but which are not classified by their authors and publishers as science fiction Atwood in particular argued against the categorization of works like the Handmaid s Tale as science fiction labeling it Oryx and the Testaments as speculative fiction and deriding science fiction as talking squids in outer space br In his book The Western Canon literary critic Harold Bloom includes Brave New World Stanis aw Lem s Solaris Kurt Vonnegut s Cat s Cradle and The Left Hand of Darkness as culturally and aesthetically significant works of western literature though Lem actively spurned the Western label of science fiction while Vonnegut was more commonly classified as a postmodernist or satirist br In her essay Science Fiction and Mrs Brown Ursula K Le Guin was asked Can a science fiction writer write a novel She answered I believe that all novels deal with character The great novelists have brought us to see whatever they wish us to see through some character Otherwise they would not be novelists but poets historians or pamphleteers br Orson Scott Card best known for his science fiction novel Ender s Game has postulated that in science fiction the message and intellectual significance of the work are contained within the story itself and therefore does not require accepted literary devices and techniques he instead characterized as gimmicks or literary games br Jonathan Lethem in a essay in the Village Voice entitled Close Encounters The Squandered Promise of Science Fiction suggested that the point in when Thomas Pynchon s Gravity s Rainbow was nominated for the Nebula Award and was passed over in favor of Clarke s Rendezvous with Rama stands as a hidden tombstone marking the death of the hope that SF was about to merge with the mainstream In the same year science fiction author and physicist Gregory Benford wrote SF is perhaps the defining genre of the twentieth century although its conquering armies are still camped outside the Rome of the literary citadels br br Science fiction is being written and has been written by diverse authors from

promoters br br Science fiction fandom emerged from the letters column in Amazing Stories magazine Soon fans began writing letters to each other and then grouping their comments together in informal
