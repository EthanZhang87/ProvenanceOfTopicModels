The Magazine of Fantasy Science Fiction usually referred to as F SF is a U S fantasy and science fiction magazine first published in by Mystery House a subsidiary of Lawrence Spivak s Mercury Press Editors Anthony Boucher and J Francis McComas had approached Spivak in the mid s about creating a fantasy companion to Spivak s existing mystery title Ellery Queen s Mystery Magazine The first issue was titled The Magazine of Fantasy but the decision was quickly made to include science fiction as well as fantasy and the title was changed correspondingly with the second issue F SF was quite different in presentation from the existing science fiction magazines of the day most of which were in pulp format it had no interior illustrations no letter column and text in a single column format which in the opinion of science fiction historian Mike Ashley set F SF apart giving it the air and authority of a superior magazine br F SF quickly became one of the leading magazines in the science fiction and fantasy fields with a reputation for publishing literary material and including more diverse stories than its competitors Well known stories that appeared in its early years include Richard Matheson s Born of Man and Woman and Ward Moore s Bring the Jubilee a novel of an alternative history in which the South has won the American Civil War McComas left for health reasons in but Boucher continued as sole editor until winning the Hugo Award for Best Magazine that year a feat his successor Robert Mills repeated in the next two years Mills was responsible for publishing Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes Rogue Moon by Algis Budrys Starship Troopers by Robert Heinlein and the first of Brian Aldiss s Hothouse stories The first few issues mostly featured cover art by George Salter Mercury Press s art director but other artists soon began to appear including Chesley Bonestell Kelly Freas and Ed Emshwiller br In Mills was succeeded as editor by Avram Davidson When Davidson left at the end of Joseph Ferman who had bought the magazine from Spivak in took over briefly as editor though his son Edward soon began doing the editorial work under his father s supervision At the start of Edward Ferman was listed as editor and four years later he acquired the magazine from his father and moved the editorial offices to his house in Connecticut Ferman remained editor for over years and published many well received stories including Fritz Leiber s Ill Met in Lankhmar Robert Silverberg s Born with the Dead and Stephen King s The Dark Tower series In he turned the editorship over to Kristine Kathryn Rusch who began including more horror and dark fantasy than had appeared under Ferman In the mid s circulation began to decline most magazines were losing subscribers and F SF was no exception Gordon Van Gelder replaced Rusch in and bought the magazine from Ferman in but circulation continued to fall and by it was below Charles Coleman Finlay took over from Van Gelder as editor in Sheree Ren e Thomas succeeded Charles Coleman Finlay becoming the magazine s th editor in the fall of br br The first magazine dedicated to fantasy Weird Tales appeared in it was followed in by Amazing Stories the first science fiction sf magazine By the end of the s the genre was flourishing in the United States nearly twenty new sf and fantasy titles appearing between and These were all pulp magazines which meant that despite the occasional high quality story most of the magazines presented badly written fiction and were regarded as trash by many readers In Ellery Queen s Mystery Magazine appeared edited by Fred Dannay and focusing on detective fiction The magazine was published in digest format rather than pulp and printed a mixture of classic stories and fresh material Dannay attempted to avoid the sensationalist fiction appearing in the pulps and soon made the magazine a success br In the early s Anthony Boucher a successful writer of fantasy and sf and also of mystery stories got to know Dannay through his work on the Ellery Queen radio show Boucher also knew J Francis McComas an editor who shared his interest in fantasy and SF By McComas and Boucher became interested in the idea of a fantasy companion to Ellery Queen s Mystery Magazine and spoke to Dannay about it Dannay was interested in the idea but paper was scarce because of World War II The following year Boucher and McComas suggested that the new magazine could use the Ellery Queen name but Dannay knew little about fantasy and suggested instead that they approach Lawrence Spivak the owner of Mercury Press which published Ellery Queen s Mystery Magazine br In January Boucher and McComas went to New York and met with Spivak who let them know later in the year that he wanted to go ahead At Spivak s request they began acquiring material for the new magazine including a new story by Raymond Chandler and reprint rights to stories by H P Lovecraft John Dickson Carr and Robert Bloch Spivak initially planned the first issue for which Boucher and McComas were proposing the title Fantasy and Horror for early but repeatedly delayed the launch because of poor newsstand sales of digest magazines He also suggested that it should be priced at cents an issue which was higher than the original plan to provide a financial buffer against poor sales In May Spivak suggested a new title The Magazine of Fantasy and in August a press release announced that the magazine would appear in October On October Spivak Boucher and McComas held a luncheon at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City to commemorate the th anniversary of the death of Edgar Allan Poe and to launch a new fantasy anthology periodical Invitees included Carr Basil Rathbone and Boris Karloff br The first issue published by Fantasy House a subsidiary of American Mercury sold copies which was less than Spivak had hoped for but in November he gave Boucher and McComas the go ahead for another issue The title was changed to The Magazine of Fantasy Science Fiction almost always abbreviated to F SF by both fans and science fiction historians to reflect the contents Sales of the second issue were strong enough for Spivak to commit further and the magazine s future became more assured despite the difficulties caused by the fact that both Boucher and McComas lived on the west coast whereas the magazine s publishing offices were in New York The publishing schedule moved to bimonthly with the December issue The pay rate for the early issues was two cents per word or for short pieces which was competitive with Astounding Science Fiction the leading sf magazine of the day By the rates had changed to three and a half cents per word for stories under words br In McComas who had a full time job in sales on top of his role as editor of F SF was forced to reduce his workload for health reasons Boucher then did most of the reading and editing while McComas reviewed the results and occasionally vetoed a story In August the following year the schedule switched to monthly In Spivak sold his shares in Mercury Press to his general manager Joseph Ferman that year also saw McComas s departure his health had deteriorated to the point where he had to give up the editing post completely br br In Ferman launched a companion magazine Venture Science Fiction which was intended to focus on more action oriented fiction than F SF Boucher was unable to take on the extra work so Robert P Mills who had been the managing editor for F SF became Venture s editor with Boucher in an advisory role Later that year Ferman sold Ellery Queen s Mystery Magazine to Bernard Davis who was leaving Ziff Davis to start his own publishing venture Ferman retained F SF though Boucher departed and Mills became the editor of F SF while remaining managing editor of Queen s magazine Mills stayed for over three years leaving at the end of to spend more time working as a literary agent and Ferman replaced him with Avram Davidson whose name first appeared on the masthead with the April issue Joseph Ferman s son Edward had worked for the magazine as an editorial assistant in the s but left in to gain experience elsewhere he returned in and worked under Davidson as managing editor In Ted White later the editor of Amazing Stories became assistant editor and stayed with the magazine until br Davidson gave up the editor s chair in late in order to have more time to write and was initially replaced by Joseph Ferman who handed over control to his son Edward from May though the masthead did not reflect the change till Four years later the younger Ferman took over from his father as publisher as well and moved the editorial and publishing offices to his house in Cornwall Connecticut His wife Audrey was business manager and Andrew Porter was an assistant editor In the early s Ferman contacted Sol Cohen the owner of Amazing Stories and Fantastic Stories two competing sf magazines about purchasing them both Ferman was considering combining them into a single magazine and publishing them alongside F SF but Cohen decided to keep both titles br In an issue of F SF was priced at cents by the end of the s the price had gone up to although the page count also rose from to pages Circulation did not suffer but rose from to over partly because of subscription drives through Publishers Clearing House and perhaps also because the magazine s quality remained consistent throughout the decade In Ashley s words F SF delivered the goods month after month the schedule was reliable the format remained unchanged and the editor remained the same from throughout the next two decades and more Ferman managed to keep the circulation above and sometimes above during the s when most other magazines were losing subscribers He turned over the editorship to Kristine Kathryn Rusch in and by the mid s circulation began to fall again In Gordon Van Gelder took over as editor and from the February issue was publisher as well having bought the magazine from Ferman John Joseph Adams was Van Gelder s assistant editor from until December Van Gelder was unable to arrest the decline in circulation which by was down to less than Van Gelder reduced the publication frequency to bimonthly increasing the page count and price Charles Coleman Finlay guest edited the July August issue and was hired in as full time editor beginning with the March April issue Sheree Ren e Thomas was hired as editor beginning with the March April issue br br Boucher and McComas s original goal for the new magazine was to imitate the formula that had made Ellery Queen s Mystery Magazine successful classic reprints along with quality fiction that avoided the excesses of the pulps The initial proposal called for the magazine to include fantasy but not science fiction Even before the launch the editors found they were having trouble deciding exactly where the boundary lay so when in February Joseph Ferman Spivak s general manager asked them to add sf to the lineup as a way to broaden the readership they were happy to comply The first issue included only one story that could be called science fiction Theodore Sturgeon s The Hurkle Is a Happy Beast it also included reprints from the slick magazines by writers such as Richard Sale and Guy Endore The interior layout was quite different from the existing fantasy and sf magazines there were no interior illustrations and the text was printed in a single column instead of two as was usual elsewhere There was a book review column but no letters page According to sf historian Mike Ashley this set F SF apart giving it the air and authority of a superior magazine The logo design and layout were the work of Mercury Press s art director George Salter whose background was in book design rather than in pulp magazines Salter remained with the magazine until He was responsible for many of the surreal early covers these gave way to work by other artists but his design for F SF remained intact for decades and in Ashley s opinion the consistency of appearance has been one of the major selling points of the magazine br When the second issue appeared with the title revised to include Science Fiction there was no announcement of the change and not much more science fiction than in the first issue Damon Knight contributed one example Not with a Bang which Knight has described as his first fully professional story The next issue included Richard Matheson s first sale Born of Man and Woman widely considered one of the finest stories F SF ever published Over the next few years several writers became strongly associated with the magazine including Margaret St Clair Reginald Bretnor Miriam Allen deFord and Zenna Henderson and Boucher was also able to attract some of the best known established names such as Arthur C Clarke Fritz Leiber and Ray Bradbury Fletcher Pratt and L Sprague de Camp began their Gavagan s Bar series of stories in the first issue of F SF and Manly Wade Wellman published the first of his John the Balladeer stories in the December issue The focus was on short fiction serials and novels were mainly avoided One exception was Ward Moore s Bring the Jubilee an alternative history set in a world where the South wins the American Civil War Boucher bought A Canticle for Leibowitz from Walter M Miller who had been unable to sell it elsewhere and printed it in the April issue it was the first story in the series that would become the novel of the same name and has since become recognized as a classic of the genre br A controversial article by the astronomer R S Richardson titled The Day After We Land on Mars appeared in the December issue Richardson commented that an exploration of other worlds would require the men stationed on a planet to be openly accompanied by women to relieve the sexual tensions that develop among normal healthy males Responses by Poul Anderson and Miriam Allen deFord appeared in F SF the following year DeFord argued that Richardson was assuming that women were not people in the same way as men and the controversy has since been cited as part of the long debate within the genre about the image of women in science fiction br In F SF won its first Hugo Award for Best Magazine and when Mills became editor that year he maintained the high standards Boucher had set winning the award again in and Mills continued to publish a broad range of material without limiting the magazine to particular subgenres Ashley cites John Collier Robert Arthur Allen Drury and Ray Bradbury all authors with mainstream reputations who appeared in F SF in as evidence of the magazine s diversity Daniel Keyes had been unable to sell Flowers for Algernon until Mills bought it in it went on to win several awards and according to Clute and Nicholls is arguably the most popular sf novel ever published Rogue Moon a novel about a deadly artifact left by aliens on the moon is often considered Algis Budrys s best novel it appeared in and the following year saw Brian Aldiss s Hothouse the first in that series Budrys later said that what he described as the cuteness of the early F SF school of editing and its open contempt for the accomplishments of the Campbellian school had resulted in buckets and buckets of froth but more favorably Liberal Arts concepts in what had been almost exclusively a B S field Zenna Henderson s stories of The People a group of refugee humanoid aliens hiding on Earth were published through the s and s and became a central feature of the magazine according to sf critic John Clute Boucher published Damon Knight s The Country of the Kind described by Ashley as one of his most potent stories from the fifties in and the same year under the pseudonym Grendel Briarton Reginald Bretnor began a series of punning stories known as Feghoots that lasted until At the end of the s during Mills tenure as editor Robert Heinlein s Starship Troopers was serialized in F SF under the title Starship Soldier this was intended to be a juvenile novel but was rejected by Scribner s for being too violent It won the Hugo Award in the novel category the following year and proved to be one of Heinlein s most controversial books br br Among the cover artists in the first decade sf historian and critic Thomas Clareson singles out the early astronomical scenes by Chesley Bonestell as being the most notable these were among the first to replace George Salter s surreal artwork on the cover Kelly Freas and Ed Emshwiller two of the most popular artists in the sf field also contributed covers during the s Mel Hunter began contributing covers with the November issue and in October began a long running series of covers that depicted a robot survivor of a nuclear holocaust engaging in human activities amidst the desolation watering a flower playing with toys or reading a store catalog for example A regular book review column appeared titled Recommended Reading it was signed simply The Editors until McComas ceased to be one of the co editors after which Boucher used his own name According to Clareson the column long remained the most catholic appraisal of the field because of the variety of works reviewed Boucher did not review his own fiction in the column though on at least one occasion he listed a new book of his telling the reader Comments eagerly welcomed in this case you are the reviewer When Boucher left he was succeeded by Damon Knight as book reviewer Alfred Bester took over in and remained in the role until Avram Davidson became the book reviewer when he took the editorial chair Isaac Asimov had begun a series of science articles for Venture Science Fiction in January and when Venture was cancelled Mills brought the science column over to F SF The column which according to Asimov he enjoyed writing more than any of his other works ran for decades without interruption helping to contribute to a long standing feeling of consistency and continuity in F SF s format and contents br Avram Davidson who became editor in had sold his first story to F SF in though he was better remembered for The Golem which appeared in the March issue Under Davidson more work appeared by non English speaking writers such as Hugo Correa Herbert Franke and Shin ishi Hoshi Notable stories he acquired for F SF include Terry Carr s first sale Who Sups with the Devil in and Roger Zelazny s A Rose for Ecclesiastes in November He published two author special issues Theodore Sturgeon was featured in the September issue and Ray Bradbury in May These author issues which had been Joseph Ferman s idea became a regular feature with subsequent issues featuring Isaac Asimov October Fritz Leiber July Poul Anderson April James Blish April Frederik Pohl September Robert Silverberg April Damon Knight November Harlan Ellison July Stephen King December Lucius Shepard March Kate Wilhelm September Barry N Malzberg June Gene Wolfe April and David Gerrold September October br br Joseph Ferman s son Edward Ferman was managing editor during Davidson s tenure as editor When Davidson left Joseph Ferman took over the editorial chair but in reality Edward Ferman was doing all the editorial work and by the May issue was in full control of the magazine It remained eclectic through the s and s publishing work by New Wave writers such as Thomas Disch and John Sladek along with new US writers such as Samuel Delany and Roger Zelazny hard science fiction stories by Gregory Benford and John Varley fantasies by Sterling Lanier and Tom Reamy and horror by Charles L Grant and Stephen King The mid s saw an increase in the diversity of stories appearing elsewhere in the field magazines like New Worlds and Science Fantasy published material that previously could only have appeared in F SF Sf author Christopher Priest writing in commented that many writers later considered part of the New Wave soon found a natural home for their work in F SF In Ashley s view the rest of the field was starting to catch up to F SF s open mindedness but this did not lead to a drop in F SF s quality the end of the s saw Ferman printing some old fashioned material such as John Christopher s novel about miniaturization The Little People alongside much of Roger Zelazny s early output and anarchic and often indefinable stories by R A Lafferty Harvey Jacobs and others In Piers Anthony s early novel Sos the Rope was serialized Anthony had won a competition sponsored in part by F SF br Harlan Ellison and James Tiptree Jr were frequent contributors in the s Tiptree contributing some of her best known stories such as And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill s Side and The Women Men Don t See Ellison s many stories in F SF included The Deathbird in which won a Hugo Award and Jeffty Is Five in which won both a Hugo and a Nebula Award Other award winning stories from Ferman s first decade and a half included Fritz Leiber s Ship of Shadows in Ill Met in Lankhmar in and Catch That Zeppelin in all three won Hugos and the latter two also won Nebulas Poul Anderson s The Queen of Air and Darkness won both a Hugo and a Nebula Robert Silverberg s Born with the Dead won a Nebula and Frederik Pohl s novel of Martian colonization Man Plus also won a Nebula br Judith Merril took over the book review column on Davidson s departure and was followed by James Blish in and Algis Budrys in with frequent contributions from other reviewers such as Joanna Russ and Gahan Wilson In Wilson began contributing cartoons and continued to do so regularly until Ferman set a humorous competition for the readers in the November issue and thereafter ran two or three similar competitions every year These were later collected in a anthology titled Oi Robot the title taken from a competition to add a single letter to a well known work of SF A film review column the first in the magazine since Charles Beaumont s The Science Screen and William Morrison aka Joseph Samachson s live theater column The Science Stage in the latter s conducted by Samuel R Delany commenced in Baird Searles contributed the column between and Among the later reviewers Ellison was one of the most popular and columns from his first four years were collected as Harlan Ellison s Watching in br Isaac Asimov s Science Fiction Magazine was launched in and from under the editorships of Shawna McCarthy and later Gardner Dozois it began to publish more mature material becoming a more direct competitor to F SF s market niche Authors such as Lucius Shepard James Blaylock and John Crowley whose work was a natural fit for F SF were selling to Asimov s as well The launch of Omni in also had an impact For almost every year in the s stories published in F SF won more award nominations and were selected for more Year s Best anthologies than the other magazines in the s that was no longer true as Asimov s took over the leading role and Omni sometimes pushed F SF into third place Ferman was still able to acquire some highly regarded material such as Lost Boys by Orson Scott Card and Kirinyaga by Mike Resnick When Omni rejected George R R Martin s Monkey Treatment and Gardner Dozois s Down Among the Dead Men which were dark fantasy Ferman acquired both Along with these regular columns Ferman occasionally published articles such as Science Fiction and the University a feature in the May issue that included contributions from Darko Suvin Thomas Clareson and Philip Klass br F SF won the Hugo Award for Best Magazine for four consecutive years from through when the award was changed to Best Professional Editor Initially this category was dominated by Ben Bova the editor of Analog but Ferman won it for three more years at the start of the s br Some of the artists who had provided covers for early issues of F SF including Chesley Bonestell Ed Emshwiller and Alex Schomburg were still contributing their work into the late s and many of the regular writers from the early years such as Reginald Bretnor Ron Goulart and Hilbert Schenck continued to appear in F SF into the s A newer group including Joanna Russ and R A Lafferty had become regulars more recently Some established writers such as Thomas Disch published their more unusual work in F SF and there were also writers such as Felix C Gotschalk whose unusual stories were described by Ferman as a step ahead of most sf writers or perhaps he s marching in a different direction In Ashley s opinion Ferman managed to balance the work of these eccentric writers so that they never distorted the contents yet kept the magazine on the edge br Newer writers who began to appear regularly in the s included Bruce Sterling who published his early Shaper Mechanist stories in F SF beginning with Swarm in Stephen King s The Dark Tower series had begun in in F SF and four more stories appeared over the next three years before being collected as a novel in and Michael Shea and Bob Leman contributed horror and weird fiction regularly in the s Despite the increased competition from Omni and Isaac Asimov s Science Fiction Magazine Ferman managed to keep F SF s reputation for quality intact throughout the s it was not as distinct from its competition as it had once been but it retained an idiosyncratic individuality in Ashley s words br br Under Kristine Kathryn Rusch F SF began to publish more dark fantasy and horror stories such as The Night We Buried Road Dog by Jack Cady which won a Nebula Award When Rusch took over as editor Isaac Asimov had been writing the science column for over three decades and Algis Budrys had been contributing a book review column since in Asimov died and Budrys departed The science column ran for consecutive issues ending in February Asimov s widow Janet Asimov wrote another essay for the December issue based on her conversations with her husband before his death and a final essay appeared in January containing material from the book Yours Isaac Asimov A Lifetime of Letters The science column continued to appear written by Bruce Sterling and Gregory Benford among others and John Kessel took over the book reviews Robert Killheffer succeeded Kessel with some overlap in and Asimov s maintained its dominance of the field through the s though Rusch published well received material such as The Martian Child by David Gerrold and Last Summer at Mars Hill by Elizabeth Hand Rusch won one Hugo Award as editor during her five years at F SF in br Van Gelder printed more fantasy and less hard science fiction than had Rusch and in Ashley s opinion he was able to restore some of the magazine s distinctiveness As a result of the switch to bimonthly in with the resulting higher page count in each issue the magazine began to publish longer stories br br F SF quickly established itself as one of the leading magazines Ashley describes it as bridging the attitude gap between the slick magazines and the pulps and argues that it made the genre more respectable The fantasy side of the magazine attracted writers who had been regular contributors to Weird Tales and Unknown two of the best known fantasy pulps and in Ashley s opinion it soon found a middle ground between those pulp traditions and fantasy written for the slicks It was known as the most literary of the science fiction and fantasy magazines and it published the most diverse range of material In a review of New Wave SF Christopher Priest agreed that F SF has a bias for literary work and added that it has been a sort of New Wave of its own ever since its inception br From the s F SF was regarded as one of the big three science fiction magazines along with Astounding Science Fiction and Galaxy Science Fiction In a review of a issue James Blish writing as William Atheling Jr commented that much of the magazine to that point was wonderfully written and that Boucher s and McComas s editorial acumen made F SF very readable but that on occasion a well written sophisticated but unoriginal science fiction story might be accepted by F SF because it was not a specialist sf magazine At the end of the s Kingsley Amis described it as the most highbrow of the science fiction magazines and Gary K Wolfe later said that F SF along with Galaxy defined the tenor of the s In Judith Merril argued that it was Boucher and McComas who made a place in the genre for writers such as Charles Beaumont Mildred Clingerman Edgar Pangborn and many others who in her opinion had virtually stopped writing until the necessary new magazine came along br In Ashley commented that F SF had been the most consistently enjoyable magazine of the last years In his view a key reason for the magazine s appeal was that its roots were in the literary tradition with Lawrence Spivak its first publisher the inheritor of H L Mencken s American Mercury which had been successful and widely respected as a literary review Unlike most of its competitors F SF had no connection to the pulp magazine era and its editors had always intended to appeal to readers of books rather than of magazines Ashley also cites F SF s broad editorial policy which allowed the magazine to carry a wider range of fiction than its competitors In Gary Westfahl praised the creative editors of the s and s such as Gardner Dozois and Gordon Van Gelder but added that such editors were no longer the most important figures in the field br br As of March the editorial succession is as follows br br Anthony Boucher J Francis McComas Fall August br Anthony Boucher September

February issue his justification for the increase was that during the past ten years paper costs have gone up by composition printing binding and handling costs have gone up by postages costs have gone up from to and various other costs have risen as much or more br br The following anthologies of fiction from F SF have appeared br br In Martin H Greenberg edited a hardcover facsimile edition
