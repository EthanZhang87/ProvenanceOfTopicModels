throne Cor had been kidnapped as a baby in an attempt to thwart a prophecy which foretold that he would save Archenland from its greatest peril He was lost at sea in the ensuing battle to rescue him

and rule Archenland after Lune s death Their son Ram becomes the most famous king of Archenland Bree and Hwin found love separately after returning to Narnia and all four would reunite regularly br br br Themes and motifs br br br Divine providence br After meeting King Lune of Archenland and warning him of the impending Calormene invasion Shasta becomes lost in a fog and separated from the Archenlanders While walking in the fog he senses a mysterious presence nearby Engaging in conversation with the unknown being Shasta tells of his misfortunes including twice being chased by lions His companion who turns out to be Aslan responds as follows br br I was the lion who forced you to join with Aravis I was the cat who comforted you among the houses of the dead I was the lion who drove the jackals from you while you slept I was the lion who gave the horses the new strength of fear for the last mile so that you should reach King Lune in time And I was the lion you do not remember who pushed the boat in which you lay a child near death so that it came to shore where a man sat wakeful at midnight to receive you br The incidents which Shasta perceived as misfortunes were orchestrated by Aslan in his Divine Providence for greater purposes br br br Narnia and the North br Bree and Shasta use the phrase Narnia and the North as their rallying cry as they make their escape from their life in Calormen They are both motivated by a deep longing to find their way to their true homeland In the setting of The Horse and His Boy the reader finds a departure from the landscapes culture and people of the Narnian realms which have become familiar in the other books The placement of the action in the realm of Calormen helps to convey a sense of unbelonging on the part of the characters and the reader which reinforces the motif of longing for a true home br br br Allusions and references br The association of Cor with horses and his twin brother Corin with boxing recalls the traditional associations of the Spartan twins Castor and Pollux of Greek mythology br Researcher Ruth North has noted that the plot element of a sinful human being transformed into a donkey as a punishment and then restored to humanity as an act of Divine mercy is reminiscent of The Golden Ass by Apuleius a classic of Latin literature br br br Adaptations br BBC Radio dramatised The Chronicles of Narnia including The Horse and His Boy in The dramatisation is entitled The Complete Chronicles of Narnia The Classic BBC Radio Full Cast Dramatisations br Focus on the Family produced an audio dramatisation
