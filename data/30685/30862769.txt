distant future of entropic decay is called entropic romance br br br Genre br br The Dying Earth genre differs from the apocalyptic subgenre in that it deals not with catastrophic destruction but with entropic exhaustion of Earth It is therefore described as more melancholic The genre was prefigured by the works of the Romantic movement Jean Baptiste Cousin de Grainville s Le Dernier Homme narrates the tale of Omegarus the Last Man on Earth It is a bleak vision of the future when Earth has become totally sterile Lord Byron s poem Darkness shows Earth after the Sun has died Mary Shelley s The Last Man details a future in which humanity is slowly but inexorably wiped from the face of the planet by an unstoppable outbreak of the Great Plague killing almost everyone but the protagonist immune to the disease s effects br Another early example is La Fin du Monde The End of the World aka Omega the last days of the world written by Camille Flammarion and published in France in The first half

Mort de la Terre deals with the last scattered generation of an evolved humankind on an exhausted desert Earth and their encounter with a new type of mineral metallic life In some ways it reads like the inversion of his earlier Les Xip huz in which early humans encounter and battle an utterly alien and incomprehensible form of life br From the s onwards Clark Ashton Smith wrote a series of stories situated in Zothique the last continent of Earth where its inhabitants live out their lives in a similar manner to the civilisations of the Classical era Smith said in a letter to L Sprague de Camp dated November br br Zothique vaguely suggested by Theosophic theories about past and future continents is the last inhabited continent of earth The continents of our present cycle have sunken perhaps several times Some have remained submerged others have re risen partially and re arranged themselves br The science and machinery of our present civilization have long been forgotten together
