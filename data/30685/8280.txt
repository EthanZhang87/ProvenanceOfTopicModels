A demon is a malevolent supernatural entity Historically belief in demons or stories about demons occurs in folklore mythology religion and literature these beliefs are reflected in media including comics fiction film television and video games Belief in demons probably goes back to the Paleolithic age stemming from humanity s fear of the unknown the strange and the horrific In ancient Near Eastern religions and in the Abrahamic religions including early Judaism and ancient medieval Christian demonology a demon is considered a harmful spiritual entity that may cause demonic possession calling for an exorcism Large portions of Jewish demonology a key influence on Christianity and Islam originated from a later form of Zoroastrianism and was transferred to Judaism during the Persian era br Demons may or may not also be considered to be devils minions of the Devil In many traditions demons are independent operators with different demons causing different types of evils destructive natural phenomena specific diseases etc In religions featuring a principal Devil e g Satan locked in an eternal struggle with God demons are often also thought to be subordinates of the principal Devil As lesser spirits doing the Devil s work they have additional duties causing humans to have sinful thoughts and tempting humans to commit sinful actions br The original Ancient Greek word daim n did not carry negative connotations as it denotes a spirit or divine power The Greek conception of a daim n notably appears in the philosophical works of Plato where it describes the divine inspiration of Socrates In Christianity morally ambivalent daim n were replaced by demons forces of evil only striving for corruption Such demons are not the Greek intermediary spirits but hostile entities already known in Iranian beliefs In Western esotericism and Renaissance magic which grew out of an amalgamation of Greco Roman magic Jewish Aggadah and Christian demonology a demon is believed to be a spiritual entity that may be conjured and controlled br Belief in demons remains an important part of many modern religions and occult traditions Demons are still feared largely due to their alleged power to possess living creatures In contemporary Western esoteric traditions demons may be used as metaphors for inner psychological processes inner demons br br br Etymology br br The Ancient Greek word daim n denotes a spirit or divine power much like the Latin genius or numen Daim n most likely came from the Greek verb daiesthai to divide or distribute The Greek conception of a daim n notably appears in the philosophical works of Plato where it describes the divine inspiration of Socrates The original Greek word daim n does not carry the negative connotation initially understood by implementation of the Koine daimonion and later ascribed to any cognate words sharing the root br The Greek terms do not have any connotations of evil or malevolence In fact eudaimonia which literally translates as good spiritedness means happiness By the early centuries of the Roman Empire cult statues were seen by Pagans and their Christian neighbors alike as inhabited by the numinous presence of the Greco Roman gods Like pagans Christians still sensed and saw the gods and their power and as something they had to assume lay behind it by an easy traditional shift of opinion they turned these pagan daimones into malevolent demons the troupe of Satan Far into the Byzantine period Christians eyed their cities old pagan statuary as a seat of the demons presence It was no longer beautiful it was infested The term had first acquired its negative connotations in the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek which drew on the mythology of ancient Semitic religions This was then inherited by the Koine text of the New Testament br The English use of demon as synonym for devils goes back at least as far as about The German word D mon however is different from devil Teufel and demons as evil spirits and akin to the original meaning of daimon The Western Modern era conception of a demon as in the Ars Goetia derives seamlessly from the ambient popular culture of Late Antiquity br br br Ancient Egypt br br The exact definition of demon in Egyptology posed a major problem for modern scholarship since the borders between a deity and a demon are sometimes blurred and the ancient Egyptian language lacks a term for the modern English demon Both deities and demons can act as intermediaries to deliver messages to humans By that they share some resemblance to the Greek daimon However magical writings indicate that ancient Egyptians acknowledged the existence of malevolent demons by highlighting the demon names with red ink Demons in this culture appeared to be subordinative and related to a specific deity yet they may have occasionally acted independently of the divine will The existence of demons can be related to the realm of chaos beyond the created world But even this negative connotation cannot be denied in light of the magical texts The role of demons in relation to the human world remains ambivalent and largely depends on context br Ancient Egyptian demons can be divided into two classes guardians and wanderers Guardians are tied to a specific place their demonic activity is topographically defined and their function can be benevolent towards those who have the secret knowledge to face them Demons protecting the underworld may prevent human souls from entering paradise Only by knowing the right charms is the deceased able to enter the Halls of Osiris Here the aggressive nature of the guardian demons is motivated by the need to protect their abodes and not by their evil essence Accordingly demons guarded sacred places or the gates to the netherworld During the Ptolemaic and Roman period the guardians shifted towards the role of genius loci and they were the focus of local and private cults br The wanderers are associated with possession mental illness death and plagues Many of them serve as executioners for the major deities such as Ra or Osiris when ordered to punish humans on earth or in the netherworld Wanderers can also be agents of chaos arising from the world beyond creation to bring about misfortune and suffering without any divine instructions led only by evil motivations The influences of the wanderers can be warded off and kept at the borders of the human world by the use of magic but they can never be destroyed A sub category of wanderers are nightmare demons which were believed to cause nightmares by entering a human body br br br China br br See also List of supernatural beings in Chinese folklore br br Chinese folktale legend and literature are replete with malevolent supernatural creatures who are often rendered demons in English translations These include categories of beings such as the yao shapeshifters with the power to cause insanity to inflict poison and to bring about disease and the mo derived from Indian mythology and entering through the influence of Buddhism In folk belief these beings are responsible for misfortune insanity and illness and any number of strange phenomena that could not easily be accounted for Epilepsy and stroke which led to either temporary or permanent contortions were generally seen as the results of demonic possession and attacks br In the imperial era anxiety over unexplained serial murders missing persons accidents or diseases sometimes led to instances of mass panic requiring imperial intervention Exorcism was a court function during the Zhou dynasty led by ritual specialists known as fangshi In later dynaties roving Taoist sorcerers Buddhist monks as well as eccentric folk magicians plied their services in warding off exorcising countering or defeating these demons through the use of amulets charms spells and chants br In mainland China belief in demons is very rare Today these beings appear primarily as antagonists in the fantasy genre and especially in entertainment aimed at children and young adults br br br In folklore br Belief in wilderness demons haunted China from the very earliest periods and persisted throughout the late imperial era In the Xia dynasty nine bronze cauldrons with their forms were cast to help the common people to identify and to avoid them Classical texts in the Zhou and Warring States period distinguish between the demons of mountains and forests the seductive Chimei demons of trees and rocks a necrophagous fever demon the Wangliang subterranean demons of the earth and of decay the goat like and necrophagous Fenyang lit grave goat who caused disease and miscarriage and fever demons born from water Wangxiang a child like being with red eyes These demons were said to be born of aberrant qi breath or energy known to accost and kill travellers and held responsible for sickness People also feared the Muling lit tree spirit also muzhong lit tree swelling demons forming over time in trees of immense age capable of inflicting disease and killing human passers by and birds flying overhead Examples include the penghou lit drumbeat marquis a demon associated with camphor trees in mountain forests and which takes the form of a human headed dog and in the southern provinces the banana leaf spirits br From the Tang dynasty onwards belief in shapeshifting foxes tigers and wolves amongst other creatures also featured in Chinese folk belief partly due to the existence of outlawed fox spirit cults Fox Demons are described as cunning and lustful capable of clairvoyance and of inflicting disease and poisoning at will They are sometimes seen as beings requiring worship to be appeased or placated Tiger Demons and Wolf Demons are ravening beings roaming large territories for prey taking the form of humans to conveniently insert themselves into communities and settlements Tiger demons are described as being enslave the souls of humans they have killed turning them into minions In the superstitious climate of the previous centuries people mistaken as tigers and wolves in human disguise were often put to death or starved in their cells by magistrates br Fish and snake demons are said to have attempted to assault Confucius Even insects are capable of being demonic In one tale the sighting of a Centipede Demon in the form of an old woman without eyes is said to have led to the sickness and death of an entire household br One notable demon not in the above categories includes the Heisheng or Heiqi Black Calamity or Black Air a kind of roving vapour demon that inflicts damage to persons and property wherever it roams sometimes killing where it goes Another are undefined Poltergeists sometimes afflicting monasteries causing serious nuisances and unable to be exorcised br br br In religion br Demons in the religious sense are known as Mo and are generally derived from Indian lore through Buddhism These include the man eating night flying luocha raksasha and the yecha yaksha These have also entered Chinese folk religion and Taoism Another closely related term highlighting their spiritual deviance and moral corruption is Xie br br br In literature br Aside from recurring in Chinese superstition of the imperial era they also appear as antagonists and sometimes protagonists in multiple genres of Chinese literature These include mythic literature Shen Mo Xiaoshuo lit Gods and demons novels in records about paranormal or occult activity Zhi Guai lit Records of the Strange and in tales about cultivators of supernatural power and immortality Xian Xia lit Immortal Hero fiction These demons are often examples or close variants of the type and kind that exist in folk belief They also appear in entertainment designed for children and young adults especially in comics manhua cartoons anime and computer games br br br Disambiguation br The terms Yao Mo Gui Guai and Xie are their various two character combinations often used to refer to these creatures but of these terms only Mo denotes demons in the religious sense br China has two classes of beings that might be regarded as demons and which are generally translated as such br br Yao a kind of uncanny supernatural creature usually with the power to shapeshift to poison or to cause disease and to bewilder or enthrall They are associated with sorcery or sorcery like powers They are not always evil in the sense that Western demons or the Chinese mo are but are represented as having malevolent tendencies and as creatures of ill omen They are often invoked as an explanation for strange events bizarre occurrences mysterious diseases and horrible accidents They resemble the unseelie fae of Celtic legend and folklore in their powers and predisposition and are sometimes translated as faeries or daemons rather than demons br Mo derived from the Mara of Buddhism and are almost always evil This kind of being is morally corrupted and rebels against the moral law and heavenly principle Taoist cultivators fallen Buddhist monks gods and mortals who have succumbed to an evil inclination are said to have become demonic or become diabolical ru mo As such it is often a condition and a state rather than always being directly the result of a certain innate heritage Furthermore certain beings derived directly from Indian mythology such as the luocha or raksasha and yecha or yaksha however are classed as being innately demonic types by heritage but are nevertheless represented as being capable of repentance or turning to good br Both the indigenous Yao and the Indian influenced Mo feature prominently in Chinese legends and folktales about the supernatural and the uncanny and these days are staples of popular culture and fantasy fiction in games movies and books br br br Mesopotamia br br The ancient Mesopotamians believed that the underworld was home to many demons which are sometimes referred to as offspring of arali These demons could sometimes leave the underworld and terrorize mortals on earth One class of demons that were believed to reside in the underworld were known as galla their primary purpose appears to have been to drag unfortunate mortals back to Kur They are frequently referenced in magical texts and some texts describe them as being seven in number Several extant poems describe the galla dragging the god Dumuzid into the underworld Like other demons however galla could also be benevolent and in a hymn from King Gudea of Lagash c BCE a minor god named Ig alima is described as the great galla of Girsu br Lamashtu was a demonic goddess with the head of a lion the teeth of a donkey naked breasts a hairy body hands stained with blood long fingers and fingernails and the feet of Anz She was believed to feed on the blood of human infants and was widely blamed as the cause of miscarriages and cot deaths Although Lamashtu has traditionally been identified as a demoness the fact that she could cause evil on her own without the permission of other deities strongly indicates that she was seen as a goddess in her own right Mesopotamian peoples protected against her using amulets and talismans She was believed to ride in her boat on the river of the underworld and she was associated with donkeys She was believed to be the daughter of An br Pazuzu is a demonic god who was well known to the Babylonians and Assyrians throughout the first millennium BCE He is shown with a rather canine face with abnormally bulging eyes a scaly body a snake headed penis the talons of a bird and usually wings He was believed to be the son of the god Hanbi He was usually regarded as evil but he could also sometimes be a beneficent entity who protected against winds bearing pestilence and he was thought to be able to force Lamashtu back to the underworld Amulets bearing his image were positioned in dwellings to protect infants from Lamashtu and pregnant women frequently wore amulets with his head on them as protection from her br ul pa e s name means youthful brilliance but he was not envisioned as youthful god According to one tradition he was the consort of Ninhursag a tradition which contradicts the usual portrayal of Enki as Ninhursag s consort In one Sumerian poem offerings made to hul pa e in the underworld and in later mythology he was one of the demons of the underworld br According to The Jewish Encyclopedia originally published in volumes from to In Chaldean mythology the seven evil deities were known as shedu storm demons represented in ox like form They were represented as winged bulls derived from the colossal bulls used as protective jinn of royal palaces br br br Judaism br br There are differing opinions in Judaism about the existence or non existence of demons shedim or se irim Some Rabbinic scholars assert that demons have existed in Talmudic times but do not exist regularly in present When prophecy divine presence and divine inspiration gradually decreased the demonic powers of impurity have become correspondingly weak too br br br Hebrew Bible br The Hebrew Bible mentions two classes of demonic spirits the se irim and the shedim The word shedim sing shed or sheyd appears in two places in the Hebrew Bible The se irim sing sa ir male goat are mentioned once in Leviticus probably a recollection of Assyrian demons in the shape of goats They might be a metaphorical symbol for life threatening animals such as hyenas ostrichs and jackals The shedim however are not pagan demigods but the foreign gods themselves Both entities appear in a scriptural context of animal or child sacrifice to non existent false gods br Various diseases and ailments were ascribed to demons particularly those affecting the brain and those of internal nature Examples include catalepsy headache epilepsy and nightmares There also existed a demon of blindness Shabriri lit dazzling glare who rested on uncovered water at night and blinded those who drank from it br Demons supposedly entered the body and caused the disease while overwhelming or seizing the victim To cure such diseases it was necessary to draw out the evil demons by certain incantations and talismanic performances at which the Essenes excelled Josephus who spoke of demons as spirits of the wicked which enter into men that are alive and kill them but which could be driven out by a certain root witnessed such a performance in the presence of the Emperor Vespasian and ascribed its origin to King Solomon In mythology there were few defences against Babylonian demons The mythical mace Sharur had the power to slay demons such as Asag a legendary gallu or edimmu of hideous strength br br br Talmudic tradition and Midrashim br br In the Jerusalem Talmud notions of shedim demons or spirits are almost unknown or occur only very rarely whereas in the Babylonian Talmud there are many references to shedim and magical incantations The existence of shedim in general was not questioned by most of the Babylonian Talmudists As a consequence of the rise of influence of the Babylonian Talmud over that of the Jerusalem Talmud late rabbis in general took as fact the existence of shedim nor did most of the medieval thinkers question their reality However rationalists like Maimonides and Saadia Gaon and others explicitly denied their existence and completely rejected concepts of demons evil spirits negative spiritual influences attaching and possessing spirits They thought the essential teaching about shedim and similar spirits is that they should not be an object of worship not a reality to be acknowledged or feared Their point of view eventually became mainstream Jewish understanding br The opinion of some authors is not clear Abraham ibn Ezra states that insane people can see the image of se irim when they go astray and ascribe to them powers independent from God It is not clear from his work if he considered these images of se irim as manifestations of actual spirits or merely delusions Despite academic consensus Rabbis disputed that Maimonides denied the existence of demons entirely He would only dispute the existence of demons in his own life time but not that demons had existed once br Occasionally an angel is called satan in the Babylon Talmud But satans do not refer to demons as they remain at the service of God Stand not in the way of an ox when coming from the pasture for Satan dances between his horns br Aggadic tales from the Persian tradition describe the shedim the mazzi im harmers and the ru in spirits There were also lilin night spirits elane shade or evening spirits iharire midday spirits and afrire morning spirits as well as the demons that bring famine and such as cause storm and earthquake According to some aggadic stories demons were under the dominion of a king or chief usually Asmodai br br br Kabbalah br In Kabbalah demons are regarded as a necessary part of the divine emanation in the material world and a byproduct of human sin Qlippoth After they are created they assume an existence on their own Demons would attach themselves to the sinner and start to multiply as an act of self preservation Medieval Kabbalists characterize such demons as punishing angels of destruction They are subject to the divine will and do not act independently br Other demonic entities such as the shedim might be considered benevolent The Zohar classifies them as those who are like humans and submit to the Torah and those who have no fear of God and are like animals br br br Second Temple Judaism br br The sources of demonic influence were thought to originate from the Watchers or Nephilim who are first mentioned in Genesis and are the focus of Enoch Chapters and also in Jubilees The Nephilim were seen as the source of the sin and evil on Earth because they are referenced in Genesis before the story of the Flood In Genesis God sees evil in the hearts of men Ethiopic Enoch refers to Genesis and provides further description of the story connecting the Nephilim to the corruption of humans According to the Book of Enoch sin originates when angels descend from heaven and fornicate with women birthing giants The Book of Enoch shows that these fallen angels can lead humans to sin through direct interaction or through providing forbidden knowledge Most scholars understand the text that demons originate from the evil spirits of the deceased giants cursed by God to wander the Earth Dale Martin disagrees with this interpretation arguing that the ghosts of the Nephilim are distinct The evil spirits would make the people sacrifice to the demons but they were not demons themselves The spirits are stated in Enoch to corrupt fall be excited and fall upon the earth and cause sorrow br The Book of Jubilees conveys that sin occurs when Cainan accidentally transcribes astrological knowledge used by the Watchers This differs from Enoch in that it does not place blame on the angels However in Jubilees the evil spirits of the Watchers are discussed as evil and still remain on Earth to corrupt humans God binds only of the Watchers and destroys them leaving to be ruled by Mastema Because the evil in humans is great only would be needed to corrupt and lead humans astray These spirits of the giants are also referred to as the bastards in the apotropaic prayer Songs of the Sage which lists the names of demons the narrator hopes to expel br To the Qumran community during the Second Temple period this apotropaic prayer was assigned stating And I the Sage declare the grandeur of his radiance in order to frighten and terri fy all the spirits of the ravaging angels and the bastard spirits demons Liliths owls Dead Sea Scrolls Songs of the Sage Lines br br br Indian religions br br br Hinduism br br In the Veda gods deva and anti gods asura both share the upper world It is only by the time of the Brahmanas that they are said to inhabit the underworld The identification of asura with demons stems from the description of asura as formerly gods p rvadeva The gods are said to have claimed heaven for themselves and tricked the demons ending on earth During the Vedic period gods aid humans against demons By that gods secure their own place in heaven using humans as tools to defeat their cosmic enemies br Asura in the earliest hymns of the Rigveda originally meant any supernatural spirit either good or bad Since the s of the Indic linguistic branch is cognate with the h of the Early Iranian languages the word asura representing a category of celestial beings is a cognate with Old Persian Ahura Ancient Hinduism tells that Devas also called suras and Asuras are half brothers sons of the same father Kashyapa although some of the Devas such as Varuna are also called Asuras Later during Puranic age Asura and Rakshasa came to exclusively mean any of a race of anthropomorphic powerful possibly evil beings Daitya lit sons of the mother Diti Danava lit sons of the mother Danu Maya Danava Rakshasa lit from harm to be guarded against and asura are incorrectly translated into English as demon br With increase in asceticism during the post Vedic period withdrawal of sacrificial rituals was considered a threat to the gods Ascetic humans or ascetic demons were supposed to be more powerful than gods Pious highly enlightened Asuras and Rakshasas such as Prahlada and Vibhishana are not uncommon The Asura are not fundamentally against the gods nor do they tempt humans to fall Many people metaphorically interpret the Asura as manifestations of the ignoble passions in the human mind and as symbolic devices There were also cases of power hungry asuras challenging various aspects of the gods but only to be defeated eventually and seek forgiveness br Hinduism advocates the reincarnation and transmigration of souls according to one s karma Souls Atman of the dead are adjudged by the Yama and are accorded various purging punishments before being reborn Humans that have committed extraordinary wrongs are condemned to roam as lonely often mischief mongers spirits for a length of time before being reborn Many kinds of such spirits Vetalas and Pishachas are recognized in the later Hindu texts According to Hinduism demons are not inherently evil beings but good by following their dharma what is being evil and deceitful However nothing is purely evil or good and a demon could eventually abandon his demonic nature br br br Buddhism br br Belief in demons does not constitute an essential feature in Buddhism However since belief in demons were common during the rise of Buddhism they are integrated into the cycle of Sa s ra Accordingly their malevolent condition is due to their bad karma from their previous lives When Buddhism spread it accommodated itself with indigenous popular ideas about demons br br br Iranian demons br br br Zoroastrianism br br The Zorastrian belief in demons Daeva later div had strong influence on the Abrahamic religions especially Christianity and Islam br In hell demons continue to torment the damned br Book of the Denkard describes demons as the opposite of the creative power of God As such they cannot create but only corrupt and thus evil is merely the corruption of the good Since demons can only destroy they will ultimately destroy themselves Chapter questions the reality of demons since their existence seem to rely on their destruction of good Therefore Ahriman and his demons would miss any substance and exist only as absence of good br br br Manichaeism br Manichaeism was a major religion founded in the third century AD by the Parthian prophet Mani c AD in the Sasanian Empire One of its key concepts is the doctrine of Two Principles and Three Moments Accordingly the world could be described as resulting from a past moment in which two principles good and evil were separate a contemporary moment in which both principles are mixed due to an assault of the world of darkness on the realm of light and a future moment when both principles are distinct forever Thus evil and demons played a significant role within Manichaean teachings br There are numberless designations for various groups of demonic entities in Manichaean cosmology The general term used for the beings of the world of darkness is dyw dev Before the demons attacked the realm of light they have been in constant battle and intercourse against each other It is only in the realm of darkness demons are described in their physical form After their assault on the world above they have been overcome by the Living Spirit and imprisoned in the structure of the world From that point onwards they impact human s ethical life and appear as personified ethical qualities mostly greed envy grief and wrath desire for destruction br Ibn al Jawzi in his work Talb s Ibl s devils delusion credits the Manichaeans with believing that each Light and Darkness God and the Devil consist of four bodies and one spirit The bodies of Light God were referred to as angels while the bodies of Darkness Devil were referred to as ifrits Light and Darkness would multiple by angels and demons respectively br In The Book of Giants one of the canonical seven treatises also known from Jewish intertestamental literature the Grigori egr goroi beget giant half demon offspring with human woman In the Middle Persian version of the Book of Giants they are referred to as k w while in the Coptic Kephalaia as gigas In accordance with some interpretations of Genesis the giant offspring became the ancient tyrannic rulers over mankind until overthrown by the angels of punishment Nonetheless these demons are still active in the microcosm such as z and warz g Views on stars ab xtar n are mixed On one hand they are regarded as light particles of the world soul fixed in the sky On the other hand stars are identified with powers hindering the soul from leaving the material world The Third Messenger Jesus is said to have chained up demons in the sky Their offspring the nephilim n f l m or asrestar sar t r n A qal n and Nebr l in particular play instrumental roles in the creation of Adam and Eve According to Manichaeism the watchers known as angels in Jewish lore are not considered angels but demons br br br In the Shahnameh br br The poem begins with the kings of the Pishdadian dynasty They defeat and subjugate the demonic divs Tahmuras commanded the divs and became known as d vband binder of demons Jamshid the fourth king of the world ruled over both angels and divs and served as a high priest of Ahura Mazda Hormozd Like his father he slayed many divs however spared some under the condition they teach him new valuable arts such as writing in different languages After a just reign over hundreds of years Jamshid grew haughty and claimed because of his wealth and power divinity for himself Whereupon God withdraws his blessings from him and his people get unsatisfied with their king With the ceasing influence of God the devil gains power and aids Zahhak to usurp the throne Jamshid dies sawn in two by two demons Tricked by Ahriman or Iblis Zahhak grew two snakes on his shoulders and becomes the demonic serpent king The King Kay K vus fails to conquer the legendary Mazandaran the land of divs and gets captured To save his king Rustam takes a journey and fights through seven trials Divs are among the common enemies Rustam faces the last one the Div e Sepid the demonic king of Mazandaran br The div in the Shahnameh might include both demonic supernatural beings as well as evil humans br Rustam s battle against the demonic may also have a symbolic meaning Rustam represents wisdom and rationality fights the demon embodiment of passion and instinct Rustam s victory over the White Div is also a triumph over men s lower drives and killing the demon is a way to purge the human soul from such evil inclinations The killing of the White Div is an inevitable act to restore the human king s eyesight Eliminating the divs is an act of self preservation to safeguard the good in oneself s and the part acceptable in a regulated society br br br Native North American demons br br br Wendigo br br The Algonquian people traditionally believe in a spirit called a wendigo The spirit is believed to possess people who then become cannibals In Athabaskan folklore there is a belief in wechuge a similar cannibal spirit br br br Middle Eastern and Central Asian demons br br Ideas of demons often called D v D w in Armenia Turkic countries and Albania derive from Persian imagery At this time the demons are more anthropomorphized and morally complex than their original Persian counterparts daeva p However a general negative association remains during the Islamic period br Common features of these Middle Eastern demons are their immortality and pernicious nature they can turn invisible and can be enslaved when pierced by a silver needle Due to their reluctant nature even enslaved they do always the opposite of what has been commanded Like the jinn from Islamic traditions they can enter sexual relationships with humans and sire offspring Demons are believed to be mostly active at night and a bad smell in the air or sudden change in temperature would announce their presence In some tales supernatural powers are attributed to them such as causing sickness mental illnesses or even turn humans to stone br Demons are believed to be vanquished by sacred symbols The content of the symbol depends on the prevailing religion of the culture Among Turks the basmalah invocation of the name of Allah is used to ward off demons while among Armenians the symbol of the cross is utilized br The origin of the demons is explained by Abu Ali Bal ami s interpretation of Tarikh al Tabari as the possibly first creation of God Allah The demons would have reigned for years until they have been replaced by the jinn peri Only then years later the angels firis h ta were sent with Iblis as their leader to chase them away and the story of Adam begins According to the S leymanname written during the time of Suleiman the Magnificent demons were created in the time between the par and the angels from the fires of the stars and smoke Due to the Islamic belief system prevailing in Middle Eastern and Central Asian culture at the time authors emphasized that demons only exist by God s will and not as an independent or even accidental part of the world Muslim authors sometimes identified the demons with the devils and ifrits of Islamic tradition as the Quran asserts that it is God who controls both the angels and devils p br br br Christianity br br br Old Testament br The existence of demons as inherently malicious spirits within Old Testamental texts is absent Though there are evil spirits sent by YHWH they can hardly be called demons since they serve and do not oppose the governing deity First then the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek the gods of other nations were merged into a single category of demons daimones with implied negativity br The Greek Daimons were associated with demi divine entities deities illnesses and fortune telling The Jewish translators rendered them all as demons depicting their power as nullified comparable to the description of shedim in the Tanakh Although all these supernatural powers were translated none were angels despite sharing a similar function to that of the Greek Daimon This established a dualism between the angels on God s side and negatively evaluated demons of pagan origin Their relationship to the God head became the main difference between angels and demons not their degree of benevolence Both angels and demons might be fierce and terrifying However the angels act always at service of the high god of the Israelites differing from the pagan demons who represent the powers of foreign deities The Septuagint refers to evil spirits as demons daimon br br br New Testament br br Through the New Testament demons appear times and times in reference to demonic possession or exorcisms Some old English Bible translations such as King James Version do not have the word demon in their vocabulary and translate it as devil As adversaries of Jesus demons are not morally ambivalent spirits but evil causes of misery suffering and death They are not tempters but the cause of pain suffering and maladies both physical and mental Temptation is reserved for the devil only Unlike spirits in pagan beliefs demons are not intermediary spirits who must be sacrificed for the appeasement of a deity Possession also shows no trace of positivity contrary to some pagan depictions of spirit possession They are explicitly said to be ruled by the Devil or Beelzebub Their origin is unclear the texts take the existence of demons for granted Many early Christians like Irenaeus Justin Martyr Clement of Alexandria and Lactantius assumed demons were ghosts of the Nephilim known from Intertestamental writings Because of references to Satan as the lord of demons and evil angels of Satan throughout the New Testament other scholars identified fallen angels with demons Demons as entirely evil entities who have been born evil may not fit the proposed origin of evil in free will taught in alternate or opposing theologies br br br Pseudepigrapha and deuterocanonical books br br Demons are included in biblical interpretation In the story of Passover the Bible tells the story as the Lord struck down all the firstborn in Egypt Exodus In the Book of Jubilees which is considered canonical only by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church this same event is told slightly differently All the powers of the demon Mastema had been let loose to slay all the first born in the land of Egypt And the powers of the Lord did everything according as the Lord commanded them Jubilees br In the Genesis flood narrative the author explains how God was noticing how corrupt the earth had become for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways Genesis In Jubilees the sins of man are attributed to the unclean demons who began to lead astray the children of the sons of Noah and to make to err and destroy them Jubilees In Jubilees Mastema questions the loyalty of Abraham and tells God to bid him offer him as a burnt offering on the altar and Thou wilt see if he will do this command Jubilees The discrepancy between the story in Jubilees and the story in Genesis exists with the presence of Mastema In Genesis God tests the will of Abraham merely to determine whether he is a true follower however in Jubilees Mastema has an agenda behind promoting the sacrifice of Abraham s son an even more demonic act than that of Satan in Job In Jubilees where Mastema an angel tasked with tempting mortals into sin and iniquity requests that God give him a tenth of the spirits of the children of the watchers demons in order to aid the process Jubilees These demons are passed into Mastema s authority where once again an angel is in charge of demonic spirits br In the Testament of Solomon written sometime in the first three centuries C E the demon Asmodeus explains that he is the son of an angel and a human mother Another demon describes himself as having died in the massacre in the age of giants Beelzeboul the prince of demons appears as a fallen angel not as a demon but makes people worship demons as their gods br br br Christian demonology br br Since Early Christianity demonology has developed from a simple acceptance of demons to a complex study that has grown from the original ideas taken from Jewish demonology and Christian scriptures Christian demonology is studied in depth within the Roman Catholic Church although many other Christian churches affirm and discuss the existence of demons br Building upon the few references to daimon in the New Testament especially the poetry of the Book of Revelation Christian writers of apocrypha from the second century onwards created a more complicated tapestry of beliefs about demons that was largely independent of Christian scripture br While daimons were considered as both potentially benevolent or malevolent Origen argued against Celsus that daimons are exclusively evil entities supporting the later idea of evil demons According to Origen s cosmology increasing corruption and evil within the soul the more estranged the soul gets from God Therefore Origen opined that the most evil demons are located underground Besides the fallen angels known from Christian scriptures Origen talks about Greek daemons like nature spirits and giants These creatures were thought to inhabit nature or air and nourish from pagan sacrifices roaming the earth However there is no functional difference between the spirits of the underworld and of earth since both have fallen from perfection into the material world Origen sums them up as fallen angels and thus equal to demons br Many ascetics like Origen and Anthony the Great described demons as psychological powers tempting to evil in contrast to benevolent angels advising good According to Life of Anthony written in Greek around by Athanasius of Alexandria most of the time the demons were expressed as an internal struggle inclinations and temptations But after Anthony successfully resisted the demons they would appear in human form to tempt and threaten him even more intensely br Pseudo Dionysius the Areopagite described evil as defiancy and does not give evil an ontological existence He explains demons are deficient creatures who willingly turn themselves towards the unreal and non existence Their dangerous nature results not from the power of their nature but from their tendency to drag others into the void and the unreal away from God br Michael Psellos proposed the existence of several types of demons deeply influenced by the material nature of the regions they dwell The highest and most powerful demons attack the mind of people using their imaginative action phantastikos to produce illusions in the mind The lowest demons on the other hand are almost mindless gross and grunting spirits which try to possess people instinctively simply attracted by the warmth and life of humans These cause diseases fatal accidents and animalistic behavior in their victims They are unable to speak while other lower types of demons might give out false oracles The demons are divided into br br Leliouria The highest demons who inhabit the ether beyond the moon br Aeria Demons of the air below the moon br Chthonia Inhabiting the land br Hyraia Enalia Dwelling in the water br Bypochtbonia They live beneath the earth br Misophaes The lowest type of demon blind and almost senseless in the lowest hell br Invocation of Saints holy men and women especially ascetics reading the Gospel holy oil or water is said to drive them out However Psellos schemes have been too inconsistent to answer questions about the hierarchy of fallen angels The devil s position is impossible to assign in this scheme and it does not respond to living perceptions of felt experience and was considered rather impractical to have a lasting effect or impact on Christian demonology br The contemporary Roman Catholic Church unequivocally teaches that angels and demons are real beings rather than just symbolic devices The Catholic Church has a cadre of officially sanctioned exorcists which perform many exorcisms each year The exorcists of the Catholic Church teach that demons attack humans continually but that afflicted persons can be effectively healed and protected either by the formal rite of exorcism authorized to be performed only by bishops and those they designate or by prayers of deliverance which any Christian can offer for themselves or others br At various times in Christian history attempts have been made to classify demons according to various proposed demonic hierarchies br In recent times scholars doubted that independent demons exist and rather considers them aking to Jewish satan to be servants of God According to S N Chiu God is shown sending a demon against Saul in Samuel and in order to punish him for the failure to follow God s instructions showing God as having the power to use demons for his own purposes putting the demon under his divine authority According to the Britannica Concise Encyclopedia demons despite being typically associated with evil are often shown to be under divine control and not acting of their own devices br br br Mandaeism br br In Mandaeism the World of Darkness alma d h uka also referred to as Sheol is the underworld located below Tibil Earth It is ruled by its king Ur Leviathan and its queen Ruha mother of the seven planets and twelve constellations The great dark Ocean of Sup or Suf lies in the World of Darkness The great dividing river of Hitfun analogous to the river Styx in Greek mythology separates the World of Darkness from the World of Light br Prominent infernal beings found in the World of Darkness include lilith nalai vampire niuli hobgoblin gadalta ghost satani Satan and various other demons and evil spirits br br br Gnosticism br Gnosticism largely relies on Greek and Persian dualism especially on Platonism In accordance with Platonism they regarded the idea as good while considering the material and conscious world to be inherently evil The demonized star deities of late Persian religion became associated with a demon thus identifying the seven observable planets with an Archon demonic ruler These demons rule over the earth and the realm of planets representing different desires and passions According to Origen the Ophites depicted the world as surrounded by the demonic Leviathan br Like in Christianity the term daimons was used for demons and refers to both the Archons as well as to their demonic assistants Judas Iscariot is in the Gospel of Judas portrayed as the thirtheenth daimon for betraying Jesus and a supporter of the Archons br Examples of Gnostic portrayals of demons can be found in the Apocryphon of John in which they are said to have helped construct the physical Adam and in Pistis Sophia which states they are ruled over by Hekate and punish corrupt souls br br br Islam br br In Islamic beliefs demons are roughly of two types Jinn and devils Arabic romanized ay n or Persian romanized d v The jinn are parts of pre Islamic Arabian beliefs although their exact origin is unclear br The presence of jinn in pre Islamic Arabian beliefs is not only testified by the Quran but also by pre Islamic literature in the seventh century The jinn were made responsible for various diseases mental illnesses and demonic possession p but also venerated for means of protection The distinction between a deity and a jinni in pre Islamic times is not always clear In the regions north to the Hejaz Palmyra and Baalbek the terms jinni and ilah deity were often used interchangeably Emilie Savage Smith asserts that malicious jinn and good gods were distinct in pre Islamic Arabia but admits that such distinction is not absolute Julius Wellhausen distinguishes between the jinn worshipped in private and deities worshipped in public Likewise some Muslim Quran commentators identify the pre Islamic Arabian deities most notably Manat al Lat and al Uzza with jinn br Muslims generally adopt the belief that jinn can possess people In the tradition of Ash ari it has been considered to be part of the doctrines aqidah of the people of the Sunnah ahl as sunnah wal jammah a The demonic features of jinn are however virtually absent in the Quran According to the Quran the jinn can neither benefit nor harm humans in contrast to demons from the biblical tradition p The Quran uses the term jinn to refer to foreign inseen anthropomorphic creatures in general frequently paired with ins known humans emphasizing the status of jinn as equal in regards of their creation and rejecting the pre Islamic belief that jinn share divinity with the Creator p br While the jinn are morally ambivalent the devils are inherently malevolent beings and closer to the devils of the Judeo Christian tradition In contrast to the jinn devils are usually not described with human like features but are created from fire too which explains some extraordinary abilities among both creatures The primary function of devils is to tempt humans and jinn to sin They are however sent by God and endowed with immortality until the world ceases to exist p p Prayers are used to ward off their attacks dissolving them temporarily Both jinn and devils feature in Islamic magical practises However summoning a devil requires acts against God s laws and is therefore forbidden haram Such acts may include illicit blood sacrifices abandoning prayer and rejecting fasting br According to a tradition mentioned in tafs r authorized Quranic exegesis attributed to ibn Abbas the devils have been dismissed by God when he created Adam According to the Quran when God created Adam he ordered the angels to bow before the newest creation However Iblis Satan refuses to do so and is consequently punished He explains that the devils observed the jinn causing corruption on earth whereupon they were sent to chase away the jinn from the surface When God created a successor to the jinn they protested and those who remained in protest have been punished with hell br br br Bah Faith br In the Bah Faith demons are not regarded as independent evil spirits as they are in some faiths Rather evil spirits described in various faiths traditions such as Satan fallen angels demons and jinn are metaphors for the base character traits a human being may acquire and manifest when he turns away from God and follows his lower nature Belief in the existence of ghosts and earthbound spirits is rejected and considered to be the product of superstition br br br Occultism br In occultism demons are often seen as beneficial and useful lacking an inherent negative connotation While some people fear demons or attempt to exorcise them others willfully attempt to summon them for knowledge assistance or power William of Conches c c s understands demon closer to the Greek daimon reserving the concept of the devil only for the demons of the lower regions You think as I infer from your words that a demon is the same as a devil which is not the case For a demon is said to be any invisible being using reason as if knowing Of these the two high orders are called calodemons that is good knowing ones the lower order is called cacodemon that is evil knowing one for calos means good cacos bad br The ceremonial magician usually consults a grimoire which gives the names and abilities of demons as well as detailed instructions for conjuring and controlling them Grimoires are not limited to demons some give instructions for the invocation of deity a process called theurgy The use of ceremonial magic to call demons is also known as goetia a word derived from the Greek word goes which originally denoted diviners magicians healers and seers br br br In modernity br br The Age of Enlightenment conceptualizes humans as autonomous individuals mostly independent from outer invisible forces such as demons or gods ruling over human fate Previously the world was understood to be inhabited by various spirits and demons With the rise of the rationalistic school of thought the existence of foreign unknown forces was increasingly rejected Demons were explained as non existent Visions of demons and ghosts were explained as the products of one s own mind By labelling local deities and demons as superstition local religious ideas were banished supporting the promotion of nationwide gods and religions Because of that demons became increasingly associated with delusions Wilkinson Duran states that people who believe in demons are often marginalized in the United States The notion of possession was at odds with Western philosophy such as the American Dream and capitalism which implies the belief that everyone is responsible for their own fate and not at the mercy of external forces br br br Psychological approach br br br Islamic world br A minority of Muslim scholars in the Medieval Age often associated with the Mu tazila and the Jahm tes denied that demons jinn devils divs etc have physicality and asserted they could only affect the mind by wasw s Arabic demonic whisperings in the mind p Some scholars like ibn Sina p rejected the reality of jinn altogether Al J i and al Mas d explained jinn and demons as merely psychological phenomena br In his Kit b al Hayaw n al J i states that jinn and demons are the product of loneliness Such a state induces people to mind games causing wasw s p Al Mas d is similarly critical regarding the reality of demons He states that alleged demonic encounters are the result of fear and wrong thinking Alleged encounters are then told to other generations in bedtime stories and poems When they grow up they remember such stories in a state of fear or loneliness This encourages their imaginations resulting in another alleged demonic encounter p br br br Western world br Psychologist Wilhelm Wundt remarked that among the activities attributed by myths all over the world to demons the harmful predominate so that in popular belief bad demons are clearly older than good ones Sigmund Freud developed this idea and claimed that the concept of demons was derived from the important relation of the living to the dead The fact that demons are always regarded as the spirits of those who have died recently shows better than anything the influence of mourning on the origin of the belief in demons br M Scott Peck an American psychiatrist wrote two books on the subject People of the Lie The Hope For Healing Human Evil and Glimpses of the Devil A Psychiatrist s Personal Accounts of Possession Exorcism and Redemption Peck describes in some detail several cases involving his patients In People of the Lie he provides identifying characteristics of an evil person whom he classified as having a character disorder In Glimpses of the Devil Peck goes into significant detail describing how he became interested in exorcism in order to debunk the myth of possession by evil spirits only to be convinced otherwise after encountering two cases which did not fit into any category known to psychology or psychiatry Peck came to the conclusion that possession was a rare phenomenon related to evil and that possessed people are not actually evil rather they are doing battle with the forces of evil br Although Peck s earlier work was met with widespread popular acceptance his work on the topics of evil and possession has generated significant debate and derision Much was made of his association with and admiration for the controversial Malachi Martin a Roman Catholic priest and a former Jesuit despite the fact that Peck consistently called Martin a liar and a manipulator br br br See also br br br br br br Citations br br br Works cited br br br Further reading br br br External links br br Catechism of the
