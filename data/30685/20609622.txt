Babylon was an ancient city located on the lower Euphrates river in southern Mesopotamia within modern day Hillah Iraq about kilometers miles south of modern day Baghdad Babylon functioned as the main cultural and political centre of the Akkadian speaking region of Babylonia Its rulers established two important empires in antiquity the th th century BC Old Babylonian Empire and the th th century BC Neo Babylonian Empire Babylon was also used as a regional capital of other empires such as the Achaemenid Empire Babylon was one of the most important urban centres of the ancient Near East until its decline during the Hellenistic period Nearby ancient sites are Kish Borsippa Dilbat and Kutha br The earliest known mention of Babylon as a small town appears on a clay tablet from the reign of Shar Kali Sharri BC of the Akkadian Empire Babylon was merely a religious and cultural centre at this point and neither an independent state nor a large city subject to the Akkadian Empire After the collapse of the Akkadian Empire the south Mesopotamian region was dominated by the Gutian Dynasty for a few decades before the rise of the Third Dynasty of Ur which encompassed the whole of Mesopotamia including the town of Babylon br The town became part of a small independent city state with the rise of the first Babylonian Empire now known as the Old Babylonian Empire in the th century BC The Amorite king Hammurabi founded the short lived Old Babylonian Empire in the th century BC He built Babylon into a major city and declared himself its king Southern Mesopotamia became known as Babylonia and Babylon eclipsed Nippur as the region s holy city The empire waned under Hammurabi s son Samsu iluna and Babylon spent long periods under Assyrian Kassite and Elamite domination After the Assyrians destroyed and then rebuilt it Babylon became the capital of the short lived Neo Babylonian Empire from to BC The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were ranked as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World allegedly existing between approximately BC and AD However there are questions about whether the Hanging Gardens of Babylon even existed as there is no mention within any extant Babylonian texts of its existence After the fall of the Neo Babylonian Empire the city came under the rule of the Achaemenid Seleucid Parthian Roman Sassanid and Muslim empires The last known habitation of the town dates from the th century when it was referred to as the small village of Babel br It has been estimated that Babylon was the largest city in the world c c BC and again c c BC It was perhaps the first city to reach a population above Estimates for the maximum extent of its area range from sq mi to ha acres The main sources of information about Babylon excavation of the site itself references in cuneiform texts found elsewhere in Mesopotamia references in the Bible descriptions in other classical writing especially by Herodotus and second hand descriptions citing the work of Ctesias and Berossus present an incomplete and sometimes contradictory picture of the ancient city even at its peak in the sixth century BC UNESCO inscribed Babylon as a World Heritage Site in The site receives thousands of visitors each year almost all of whom are Iraqis Construction is rapidly increasing which has caused encroachments upon the ruins br br br Names br br The spelling Babylon is the Latin representation of Greek Babyl n derived from the native Babylonian B bilim meaning gate of the god s The cuneiform spelling was K DIG IR RAKI This would correspond to the Sumerian phrase Kan dig irak br The sign K is the logogram for gate DIG IR means god and RA represents the coda of the word dig ir r followed by the genitive suffix ak The final KI is a determinative indicating that the previous signs are to be understood as a place name br Archibald Sayce writing in the s postulated that the Semitic name was a loan translation of the original Sumerian name However the gate of god interpretation is increasingly viewed as a Semitic folk etymology to explain an unknown original non Semitic placename I J Gelb in argued that the original name was Babilla of unknown meaning and origin as there were other similarly named places in Sumer and there are no other examples of Sumerian place names being replaced with Akkadian translations He deduced that it later transformed into Akkadian B b ili m and that the Sumerian name Kan dig irak was a loan translation of the Semitic folk etymology and not the original name The re translation of the Semitic name into Sumerian would have taken place at the time of the Neo Sumerian Third Dynasty of Ur Bab Il br br A fragmentary inscription dating to the Early Dynastic Period likely in the Akkadian language refers to an unknown lord who was the governor ENSI of BAR KI BAR and constructed the temple for Marduk indicating that the city could very well be Babylon During the ED III period sign placement was relatively fluid and so the KI sign could be seen as the determinative with the name of the city as BAR BAR perhaps pronounced Babbar Paul Alain Beaulieu proposes that the original name could mean shining glowing or white It would be likely that it was later read as Babbir and then Babbil by swapping the consonant r with l The earliest unambiguous mention to the city Babylon came from one of Shar Kali Sharri s year names spelled as KA DINGIR KI indicating that the folk etymology was already widely known in the Sargonic period However the original form of the name Babbar Babbir was not forgotten as seen from the phonetic spelling ba ab b lum in the Ur III period and the spellings Pambalu and Babalu in the Kassite period br Another attested spelling for the city of Babylon is TIN TIR KI attested sparsely in the Old Babylonian period but grew in popularity in the Late nd Millennium BC and was in widespread usage in the st Millennium BC The spelling E KI also appears in the st Millennium BC br In the Hebrew Bible the name appears as Babel Hebrew Bavel Tib B el Classical Syriac B w l Imperial Aramaic B el in Arabic B bil interpreted in the Book of Genesis to mean confusion from the verb bilb l to confuse The modern English verb to babble to speak foolish excited or confusing talk is popularly thought to derive from this name but there is no direct connection br In Pali and Sanskrit literature the name appears as B veru br Ancient records in some situations use Babylon as a name for other cities including cities like Borsippa within Babylon s sphere of influence and Nineveh for a short period after the Assyrian sack of Babylon br br br Archaeology br br The site covers an area of about hectares sq mi with about hectares sq mi within the several kilometer mile long city walls containing a number of mounds the most prominent of which are Kasr Merkes meters above the plain Homera Ishin Aswad Sahn Amran and Babil It is roughly bisected by the Shatt Al Hillah a branch of the Euphrates river which has shifted slightly since ancient times The local water table has risen making excavation of lower levels difficult Prior to the heavy use of baked bricks in the reign of Neo Babylonian ruler Nebuchadnezzar II BC construction at Babylon was primarily of unbaked brick with the occasional use of baked bricks or bitumen br br Kasr also called Palace or Castle it was the location of the Neo Babylonian ziggurat Etemenanki of Nebuchadnezzar II It lies in the center of the site and rises to meters above the plain br Amran Ibn Ali about meters high and at the south of the site It is the site of Esagila a temple of Marduk that also contained shrines to Ea and Nabu br Homera a reddish colored mound on the west side Most of the Hellenistic remains are here Most of the remains of the ziggurat Etemenanki were heaped here when it was demolished by Alexander the Great in BC br Babil a mound about meters high at the northern end of the site Its bricks have been subject to looting since ancient times It held a palace built by Nebuchadnezzar br Subsequent excavation looting and reconstruction have reduced these original heights found by the German excavators br br br Excavations br Claudius Rich working for the British East India Company in Baghdad excavated Babylon in and again in Captain Robert Mignan explored the site briefly in In he completed a map of Babylon which includes the location of several villages William Loftus visited there in Austen Henry Layard made some soundings during a brief visit in before abandoning the site br br Fulgence Fresnel Julius Oppert and Felix Thomas heavily excavated Babylon from to Much of their work was lost in the Qurnah Disaster when a transport ship and four rafts sank on the Tigris river in May They had been carrying over crates of artifacts from various excavation missions when they were attacked by Tigris river pirates near Al Qurnah Recovery efforts assisted by the Ottoman authorities and British Residence in Baghdad loaded the equivalent of crates on a ship for Le Havre in May Few antiquities from the Fresnel mission made it to France Subsequent efforts to recover the lost antiquities from the Tigris including a Japanese expedition in have been largely unsuccessful br br Henry Rawlinson and George Smith worked there briefly in The next excavation was conducted by Hormuzd Rassam on behalf of the British Museum Work began in continuing until and was prompted by widespread looting of the site Using industrial scale digging in search of artifacts Rassam recovered a large quantity of cuneiform tablets and other finds The zealous excavation methods common at the time caused significant damage to the archaeological context Many tablets had appeared on the market in before Rassam s excavation began br br A team from the German Oriental Society led by Robert Koldewey conducted the first scientific archaeological excavations at Babylon The work was conducted daily from until A major problem for Koldewey was the large scale mining of baked bricks which began in the th century and which were mainly sourced from the time of Nebuchadnezzar II At the time excavations for brick mining for various building projects including the Hindiya dam were under way The primary efforts of the dig involved the temple of Marduk and the processional way leading up to it as well as the city wall br Artifacts including pieces of the Ishtar Gate and hundreds of recovered tablets were sent back to Germany where Koldewey s colleague Walter Andrae reconstructed them into displays at the Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin The Koldewey expedition recovered artifacts from the Old Babylonian period These included clay tablets with tablets from the Middle Babylonian period stored in private houses with Sumerian literature and lexical documents The German archaeologists fled before oncoming British troops in and again many objects went missing in the following years br Further work by the German Archaeological Institute was conducted by Heinrich J Lenzen in and Hansj rg Schmid in working the Hellenistic Parthian Sasanian and Arabic levels of the site Lenzen s work dealt primarily with the Hellenistic theatre and Schmid focused on the temple ziggurat Etemenanki br A topographical survey at the site was conducted in followed in by a review of the stratigraphical position of the main monuments and reconsideration of ancient water levels by the Turin Centre for Archaeological Research and Excavations in the Middle East and Asia and the Iraqi Italian Institute of Archaeological Sciences The focus was on clearing up issues raised by re examination of the old German data Additional work in concentrated on the area surrounding the Ishara and Ninurta temples in the Shu Anna city quarter of Babylon br A number of Iraqi excavations have occurred at Babylon the earliest in From excavation and restoration work was conducted at the Ninmah Temple Istar Temple and the Southern Palace Occasional excavations and restorations continued in the s and s br During the restoration efforts in Babylon the Iraqi State Organization for Antiquities and Heritage conducted extensive research excavation and clearing but wider publication of these archaeological activities has been limited Most of the known tablets from all modern excavations remain unpublished br br br Sources br br The main sources of information about Babylon excavation of the site itself references in cuneiform texts found elsewhere in Mesopotamia references in the Bible descriptions in other classical writing especially by Herodotus and second hand descriptions citing the work of Ctesias and Berossus present an incomplete and sometimes contradictory picture of the ancient city even at its peak in the sixth century BC Babylon was described perhaps even visited by a number of classical historians including Ctesias Herodotus Quintus Curtius Rufus Strabo and Cleitarchus These reports are of variable accuracy and some of the content was politically motivated but these still provide useful information br Historical knowledge of early Babylon must be pieced together from epigraphic remains found elsewhere such as at Uruk Nippur Sippar Mari and Haradum br br br Early references br br The earliest known mention of Babylon as a small town appears on a clay tablet from the reign of Shar Kali Sharri BC of the Akkadian Empire References to the city of Babylon can be found in Akkadian and Sumerian literature from the late third millennium BC One of the earliest is a tablet describing the Akkadian king ar kali arri laying the foundations in Babylon of new temples for Ann n tum and Ilaba Babylon also appears in the administrative records of the Third Dynasty of Ur which collected in kind tax payments and appointed an ensi as local governor br The so called Weidner Chronicle also known as ABC states that Sargon of Akkad c rd century BC in the short chronology had built Babylon in front of Akkad ABC A later chronicle states that Sargon dug up the dirt of the pit of Babylon and made a counterpart of Babylon next to Akkad ABC Van de Mieroop has suggested that those sources may refer to the much later Assyrian king Sargon II of the Neo Assyrian Empire rather than Sargon of Akkad br br br Classical dating br Ctesias quoted by Diodorus Siculus and in George Syncellus s Chronographia claimed to have access to manuscripts from Babylonian archives which date the founding of Babylon to BC under the reign of its first king Belus A similar figure is found in the writings of Berossus who according to Pliny stated that astronomical observations commenced at Babylon years before the Greek era of Phoroneus indicating BC Stephanus of Byzantium wrote that Babylon was built years before the date given by Hellanicus of Lesbos for the siege of Troy BC which would date Babylon s foundation to BC All of these dates place Babylon s foundation in the rd century BC However cuneiform records have not been found to correspond with these classical post cuneiform accounts br br br History br br The first attested mention of Babylon was in the late rd millennium BC during the Akkadian Empire reign of ruler Shar Kali Sharri one of whose year names mentions building two temples there Babylon was ruled by ensi governors for the empire Some of the known governors were Abba Ar i a It r ilum Murteli Unabatal and Puzur Tutu After that nothing is heard of the city until the time of Sumu la El After around BC Amorite kingdoms will appear in Uruk and Larsa in the south br br br Old Babylonian period br br According to a Babylonian king list Amorite rule in Babylon began c th or th century BC with a chieftain named Sumu abum who declared independence from the neighboring city state of Kazallu Sumu la El whose dates may be concurrent with those of Sumu abum is usually given as the progenitor of the First Babylonian dynasty Both are credited with building the walls of Babylon In any case the records describe Sumu la El s military successes establishing a regional sphere of influence for Babylon br Babylon was initially a minor city state and controlled little surrounding territory Its first four Amorite rulers did not assume the title of king The older and more powerful states of Elam Isin and Larsa overshadowed Babylon until it became the capital of Hammurabi s short lived empire about a century later Hammurabi r BC is famous for codifying the laws of Babylonia into the Code of Hammurabi He conquered all of the cities and city states of southern Mesopotamia including Isin Larsa Ur Uruk Nippur Lagash Eridu Kish Adab Eshnunna Akshak Shuruppak Bad tibira Sippar and Girsu coalescing them into one kingdom ruled from Babylon Hammurabi also invaded and conquered Elam to the east and the kingdoms of Mari and Ebla to the northwest After a conflict with the Old Assyrian period king Ishme Dagan he forced his successor to pay tribute late in his reign br After the reign of Hammurabi the whole of southern Mesopotamia came to be known as Babylonia From this time Babylon supplanted Nippur and Eridu as the major religious centers of southern Mesopotamia Hammurabi s empire destabilized after his death The far south of Mesopotamia broke away forming the native Sealand Dynasty and the Elamites appropriated territory in eastern Mesopotamia The Amorite dynasty remained in power in Babylon which again became a small city state After the destruction of the city the Kassites rose to control the region br Texts from Old Babylon often include references to Shamash the sun god of Sippar treated as a supreme deity and Marduk considered as his son Marduk was later elevated to a higher status and Shamash lowered perhaps reflecting Babylon s rising political power br br br Middle Babylon br In BC the city was sacked by Mursili I ruler of the Hittite Empire Thereafter the Kassite dynasty took power in the city of Babylon renaming it Karduniash ushering in a dynasty that lasted for years until BC br Babylon was weakened during the Kassite era and as a result Kassite Babylon began paying tribute to the Pharaoh of Egypt Thutmose III following his eighth campaign against Mitanni Kassite Babylon eventually became subject to the Middle Assyrian Empire BC to the north and Elam to the east with both powers vying for control of the city br By BC after continued attacks and annexing of territory by the Assyrians and Elamites the Kassites were deposed in Babylon An Akkadian south Mesopotamian dynasty then ruled for the first time However Babylon remained weak and subject to domination by Assyria Its ineffectual native kings were unable to prevent new waves of foreign West Semitic settlers from the deserts of the Levant including the Arameans and Suteans in the th century BC and finally the Chaldeans in the th century BC entering and appropriating areas of Babylonia for themselves The Arameans briefly ruled in Babylon during the late th century BC br br br Assyrian period br br During the rule of the Neo Assyrian Empire BC Babylonia was under constant Assyrian domination or direct control During the reign of Sennacherib of Assyria Babylonia was in a constant state of revolt led by a chieftain named Merodach Baladan in alliance with the Elamites and suppressed only by the complete destruction of the city of Babylon In BC its walls temples and palaces were razed and the rubble was thrown into the Arakhtu the sea bordering the earlier Babylon on the south The destruction of the religious center shocked many and the subsequent murder of Sennacherib by two of his own sons while praying to the god Nisroch was considered an act of atonement br Consequently his successor Esarhaddon hastened to rebuild the old city and make it his residence for part of the year After his death Babylonia was governed by his elder son the Assyrian prince Shamash shum ukin who eventually started a civil war in BC against his own brother Ashurbanipal who ruled in Nineveh Shamash shum ukin enlisted the help of other peoples against Assyria including Elam Persia the Chaldeans and Suteans of southern Mesopotamia and the Canaanites and Arabs dwelling in the deserts south of Mesopotamia br Once again Babylon was besieged by the Assyrians starved into surrender and its allies were defeated Ashurbanipal celebrated a service of reconciliation but did not venture to take the hands of Bel An Assyrian governor named Kandalanu was appointed as ruler of the city Ashurbanipal did collect texts from Babylon for inclusion in his extensive library at Ninevah br br br Neo Babylonian Empire br br Under Nabopolassar Babylon escaped Assyrian rule and the allied Medo Babylonian armies finally destroyed the Assyrian Empire between BC and BC Babylon thus became the capital of the Neo Babylonian sometimes called the Chaldean Empire br With the recovery of Babylonian independence a new era of architectural activity ensued particularly during the reign of his son Nebuchadnezzar II BC Nebuchadnezzar ordered the complete reconstruction of the imperial grounds including the Etemenanki ziggurat and the construction of the Ishtar Gate the most prominent of eight gates around Babylon A reconstruction of the Ishtar Gate is located in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin br Nebuchadnezzar is also credited with the construction of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World said to have been built for his homesick wife Amytis Whether the gardens actually existed is a matter of dispute German archaeologist Robert Koldewey speculated that he had discovered its foundations but many historians disagree about the location Stephanie Dalley has argued that the hanging gardens were actually located near the Assyrian capital Nineveh br Nebuchadnezzar is also notoriously associated with the Babylonian exile of the Jews the result of an imperial technique of pacification used also by the Assyrians in which ethnic groups in conquered areas were deported en masse to the capital According to the Hebrew Bible he destroyed Solomon s Temple and exiled the Jews to Babylon The defeat was also recorded in the Babylonian Chronicles br br br Persian conquest br br In BC the Neo Babylonian Empire fell to Cyrus the Great king of Persia with a military engagement known as the Battle of Opis Babylon s walls were considered impenetrable The only way into the city was through one of its many gates or through the Euphrates River Metal grates were installed underwater allowing the river to flow through the city walls while preventing intrusion The Persians devised a plan to enter the city via the river During a Babylonian national feast Cyrus troops upstream diverted the Euphrates River allowing Cyrus soldiers to enter the city through the lowered water The Persian army conquered the outlying areas of the city while the majority of Babylonians at the city center were unaware of the breach The account was elaborated upon by Herodotus and is mentioned in parts of the Hebrew Bible br Herodotus also described a moat an enormously tall and broad wall cemented with bitumen and with buildings on top and a hundred gates to the city He writes that the Babylonians wear turbans and perfume and bury their dead in honey that they practice ritual prostitution and that three tribes among them eat nothing but fish The hundred gates can be considered a reference to Homer Following the pronouncement of Archibald Henry Sayce in Herodotus account of Babylon has largely been considered to represent Greek folklore rather than an authentic voyage to Babylon However recently Dalley and others have suggested taking Herodotus account seriously br br According to Chronicles of the Hebrew Bible Cyrus later issued a decree permitting captive people including the Jews to return to their own lands The text found on the Cyrus Cylinder has traditionally been seen by biblical scholars as corroborative evidence of this policy although the interpretation is disputed because the text identifies only Mesopotamian sanctuaries but makes no mention of Jews Jerusalem or Judea br Under Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king Darius I Babylon became the capital city of the th Satrapy Babylonia in the south and Athura in the north as well as a center of learning and scientific advancement In Achaemenid Persia the ancient Babylonian arts of astronomy and mathematics were revitalized and Babylonian scholars completed maps of constellations The city became the administrative capital of the Persian Empire and remained prominent for over two centuries Many important archaeological discoveries have been made that can provide a better understanding of that era br The early Persian kings had attempted to maintain the religious ceremonies of Marduk who was the most important god but by the reign of Darius III over taxation and the strain of numerous wars led to a deterioration of Babylon s main shrines and canals and the destabilization of the surrounding region There were numerous attempts at rebellion and in BC Nebuchadnezzar III BC Nebuchadnezzar IV and BC Bel shimani and Shamash eriba native Babylonian kings briefly regained independence However these revolts were quickly repressed and Babylon remained under Persian rule for two centuries until Alexander the Great s entry in BC br br br Hellenistic period br In October of BC Darius III the last Achaemenid king of the Persian Empire was defeated by the forces of the Ancient Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great at the Battle of Gaugamela occupying Babylon Under Alexander Babylon again flourished as a center of learning and commerce However following Alexander s death in BC in the palace of Nebuchadnezzar his empire was divided amongst his generals the Diadochi and decades of fighting soon began Babylon declined somewhat in importance but remained active throughout this period br br br Renewed Persian rule br br Under the Parthian and Sassanid Empires Babylon like Assyria became a province of these Persian Empires for nine centuries until after AD Although it was captured briefly by Trajan in AD to be part of the newly conquered province of Mesopotamia his successor Hadrian relinquished his conquests east of the Euphrates river which became again the Roman Empire s eastern boundary br However Babylon maintained its own culture and people who spoke varieties of Aramaic and who continued to refer to their homeland as Babylon Examples of their culture are found in the Babylonian Talmud the Gnostic Mandaean religion Eastern Rite Christianity and the religion of the philosopher Mani Christianity was introduced to Mesopotamia in the st and nd centuries and Babylon was the seat of a Bishop of the Church of the East until well after the Arab Islamic conquest Coins from the Parthian Sasanian and Arabic periods excavated in Babylon demonstrate the continuity of settlement there br br br Muslim conquest br br In the mid th century Mesopotamia was conquered and settled by the expanding Muslim Empire and a period of Islamization followed Babylon was dissolved as a province and Aramaic and Church of the East Christianity eventually became marginalized Ibn Hawqal th century and the Arab scholar al Qazwini th century describe Babylon Babil as a small village The latter described a well referred to as the Dungeon of Daniel that was visited by Christians and Jews during holidays The grave shrine of Amran ibn Ali was visited by Muslims br According to medieval Arabic writings Babylon was a popular site to extract bricks which were used to build cities from Baghdad to Basra br European travellers in many cases could not discover the city s location or mistook Fallujah for it Benjamin of Tudela a th century traveller mentions Babylon but it is not clear if he went there Others referred to Baghdad as Babylon or New Babylon and described various structures encountered in the region as the Tower of Babel Pietro della Valle travelled to the village of Babil in Babylon in the th century and noted the existence of both baked and dried mudbricks cemented with bitumen br br br Modern era br br The eighteenth century saw an increasing flow of travellers to Babylon including Carsten Niebuhr and Pierre Joseph de Beauchamp as well as measurements of its latitude Beauchamp s memoir published in English translation in provoked the British East India Company to direct its agents in Baghdad and Basra to acquire Mesopotamian relics for shipment to London br By there were several villages in Babylon one of which was Qwaresh with about households located within the boundaries of the ancient inner city walls The village grew due to the need for laborers during the German Oriental Society excavations between br br br Iraqi government br The site of Babylon has been a cultural asset to Iraq since the creation of the modern Iraqi state in The site was officially protected and excavated by the Kingdom of Iraq under British Administration which later became the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq and its successors the Arab Federation the Iraqi Republic Ba athist Iraq also officially called the Iraqi Republic and the Republic of Iraq Babylonian images periodically appear on Iraqi postcards and stamps In the s a replica of the Ishtar Gate and a reconstruction of Ninmakh Temple were built on site br In February the Ba athist government of Iraq under Saddam Hussein began the Archaeological Restoration of Babylon Project reconstructing features of the ancient city atop its ruins These features included the Southern Palace of Nebuchadnezzar with rooms five courtyards and a meter entrance arch The project reinforced the Processional Way the Lion of Babylon and an amphitheater constructed in the city s Hellenistic era In the government minted a set of seven coins displaying iconic features of Babylon A Babylon International Festival was held in September and annually thereafter until excepting and to showcase this work The proposed reconstruction of the Hanging Gardens and the great ziggurat never took place br Hussein installed a portrait of himself and Nebuchadnezzar at the entrance to the ruins and inscribed his name on many of the bricks in imitation of Nebuchadnezzar One frequent inscription reads This was built by Saddam Hussein son of Nebuchadnezzar to glorify Iraq These bricks became sought after as collectors items after Hussein s downfall Similar projects were conducted at Nineveh Nimrud Assur and Hatra to demonstrate the magnificence of Arab achievement br In the s Saddam Hussein completely removed the village of Qwaresh displacing its residents He later constructed a modern palace in that area called Saddam Hill over some of the old ruins in the pyramidal style of a ziggurat In he intended to have a cable car line constructed over Babylon but plans were halted by the invasion of Iraq br br br Under US and Polish occupation br br Following the invasion of Iraq the area around Babylon came under the control of US troops before being handed over to Polish forces in September US forces under the command of General James T Conway of the I Marine Expeditionary Force were criticized for building the military base Camp Alpha with a helipad and other facilities on ancient Babylonian ruins during the Iraq War US forces occupied the site for some time and caused irreparable damage to the archaeological record In a report of the British Museum s Near East department John Curtis described how parts of the archaeological site were levelled to create a landing area for helicopters and parking lots for heavy vehicles Curtis wrote of the occupation forces br br They caused substantial damage to the Ishtar Gate one of the most famous monuments from antiquity US military vehicles crushed year old brick pavements archaeological fragments were scattered across the site more than trenches were driven into ancient deposits and military earth moving projects contaminated the site for future generations of scientists br A US military spokesman claimed that engineering operations were discussed with the head of the Babylon museum The head of the Iraqi State Board for Heritage and Antiquities Donny George said that the mess will take decades to sort out and criticised Polish troops for causing terrible damage to the site Poland resolved in to place the city under Iraq control and commissioned a report titled Report Concerning the Condition of the Preservation of the Babylon Archaeological Site which it presented at a meeting in December In the site was handed over to the Iraqi Ministry of Culture br In April Colonel John Coleman former Chief of Staff for the I Marine Expeditionary Force offered to issue an apology for the damage done by military personnel under his command He also claimed that the US presence had deterred far greater damage by other looters An April article stated that UN officials and Iraqi leaders have plans to restore Babylon making it into a cultural center br Two museums and a library containing replicas of artifacts and local maps and reports were raided and destroyed br br br Present day br In May the provincial government of Babil reopened the site to tourists Over people visited in An oil pipeline runs through an outer wall of the city In July the site of Babylon was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site br Thousands of people reside in Babylon within the perimeter of the ancient outer city walls and communities in and around them are rapidly developing from compact dense settlements to sprawling suburbia despite laws restricting constructions Modern villages include Zwair West Sinjar Village Qwaresh and Al Jimjmah among which the first two are better off economically Most residents primarily depend on daily wage earning or have government jobs in Al Hillah Some cultivate dates citrus fruits figs fodder for livestock and limited cash crops although income from the land alone is not enough to sustain a family Both Shi a and Sunni Muslims live in Sinjar village with mosques for both groups br The State Board of Antiquities and Heritage SBAH is the main authority responsible for the conservation of the archeological site They are assisted by Antiquity and Heritage Police and maintain a permanent presence there The World Monuments Fund is involved in research and conservation The SBAH Provincial Inspectorate Headquarters is located within the boundaries of the ancient inner city walls on the east side Several staff members and their families reside in subsidized housing in this area br br br Cultural importance br br Before modern archaeological excavations in Mesopotamia the appearance of Babylon was largely a mystery and typically envisioned by Western artists as a hybrid between ancient Egyptian classical Greek and contemporary Ottoman culture br Due to Babylon s historical significance as well as references to it in the Bible the word Babylon in various languages has acquired a generic meaning of a large bustling diverse city Examples include br br Babylon is used in reggae music as a concept in the Rastafari belief system denoting the materialistic capitalist world or any form of imperialist evil It is believed that Babylon actively seeks to exploit and oppress the people of the world specifically people of African descent It is believed by Rastafarians that Babylon attempts to forbid the smoking of ganja because this sacred herb opens minds to the truth br Babylon A science fiction series set on a futuristic space station that acts as a trading and diplomatic nexus between many different cultures Many stories focus on the theme of different societies and cultures uniting respecting differences and learning from each other rather than fighting or looking on each other with prejudice and suspicion br Babylon A D takes place in New York City decades in the future br Babilonas Lithuanian name for Babylon is a real estate development in Lithuania br Babylon is a song by Lady Gaga that uses allusions to ancient Biblical themes to discuss gossip br Eternals depicts Babylon on its greatest extent and is shown to be protected and aided in its development by the eternals br br br Biblical narrative br In the Book of Genesis Babel Babylon is described as founded by Nimrod along with Uruk Akkad and perhaps Calneh all of them in Shinar Calneh is now sometimes translated not as a proper name but as the phrase all of them Another story is given in Genesis which describes a united human race speaking one language migrating to Shinar to establish a city and tower the Tower of Babel God halts construction of the tower by scattering humanity across the earth and confusing their communication so they are unable to understand each other in the same language br After Hezekiah the king of Judah became ill Baladan king of Babylon sent a letter and gifts to him Hezekiah showed all of his treasures to the delegation and the prophet Isaiah later said to him Behold the days are coming when everything that is in your house and what your fathers have stored up to this day will be carried to Babylon nothing will be left Some years later Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon invaded Judah laid siege to Jerusalem and deported the Jews to Babylon br The prophet Daniel lived in Babylon for most of his life Nebuchadnezzar made Daniel ruler over the entire province of Babylon for having interpreted his dream Years later Belshazzar held a banquet at which fingers of a hand appeared and wrote on a wall Daniel was called to provide an interpretation of the writings upon which he explained that God had put an end to Belshazzar s kingdom Belshazzar was killed that very night and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom br The Book of Isaiah says the following regarding Babylon It will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them It will never be inhabited or lived in for all generations no Arab will pitch his tent there no shepherds will make their flocks lie down there The Book of Jeremiah says that Babylon will never again be inhabited and that no one will live there nor will anyone of mankind reside in it and that it will be a land in which no one of mankind passes The territories of Babylon Edom Bozrah Moab Tyre Hazor and the sons of Ammon are all predicted in the Bible to become like Sodom and Gomorrah or uninhabited forever br In Jewish tradition Babylon symbolizes an oppressor against which righteous believers must struggle In Christianity Babylon symbolizes worldliness and evil Prophecies sometimes symbolically link the kings of Babylon with Lucifer Nebuchadnezzar II sometimes conflated with Nabonidus appears as the foremost ruler in this narrative br The Book of Revelation in the Christian Bible refers to Babylon many centuries after it ceased to be a major political center The city is personified by the Whore of Babylon riding on a scarlet beast with seven heads and ten horns and drunk on the blood of the righteous Some scholars of apocalyptic literature believe this New Testament Babylon to be a dysphemism for the Roman Empire Other scholars suggest that Babylon in the book of Revelation has a symbolic significance that extends
