Old Irish also called Old Gaelic Old Irish Go delc Ogham script Irish Sean Ghaeilge Scottish Gaelic Seann Gh idhlig Manx Shenn Yernish or Shenn Ghaelg is the oldest form of the Goidelic Gaelic language for which there are extensive written texts It was used from c to c The main contemporary texts are dated c by the language had already transitioned into early Middle Irish Some Old Irish texts date from the th century although these are presumably copies of texts written at an earlier time Old Irish is thus forebear to Modern Irish Manx and Scottish Gaelic br Old Irish is known for having a particularly complex system of morphology and especially of allomorphy more or less unpredictable variations in stems and suffixes in differing circumstances as well as a complex sound system involving grammatically significant consonant mutations to the initial consonant of a word Apparently neither characteristic was present in the preceding Primitive Irish period though initial mutations likely existed in a non grammaticalised form in the prehistoric era br Contemporary Old Irish scholarship is still greatly influenced by the works of a small number of scholars active in the late th and early th centuries such as Rudolf Thurneysen and Osborn Bergin br br Notable characteristics of Old Irish compared with other old Indo European languages are br br Initial mutations including lenition nasalisation and aspiration gemination br A complex system of verbal allomorphy br A system of conjugated prepositions that is unusual in Indo European languages but common to Celtic languages There is a great deal of allomorphy here as well br Infixed or prefixed object prepositions which are inserted between the verb stem and its initial prefix es If a verb lacks any such prefixes a dummy prefix is normally added br Special verbal conjugations are used to signal the beginning of a relative clause br Old Irish also preserves most aspects of the complicated Proto Indo European PIE system of morphology Nouns and adjectives are declined in three genders masculine feminine neuter three numbers singular dual plural and five cases nominative vocative accusative dative and genitive Most PIE noun stem classes are maintained o yo y i u r n s and consonant stems Most of the complexities of PIE verbal conjugation are also maintained and there are new complexities introduced by various sound changes see below br br Old Irish was the only known member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages which is in turn a subfamily of the wider Indo European language family that also includes the Slavonic Italic Romance Indo Aryan and Germanic subfamilies along with several others Old Irish is the ancestor of all modern Goidelic languages Modern Irish Scottish Gaelic and Manx br A still older form of Irish is known as Primitive Irish Fragments of Primitive Irish mainly personal names are known from inscriptions on stone written in the Ogham alphabet The inscriptions date from about the th to the th centuries Primitive Irish appears to have been very close to Common Celtic the ancestor of all Celtic languages and it had a lot of the characteristics of other archaic Indo European languages br br Relatively little survives in the way of strictly contemporary sources They are represented mainly by shorter or longer glosses on the margins or between the lines of religious Latin manuscripts most of them preserved in monasteries in Germany Italy Switzerland France and Austria having been taken there by early Irish missionaries Whereas in Ireland many of the older manuscripts appear to have been worn out through extended and heavy use their counterparts on the Continent were much less prone to the same risk because once they ceased to be understood they were rarely consulted br The earliest Old Irish passages may be the transcripts found in the Cambrai Homily which is thought to belong to the early th century The Book of Armagh contains texts from the early th century Important Continental collections of glosses from the th and th century include the W rzburg Glosses mainly on the Pauline Epistles the Milan Glosses on a commentary to the Psalms and the St Gall Glosses on Priscian s Grammar br Further examples are found at Karlsruhe Germany Paris France Milan Florence and Turin Italy A late th century manuscript from the abbey of Reichenau now in St Paul in Carinthia Austria contains a spell and four Old Irish poems The Liber Hymnorum and the Stowe Missal date from about to br In addition to contemporary witnesses the vast majority of Old Irish texts are attested in manuscripts of a variety of later dates Manuscripts of the later Middle Irish period such as the Lebor na hUidre and the Book of Leinster contain texts which are thought to derive from written exemplars in Old Irish now lost and retain enough of their original form to merit classification as Old Irish br The preservation of certain linguistic forms current in the Old Irish period may provide reason to assume that an Old Irish original directly or indirectly underlies the transmitted text or texts br br The consonant inventory of Old Irish is shown in the chart below The complexity of Old Irish phonology is from a four way split of phonemes inherited from Primitive Irish with both a fortis lenis and a broad slender velarised vs palatalised distinction arising from historical changes The sounds f v x h n l r are the broad lenis equivalents of broad fortis p b t d k s m N L R likewise for the slender palatalised equivalents However most f f sounds actually derive historically from w since p was relatively rare in Old Irish being a recent import from other languages such as Latin br br Some details of Old Irish phonetics are not known s may have been pronounced or as in Modern Irish h may have been the same sound as h or x The precise articulation of the fortis sonorants N N L L R R is unknown but they were probably longer tenser and generally more strongly articulated than their lenis counterparts n n l l r r as in the Modern Irish and Scottish dialects that still possess a four way distinction in the coronal nasals and laterals N and L may have been pronounced and respectively The difference between R and r may have been that the former were trills while the latter were flaps m and were derived from an original fortis lenis pair br br Old Irish had distinctive vowel length in both monophthongs and diphthongs Short diphthongs were monomoraic taking up the same amount of time as short vowels while long diphthongs were bimoraic the same as long vowels This is much like the situation in Old English but different from Ancient Greek whose shorter and longer diphthongs were bimoraic and trimoraic respectively ai vs a i The inventory of Old Irish long vowels changed significantly over the Old Irish period but the short vowels changed much less br The following short vowels existed br br The short diphthong u likely existed very early in the Old Irish period but merged with u later on and in many instances was replaced with o due to paradigmatic levelling It is attested once in the phrase i routh by the prima manus of the W rzburg Glosses br arose from the u infection of stressed a by a u that preceded a palatalized consonant This vowel faced much inconsistency in spelling often detectable by a word containing it being variably spelled with au ai e i u across attestations Tulach hill mound is the most commonly cited example of this vowel with the spelling of its inflections including tulach itself telaig telocho tilchaib taulich and tailaig This special vowel also ran rampant in many words starting with the stressed prefix air from Proto Celtic are br Archaic Old Irish before about had the following inventory of long vowels br br Both e and e were normally written but must have been pronounced differently because they have different origins and distinct outcomes in later Old Irish e stems from Proto Celtic PIE ei or from in words borrowed from Latin e generally stems from compensatory lengthening of short e because of loss of the following consonant in certain clusters or a directly following vowel in hiatus It is generally thought that e was higher than e Perhaps e was e while e was They are clearly distinguished in later Old Irish in which e becomes a but before a palatal consonant e becomes in all circumstances Furthermore e is subject to u affection becoming u or u while e is not br A similar distinction may have existed between o and o both written and stemming respectively from former diphthongs eu au ou and from compensatory lengthening However in later Old Irish both sounds appear usually as a sometimes as and it is unclear whether o existed as a separate sound any time in the Old Irish period br ou existed only in early archaic Old Irish c or earlier afterwards it merged into au Neither sound occurred before another consonant and both sounds became in later Old Irish often or u before another vowel The late does not develop into a suggesting that u postdated a br Later Old Irish had the following inventory of long vowels br br Early Old Irish ai and oi merged in later Old Irish It is unclear what the resulting sound was as scribes continued to use both a and o to indicate the merged sound The choice of oi in the table above is somewhat arbitrary br The distribution of short vowels in unstressed syllables is a little complicated All short vowels may appear in absolutely final position at the very end of a word after both broad and slender consonants The front vowels e and i are often spelled ae and ai after broad consonants which might indicate a retracted pronunciation here perhaps something like and All ten possibilities are shown in the following examples br br The distribution of short vowels in unstressed syllables other than when absolutely final was quite restricted It is usually thought that there were only two allowed phonemes written a ai e i depending on the quality of surrounding consonants and u written u or o The phoneme u tended to occur when the following syllable contained an in Proto Celtic for example dligud d l i u law dat PC dliged or after a broad labial for example lebor L evur book domun do un world The phoneme occurred in other circumstances The occurrence of the two phonemes was generally unrelated to the nature of the corresponding Proto Celtic vowel which could be any monophthong long or short br Long vowels also occur in unstressed syllables However they rarely reflect Proto Celtic long vowels which were shortened prior to the deletion syncope of inner syllables Rather they originate in one of the following ways br br from the late resolution of a hiatus of two adjacent vowels usually as a result of loss of s between vowels br from compensatory lengthening in response to loss of a consonant cen l kindred gender cenethl du air ch r I have

the first syllable is a clitic the verbal prefix as in as beir as ber he says In such cases the unstressed prefix is indicated in grammatical works with a following centre dot br br As with most medieval languages the orthography of Old Irish is not fixed so the following statements are to be taken as generalisations only Individual manuscripts may vary greatly from these guidelines br The Old Irish alphabet consists of the following eighteen letters of the Latin alphabet br br a b c d e f g h i l m n o p r s t u br in addition to the five long vowels shown by an acute accent br br br the lenited consonants denoted with a superdot br br br and the eclipsis consonants also denoted with a superdot br br br Old Irish digraphs include the lenition consonants br br ch fh th ph sh br the

table indicates the broad pronunciation of various consonant letters in various environments br br When the consonants b d g are eclipsed by the preceding word always from a word initial position their spelling and pronunciation change to mb m nd N ng br Generally geminating a consonant ensures its unmutated sound While the letter c may be voiced at the end of some words but when it is written double cc it is always voiceless k in regularised texts however even final was often written cc as in bec becc small little Modern Irish and Scottish beag Manx beg br In later Irish manuscripts lenited f and s are denoted with the letter h fh sh instead of using a superdot br When initial s stemmed from Primitive Irish sw its lenited version is f br The slender palatalised variants of the consonants are denoted with marking the letter They occur in the following environments br br Before a written e i br After a written i when not followed by a vowel letter but not after the diphthongs a o u br Although Old Irish has both a sound h and a letter h there is no consistent relationship between the two Vowel initial words are sometimes written with an unpronounced h especially if they are very short the Old Irish preposition i in was sometimes written hi or if they need to be emphasised the name of Ireland riu was sometimes written H riu On the other hand words that begin with the sound h are usually written without it a r a ho r her gold If the sound and the spelling co occur it is by coincidence as n hed N i he it is not br br The voiceless stops of Old Irish are c p t They contrast with the voiced stops g b d Additionally the letter m can behave similarly to a stop following vowels These seven consonants often mutate when not in the word initial position br In non initial positions the single letter voiceless stops c p and t become the voiced stops b and d respectively unless they are written double Ambiguity in these letters pronunciations arises when a single consonant follows an l n or r The lenited stops ch ph and th become x f and respectively br br The voiced stops b d and g become fricative v and respectively identical sounds to their word initial lenitions br br In non initial positions the letter m usually becomes the nasal fricative but in some cases it becomes a nasal stop denoted as m In cases in which it becomes a stop m is often written double to avoid ambiguity br br Ambiguity arises in the pronunciation of the stop consonants c g t d p b when they follow l n or r br br After m the letter b is naturally a stop b After d l r the letter b is fricative v br br After n or r the letter d is a stop d br br After n l or r the letter g is usually a stop but it becomes a fricative in a few words br br The letters l n r are generally written double when they indicate tense sonorants and single when they indicate lax sonorants Originally it reflected an actual difference between single and geminate consonants as tense sonorants in many positions such as between vowels or word finally developed from geminates As the gemination was lost the use of written double consonants was repurposed to indicate tense sonorants Doubly written consonants of this sort do not occur in positions where tense sonorants developed from non geminated Proto Celtic sonorants such as word initially or before a consonant br br Geminate consonants appear to have existed since the beginning of the Old Irish period but they were simplified by the end as is generally reflected by the spelling Eventually however ll mm nn rr were repurposed to indicate nonlenited variants of those sounds in certain positions br br Written vowels a ai e i in poststressed syllables except when absolutely word final all seem to represent phonemic The particular vowel that appears is determined by the quality broad vs slender of the surrounding consonants and has no relation to the etymological vowel quality br br It seems likely that spelling variations reflected allophonic variations in the pronunciation of br br Old Irish underwent extensive phonological changes from Proto Celtic in both consonants and vowels Final syllables were lost or transphonologized as grammatical mutations on the following word In addition unstressed syllables faced various reductions and deletions of their vowels br br Old Irish is a fusional nominative accusative and VSO language br Nouns decline for cases nominative accusative genitive prepositional vocative genders masculine feminine neuter numbers singular dual plural Adjectives agree with nouns in case gender and number The prepositional case is called the dative by convention br Verbs conjugate for tenses past present future aspects simple perfective imperfective moods indicative subjunctive conditional imperative voices active and passive independent and dependent forms and simple and complex forms Verbs display tense aspect mood voice and sometimes portmanteau forms through suffixes or stem vowel changes for the former four Proclitics form a verbal complex with the core verb and the verbal complex is often preceded by preverbal particles such as n negative marker in interrogative marker ro perfective marker Direct object personal pronouns occur between the preverb and the verbal stem Verbs agree with their subject in person and number A single verb can stand as an entire sentence Emphatic particles such as sa and se are affixed to the end of the verb br Prepositions inflect for person and number and different prepositions govern different cases sometimes
