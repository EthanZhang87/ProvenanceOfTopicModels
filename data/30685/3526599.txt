a story about the Ring of Gyges which conferred invisibility on its wearer The shepherd Gyges who found it in a cave used its power to seduce the queen kill the king and take his place Earlier accounts of Gyges however who was king of Lydia make no mention of a magic ring Magic powers are not generally attributed to rings in ancient Greek legend although many other magical objects are listed particularly in the Perseus myth br Josephus repeats an anecdote of one Eleazar who used a magic ring to exorcise demons in the presence of Vespasian br J G Frazer in his study of magic and superstition in The Golden Bough has speculated to the effect that rings can serve in the primitive mind as devices to prevent the soul from leaving the body and to prevent demons from gaining entry A magic ring therefore might confer immortality by preventing the soul s departure and thwart the penetration of any harmful magic that might be directed against the wearer These magical properties inhibiting egress of the soul may explain an ancient Greek maxim attributed to the ancient philosopher and mystic Pythagoras which forbade people to wear rings p br br br Medieval demonology and alchemy br Traditional medieval Arabic and Hebraic demonology both cultivated the legend of the Ring of Solomon used to control demons and or djinn Tales of magic rings feature in One Thousand and One
