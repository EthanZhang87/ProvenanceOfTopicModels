longer be addressing those displeased with the way the show ended stating br br And what do I do I jump at the opportunity to acknowledge how many people were dissatisfied with how it ended I try to be self deprecating and witty when I do this but that s an elaborate or obvious defense mechanism to let people know I m fully aware of the elephant in the room and I m perfectly fine with it sitting down on my face and shitting all over me And here s my part I will finally stop talking about it I m not doing this because I feel entitled or above it I m doing it because I accept that I will not change hearts nor minds I will not convince you they weren t dead the whole time nor resent you for believing they were despite my infinite declarations otherwise br Lindelof was featured on a

Perrineau from the series that the actor called me racist so I fired his ass Lindelof responded to the allegations by saying I have no recollection of those specific things And that s not me saying that they didn t happen I m just saying that it s literally baffling my brain that they did happen and that I bore witness to them or that I said them To think that they came out of my mouth or the mouths of people that I still consider friends is just not computing Lindelof acknowledged personal failings during his time as showrunner on Lost saying My level of fundamental inexperience as a manager and a boss my role as someone who was supposed to model a climate of creative danger and risk taking but provide safety and comfort inside of the creative process I failed in that endeavor and
