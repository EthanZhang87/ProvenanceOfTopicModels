id: 74389865
Although fantasy had long existed in various forms around the world before his time J R R Tolkien has been called the father of fantasy and The Lord of the Rings its centre That novel published in enormously influenced fantasy writing establishing in particular the form of high or epic fantasy set in a secondary or fantasy world in an act of mythopoeia The book was distinctive at the time for its considerable length its epic feel with a cast of heroic characters its wide geography and its battles It involved an extensive history behind the action an impression of depth multiple sentient races and monsters and powerful talismans The story is a quest with multiple subplots The novel s success demonstrated that the genre was commercially distinct and viable br Many later fantasy writers have either imitated Tolkien s work or have written in reaction against it One of the first was Ursula Le Guin s Earthsea series of novels starting in which used Tolkienian archetypes such as wizards a disinherited prince a magical ring a quest and dragons A publishing rush followed Fantasy authors including Stephen R Donaldson and Philip Pullman have created intentionally non Tolkienian fantasies Donaldson with an unloveable protagonist and Pullman who is critical of The Lord of the Rings with a different view of the purpose of life br The genre has spread into film into both role playing and video games and into fantasy art Peter Jackson s The Lord of the Rings film series brought a new and very large audience to Tolkien s work Tolkien s influence reached role playing games as early as with Gary Gygax s Dungeons Dragons this was followed by many Middle earth video games some directly licensed and others based on Tolkienian fantasy culture Tolkien s fantasies have been illustrated by artists such as John Howe Alan Lee and Ted Nasmith who have become known as Tolkien artists br br br Context br br J R R Tolkien was a scholar of English literature a philologist and medievalist interested in language and poetry from the Middle Ages especially that of Anglo Saxon England and Northern Europe His professional knowledge of works such as Beowulf shaped his fictional world of Middle earth including his high fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings This did not prevent him from making use of modern sources including fantasy as well the J R R Tolkien Encyclopedia discusses authors whose works are paralleled by elements in Tolkien s writings br br br Fantasy in Tolkien s hands br br br Distinctive features br br The Lord of the Rings was constructed with several distinctive features These included its considerable length remarkable for its time when few genre novels exceeded words This was accompanied by an epic feel created by a combination of features such as its cast of heroic characters its wide geography and its battles The story is told with allusions to older times giving both an impression of depth behind the action and a past that fades into mythology The heroes encounter multiple sentient races including both free peoples like elves and dwarves and monsters like trolls and giant spiders Powerful talismans are deployed such as swords with their own names wizards staffs magical rings and seeing stones As for the story there is a quest accompanied by many subplots As if this were not enough Tolkien gives the plot a moral dimension the characters have to rely on their own courage and luck believing that the unseen powers will support them br The Lord of the Rings and to some extent also his children s novel The Hobbit make use of multiple elements to make the fantasy world of Middle earth convincing These include detailed maps with a large number of placenames an impression of depth a frame story poetry interspersed with the narrative family trees invented languages that had been worked out in detail complete with scripts artwork and heraldry br br The impression of depth in particular helps to make Middle earth feel like what Tom Shippey has called a coherent consistent deeply fascinating world about which Tolkien had no time then to speak As another example the heraldry helps to convey impressions such as the evident majesty of the hero Aragorn br br upon the foremost ship a great standard broke and the wind displayed it as she turned towards the Harlond There flowered a White Tree and that was for Gondor but Seven Stars were about it and a high crown above it the signs of Elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond count And the stars flamed in the sunlight for they were wrought of gems by Arwen daughter of Elrond and the crown was bright in the morning for it was wrought of mithril and gold br br br Mythopoeia br br Mythopoeia is the creation of a fictional mythology incorporating traditional mythological themes and archetypes within a work of literature Tolkien was not the first author to create fictional worlds as George MacDonald and H Rider Haggard had done so and were praised for their mythopoeic gifts by Tolkien s friend and fellow Inkling C S Lewis Tolkien however went much further spending many years developing what has been called a mythology for England starting in The Finnish scholar Jyrki Korpua argues that Tolkien followed a specific mythopoetic code in his legendarium spanning creation Ainulindal world building Valaquenta start of Quenta Silmarillion the fall Quenta Silmarillion a period of struggle Akallab th and The Lord of the Rings and the end of the world as in Morgoth s Ring Korpua states that this code is both linear and somewhat Biblical and that it makes use of archetypes Tolkien created numerous archetypes in his Middle earth writings He established as stock fantasy elements familiar and attractive to readers the distinct races of Elves Dwarves Ents Trolls Orcs and Hobbits br br br Impact br The Lord of the Rings had an enormous impact on the fantasy genre in some respects it swamped all the works of fantasy that had been written before it and it unquestionably created fantasy as a marketing category Tolkien has been called the father of modern fantasy or more specifically of high fantasy Tolkien s works brought fantasy literature a new degree of mainstream acclaim numerous polls named The Lord of the Rings the greatest book of the century The author and editor of Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts Brian Attebery writes that fantasy is defined not by boundaries but by a centre which is The Lord of the Rings br Diana Paxson states in Mythlore that Tolkien had founded a new literary tradition Tolkien s influence and his literary criticism greatly popularized secondary worlds as his formative essay On Fairy Stories termed them This led to the decline of such devices as dream frames to explain away a fantastical setting br br br Tolkien influenced fantasy writing br br It has been said of Tolkien that most subsequent writers of fantasy are either imitating him or else desperately trying to escape his influence while his hold over readers has been extraordinary br br br Inspired by Tolkien br The immense success of Tolkien s works started a publishing rush Lin Carter edited the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series from reprinting Morris Dunsany MacDonald and Mirrlees alongside some new works Many authors wrote Tolkienesque books with stories rooted in folklore myth and magic set in a medieval countryside Among these were Patricia A McKillip s The Forgotten Beasts of Eld and Jane Yolen s The Magic Three of Solatia Tolkien inspired fantasies for young adults written in the mid s Yolen comments that while some of the writing was good what began in grace and power easily degenerated into a kind of mythic silliness with pastel unicorns coy talking swords and a paint by number medieval setting with the requisite number of dirty inns evil wizards and gentle hairy footed beings of various sexual persuasions Tolkien would have been horrified br br In Lester Del Rey seeking to mirror Tolkien s work published Terry Brooks s The Sword of Shannara The book was heavily criticised by Carter Attebery and others for copying the plot and characters of The Lord of the Rings wholesale Attebery wrote that it attempted to evoke wonder without engaging the mind or emotions reducing Tolkien s artistry to a bare formula Despite this it gained the sort of breakthrough success that Del Rey had hoped for it became the first fantasy novel to appear on and eventually to top the New York Times bestseller list br Guy Gavriel Kay who had assisted Christopher Tolkien with the editing of The Silmarillion later wrote his own Tolkien influenced fantasy trilogy The Fionavar Tapestry complete with dwarves and mages Dennis L McKiernan s Silver Call duology was intended to be a direct sequel to The Lord of the Rings but had to be altered The Iron Tower trilogy highly influenced by Tolkien s books was then written as backstory Fantasy series such as Terry Pratchett s Discworld and Orson Scott Card s The Tales of Alvin Maker were undoubtedly influenced by Tolkien br In Martin H Greenberg edited a festschrift collection of short stories by fantasy authors including Yolen Stephen R Donaldson Terry Pratchett Poul and Karen Anderson and Peter S Beagle on the centenary of Tolkien s birth Yolen commenting that sometimes it is difficult to remember that there were fantasy books written before J R R Tolkien s work stated that the stories were not imitations for none of us are imitators but in honor of his work br br Many writers have made use of Tolkienesque plots settings and characters The plot of Pat Murphy s There and Back Again intentionally mirrors that of The Hobbit but is transposed into a science fiction setting involving space travel J K Rowling s Harry Potter series too is influenced by Tolkien for example the wizard Dumbledore has been described as partially inspired by Tolkien s Gandalf Further Rowling explores the Tolkienian themes of death and immortality and the nature of evil and how it arises with Lord Voldemort taking the place of the Dark Lord Morgoth S M Stirling s Emberverse series includes a character obsessed with The Lord of the Rings who creates a post apocalyptic community based Tolkien s Elves and D nedain The same plot point was used by the Russian writer Vladimir Berezin in his novel Road Signs from the Universe of Metro The horror writer Stephen King has acknowledged Tolkien s influence on his novel The Stand and his fantasy series The Dark Tower Other prominent fantasy writers including George R R Martin Michael Swanwick Raymond E Feist Poul Anderson Karen Haber Harry Turtledove Charles De Lint and Orson Scott Card have acknowledged Tolkien s work as an inspiration br br br Reacting against Tolkien br br Some writers have reacted against Tolkien by creating fantasy that does not fit the expected pattern Thus Stephen R Donaldson s The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant has an unloveable protagonist quite unlike a hobbit John R Fultz calls Covenant a whiner a complainer a broken man with no hope for himself or the kingdom he was charged with saving The world that Covenant visits might resemble Middle earth as might his quest but the book s approach a dark counterpoint to Tolkien s shining heroism is entirely different br Philip Pullman s His Dark Materials trilogy is according to Pullman a rival to both The Lord of the Rings and Tolkien s fellow Inkling C S Lewis s The Chronicles of Narnia Pullman states that he disagrees with Lewis s answer to questions about the existence of God and the purpose of life and asserts that Tolkien doesn t touch those issues at all As a result he finds Tolkien essentially trivial and not worth arguing with Ross Douthat comments in The Atlantic that Pullman s dismiss ing the Rings saga as trivial tells you a great deal about where his own fantasy saga went wrong In Douthat s view Pullman s compelling and fun world building in The Golden Compass the first novel in the trilogy complete with the armoured bear and the witches the Jules Verne meets Tolkien landscape slowly fades out in the later novels Pullman has further criticised The Lord of the Rings for not having any strong female characters in his view There is absolutely no awareness of sexual power and mystery in the book br br br Using Tolkienian sources br br The scholar of folklore Dimitra Fimi suggests a third group of Tolkien influenced authors the British fantasists Susan Cooper Alan Garner and Diana Wynne Jones In her view all were like Tolkien prompted to fantasy by war all three attended Tolkien s lectures at the University of Oxford and all admitted being influenced by British myth and folklore the sorts of medieval intertexts that Tolkien had used While Wynne Jones wrote high fantasy about secondary worlds Cooper and Garner wrote intrusion fantasy in which the supernatural or fantastic intrudes into the ordinary world br br br Reworking Tolkienian conventions br br In Ursula K Le Guin published the high fantasy A Wizard of Earthsea followed between and by her other Earthsea novels and short stories It was one of the first fantasy series influenced by Tolkien Among the Tolkienian archetypes in the Earthsea books are wizards including the protagonist Ged a disinherited prince Arren in The Farthest Shore a magical ring the ring of Erreth Akbe in The Tombs of Atuan a Middle earth style quest in The Farthest Shore and powerful dragons like the dragon of Pendor in A Wizard of Earthsea br Fimi writes that Le Guin s secondary world along with its mythology is very much un Tolkienian It has its own culture languages and history but she notes Earthsea does not share the British flavor of Middle earth Earthsea consists of an archipelago not a continent has brown skinned protagonists and Taoist philosophy Le Guin stated that Tolkien s wizard Gandalf was the germ for A Wizard of Earthsea the character led her to wonder how wizards learnt what is obviously an erudite and dangerous art Are there colleges for young wizards resulting in the young Ged s going to the island of Roke to study at the School of Magic and ultimately to become the Archmage In Fimi s view Le Guin has navigated her way around Tolkien s legacy with care and a real creative flair br br br Tolkien influenced fantasy media br br br Film br br The fantasy genre has expanded from the written form into film Peter Jackson s The Lord of the Rings film series brought Tolkien to the cinema screen gaining him and fantasy in general a new and very large audience Its success was followed up by the The Chronicles of Narnia film series adapted from Lewis s Narnia books and the eight Harry Potter films The fantasy market accommodated too some very un Tolkien like films such as Guillermo del Toro s Pan s Labyrinth set in post Spanish Civil War Spain where a mythical world full of strange monsters intrudes upon the real world Del Toro was later involved in the development of The Hobbit film series despite having said of Tolkien s Middle earth that I don t like little guys and dragons hairy feet hobbits I don t like sword and sorcery I hate all that stuff br br br Games br br Tolkien s influence extends to role playing games including Gary Gygax s Dungeons Dragons Gygax was obliged after a lawsuit to rename some especially Tolkienesque types of character such as Hobbits which became Halflings Nazgul which became Wraiths and the Balrog which became Balor Many video games inspired by Middle earth have been manufactured by studios including Electronic Arts Vivendi Games Melbourne House and Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment Apart from games directly licensed to use Middle earth material other developers have developed video games such as Baldur s Gate EverQuest The Elder Scrolls Neverwinter Nights and World of Warcraft grown from the culture put forth from Tolkien s works br br br Art br br Tolkien is one of the few authors in any domain not just to have had his works illustrated by fantasy artists in his case including John Howe Alan Lee and Ted Nasmith whose work was praised by Tolkien but to have spawned a named profession Tolkien artist Howe and Lee served too as concept artists for Jackson s Middle earth films The Brothers Hildebrandt created many Tolkien artworks in the s a selection appearing in their Tolkien calendars br In Russia Alexander Korotich created a set of scraperboard illustrations for The Lord of the Rings He also drew illustrations for a collection of Tolkien s fairy tales for
