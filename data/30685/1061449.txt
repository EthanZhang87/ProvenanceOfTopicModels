title: Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II
id: 1061449
The evacuation of civilians in Britain during the Second World War was designed to defend individuals especially children from the risks associated with aerial bombing of cities by moving them to areas thought to be less at risk br Under the name Operation Pied Piper the effort began on September and officially relocated million people There were further waves of official evacuation and re evacuation from the south and east coasts in June when a seaborne invasion was expected and from affected cities after the Blitz began in September Official evacuations also took place from the UK to other parts of the British Empire and many non official evacuations within and from the UK Other mass movements of civilians included British citizens arriving from the Channel Islands and displaced people arriving from continental Europe br br br Background br br The Government Evacuation Scheme was developed during the summer of by the Anderson Committee and implemented by the Ministry of Health The country was divided into zones classified as either evacuation neutral or reception with priority evacuees being moved from the major urban centres and billeted on the available private housing in more rural areas Each zone covered roughly a third of the population although several urban areas later bombed had not been classified for evacuation br In early the reception areas compiled lists of available housing Space was found for about people and the government also constructed camps that provided a few thousand additional spaces br The government began to publicise its plan through the local authorities in summer The government had overestimated demand only half of all school aged children were moved from the urban areas instead of the expected There was enormous regional variation as few as of the children were evacuated from some urban areas while over of children were evacuated from Manchester Belfast and Liverpool The refusal of the central government to spend large sums on preparation also reduced the effectiveness of the plan Despite that over people were evacuated br br br Evacuation br br Almost million people were displaced with around a third of the entire population experiencing some effects of the evacuation In the first three days of official evacuation million people were moved children of school age mothers and young children under pregnant women disabled people and over teachers and other helpers Children were parted from their parents br Goods as well as people were evacuated organisations or departments departed the cities Art treasures were sent to distant storage The National Gallery collection spent the war at the Manod Quarry near Ffestiniog North Wales The Bank of England moved to the small town of Overton Hampshire and in moved tons of gold to the vaults of the Bank of Canada in Ottawa The BBC moved variety production to Bristol and Bedford and moved senior staff to Wood Norton near Evesham Worcestershire Many senior Post Office staff were relocated to Harrogate Some private companies moved head offices or their most vital records to comparative safety away from major cities br Government functions were also evacuated Under Plan Yellow some civil servants and their paperwork were dispatched to available hotels in the better coastal resorts and spa towns Other hotels were requisitioned and emptied for a possible last ditch Black Move should London be destroyed or threatened by invasion Under this plan the nucleus of government would relocate to the West Midlands the War Cabinet and ministers would move to Hindlip Hall Bevere House and Malvern College near Worcester and Parliament to Stratford upon Avon Winston Churchill was to relocate to Spetchley Park whilst King George VI and other members of the royal family would take up residence at Madresfield Court near Malvern br Some strained areas took the children into local schools by adopting the First World War expedient of double shift education taking twice as long but also doubling the number taught The movement of teachers also meant that almost a million children staying home had no source of education br br br Evacuation centres br br In the British Government passed the Camps Act which established the National Camps Corporation as a body to design and build residential camps for young people which could provide opportunities for outdoor learning and also act as evacuation centres in the event of war The architect T S Tait was responsible for the design of the buildings which included accommodation for over children and staff recreational halls wash blocks and a dining hall kitchen complex These camps were replicated in over thirty different rural locations around the country br During the war years they acted as safe refuges for city children After the war the ownership of the sites was transferred to the local authorities Over the years most of these sites have been lost but the best preserved example today is Sayers Croft at Ewhurst Surrey The dining hall and kitchen complex is protected as a Grade II listed building because of the importance of Tait s work and because of the painted murals depicting the life of the many evacuees Evacuation Centres were also set up by the Foster Parent Plan FPP for Children Affected by War later renamed Plan International br One evacuated school was sponsored by the FPP in Knutsford Cheshire with each child being financially supported by an American citizen One female pupil named Paulette was sponsored by Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt br br br Overseas evacuation br The Children s Overseas Reception Board CORB approved children for evacuation overseas Between March and September children were evacuated to Canada mainly through the Pier immigration terminal to Australia to South Africa and to New Zealand The scheme was cancelled after the City of Benares was torpedoed on September killing of the CORB children aboard However in and about children were evacuated privately to overseas relatives or foster families including to Canada and to the United States br The BBC cooperated with radio networks in the host countries to make Children Calling Home a programme which enabled the evacuated children and their parents to talk to each other live on air br br br Other evacuations br br A second evacuation effort started during and after the fall of France From to June around children were evacuated and in many cases re evacuated Efforts were made to remove the vulnerable from coastal towns in southern and eastern England facing German controlled areas By July over children had been moved some towns in Kent and East Anglia evacuated over of the population Also some people arrived from continental Europe and from to June people arrived from the Channel Islands br As thousands of Guernsey school children arrived in northern England with their teachers some were allowed to re establish their schools in empty buildings Guernsey s Forest School reopened in a church hall in Cheadle Hulme Cheshire where it operated until August As a result of the evacuation of so many Guernsey people to England those returning no longer spoke the Guernsey language Guernsiaise after the war br One of the speediest moves was accomplished by the London Midland and Scottish Railway when it transferred its headquarters out of London The company took over The Grove on the estate of the Earl of Clarendon in Hertfordshire This was made ready as offices and a number of huts built in the surrounding park On September it was decided to move in and the transfer was completed before war was declared two days later Within three days some of the staff were based at the new headquarters br br When the Blitz began in September there were clear grounds for evacuation Free travel and billeting allowance were offered to those who made private arrangements They were also given to children the elderly the disabled pregnant women the ill and those who had lost their homes some in the first six weeks in London By the combination of all the state and private efforts London s population was reduced by almost br As bombing affected more towns assisted private evacuation was extended However not all evacuated children mothers and teachers were safe in the areas to which they had been evacuated Air raids unexploded bombs military vehicles and military minefields posed risks to the evacuees wherever they were posted in the UK br London proved resilient to bombing despite the heavy bombardment The destruction in the smaller towns was more likely to provoke panic and spontaneous evacuations The number of official evacuees rose to a peak of million by February By September it stood at just over one million By the end of there were just people officially billeted Still the V flying bomb attacks from June provoked another significant exodus from London Up to million people left by September only were official evacuees br From September the evacuation process was officially halted and reversed for most areas except for London and the east coast Returning to London was not officially approved until June In March the billeting scheme was ended with people still without homes br br br Traumatic effect on children br Even at the time there were some that had grave concerns about the psychological effect on especially the younger children and wondered whether they would be better off taking the risks with their parents br In the early s a number of evacuees came forward to clarify the many bad sides of the evacuation br br br Cultural impact br br The movement of urban children of all classes to unfamiliar rural locations without their parents had a major impact The Evacuees Reunion Association was formed with the support of the Imperial War Museum It provides opportunities for former evacuees to contribute and share evacuation experiences and for researchers to request information such as the long term effects of evacuation upon children br The evacuation spawned a whole literature of children s and young adult fiction The convenience of the setting for the writer is clear allowing the child heroes to have adventures in a strange new world Some of the authors like Nina Bawden had themselves experienced evacuation br br Kitty Barne s
