British literature is from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands This article covers British literature in the English language Anglo Saxon Old English literature is included and there is some discussion of Latin and Anglo Norman literature where literature in these languages relate to the early development of the English language and literature There is also some brief discussion of major figures who wrote in Scots but the main discussion is in the various Scottish literature articles br The article Literature in the other languages of Britain focuses on the literatures written in the other languages that are and have been used in Britain There are also articles on these various literatures Latin literature in Britain Anglo Norman Cornish Guern siais J rriais Latin Manx Scottish Gaelic Welsh etc br Irish writers have played an important part in the development of literature in England and Scotland but though the whole of Ireland was politically part of the United Kingdom from January to December it can be controversial to describe Irish literature as British For some this includes works by authors from Northern Ireland br The United Kingdom publishes more books per capita than any other country in the world br br br British identity br The nature of British identity has changed over time The island that contains England Scotland and Wales has been known as Britain from the time of the Roman Pliny the Elder c AD English as the national language had its beginnings with the Anglo Saxon invasion which started around AD Before that the inhabitants mainly spoke various Celtic languages The various constituent parts of the present United Kingdom joined at different times Wales was annexed by the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union of and However it was not until with a treaty between England and Scotland that the Kingdom of Great Britain came into existence This merged in January with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Subsequently Irish nationalism led to the partition of the island of Ireland in thus the literature of the Republic of Ireland is not British although literature from Northern Ireland is both Irish and British br In the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act formally changing the name of the UK to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland br Until fairly recent times Celtic languages continued to be spoken widely in Scotland Wales Cornwall and Ireland and these languages still survive especially in parts of Wales br Works written in the English language by Welsh writers especially if their subject matter relates to Wales has been recognised as a distinctive entity since the th century The need for a separate identity for this kind of writing arose because of the parallel development of modern Welsh language literature br Because Britain was a colonial power the use of English spread through the world from the th century or earlier in the United States and later in other former colonies major writers in English began to appear beyond the boundaries of Britain and Ireland later these included Nobel laureates br br br The coming of the Anglo Saxons c br br br The other languages of early Britain br Although the Romans withdrew from Britain in the early th century Latin literature mostly ecclesiastical continued to be written including Chronicles by Bede Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum and Gildas c De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae br br Various Celtic languages were spoken by many British people at that time Among the more important written works that have survived are Y Gododdin and the Mabinogion From the th to the th centuries Vikings and Norse settlers and their descendants colonised parts of what is now modern Scotland Some Old Norse poetry survives relating to this period including the Orkneyinga saga an historical narrative of the history of the Orkney Islands from its capture by the Norwegian king in the th century until about br br br Old English literature c br br Old English literature or Anglo Saxon literature encompasses the surviving literature written in Old English in Anglo Saxon England from the settlement of the Saxons and other Germanic tribes in England Jutes and the Angles around until soon after the Norman Conquest in that is c These works include genres such as epic poetry hagiography sermons Bible translations legal works chronicles riddles and others In all there are about surviving manuscripts from the period br Oral tradition was very strong in early English culture and most literary works were written to be performed Epic poems were thus very popular and some including Beowulf have survived to the present day Beowulf is the most famous work in Old English and has achieved national epic status in England despite being set in Scandinavia br Nearly all Anglo Saxon authors are anonymous are known by name from medieval sources but only four of those are known by their vernacular works with any certainty C dmon Bede Alfred the Great and Cynewulf C dmon is the earliest English poet whose name is known C dmon s only known surviving work is C dmon s Hymn which probably dates from the late th century br Chronicles contained a range of historical and literary accounts and a notable example is the Anglo Saxon Chronicle The poem Battle of Maldon also deals with history This is the name given to a work of uncertain date celebrating the real Battle of Maldon of at which the Anglo Saxons failed to prevent a Viking invasion br Classical antiquity was not forgotten in Anglo Saxon England and several Old English poems are adaptations of late classical philosophical texts The longest is King Alfred s translation of Boethius Consolation of Philosophy br br br Late medieval literature br br The linguistic diversity of the islands in the medieval period contributed to a rich variety of artistic production and made British literature distinctive and innovative br Some works were still written in Latin these include Gerald of Wales s late th century book on his beloved Wales Itinerarium Cambriae After the Norman Conquest of Anglo Norman literature developed introducing literary trends from Continental Europe such as the chanson de geste However the indigenous development of Anglo Norman literature was precocious in comparison to continental O l literature br Geoffrey of Monmouth c c was one of the major figures in the development of British history and of the popularity of the tales of King Arthur He is best known for his chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae History of the Kings of Britain of which spread Celtic motifs to a wider audience Wace c after who wrote in Norman French is the earliest known poet from Jersey he also developed the Arthurian legend At the end of the th century Layamon in Brut adapted Wace to make the first English language work to use the legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table It was also the first historiography written in English since the Anglo Saxon Chronicle br br br Middle English br Interest in King Arthur continued in the th century with Sir Thomas Malory s Le Morte d Arthur a popular and influential compilation of some French and English Arthurian romances It was among the early books printed in England by Caxton br In the later medieval period a new form of English now known as Middle English evolved This is the earliest form which is comprehensible to modern readers and listeners albeit not easily Middle English Bible translations notably Wycliffe s Bible helped to establish English as a literary language Wycliffe s Bible is the name now given to a group of Bible translations into Middle English that were made under the direction of or at the instigation of John Wycliffe They appeared over a period from about to br Piers Plowman or Visio Willelmi de Petro Plowman William s Vision of Piers Plowman written c is a Middle English allegorical narrative poem by William Langland It is written in unrhymed alliterative verse divided into sections called pass s Latin for steps Piers is considered by many critics to be one of the early great works of English literature along with Chaucer s Canterbury Tales and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight during the Middle Ages br Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is a late th century Middle English alliterative romance It is one of the better known Arthurian stories of an established type known as the beheading game Developing from Welsh Irish and English tradition Sir Gawain highlights the importance of honour and chivalry Preserved in the same manuscript with Sir Gawayne were three other poems now generally accepted as the work of its author including the intricate elegiac poem Pearl br br Geoffrey Chaucer c known as the Father of English literature is widely considered the greatest English poet of the Middle Ages and was the first poet to have been buried in Poet s Corner in Westminster Abbey Chaucer is best known today for The Canterbury Tales a collection of stories written in Middle English mostly written in verse although some are in prose that are presented as part of a story telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a journey from Southwark to the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral Chaucer is a crucial figure in developing the legitimacy of Middle English at a time when the dominant literary languages in England were French and Latin br The multilingual nature of the audience for literature in the th century can be illustrated by the example of John Gower c October A contemporary of Langland and a personal friend of Chaucer Gower is remembered primarily for three major works the Mirroir de l Omme Vox Clamantis and Confessio Amantis three long poems written in Anglo Norman Latin and Middle English respectively which are united by common moral and political themes br Women writers were also active such as Marie de France in the th century and Julian of Norwich in the early th century Julian s Revelations of Divine Love around is believed to be the first published book written by a woman in the English language Margery Kempe c after is known for writing The Book of Margery Kempe a work considered by some to be the first autobiography in the English language br Major Scottish writers from the th century include Henrysoun Dunbar Douglas and Lyndsay The works of Chaucer had an influence on Scottish writers br br br Medieval drama br br In the Middle Ages drama in the vernacular languages of Europe may have emerged from religious enactments of the liturgy Mystery plays were presented on the porches of the cathedrals or by strolling players on feast days Miracle and mystery plays along with moralities and interludes later evolved into more elaborate forms of drama such as was seen on the Elizabethan stages Another form of medieval theatre was the mummers plays a form of early street theatre associated with the Morris dance concentrating on themes such as Saint George and the Dragon and Robin Hood These were folk tales re telling old stories and the actors travelled from town to town performing these for their audiences in return for money and hospitality br Mystery plays and miracle plays are among the early formally developed plays in medieval Europe Mystery plays focused on the representation of Bible stories in churches as tableaux with accompanying antiphonal song They developed from the th to the th century reaching the height of their popularity in the th century before being rendered obsolete by the rise of professional theatre br br There are four complete or nearly complete extant English biblical collections of plays from the late medieval period The most complete is the York cycle of forty eight pageants They were performed in the city of York from the middle of the th century until Besides the Middle English drama there are three surviving plays in Cornish known as the Ordinalia br Having grown out of the religiously based mystery plays the morality play is a genre of medieval and early Tudor theatrical entertainment which represented a shift towards a more secular base for European theatre Morality plays are a type of allegory in which the protagonist is met by personifications of various moral attributes who try to prompt him to choose a godly life over one of evil The plays were most popular in Europe during the th and th centuries br The Somonyng of Everyman The Summoning of Everyman c usually referred to simply as Everyman is a late th century English morality play Like John Bunyan s allegory Pilgrim s Progress Everyman examines the question of Christian salvation through the use of allegorical characters br br br The Renaissance br Renaissance style and ideas were slow to penetrate England and Scotland and the Elizabethan era is usually regarded as the height of the English Renaissance However many scholars see its beginnings in the early s during the reign of Henry VIII br Italian literary influences arrived in Britain the sonnet form was introduced into English by Thomas Wyatt in the early th century and was developed by Henry Howard Earl of Surrey who also introduced blank verse into England with his translation of Virgil s Aeneid in c br The spread of printing affected the transmission of literature across Britain and Ireland The first book printed in English William Caxton s own translation of Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye was printed abroad in to be followed by the establishment of the first printing press in England in br br Latin continued in use as a language of learning long after the Reformation had established the vernaculars as liturgical languages for the elites br Utopia is a work of fiction and political philosophy by Thomas More published in The book written in Latin is a frame narrative primarily depicting a fictional island society and its religious social and political customs br br br Elizabethan era br br br Poetry br In the later th century English poetry used elaborate language and extensive allusions to classical myths Sir Edmund Spenser was the author of The Faerie Queene an epic poem and fantastical allegory celebrating the Tudor dynasty and Elizabeth I The works of Sir Philip Sidney a poet courtier and soldier include Astrophel and Stella The Defence of Poetry and Arcadia Poems intended to be set to music as songs such as those by Thomas Campion became popular as printed literature was disseminated more widely in households see English Madrigal School br br br Drama br During the reign of Elizabeth I and then James I a London centred culture that was both courtly and popular produced great poetry and drama The English playwrights were intrigued by Italian model a conspicuous community of Italian actors had settled in London The linguist and lexicographer John Florio whose father was Italian was a royal language tutor at the Court of James I and a possible friend and influence on William Shakespeare had brought much of the Italian language and culture to England He was also the translator of Montaigne into English The earlier Elizabethan plays include Gorboduc by Sackville and Norton and Thomas Kyd s revenge tragedy The Spanish Tragedy Highly popular and influential in its time The Spanish Tragedy established a new genre in English literature theatre the revenge play or revenge tragedy Jane Lumley was the first person to translate Euripides into English Her translation of Iphigeneia at Aulis is the first known dramatic work by a woman in English br William Shakespeare stands out in this period as a poet and playwright as yet unsurpassed Shakespeare wrote plays in a variety of genres including histories tragedies comedies and the late romances or tragicomedies Works written in the Elizabethan era include the comedy Twelfth Night tragedy Hamlet and history Henry IV Part br br br Jacobean period br br br Drama br Shakespeare s career continued during the reign of King James I and in the early th century he wrote the so called problem plays like Measure for Measure as well as a number of his better known tragedies including King Lear and Anthony and Cleopatra The plots of Shakespeare s tragedies often hinge on fatal errors or flaws which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves In his final period Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed four major plays including The Tempest Less bleak than the tragedies these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the s but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors br Other important figures in Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre include Christopher Marlowe Thomas Dekker c John Fletcher and Francis Beaumont Marlowe s subject matter is different from Shakespeare s as it focuses more on the moral drama of the renaissance man His play Doctor Faustus c is about a scientist and magician who sells his soul to the Devil Beaumont and Fletcher are less known but they may have helped Shakespeare write some of his better dramas and were popular at the time Beaumont s comedy The Knight of the Burning Pestle satirises the rising middle class and especially the nouveaux riches br After Shakespeare s death the poet and dramatist Ben Jonson was the leading literary figure of the Jacobean era Jonson s aesthetics hark back to the Middle Ages and his characters embody the theory of humours based on contemporary medical theory though the stock types of Latin literature were an equal influence Jonson s major plays include Volpone or and Bartholomew Fair br A popular style of theatre in Jacobean times was the revenge play which had been popularised earlier by Thomas Kyd and then developed by John Webster in the th century Webster s famous plays are The White Devil and The Duchess of Malfi Other revenge tragedies include The Changeling written by Thomas Middleton and William Rowley br br br Poetry br Shakespeare also popularised the English sonnet which made significant changes to Petrarch s model A collection of sonnets dealing with themes such as the passage of time love beauty and mortality were first published in a quarto br br Besides Shakespeare the major poets of the early th century included the metaphysical poets John Donne and George Herbert Influenced by continental Baroque and taking as his subject matter both Christian mysticism and eroticism Donne s metaphysical poetry uses unconventional or unpoetic figures such as a compass or a mosquito to achieve surprise effects br George Chapman was a successful playwright who is remembered chiefly for his translation in of Homer s Iliad and Odyssey into English verse This was the first complete translation of either poem into the English language and it had a profound influence on English literature br br br Prose br Philosopher Sir Francis Bacon wrote the utopian novel New Atlantis and coined the phrase Knowledge Is Power Francis Godwin s The Man in the Moone recounts an imaginary voyage to the moon and is now regarded as the first work of science fiction in English literature br At the Reformation the translation of liturgy and the Bible into vernacular languages provided new literary models The Book of Common Prayer and the Authorised King James Version of the Bible have been hugely influential The King James Bible one of the great translation projects in the history of English up to that time was started in and completed in It continued the tradition of Bible translation into English from the original languages that began with the work of William Tyndale Previous translations into English had relied on the Vulgate It became the standard Bible of the Church of England and some consider it one of the great literary works of all time br br br Late Renaissance br br The metaphysical poets continued writing in this period Both John Donne and George Herbert died after but there was a second generation of metaphysical poets Andrew Marvell Thomas Traherne or and Henry Vaughan Their style was witty with metaphysical conceits far fetched or unusual similes or metaphors such as Marvell s comparison of the soul with a drop of dew or Donne s description of the effects of absence on lovers to the action of a pair of compasses br Another important group of poets at this time were the Cavalier poets They were an important group of writers who came from the classes that supported King Charles I during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms King Charles reigned from and was executed in The best known of these poets are Robert Herrick Richard Lovelace Thomas Carew and Sir John Suckling They were not a formal group but all were influenced by Ben Jonson Most of the Cavalier poets were courtiers with notable exceptions For example Robert Herrick was not a courtier but his style marks him as a Cavalier poet Cavalier works make use of allegory and classical allusions and they are influenced by Latin authors Horace Cicero and Ovid br br John Milton is one of the great English poets who wrote at a time of religious flux and political upheaval He is generally seen as the last major poet of the English Renaissance though his major epic poems were written in the Restoration period including Paradise Lost Among these are L Allegro Il Penseroso Comus a masque and Lycidas His later major works are Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes Milton s works reflect deep personal convictions a passion for freedom and self determination and the urgent issues and political turbulence of his day Writing in English Latin and Italian he achieved international renown within his lifetime and his celebrated Areopagitica written in condemnation of pre publication censorship is among history s influential and impassioned defences of free speech and freedom of the press William Hayley s biography called him the greatest English author and he remains generally regarded as one of the preeminent writers in the English language br Thomas Urquhart translation of Rabelais Gargantua and Pantagruel into English has been described as the greatest Scottish translation since Gavin Douglas s Eneados br br br The Restoration br br br Drama br br The Restoration of the monarchy in launched a fresh start for literature both in celebration of the new worldly and playful court of the king and in reaction to it Theatres in England reopened after having been closed during the protectorship of Oliver Cromwell Puritanism lost its momentum and the bawdy Restoration comedy became a recognisable genre Restoration comedy refers to English comedies written and performed in the Restoration period from to In addition women were allowed to perform on stage for the first time br The Restoration of the monarchy in Ireland enabled Ogilby to resume his position as Master of the Revels and open the first Theatre Royal in Dublin in in Smock Alley In Katherine Philips went to Dublin where she completed a translation of Pierre Corneille s Pomp e produced with great success in in the Smock Alley Theatre and printed in the same year both in Dublin and London Although other women had translated or written dramas her translation of Pompey broke new ground as the first rhymed version of a French tragedy in English and the first English play written by a woman to be performed on the professional stage Aphra Behn one of the women writers dubbed The fair triumvirate of wit was a prolific dramatist and one of the early English professional female writers Her greatest dramatic success was The Rover br br br Poetry br br Behn s depiction of the character Willmore in The Rover and the witty poetry reciting rake Dorimant in George Etherege s The Man of Mode are seen as a satire on John Wilmot nd Earl of Rochester an English libertine poet and a wit of the Restoration court His contemporary Andrew Marvell described him as the best English satirist and he is generally considered to be the most considerable poet and the most learned among the Restoration wits His A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind is assumed to be a Hobbesian critique of rationalism Rochester s poetic work varies widely in form genre and content He was part of a mob of gentlemen who wrote with ease who continued to produce their poetry in manuscripts rather than in publication As a consequence some of Rochester s work deals with topical concerns such as satires of courtly affairs in libels to parodies of the styles of his contemporaries such as Sir Charles Scroope He is also notable for his impromptus Voltaire who spoke of Rochester as the man of genius the great poet admired his satire for its energy and fire and translated some lines into French to display the shining imagination his lordship only could boast br John Dryden was an English poet literary critic translator and playwright who dominated the literary life of Restoration England to such a point that the period came to be known in literary circles as the Age of Dryden He established the heroic couplet as a standard form of English poetry by writing successful satires religious pieces fables epigrams compliments prologues and plays with it he also introduced the alexandrine and triplet into the form In his poems translations and criticism he established a poetic diction appropriate to the heroic couplet Dryden s great achievements were in satiric verse in works like the mock heroic MacFlecknoe W H Auden referred to him as the master of the middle style that was a model for his contemporaries and for much of the th century The considerable loss felt by the English literary community at his death was evident from the elegies that it inspired Alexander Pope was heavily influenced by Dryden and often borrowed from him other writers in the th century were equally influenced by both Dryden and Pope br Though Ben Jonson had been poet laureate to James I in England this was not then a formal position and the formal title of Poet Laureate as a royal office was first conferred by letters patent on John Dryden in The post then became a regular British institution br br br Prose br Diarists John Evelyn and Samuel Pepys depicted everyday London life and the cultural scene of the times Their works are among the more important primary sources for the Restoration period in England and consists of eyewitness accounts of many great events such as the Great Plague of London and the Great Fire of London br The publication of The Pilgrim s Progress Part I established the Puritan preacher John Bunyan as a notable writer Bunyan s The Pilgrim s Progress is an allegory of personal salvation and a guide to the Christian life Bunyan writes about how the individual can prevail against the temptations of mind and body that threaten damnation The book is written in a straightforward narrative and shows influence from both drama and biography and yet it also shows an awareness of the grand allegorical tradition found in Edmund Spenser br br br th century br br br The Augustan age br br The late th early th century in English literature is known as the Augustan Age Writers at this time greatly admired their Roman counterparts imitated their works and frequently drew parallels between contemporary world and the age of the Roman emperor Augustus AD BC see Augustan literature ancient Rome Some of the major writers in this period were the Anglo Irish writer Jonathan Swift William Congreve Joseph Addison Richard Steele Alexander Pope Henry Fielding Samuel Johnson br br br Birth of Britain br br The Union of the Parliaments of Scotland and England in to form a single Kingdom of Great Britain and the creation of a joint state by the Acts of Union had little impact on the literature of England nor on national consciousness among English writers The situation in Scotland was different the desire to maintain a cultural identity while partaking of the advantages offered by the English literary market and English literary standard language led to what has been described as the invention of British literature by Scottish writers English writers if they considered Britain at all tended to assume it was merely England writ large Scottish writers were more clearly aware of the new state as a cultural amalgam comprising more than just England James Thomson s Rule Britannia is an example of the Scottish championing of this new national and literary identity With the invention of British literature came the development of the early British novels in contrast to the English novel of the th century which continued to deal with England and English concerns rather than exploring the changed political social and literary environment Tobias Smollett was a Scottish pioneer of the British novel exploring the prejudices inherent within the new social structure of the country through comic picaresque novels His The Adventures of Roderick Random is the first major novel written in English to have a Scotsman as hero and the multinational voices represented in the narrative confront Anti Scottish sentiment being published only two years after the Battle of Culloden The Expedition of Humphry Clinker brings together characters from the extremes of Britain to question how cultural and linguistic differences can be accommodated within the new British identity and influenced Charles Dickens Richard Cumberland wrote patriotic comedies depicting characters taken from the outskirts of the empire His most popular play The West Indian was performed in North America and the West Indies br br br Prose including the novel br br In prose the earlier part of the period was overshadowed by the development of the English essay Joseph Addison and Richard Steele s The Spectator established the form of the British periodical essay inventing the pose of the detached observer of human life who can meditate upon the world without advocating any specific changes in it However this was also the time when the English novel first emerging in the Restoration developed into a major art form Daniel Defoe turned from journalism and writing criminal lives for the press to writing fictional criminal lives with Roxana and Moll Flanders br br The English novel has generally been seen as beginning with Daniel Defoe s Robinson Crusoe and Moll Flanders though John Bunyan s The Pilgrim s Progress and Aphra Behn s Oroonoko are also contenders Other major th century British novelists are Samuel Richardson author of the epistolary novels Pamela or Virtue Rewarded and Clarissa Henry Fielding who wrote Joseph Andrews and The History of Tom Jones a Foundling br If Addison and Steele were dominant in one type of prose then Jonathan Swift author of the satire Gulliver s Travels was in another In A Modest Proposal and the Drapier Letters Swift reluctantly defended the Irish people from the predations of colonialism This position provoked riots and arrests but Swift who had no love of Irish Roman Catholics was outraged by the abuses he saw br The English pictorial satirist and editorial cartoonist William Hogarth has been credited with pioneering Western sequential art His work ranged from realistic portraiture to comic strip like series of pictures called modern moral subjects Much of his work satirises contemporary politics and customs br br br Drama br br Although documented history of Irish theatre began at least as early as the early Irish dramatists of note were William Congreve one of the more interesting writers of Restoration comedies and author of The Way of the World and playwright George Farquhar The Recruiting Officer Restoration comedy refers to English comedies written and performed in the Restoration period from to Comedy of manners is used as a synonym of Restoration comedy br Anglo Irish drama in the th century also includes Charles Macklin and Arthur Murphy br The age of Augustan drama was brought to an end by the censorship established by the Licensing Act After authors with strong political or philosophical points to make would no longer turn to the stage as their first hope of making a living and novels began to have dramatic structures involving only normal human beings as the stage was closed off for serious authors Prior to the Licensing Act theatre was the first choice for most wits After it the novel was br br br Poetry br br The most outstanding poet of the age is Alexander Pope whose major works include The Rape of the Lock enlarged in a translation of the Iliad a translation of the Odyssey The Dunciad Since his death Pope has been in a constant state of re evaluation His high artifice strict prosody and at times the sheer cruelty of his satire were an object of derision for the Romantic poets and it was not until the s that his reputation was revived Pope is now considered the dominant poetic voice of his century a model of prosodic elegance biting wit and an enduring demanding moral force The Rape of the Lock and The Dunciad are masterpieces of the mock epic genre br It was during this time that poet James Thomson produced his melancholy The Seasons and Edward Young wrote his poem Night Thoughts br br br The roots of Romanticism br br The second half of the th century is sometimes called the Age of Johnson Samuel Johnson often referred to as Dr Johnson was an English author who made lasting contributions to English literature as a poet essayist moralist literary critic biographer editor and lexicographer Johnson has been described as arguably the most distinguished man of letters in English history After nine years of work Johnson s A Dictionary of the English Language was published in it had a far reaching effect on Modern English and has been described as one of the greatest single achievements of scholarship Through works such as the Dictionary his edition of Shakespeare and his Lives of the Poets in particular he helped invent what we now call English Literature br This period of the th century saw the emergence of three major Irish authors Oliver Goldsmith Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Laurence Sterne Goldsmith settled in London in where he published the novel The Vicar of Wakefield a pastoral poem with the title The Deserted Village and two plays The Good Natur d Man and She Stoops to Conquer Sheridan was born in Dublin but his family moved to England in the s His first play The Rivals was performed at Covent Garden and it was an instant success He became the most significant London playwright of the late th century with plays like The School for Scandal and The Critic Sterne published his famous novel Tristram Shandy in parts from to br The sentimental novel or the novel of sensibility is a genre which developed during the second half of the th century Among the famous sentimental novels in English are Samuel Richardson s Pamela or Virtue Rewarded Oliver Goldsmith s The Vicar of Wakefield and Laurence Sterne s Tristram Shandy br Another novel genre also developed in this period In Frances Burney wrote Evelina one of the ear y novels of manners Fanny Burney s novels indeed were enjoyed and admired by Jane Austen br The graveyard poets were a number of pre Romantic English poets writing in the s and later whose works are characterised by their gloomy meditations on mortality skulls and coffins epitaphs and worms in the context of the graveyard To this was added by later practitioners a feeling for the sublime and uncanny and an interest in ancient English poetic forms and folk poetry They are often considered precursors of the Gothic genre The poets include Thomas Gray Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard William Cowper Christopher Smart Thomas Chatterton Robert Blair and Edward Young The Complaint or Night Thoughts on Life Death and Immortality br Other precursors of Romanticism are the poets James Thomson and James Macpherson the Gothic novel and the novel of sensibility br Also foreshadowing Romanticism was Gothic fiction in works such as Horace Walpole s novel The Castle of Otranto The Gothic fiction genre combines elements of horror and romance A pioneering Gothic novelist was Ann Radcliffe author of The Mysteries of Udolpho The Monk by Matthew Lewis is another notable early work in both the Gothic and horror genres br James Macpherson was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation Claiming to have found poetry written by the ancient bard Ossian he published translations that acquired international popularity being proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical epics Both Robert Burns and Walter Scott were highly influenced by the Ossian cycle br Robert Burns was a pioneer of the Romantic movement and after his death he became a cultural icon in Scotland Among poems and songs of Burns that remain well known across the world are Auld Lang Syne A Red Red Rose A Man s A Man for A That To a Mouse Tam o Shanter and Ae Fond Kiss br br br Romanticism br br Romanticism was an artistic literary and intellectual movement that originated in Europe toward the end of the th century Various dates are given for the Romantic period in British literature but here the publishing of Lyrical Ballads in is taken as the beginning and the crowning of Queen Victoria in as its end even though for example William Wordsworth lived until and William Blake published before The writers of this period however did not think of themselves as Romantics and the term was first used by critics of the Victorian period br The Romantic period was one of major social change in England because of the depopulation of the countryside and the rapid development of overcrowded industrial cities that took place in the period roughly from to The movement of so many people in England was the result of two forces the Agricultural Revolution that involved the enclosure of the land drove workers off the land and the Industrial Revolution which provided them employment in the factories and mills operated by machines driven by steam power Indeed Romanticism may be seen in part as a reaction to the Industrial Revolution though it was also a revolt against aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment as well a reaction against the scientific rationalisation of nature The French Revolution was an especially important influence on the political thinking of many of the Romantic poets br The landscape is often prominent in the poetry of this period so that the Romantics especially perhaps Wordsworth are often described as nature poets However the longer Romantic nature poems have a wider concern because they are usually meditations on an emotional problem or personal crisis br br br Romantic poetry br br The poet painter and printmaker William Blake was one of the early of the English Romantic poets Largely disconnected from the major streams of the literature of the time Blake was generally unrecognised during his lifetime but is now considered a seminal figure in the history of both the poetry and visual arts of the Romantic Age Among his important works are Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience and profound and difficult prophecies such as Visions of the Daughters of Albion The First Book of Urizen and Jerusalem the Emanation of the Giant Albion br After Blake among the early Romantics were the Lake Poets a small group of friends including William Wordsworth Samuel Taylor Coleridge Robert Southey and journalist Thomas De Quincey However at the time Walter Scott was the most famous poet Scott achieved immediate success with his long narrative poem The Lay of the Last Minstrel in followed by the full epic poem Marmion in Both were set in the distant Scottish past br The early Romantic Poets brought a new emotionalism and introspection and their emergence is marked by the first romantic manifesto in English literature the Preface to Lyrical Ballads The poems in Lyrical Ballads were mostly by Wordsworth but Coleridge contributed the long Rime of the Ancient Mariner Among Wordsworth s important poems are Michael Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey Resolution and Independence Ode Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood and the autobiographical epic The Prelude br Robert Southey was another of the so called Lake Poets and Poet Laureate for years from to his death in Although his fame has been eclipsed by that of his contemporaries and friends William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge Thomas De Quincey was an English essayist best known for his Confessions of an English Opium Eater an autobiographical account of his laudanum and its effect on his life br br br Second generation br br The second generation of Romantic poets includes Lord Byron Percy Bysshe Shelley and John Keats Byron however was still influenced by th century satirists and was perhaps the least romantic of the three preferring the brilliant wit of Pope to what he called the wrong poetical system of his Romantic contemporaries br Though John Keats shared Byron and Shelley s radical politics his best poetry is not political but is especially noted for its sensuous music and imagery along with a concern with material beauty and the transience of life Among his famous works are The Eve of St Agnes La Belle Dame sans Merci Ode to a Nightingale To Autumn br Percy Shelley known to contemporaries for his radical politics and association with figures such as Byron and Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley daughter of radical thinkers William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft was the third major romantic poet of the second generation Generally regarded as among the great lyric poets in the English language Shelley is perhaps best known for poems such as Ozymandias Ode to the West Wind To a Skylark and Adona s an elegy written on the death of Keats Mary Shelley is remembered as the author of Frankenstein an important Gothic novel as well as being an early example of science fiction br Although sticking to its forms Felicia Hemans began a process of undermining the Romantic tradition a deconstruction that was continued by Letitia Elizabeth Landon as an urban poet deeply attentive to themes of decay and decomposition Landon s novel forms of metrical romance and dramatic monologue were much copied and contributed to her long lasting influence on Victorian poetry br br br Other poets br Another important poet in this period was John Clare Clare was the son of a farm labourer who came to be known for his celebratory representations of the English countryside and his lamentation for the changes taking place in rural England br George Crabbe was an English poet who during the Romantic period wrote closely observed realistic portraits of rural life in the heroic couplets of the Augustan age Crabbe s works include The Village Poems The Borough br br br Romanticism and the novel br br Major novelists in this period were Jane Austen and the Scotsman Sir Walter Scott and Gothic fiction of various kinds
