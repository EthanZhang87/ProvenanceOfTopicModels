rejection to privilege as she had attended a state school rather than a private one br Rowling always wanted to be a writer but chose to study French and the classics at the University of Exeter for practical reasons influenced by her parents who thought job prospects would be better with evidence of bilingualism She later stated that Exeter was not initially what she expected to be among lots of

write br Rowling moved to Manchester around November She described her time in Manchester where she worked for the Chamber of Commerce and at Manchester University in temp jobs as a year of misery Her mother died of multiple sclerosis on December At the time she was writing Harry Potter and had never told her mother about it Her mother s death heavily affected Rowling s writing She later said that her literary creation of the Mirror of Erised is about her mother s death and noted an evident parallelism between Harry confronting his own mortality and her life br The pain of the loss of her mother was compounded when some personal effects her mother had left her were stolen With the end of the relationship with her boyfriend and being made redundant from an office job in Manchester Rowling described herself as being in a state of fight or flight An advertisement in The Guardian led her to move to Porto Portugal in November to teach night classes in English as a foreign language

of Harry Potter in her suitcase Rowling moved with her daughter to Edinburgh Scotland planning to stay with her sister until Christmas br Her biographer Sean Smith raises the question of why Rowling chose to stay with her sister rather than her father Rowling has spoken of an estrangement from her father stating in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that It wasn t a good relationship from my point of view for a very long time but I had a need to please and I kept that going for a long time and then there just came a point at which I had to pull up and say I can t do this anymore Pete had married his secretary within two years of Anne s death and The Scotsman reported in that t he speed of his decision to move in with his secretary distressed both sisters and a fault line now separated

Seven years after graduating from university she saw herself as a failure Tison Pugh writes that the grinding effects of poverty coupled with her concern for providing for her daughter as a single parent caused great hardship Her marriage had failed and she was jobless with a dependent child but she later described this as liberating her to focus on writing She has said that Jessica kept me going Her old school friend Sean Harris lent her which allowed her to move to a flat in Leith where she finished Philosopher s Stone br Arantes arrived in Scotland in March seeking both Rowling and Jessica On March Rowling sought an action of interdict order of restraint the interdict was granted and Arantes returned to Portugal Early in the year Rowling began to experience a deep depression and

continue the film series or to develop any further films related to the Wizarding World franchise br br By Rowling was portrayed in the media as a penniless divorcee hitting the jackpot According to her biographer Sean Smith the publicity became effective marketing for Harry Potter but her journey from living on benefits to wealth brought along with fame concerns from different groups about the books portrayals of the occult and gender roles Ultimately Smith says that these concerns served to enhance her public profile rather than damage it br Rowling identifies as a Christian Although she grew up next door to her church accounts of the family s church attendance differ She began attending a Church of Scotland congregation where Jessica was christened around the time she was writing

Pig guides him through the fantastical Land of the Lost to retrieve it The novel was published on October and became a bestseller in the UK and the US br br Rowling has named Jessica Mitford as her greatest influence She said Mitford had been my heroine since I was years old when I overheard my formidable great aunt discussing how Mitford had run away at the age of to fight with the Reds in the Spanish Civil War and that what inspired her about Mitford was that she was incurably and instinctively rebellious brave adventurous funny and irreverent she liked nothing better than a good fight preferably against a pompous and hypocritical target As a child Rowling read C S Lewis s The Chronicles of Narnia Elizabeth Goudge s The Little White Horse Manxmouse by Paul Gallico and books by E Nesbit and Noel Streatfeild Rowling describes Jane Austen as her favourite author of all time br Rowling acknowledges Homer Geoffrey Chaucer and William Shakespeare as literary influences Scholars agree that Harry Potter is heavily influenced by the children s fantasy of writers such as Lewis Goudge Nesbit J R R Tolkien Ursula K Le Guin and Diana Wynne Jones According to the critic Beatrice Groves Harry Potter is also rooted in the Western literary tradition including the classics Commentators also note similarities to the children s stories of Enid Blyton and Roald Dahl Rowling expresses admiration for Lewis in whose writing battles between good and evil are also prominent but rejects any connection with Dahl br Earlier works prominently featuring characters who learn to use magic include Le Guin s Earthsea series in which a school of wizardry also appears and the Chrestomanci books by Jones Rowling s setting of a school of witchcraft and wizardry departs from the still older tradition of protagonists as apprentices to magicians exemplified by The Sorcerer s Apprentice yet this trope does appear in Harry Potter when Harry receives individual instruction from Remus Lupin and other teachers Rowling also draws on the tradition of stories set in boarding schools a major example of which is Thomas Hughes s volume Tom Brown s School Days br br br br Rowling is known primarily as an author of fantasy and children s literature Her writing in other genres including literary fiction and murder mystery has received less critical attention Rowling s most famous work Harry Potter has been defined as a fairy tale a Bildungsroman and a boarding school story Her other writings have been described by Pugh as gritty contemporary fiction with historical influences The Casual Vacancy and hardboiled detective fiction Cormoran Strike br In Harry Potter Rowling juxtaposes the extraordinary against the ordinary Her narrative features two worlds the mundane and the fantastic but it differs from typical portal fantasy in that its magical elements stay grounded in the everyday Paintings move and talk books bite readers letters shout messages and maps show live journeys making the wizarding world both exotic and cosily familiar according to the scholar Catherine Butler This blend of realistic and romantic elements extends to Rowling s characters Harry is ordinary and relatable with down to earth features such as wearing broken glasses These elements serve to highlight Harry when he is heroic making him both an everyman and a fairytale hero br Arthurian Christian and fairytale motifs are frequently found in Rowling s writing Harry s ability to draw the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat resembles the Arthurian sword in the stone legend His life with the Dursleys has been compared to Cinderella Like C S Lewis s The Chronicles of Narnia Harry Potter contains Christian symbolism and allegory The series has been viewed as a Christian moral fable in the psychomachia tradition in which stand ins for good and evil fight for supremacy over a person s soul The critic of children s literature Joy Farmer sees parallels between Harry and Jesus Christ According to Maria Nikolajeva Christian imagery is particularly strong in the final scenes of the series she writes that Harry dies in self sacrifice and Voldemort delivers an ecce homo speech after which Harry is resurrected and defeats his enemy br br Death is Rowling s overarching theme in Harry Potter In the first book when Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised he feels both joy and a terrible sadness at seeing his desire his parents alive and with him Confronting their loss is central to Harry s character arc and manifests in different ways through the series such as in his struggles with Dementors Other characters in Harry s life die he even faces his own death in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Rowling has spoken about thematising death and loss in the series Soon after she started writing Philosopher s Stone her mother died and she said that I really think from that moment on death became a central if not the central theme of the seven books Rowling has described Harry as the prism through which I view death and further stated that all of my characters are defined by their attitude to death and the possibility of death br While Harry Potter can be viewed as a story about good versus evil its moral divisions are not absolute First impressions of characters are often misleading Harry assumes in the first book that Quirrell is good because he opposes Snape who appears malicious in reality their positions are reversed In Rowling s world good and evil are choices rather than inherent attributes second chances and redemption are key themes of the series br br Rowling has enjoyed enormous commercial success as an author Her Harry Potter series topped bestseller lists spawned a global media franchise including films and video games and had been translated into languages by The first three Harry Potter books occupied the top three spots of The New York Times bestseller list for more than a year they were then moved to a newly created children s list The final four books each set records as the fastest selling books in the UK or US and the series as a whole had sold more than million copies as of Neither of Rowling s later works The Casual Vacancy and the Cormoran Strike series has been as successful though Casual Vacancy was still a bestseller in the UK within weeks of its release Harry Potter s popularity has been attributed to factors including the nostalgia evoked by the boarding school story the endearing nature of Rowling s characters and the accessibility of her books to a variety of readers According to Julia Eccleshare the books are neither too literary nor too popular too difficult nor too easy neither too young nor too old and hence bridge traditional reading divides br Critical response to Harry Potter has been more mixed Harold Bloom regarded Rowling s prose as poor and her plots as conventional while Jack Zipes argues that the series would not be successful if it were not formulaic Zipes states that the early novels have the same plot in each book Harry escapes the Dursleys to visit Hogwarts where he confronts Lord Voldemort and then heads back successful Rowling s prose has been described as simple and not innovative Le Guin like several other critics considered it stylistically ordinary According to the novelist A S Byatt the books reflect a dumbed down culture dominated by soap operas and reality television Thus some critics argue Harry Potter does not innovate on established literary forms nor does it challenge readers preconceived ideas Conversely the scholar Philip Nel rejects such critiques as snobbery that reacts to the novels popularity whereas Mary Pharr argues that Harry Potter s conventionalism is the point by amalgamating literary forms familiar to her readers Rowling invites them to ponder their own ideas Other critics who see artistic merit in Rowling s writing include Marina Warner who views Harry Potter as part of an alternative genealogy of English literature that she traces from Edmund Spenser to Christina Rossetti Michiko Kakutani praises Rowling s fictional world and the darker tone of the series later entries br Reception of Rowling s later works has varied among critics The Casual Vacancy her attempt at literary fiction drew mixed reviews Some critics praised its characterisation while others stated that it would have been better if it had contained magic The Cormoran Strike series was more warmly received as a work of British detective fiction even as some reviewers noted that its plots are occasionally contrived Theatrical reviews of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child were highly positive Fans have been more critical of the play s use of time travel changes to characters personalities and perceived queerbaiting in Albus and Scorpius s relationship leading some to question its connection to the Harry Potter canon br br Rowling s portrayal of women in Harry Potter has been described as complex and varied but nonetheless conforming to stereotypical and patriarchal depictions of gender Gender divides are ostensibly absent in the books Hogwarts is coeducational and women hold positions of power in wizarding society However this setting obscures the typecasting of female characters and the general depiction of conventional gender roles According to the scholars Elizabeth Heilman and Trevor Donaldson the subordination of female characters goes further early in the series The final three books showcase richer roles and more powerful females for instance the series most matriarchal character Molly Weasley engages substantially in the final battle of Deathly Hallows while other women are shown as leaders Hermione Granger in particular becomes an active and independent character essential to the protagonists battle against evil Yet even particularly capable female characters such as Hermione and Minerva McGonagall are placed in supporting roles and Hermione s status as a feminist model is debated Girls and women are frequently shown as emotional defined by their appearance and denied agency in family settings br The social hierarchies in Rowling s magical world have been a matter of debate among scholars and critics The primary antagonists of Harry Potter Voldemort and his followers believe blood purity is paramount and that non wizards or muggles are subhuman Their ideology of racial difference is depicted as unambiguously evil However the series cannot wholly reject racial division according to several scholars as it still depicts wizards as fundamentally superior to muggles Blake and Zipes argue that numerous examples of wizardly superiority are depicted as natural and comfortable Thus according to Gupta Harry Potter depicts superior races as having a moral obligation of tolerance and altruism towards lesser races rather than explicitly depicting equality br Rowling s depictions of the status of magical non humans is similarly debated Discussing the slavery of house elves within Harry Potter scholars such as Brycchan Carey have praised the books abolitionist sentiments viewing Hermione s Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare as a model for younger readers political engagement Other critics including Farah Mendlesohn find the portrayal of house elves extremely troublesome they are written as happy in their slavery and Hermione s efforts on their behalf are implied to be na ve Pharr terms the house elves a disharmonious element in the series writing that Rowling leaves their fate hanging at the end of Deathly Hallows the elves remain enslaved and cheerful More generally the subordination of magical non humans remains in place unchanged by the defeat of Voldemort Thus scholars suggest the series s message is essentially conservative it sees no reason to transform social hierarchies only being concerned with who holds positions of power br br There have been attempts to ban Harry Potter around the world especially in the United States and in the Bible Belt in particular The series topped the American Library Association s list of most challenged books in the first three years of its publication In the following years parents in several US cities launched protests against teaching it in schools Some Christian critics particularly Evangelical Christians have claimed that the novels promote witchcraft and harm children similar opposition has been expressed to the film adaptations Criticism has taken two main forms allegations that Harry Potter is a pagan text and claims that it encourages children to oppose authority derived mainly from Harry s rejection of the Dursleys his adoptive parents The author and scholar Amanda Cockrell suggests that Harry Potter s popularity and recent preoccupation with fantasy and the occult among Christian fundamentalists explains why the series received particular opposition Some groups of Shia and Sunni Muslims also argued that the series contained satanic subtext and it was banned in private schools in the United Arab Emirates br The Harry Potter books also have a group of vocal religious supporters who believe that Harry Potter espouses Christian values or that the Bible does not prohibit the forms of magic described in the series Christian analyses of the series have argued that it embraces ideals of friendship loyalty courage love and the temptation of power After the final volume was published Rowling said she intentionally incorporated Christian themes in particular the idea that love may hold power over death According to Farmer it is a profound misreading to think that Harry Potter promotes witchcraft The scholar Em McAvan writes that evangelical objections to Harry Potter are superficial based on the presence of magic in the books they do not attempt to understand the moral messages in the series br br Rowling s Harry Potter series has been credited with a resurgence in crossover fiction children s literature with an adult appeal Crossovers were prevalent in th century American and British fiction but fell out of favour in the th century and did not occur at the same scale The post Harry Potter crossover trend is associated with the fantasy genre In the s children s books were generally realistic as opposed to fantastic while adult fantasy became popular because of the influence of The Lord of the Rings The next decade saw an increasing interest in grim realist themes with an outflow of fantasy readers and writers to adult works br The commercial success of Harry Potter in reversed this trend The scale of its growth had no precedent in the children s market within four years it occupied of that field by revenue Children s literature rose in cultural status and fantasy became a dominant genre Older works of children s fantasy including Diana Wynne Jones s Chrestomanci series and Diane Duane s Young Wizards were reprinted and rose in popularity some authors re established their careers In the following decades many Harry Potter imitators and subversive responses grew popular br Rowling has been compared with Enid Blyton who also wrote in simple language about groups of children and long held sway over the British children s market She has also been described as an heir to Roald Dahl Some critics view Harry Potter s rise along with the concurrent success of Philip Pullman s His Dark Materials as part of a broader shift in reading tastes a rejection of literary fiction in favour of plot and adventure This is reflected in the BBC s Big Read survey of the UK s favourite books where Pullman and Rowling ranked at numbers and respectively with very few British literary classics in the top br Harry Potter s popularity led its publishers to plan elaborate releases and spawned a textual afterlife among fans and forgers Beginning with the release of Prisoner of Azkaban on July at pm its publishers coordinated selling the books at the same time globally introduced security protocols to prevent premature purchases and required booksellers to agree not to sell copies before the appointed time Driven by the growth of the internet fan fiction about the series proliferated and has spawned a diverse community of readers and writers While Rowling has supported fan fiction her statements about characters for instance that Harry and Hermione could have been a couple and that Dumbledore was gay have complicated her relationship with readers According to scholars this shows that modern readers feel a sense of ownership over the text that is independent of and sometimes contradicts authorial intent br br In the s and s Rowling was both a plaintiff and defendant in lawsuits alleging copyright infringement Nancy Stouffer sued Rowling in alleging that Harry Potter was based on stories she published in Rowling won in September Richard Posner describes Stouffer s suit as deeply flawed and notes that the court finding she had used forged and altered documents assessed a penalty against her br With her literary agents and Warner Bros Rowling has brought legal action against publishers and writers of Harry Potter knockoffs in several countries In the mid s Rowling and her publishers obtained a series of injunctions prohibiting sales or published reviews of her books before their official release dates br Beginning in after Rowling sold film rights to Warner Bros the studio tried to take Harry Potter fan sites offline unless it determined that they were made by authentic fans for innocuous purposes In with Warner Bros Rowling started proceedings to cease publication of a book based on content from a fan site called The Harry Potter Lexicon The court held that Lexicon was neither a fair use of Rowling s material nor a derivative work but it did not prevent the book from being published in a different form Lexicon was published in br br Long interested in issues affecting women and children Rowling established the Volant Charitable Trust in named after her mother to address social deprivation in at risk women children and youth She was appointed president of One Parent Families now Gingerbread in after becoming its first ambassador in She collaborated with Sarah Brown on a book of children s stories to benefit One Parent Families Together with the MEP Emma Nicholson Rowling founded the charity now known as Lumos in Lumos has worked with an orphanage west of Kyiv Ukraine since after the Russian invasion of Ukraine Rowling offered to personally match up to million in donations to Lumos for Ukraine Later in during her advocacy against the Gender Recognition Reform Scotland Bill Rowling stated she had founded and would fund Beira s Place a women only rape help centre that provides free support services to survivors of sexual violence The centre excludes trans women She has donated several hundred thousand pounds to help women lawyers flee from the Taliban s control helping hundreds of Afghans escape br Rowling has made
