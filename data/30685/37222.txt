crash in Kenya being posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross DFC In an exchange with a journalist in Pullman said that as a boy he saw his father as a hero steeped in glamour killed in action defending his country and who had been training pilots Pullman was then presented with a report from The London Gazette of which carried the official RAF news of the day and said that the medal was given for gallant and distinguished service during the Mau Mau uprising The main task of the Harvards the aircraft flown by his father s unit had been bombing and machine gunning Mau Mau and their hideouts in densely wooded and difficult country This included diving steeply into the gorges of various rivers often in conditions of low cloud and driving rain Testing conditions yes but not much opposition from the enemy the journalist in the exchange continued Very few of the Mau Mau had guns that could land a blow on an aircraft br Responding to that new information Pullman wrote My father probably doesn t come out of this with very much credit judged by the standards of modern liberal progressive thought and he accepted the revelation as a serious challenge to his childhood memory In the BBC series documentary Imagine Pullman said that he has since become aware that his father could have crashed his plane deliberately saying There was something odd about the crash he just took his plane up and flew into the side of a hill citing rumours of his father having debt troubles and a problematic love affair His mother remarried the following year and following a move to North Wales

nia ceremony in the Sheldonian Theatre br In during a break from writing The Book of Dust Pullman was asked by Penguin Classics to curate of Grimms classic fairytales from their compendium of over

br Pullman has been a vocal campaigner on a number of issues related to books and politics br br br Views on writing br In the epigraph of The Amber Spyglass Pullman writes that I have stolen ideas from every book I ve ever read My principle for researching a novel is Read like a butterfly write like a bee and if this story contains any honey it is because of the quality of the nectar I have found in the work of better writers He acknowledges his primary influences as Heinrich von Kleist s essay On the Marionette Theater Milton s Paradise Lost and the works of William Blake Reviewing the novel in The Washington Post Michael Dirda finds allusions to Jewish Kabbalah the legend of the godlike angel Metatron Gnostic doctrine dust our sleeping souls needing to be awakened Aeneas Odysseus and Dante in the Underworld the Grail legend and the wounded Fisher King Peter Pan Wordsworth s pantheistic Immortality Ode and even Pullman s own early novel for adults Galatea Pullman says his favorite book is probably Robert Burton s The Anatomy of Melancholy describing it as a funny book about depression written in a very prolix ornate style br br br Views on fantasy br In a lecture at the Sea of Faith conference Pullman said that the writers we call the greatest of all Shakespeare Tolstoy Proust George Eliot herself are those who have created the most lifelike simulacra of real human beings in real human situations In fact the more profound and powerful the imagination the closer to reality are the forms it dreams up He said he wanted to write fantasy realistically or write fantastic characters with psychological depth Because when I thought about it there was no reason why fantasy shouldn t be realistic in a psychological sense and it was the lack of that sort of realism that I objected to in the work of the big Tolkien and all the little Tolkiens He says David Lindsay s A Voyage to Arcturus shows that fantasy is capable of saying big and important things He concludes that fantasy is a great vehicle when it serves the purposes of realism and a lot of old cobblers when it doesn t Pullman says that he sees His Dark Materials as stark realism not fantasy He has praised fantasy authors like Alan Garner and Neil Gaiman br br br Views on children s literature br Pullman believes that children deserve quality literature and that there isn t a clear demarcation between children s and adult literature In a talk at the Royal Society of Literature he quoted C S Lewis in On Three Ways of Writing for Children I now like hock which I am sure I should not have liked as a child But I still like lemon squash I call this growth or development because I have been enriched where I formerly had only one pleasure I now have two Pullman says that It would be nice to think that normal human curiosity would let us open our minds to experience from every quarter to listen to every storyteller in the marketplace It would be nice too occasionally to read a review of an adult book that said This book is so interesting and so clearly and beautifully written that children would enjoy it as well He is an admirer of Philippa Pearce when Pullman s Northern Lights won the Carnegie of Carnegies Pearce s Tom s Midnight Garden was the runner up Pullman said Personally I feel they got the initials right but not the name I don t know if the result would be the same in a hundred years time maybe Philippa Pearce would win then In Pullman gave the Philippa Pearce Lecture br He is also an admirer of Leon Garfield someone who put the best of his imagination into everything he wrote particularly praising The Pleasure Garden In a lecture he said that one of the things we need to do for children is introduce them to the pleasures of the subtle and complex One way to do that of course is to let them see us enjoying it and then forbid them to touch it on the grounds that it s too grown up for them their minds aren t ready to cope with it it s too strong it ll drive them mad with strange and uncontrollable desires If that doesn t make them want to try it nothing will br br br Monarchy br In to coincide with the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II Pullman was interviewed for a feature in The Guardian on notable republicans According to Pullman The present system is unsustainable because it is cruel No individual and no family should be subject to the pressures of publicity and expectation that have beset the Windsors Expressing sympathy for the young Prince William Pullman added we can t have a quiet sensible unobtrusive sort of monarchy because of the mistakes the Windsors have made and because of the disgusting and unredeemable nature of the tabloid press so we shall have to have a republic The one thing to avoid is a political president Let s have a well respected figure from some other walk of life and leave politics to the prime minister and parliament In The Atlantic described Pullman s Jesus in The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ as a proper republican in the Pullman sense of the word instinctively fraternal and anti institutional spreading his rough and ready enlightenments across the horizontal axis br br br Age and gender labelling of books br In Pullman led a campaign against the introduction of age bands on the covers of children s books saying It s based on a one dimensional view of growth which regards growing older as moving along a line like a monkey climbing a stick now you re seven so you read these books and now you re nine so you read these More than authors booksellers illustrators librarians and teachers joined the campaign Pullman s own publisher Scholastic agreed to his request not to put the age bands on his book covers Joel Rickett deputy editor of The Bookseller said The steps taken by Mr Pullman and other authors have taken the industry by surprise and I think these proposals are now in the balance br In Pullman supported the Let Books Be Books campaign to stop children s books being labelled as for girls or for boys saying I m against anything from age ranging to pinking and blueing whose effect is to shut the door in the face of children who might enjoy coming in No publisher should announce on the cover of any book the sort of readers the book would prefer Let the readers decide for themselves br br br Civil liberties br Pullman has a strong commitment to traditional British civil liberties and is noted for his criticism of growing state authority and government encroachment into everyday life In February he was the keynote speaker at the Convention on Modern Liberty in London and wrote an extended piece in The Times condemning the Labour government for its attacks on basic civil rights Later he and other authors threatened to stop visiting schools in protest at new laws requiring them to be vetted to work with youngsters though officials claimed that the laws had been misinterpreted br br br Public jury br In July Pullman was one of the lead campaigners signing a declaration that called for a strong public jury selected at random to draw up a public interest first test to ensure that power was taken away from remote interest groups The declaration was also signed by academics writers trade unionists and politicians from the Labour Party the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party br br br Library closures br In October Pullman backed a campaign to stop library closures in England calling it a war against stupidity London Borough of Brent claimed that it was closing half of its libraries to fulfil its exciting plans to improve its library service Pullman said All the time you see the council had been longing to improve the library service and the only thing standing in the way was the libraries br br Speaking at a conference organised by The Library Campaign and Voices for the Library he added The book is second only to the wheel as the best piece of technology human beings have ever invented A book symbolises the whole intellectual history of mankind it s the greatest weapon ever devised in the war against stupidity Beware of anyone who tries to make books harder to get at And that is exactly what these closures are going to do oh not intentionally except in a few cases very few people are stupid intentionally but that will be the effect Books will be harder to get at Stupidity will gain a little ground br br br Ebook library loans br In advance of becoming president of the Society of Authors in August Pullman led a call for authors to be fairly paid for ebook library loans Under arrangements in force at the time authors were paid p per library loan by the government for physical books but nothing for ebook loans In addition the Society found that publishers had possibly been inadvertently underpaying authors for ebook loans Altogether this may have resulted in authors losing up to two thirds of the income they would have received on the sale and loan of a physical book Addressing this issue Pullman said New media and new forms of buying and lending are all very interesting for all kinds of reasons but one principle remains unchanged authors must be paid fairly for their work Any arrangement that doesn t acknowledge that principle is a bad one and needs to be changed That is our whole argument br br br William Blake s cottage and memorial stone br As a long time enthusiast of William Blake and president of the Blake Society Pullman led a campaign in to buy the Sussex cottage where the poet lived between and saying Surely it isn t beyond the resources of a nation that can spend enormous amounts of money on acts of folly and unnecessary warfare a nation that likes to boast about its literary heritage to find the money to pay for a proper memorial and a centre for the study of this great poet and artist Not least because this is the place where he wrote the words now often sung as an alternative and better national anthem the poem known as Jerusalem And did those feet in ancient time Blake s feet walked in Felpham Let s not let this opportunity pass by br As president of the Blake Society on August Pullman inaugurated Blake s new memorial gravestone on the site of his grave in Bunhill Fields following a long campaign by the society br br br Boycott of Brexit p coin br In January Pullman called for literate people to boycott the newly minted Brexit p coin due to the omission of the Oxford comma in its slogan Peace prosperity and friendship with all nations The viewpoint was supported by some while lexicographer Susie Dent indicated it was optional and Baroness Bakewell said she had been taught that it was wrong to use the comma in such circumstances br br br Presidency of the Society of Authors br In Pullman was elected President of the Society of Authors the ultimate honour awarded by the British writers body and a position first held by Alfred Lord Tennyson In January Pullman resigned as patron of the Oxford Literary Festival in support of the Society of Author s campaign for writers to be paid fees at festivals and drew attention to the poor remuneration of writers br On August Pullman tweeted a response to what he wrongly thought was criticism of Kate Clanchy s teaching memoir Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me His tweet said that those who condemn a book without reading it would be at home with Boko Haram and the Taliban Pullman later deleted the tweet and apologised On the th of August The Society of Authors put out a statement and an interview with Chair of Management Committee Joanne Harris which were described by The Guardian as the society distancing itself from Pullman Pullman resigned his presidency later stating that the management committee urging him to apologise for something he hadn t done had been a factor in his decision to stand down He later criticised Harris for her facetious and flippant public comments and stated that the Society of Authors had become a vehicle for gesture politics and called for external review and reform of the organisation br br br Perspective on religion br Although Pullman has stated he is a Church of England atheist and a Book of Common Prayer atheist because that s the tradition I was brought up in he has also said he is technically an agnostic He has singled out elements of Christianity for criticism if there is a God and he is as the Christians describe him then he deserves to be put down and rebelled against He has also acknowledged that the same could be said of all religions br Pullman has also referred to himself as knowingly of the Devil s party a reference to William Blake s revisionist view of Milton in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell br Pullman is a supporter of Humanists UK and an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society In he was given a services to Humanism award by the British Humanist Association for his contribution as a longstanding supporter br On September Pullman along with other public figures including Stephen Fry Professor Richard Dawkins Terry Pratchett Jonathan Miller and Ken Follett signed an open letter published in The Guardian stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI being given the honour of a state visit to the UK the letter argued that the Pope had led and condoned global abuses of human rights leading a state which has resisted signing many major human rights treaties and has formed its own treaties concordats with many states which negatively affect the human rights of citizens of those states br New Yorker journalist Laura Miller described Pullman as one of England s most outspoken atheists He has characterised atheist totalitarian regimes as religions br Alan Jacobs of Wheaton College said that in His Dark Materials Pullman replaced the theist world view of John Milton s Paradise Lost with a Rousseauist one br br The books in the series have been criticised for their attitude to religion especially Catholicism by the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights and Focus on the Family Writing in the Catholic Herald in Leonie Caldecott cited Pullman s work as an example of fiction far more worthy of the bonfire than Harry Potter on the grounds that by co opting Catholic terminology and playing with Judaeo Christian theological concepts Pullman is effectively removing among a mass audience of a highly impressionable age some of the building blocks for future evangelisation Pullman was flattered and asked his publisher to include quotes from Caldecott s article in his next book In the Catholic Herald published an article by Sarah Johnson that compared Pullman to a playground bully whose work attacks a religious minority The following year after Benedict Allen s reference to the criticism during the BBC TV series The Big Read the Catholic Herald republished both articles and Caldecott claimed her bonfire comment was a joke and accused Pullman and his supporters of quoting her out of context In a longer article for Touchstone magazine earlier in Caldecott had also described Pullman s work as axe grinding and a kind of Luciferian enterprise br Columnist Peter Hitchens in a article for The Mail on Sunday accused Pullman of killing god and described him as the most dangerous author in Britain because he said in an interview I m trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief Pullman responded by posting Hitchens article on his study wall In that interview which was for a February article in The Washington Post Pullman acknowledged that a controversy would be likely to boost sales but continued I m not in the business of offending people I find the books upholding certain values that I think are important such as life is immensely valuable and this world is an extraordinarily beautiful place We should do what we can to increase the amount of wisdom in the world Hitchens also views the His Dark Materials series as a direct rebuttal of C S Lewis s The Chronicles of Narnia Pullman has criticised the Narnia books as religious propaganda Hitchens brother Christopher Hitchens author of God Is Not Great praised His Dark Materials as a fresh alternative to Lewis J R R Tolkien and J K Rowling describing the author as one whose books have begun to dissolve the frontier between adult and juvenile fiction However he was more critical of The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ accusing Pullman of being a Protestant atheist for supporting the teachings of Christ but being critical of organised religion br Pullman has found support from some Christians most notably Rowan Williams the former Archbishop of Canterbury who argued that Pullman s attacks focus on the constraints and dangers of dogmatism and the use of religion to oppress not on Christianity itself Williams recommended His Dark Materials for discussion in religious education classes and said that to see large school parties in the audience of the Pullman plays at the National Theatre is vastly encouraging Pullman and Williams took part in a National Theatre platform debate a few days later to discuss myth religious experience and its representation in the arts br Donna Freitas professor of religion at Boston University argued that challenges to traditional images of God should be welcomed as part of a lively dialogue about faith The Christian writers Kurt Bruner and Jim Ware also uncover spiritual themes within the books Pullman s contribution to the Canongate Myth series The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ was described by Mike Collett White as a far more direct exploration of the foundations of Christianity and the church as well as an examination of the fascination and power of storytelling br In a interview with The Times Magazine Pullman said The place religion has in our lives is a permanent one He concluded that there was no point in condemning religion and mused that it is part of the human mind to ask philosophical questions such as the purpose of life He reiterated that it was useless to become censorious about religion to say there is no God He also mentioned that his novel The Book of Dust is based on the extreme danger of putting power into the hands of those who believe in some absolute creed whether that is Christianity or Islam or Marxism br br br Bibliography br br br Young adult novels br br br His Dark Materials series br br
