Muslims while the rest are mainly Arab Christians as well as Arab groups of Druze and Bah s br br br Etymology br br The earliest documented use of the word Arab in reference to a people appears in the Kurkh Monoliths an Akkadian language record of the Assyrian conquest of Aram th century BCE The Monoliths used the term to refer to Bedouins of the Arabian Peninsula under King Gindibu who fought as part of a coalition opposed to Assyria Listed among the booty captured by the army of the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III in the Battle of Qarqar BCE are camels of G ndibu the Arb ya or the man Gindibu belonging to the Arabs ar ba a a being an adjectival nisba of the noun Arab br The related word a r b is used to refer to Bedouins today in contrast to Arab which refers to Arabs in general Both terms are mentioned around times in pre Islamic Sabaean inscriptions The term arab Arab occurs also in the titles of the Himyarite kings from the time of Abu Karab Asad until MadiKarib Ya fur According to Sabaean grammar the term a r b is derived from the term arab The term is also mentioned in Quranic verses referring to people who were living in Madina and it might be a south Arabian loanword into Quranic language br The oldest surviving indication of an Arab national identity is an inscription made in an archaic form of Arabic in CE using the Nabataean alphabet which refers to Imru al Qays ibn Amr as King of all the Arabs Herodotus refers to the Arabs in the Sinai southern Palestine and the frankincense region Southern Arabia Other Ancient Greek historians like Agatharchides Diodorus Siculus and Strabo mention Arabs living in Mesopotamia along the Euphrates in Egypt the Sinai and the Red Sea southern Jordan the Nabataeans the Syrian steppe and in eastern Arabia the people of Gerrha Inscriptions dating to the th century BCE in Yemen include the term Arab br The most popular Arab account holds that the word Arab came from an eponymous father named Ya rub who was supposedly the first to speak Arabic Abu Muhammad al Hasan al Hamdani had another view he states that Arabs were called gharab westerners by Mesopotamians because Bedouins originally resided to the west of Mesopotamia the term was then corrupted into Arab br Yet another view is held by al Masudi that the word Arab was initially applied to the Ishmaelites of the Arabah valley In Biblical etymology Arab Hebrew arvi comes from the desert origin of the Bedouins it originally described arava means wilderness br The root r b has several additional meanings in Semitic languages including west sunset desert mingle mixed merchant and raven and are comprehensible with all of these having varying degrees of relevance to the emergence of the name It is also possible that some forms were metathetical from B R moving around Arabic B R traverse and hence it is alleged nomadic br br br Origins br br Arabic is a Semitic language that belongs to the Afroasiatic language family The majority of scholars accept the Arabian peninsula has long been accepted as the original Urheimat linguistic homeland of the Semitic languages with some scholars investigating if its origins are in the Levant The ancient Semitic speaking peoples lived in the ancient Near East including the Levant Mesopotamia and the Arabian Peninsula from the rd millennium BCE to the end of antiquity Proto Semitic likely reached the Arabian Peninsula by the th millennium BCE and its daughter languages spread outward from there while Old Arabic began to differentiate from Central Semitic by the start of the st millennium BCE Central Semitic is a branch of the Semitic language includes Arabic Aramaic Canaanite Phoenician Hebrew and others The origins of Proto Semitic may lie in the Arabian Peninsula with the language spreading from there to other regions This theory proposes that Semitic peoples reached Mesopotamia and other areas from the deserts to the west such as the Akkadians who entered Mesopotamia around the late th millennium BCE The origins of Semitic peoples are thought to include various regions Mesopotamia the Levant the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa Some view that Semitic may have originated in the Levant around BCE and subsequently spread to the Horn of Africa around BCE from Arabia as well as to North Africa br br br In Abrahamic traditions br According to Arab Islamic Jewish traditions Ishmael the son of Abraham and Hagar was father of the Arabs The Book of Genesis narrates that God promised Hagar to beget from Ishmael twelve princes and turn his descendants into a great nation Ishmael was considered the ancestor of the Islamic prophet Muhammad the founder of Islam The tribes of Central West Arabia called themselves the people of Abraham and the offspring of Ishmael Ibn Khaldun an Arab scholar in the th century described the Arabs as having Ishmaelite origins br br The Quran mentions that Ibrahim Abraham and his wife Hajar Hagar bore a prophetic child named Ishmael who was gifted by God a favor above other nations God ordered Ibrahim to bring Hajar and Ishmael to Mecca where he prayed for them to be provided with water and fruits Hajar ran between the hills of Safa and Marwa in search of water and an angel appeared to them and provided them with water Ishmael grew up in Mecca Ibrahim was later ordered to sacrifice Ishmael in a dream but God intervened and replaced him with a goat Ibrahim and Ishmael then built the Kaaba in Mecca which was originally constructed by Adam br According to the Samaritan book Asa r adds And after the death of Abraham Ishmael reigned twenty seven years And all the children of Nebaot ruled for one year in the lifetime of Ishmael And for thirty years after his death from the river of Egypt to the river Euphrates and they built Mecca Josephus also lists the sons and states that they inhabit the lands which are between Euphrates and the Red Sea the name of which country is Nabath a The Targum Onkelos annotates Genesis describing the extent of their settlements The Ishmaelites lived from Hindekaia India to Chalutsa possibly in Arabia by the side of Mizraim Egypt and from the area around Arthur Assyria up towards the north This description suggests that the Ishmaelites were a widely dispersed group with a presence across a significant portion of the ancient Near East br br br History br br The nomads of Arabia have been spreading through the desert fringes of the Fertile Crescent since at least BCE but the first known reference to the Arabs as a distinct group is from an Assyrian scribe recording a battle in BCE The history of the Arabs during the pre Islamic period in various regions including Arabia Levant Mesopotamia and Egypt The Arabs were mentioned by their neighbors such as Assyrian and Babylonian Royal Inscriptions from th to th century BCE mention the king of Qedar as king of the Arabs and King of the Ishmaelites Of the names of the sons of Ishmael the names Nabat Kedar Abdeel Dumah Massa and Teman were mentioned in the Assyrian Royal Inscriptions as tribes of the Ishmaelites Jesur was mentioned in Greek inscriptions in the st century BCE There are also records from Sargon s reign that mention sellers of iron to people called Arabs in uzaza in Babylon causing Sargon to prohibit such trade out of fear that the Arabs might use the resource to manufacture weapons against the Assyrian army The history of the Arabs in relation to the Bible shows that they were a significant part of the region and played a role in the lives of the Israelites The study asserts that the Arab nation is an ancient and significant entity however it highlights that the Arabs lacked a collective awareness of their unity They did not inscribe their identity as Arabs or assert exclusive ownership over specific territories br Magan Midian and d are all ancient tribes or civilizations that are mentioned in Arabic literature and have roots in the Arabia Magan Arabic Majan known for its production of copper and other metals the region was an important trading center in ancient times and is mentioned in the Qur an as a place where Musa Moses traveled during his lifetime Midian Arabic Madyan on the other hand was a region located in the northwestern part of the Arabia the people of Midian are mentioned in the Qur an as having worshiped idols and having been punished by God for their disobedience Moses also lived in Midian for a time where he married and worked as a shepherd d Arabic d as mentioned earlier was an ancient tribe that lived in the

one of the original Arab tribes br The historian Herodotus provided extensive information about Arabia describing the spices terrain folklore trade clothing and weapons of the Arabs In his third book he mentioned the Arabs as a force to be reckoned with in the north of the Arabian Peninsula just before Cambyses campaign against Egypt Other Greek and Latin authors who wrote about Arabia include Theophrastus Strabo Diodorus Siculus and Pliny the Elder The Jewish historian Flavius Josephus wrote about the Arabs and their king mentioning their relationship with Cleopatra the queen of Egypt The tribute paid by the Arab king to Cleopatra was collected by Herod the king of the Jews but the Arab king later became slow in his payments and refused to pay without further deductions This sheds some light on the relations between the Arabs Jews and Egypt at that time Geshem the Arab was an Arab man who opposed Nehemiah in the Hebrew Bible Neh He was likely the chief of the Arab tribe Gushamu and have been a powerful ruler with influence stretching from northern Arabia to Judah The Arabs and the Samaritans made efforts to hinder Nehemiah s rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem br br The term Saracens was a term used in the early centuries both in Greek and Latin writings to refer to the Arabs who lived in and near what was designated by the Romans as Arabia Petraea Levant and Arabia Deserta Arabia The Christians of Iberia used the term Moor to describe all the Arabs and Muslims of that time Arabs of Medina referred to the nomadic tribes of the deserts as the A raab and considered

a sudden and dramatic conquest led by Arab armies which quickly conquered much of the Middle East North Africa and Spain It was a significant moment for Islam which saw itself as the successor of Judaism and Christianity The term i r b has the same root refers to the Bedouin tribes of the desert who rejected Islam and resisted Muhammad Quran The th century Kebra Nagast says And therefore the children of Ishmael became kings over Tereb and over Kebet and over N b and S ba and Kuergue and K f and M k and M rn and F n n and Ars b n and L b and Mase a for they were the seed of Shem br br br Antiquity br br Limited local historical coverage of these civilizations means that archaeological evidence foreign accounts and Arab oral traditions are largely relied on to reconstruct this period Prominent civilizations at the time included Dilmun civilization was an important trading centre which at the height of its power controlled the Arabian Gulf trading routes The Sumerians regarded Dilmun as holy land Dilmun is regarded as one of the oldest ancient civilizations in the Middle East which arose around the th millennium BCE and lasted to BCE Gerrha was an ancient city of Eastern Arabia on the west side of the Gulf Gerrha was the center of an Arab kingdom from approximately BCE to circa CE Thamud which arose around the st millennium BCE and lasted to about CE From the beginning of the first millennium BCE Proto Arabic or Ancient North Arabian texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs emergence The earliest are written in variants of epigraphic south Arabian musnad

a cultural and economic center Its legacy can still be seen today br br The ancient Kingdom of Aws n th th century BCE was indeed one of the most important small kingdoms of South Arabia and its capital ajar Ya irr was a significant center of trade and commerce in the ancient world It is fascinating to learn about the rich history of this region and the cultural heritage that has been preserved through the archaeological sites like ajar Asfal The destruction of the city in the th century BCE by the king and Mukarrib of Saba Karab El Watar is a significant event in the history of South Arabia It highlights the complex political and social dynamics that characterized the region at the time and the power struggles between different kingdoms and rulers The victory of the Sabaeans over Aws n is also a testament to the military might and strategic prowess of the Sabaeans who were one of the most powerful and influential kingdoms in the region br The Himyarite Kingdom or Himyar

tolerated other religions including Christianity and the local pagan religions br br br Classical antiquity br br The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who settled in a territory centred around their capital of Petra in what is now Jordan Their early inscriptions were in Aramaic but gradually switched to Arabic and since they had writing it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic The Nabataean alphabet was adopted by Arabs to the south and evolved into modern Arabic script around the th century This is attested by Safaitic inscriptions beginning in the st century BCE and the many Arabic personal names in Nabataean inscriptions From about the nd century BCE a few inscriptions from Qaryat al Faw reveal a dialect no longer considered proto Arabic but pre classical Arabic Five Syriac inscriptions mentioning Arabs have been found at Sumatar Harabesi one of which dates to the nd century CE br br Arabs are first recorded in Palmyra in the late first millennium BCE The soldiers of the sheikh Zabdibel who aided the Seleucids in the battle of Raphia BCE were described as Arabs Zabdibel and his men were not actually identified as Palmyrenes in the texts but the name Zabdibel is a Palmyrene name leading to the conclusion that the sheikh hailed from Palmyra After the Battle of Edessa in CE Valerian s capture by the Sassanian king Shapur I was a significant blow to Rome and it left the empire vulnerable to further attacks Zenobia was able to capture most of the Near East including Egypt and parts of Asia Minor However their empire was short lived as Aurelian was able to defeat the Palmyrenes and recover the lost territories The Palmyrenes were helped by their Arab allies but Aurelian was also able to leverage his own alliances to defeat Zenobia and her army Ultimately the Palmyrene Empire lasted only a few years but it had a significant impact on the history of the Roman Empire and the Near East br Most scholars identify the Itureans as an Arab people

Near East as Arabi The Romans called Yemen Arabia Felix The Romans called the vassal nomadic states within the Roman Empire Arabia Petraea after the city of Petra and called unconquered deserts bordering the empire to the south and east Arabia Magna The Lakhmids as a dynasty inherited their power from the Tanukhids the mid Tigris region around their capital Al Hira They ended up allying with the Sassanids against the Ghassanids and the Byzantine Empire The Lakhmids contested control of the Central Arabian tribes with the Kindites with the Lakhmids eventually destroying the Kingdom of

communities After the Muslim conquest of the Levant few Ghassanids became Muslims and most remained Christian and joined Melkite and Syriac communities within what is now Jordan Palestine Syria and Lebanon The Salihids were Arab foederati in the th century were ardent Christians and their period is less documented than the preceding and succeeding periods due to a scarcity of sources Most references to the Salihids in Arabic sources derive from the work of Hisham ibn al Kalbi with the Tarikh of Ya qubi considered valuable for determining the Salihids fall and the terms of their foedus with the Byzantines br br br Middle Ages br br During the Middle Ages Arab civilization flourished and the Arabs made significant contributions to the fields of science mathematics medicine philosophy

migrated from Mecca to Medina in an event known as the Hijra Muhammad spent the last ten years of his life engaged in a series of battles to establish and expand the Muslim community From to he led the Muslims in a state of war against the Meccans During this period the Arabs conquered the region of Basra and under the leadership of Umar they established a base and built a mosque there Another

Islam beyond the Arabian Peninsula During this time the Arab community faced numerous challenges including internal divisions and external threats from neighboring empires br Under the leadership of Abu Bakr the Arab community successfully quelled a rebellion by some tribes who refused to pay Zakat or Islamic charity During the reign of Umar ibn al Khattab the Arab empire expanded significantly conquering territories such as Egypt Syria and Iraq The reign of Uthman ibn Affan was marked by internal dissent and rebellion which ultimately led to his assassination Ali the cousin and son in law

of the Zab effectively ending their rule in all parts of the Empire with the exception of al Andalus In the second Abbasid Caliph al Mansur founded the city of Baghdad and declared it the capital of the Caliphate Unlike the Umayyads the Abbasids had the support of non Arab subjects The Islamic Golden Age was inaugurated by the middle of the th century by the ascension of the Abbasid Caliphate and the transfer of the capital from Damascus to the newly founded city of Baghdad The Abbasids were influenced by the Quranic injunctions and hadith such as The ink of the scholar is more holy than the blood of martyrs stressing the value of knowledge br br During this period the Arab Empire became an intellectual centre for science philosophy medicine and education as the Abbasids championed the cause of knowledge and established the House of Wisdom Arabic in Baghdad Rival dynasties such as the Fatimids of Egypt and the Umayyads of al Andalus were also major intellectual centres with cities such as Cairo and C rdoba rivaling Baghdad The Abbasids ruled for years before they lost their central control when Wilayas began to fracture in the th century afterwards in the s there was a revival of their power which was ended by the Mongols who conquered Baghdad in and killed the Caliph Al Musta sim Members of the Abbasid royal family escaped the massacre and resorted to Cairo which had

throughout the Levant formed al Fatat the Young Arab Society a small Arab nationalist club in Paris Its stated aim was raising the level of the Arab nation to the level of modern nations In the first few years of its existence al Fatat called for greater autonomy within a unified Ottoman state rather than Arab independence from the empire Al Fatat hosted the Arab Congress of in Paris the purpose of which was to discuss desired reforms with other dissenting individuals from the Arab world However as the Ottoman authorities cracked down on the organization s activities and members al Fatat went underground and demanded the complete independence and unity of the Arab provinces br br The Arab Revolt was a military uprising of Arab forces against the Ottoman Empire during World War I began in led by Sherif Hussein bin Ali the goal of the revolt was to gain independence for the Arab lands under Ottoman rule and to create a unified Arab state The revolt was sparked by a number of factors including the Arab desire for greater autonomy within the Ottoman Empire resentment towards Ottoman policies and the influence of Arab nationalist movements The Arab Revolt was a significant factor in the eventual defeat of the Ottoman Empire The revolt helped to weaken Ottoman military power and tie up Ottoman forces that could have been deployed elsewhere It also helped to increase support for Arab independence and nationalism which would have a lasting impact on the region in the years to come The Empire s defeat and the occupation of part of its territory by the Allied Powers in the aftermath of World War I the Sykes Picot Agreement had a significant impact on the Arab world and its people The agreement divided the Arab territories of the Ottoman Empire into zones of control for

Arabs shared its knowledge and ideas with Europe including translations of Arabic texts These translations had a significant impact on culture of Europe leading to the transformation of many philosophical disciplines in the medieval Latin world Additionally the Arabs made original innovations in various fields including the arts agriculture alchemy music and pottery and traditional star names such as Aldebaran scientific terms like alchemy whence also chemistry algebra algorithm etc and names of commodities such as sugar camphor cotton coffee etc br From the medieval scholars of the Renaissance of the th century who had focused on studying Greek and Arabic works of natural sciences philosophy and mathematics rather than on such cultural texts Arab logician most notably Averroes had inherited Greek ideas after they had invaded and conquered Egypt and the Levant Their translations and commentaries on these ideas worked their way through the Arab West into Iberia and Sicily which became important centers for this transmission of ideas From the th to the th century many schools dedicated to the translation of philosophical and scientific works from Classical Arabic to Medieval Latin were established in Iberia most notably the Toledo School of Translators This work of translation from Arab culture though largely unplanned and disorganized constituted one of the greatest transmissions of ideas in history br During the Timurid Renaissance spanning the late th the th and the early th centuries there was a significant exchange of ideas art and knowledge between

the Hejaz and the recognition of Sharif Hussein as its king by the Allies Arab nationalism emerged as a major movement in the early th century with many Arab intellectuals artists and political leaders seeking to promote unity and independence for the Arab world This movement gained momentum after World War II leading to the formation of the Arab League and the creation of several new Arab

to create a sense of pan Arab identity and solidarity br The roots of pan Arabism can be traced back to the Arab Renaissance or Al Nahda movement of the late th century which saw a revival of Arab culture literature and intellectual thought The movement emphasized the importance of Arab unity and the need to resist colonialism and foreign domination One of the key figures in the development of pan Arabism was the Egyptian statesman and intellectual Gamal Abdel Nasser who led the revolution in Egypt and became the country s president in Nasser promoted pan Arabism as a means of strengthening Arab solidarity and resisting Western imperialism He also supported the idea of Arab socialism which sought to combine pan Arabism with socialist principles Similar attempts were made by other Arab

especially mathematics astronomy and medicine Other subjects of scientific inquiry included physics alchemy and chemistry cosmology ophthalmology geography and cartography sociology and psychology br br Al Battani was an astronomer astrologer and mathematician of the Islamic Golden Age His work is considered instrumental in the development of science and astronomy One of Al Battani s best known achievements in astronomy was the determination of the solar year as being days hours minutes and seconds which is only minutes and seconds off In mathematics al Batt n produced a number of trigonometrical relationships Al Zahrawi regarded by many as the greatest surgeon of the Middle Ages His surgical treatise De chirurgia is the first illustrated surgical guide ever written It remained the primary source for surgical procedures and instruments in Europe for the next years The book helped lay the foundation to establish surgery as a scientific discipline independent from medicine

Arab nations In Egypt around of the population marry a cousin A survey in Jordan found that were married to a first cousin a further were married to more distant relatives of marriages in Saudi Arabia are between close relatives as are of all marriages in Kuwait whereas of all Lebanese were between blood relatives Due to the actions of Muhammad and the Rightly Guided Caliphs marriage between cousins is explicitly allowed in Islam and the Quran itself does not discourage or forbid the practice Nevertheless opinions vary on whether the phenomenon should be seen as exclusively based on Islamic practices as a study among Arabs in Jordan did not show significant differences between Christian Arabs or Muslim Arabs when comparing the occurrence of consanguinity br br br Genetics br

components related to the Arabian Peninsula display an increasing frequency pattern from west to east over North Africa A similar frequency pattern exist across northeastern Africa with decreasing genetic affinities to groups of the Arabian Peninsula along the Nile river valley across Sudan and South Sudan the more they go south This genetic cline of admixture is dated to the time of Arab expansion and immigration to the Maghreb and northeast Africa Genetic research has indicated that Palestinian Arabs and Jews share common genetic ancestry and are closely related br br br See also br
