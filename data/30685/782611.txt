id: 782611
The Dark Tower is an incomplete manuscript written by C S Lewis that appears to be an unfinished sequel to the science fiction novel Out of the Silent Planet though doubts have been raised about its authenticity Perelandra instead became the second book of Lewis Space Trilogy concluded by That Hideous Strength Walter Hooper Lewis literary executor titled the fragment and published it in the collection The Dark Tower and Other Stories The Lewis scholar Kathryn Lindskoog challenged the authenticity of the work br br br Plot summaries br The story deals with an early rendition of interdimensional travel A fictional Lewis himself narrates as he does in Perelandra but Elwin Ransom appears as a supporting character The story begins with a discussion of time travel among several academics at a university subsequently identified as Cambridge during summer vacation They conclude that it is impossible to violate the laws of space time in such a way However after the discussion one of the men Orfieu unveils an invention he believes allows people to see through time The group uses this chronoscope to observe an alien world they call Othertime he does not know if it is future or past where a group of human automatons work to construct a tower at the bidding of the story s villain the Unicorn a devilish but human or possibly semi human character with a single horn growing out of his forehead The Unicorn stings people apparently volunteers causing them to become automatons the Jerkies br After a while MacPhee a character who appears in That Hideous Strength though here he is a Scot not an Irishman points out that the Dark Tower is in fact a replica of the new Cambridge University Library This suggests Othertime is the far future with a replica of an ancient monument being constructed br It is discovered that Orfieu s assistant Scudamour has a double in Othertime Increasingly the observers wonder if Othertime really is the past or future or whether it is some other reality Scudamour s double grows a sting and becomes the new Unicorn During one viewing session Scudamour sees the Unicorn about to sting the double of his fianc e Camilla In a blind fury he rushes at the screen and somehow switches bodies with the Unicorn The remainder of the text deals with his experiences in Othertime as well as his colleagues attempt to hunt down the Unicorn in this world br In Othertime Scudamour survives by playing on his authority his only card while he tries to learn He discovers to his amazement that there is a chronoscope in the Unicorn s room where he stung victims but it is now broken He refrains from stinging Camilla and tries to plan their escape It appears there is some sort of war being waged by the White Riders who want to remove the stingers from the unicorns against the Othertime government He reads in a library about the Othertimer s time science A theory is given of multiple timelines these do not seem to split off from different outcomes like quantum realities but simply proceed separately However they can be controlled and contact between them can be made References are made to the changeling myth The law is stated that Any two time lines approximate to the exact degree to which their material contents are alike and it is revealed that an experiment with a replica railway shed in the right place had already been successful in allowing a controlled transfer of minds The text cuts abruptly with Scudamour still reading br br br Origin br In his introduction to The Dark Tower and Other Stories Hooper states that he rescued an untitled manuscript in Lewis handwriting of the story from a bonfire of the author s writings early in several months after Lewis death The page manuscript appears to have originally had at least pages two of which are now missing If the text did at one time continue past the th page these additional pages are also lost As it stands the narrative is unfinished it contains two gaps and comes to an abrupt end br Hooper surmises based on the text s internal setting that Lewis wrote it immediately after he finished Out of the Silent Planet in about Hooper reports that the late Gervase Mathew told him that he heard Lewis read The Dark Tower to the Inklings around that time Anne Paxch posted on the MereLewis list that many who never attended any Inklings meetings heard Lewis read his unpublished works elsewhere and that she recalls Gervase Mathew and others discussing passages which later appeared in The Dark Tower The Inklings scholar John D Rateliff suggests that the story could have been written some years later in about pointing to a reference in a letter by Lewis s friend J R R Tolkien to a story by Lewis that could be The Dark Tower Rateliff further describes The Dark Tower and Tolkien s two unfinished time travel novels The Lost Road begun in and The Notion Club Papers begun c as a triad br Alistair Fowler had clear memories of the Stinging Man character in an unfinished manuscript which Lewis showed him in However Fowler s recollections not shared until years after the event may be imperfect He reported seeing a manuscript of the Lewis fragment After Ten Years on the same occasion a text which Roger Lancelyn Green thought Lewis did not commence until Fowler also described Lewis as engrossed in an issue of the magazine Astounding Science Fiction which may be inaccurate given that Astounding featured what Lewis called the fiction of Engineers for which he had not the slightest taste in the s Lewis was both a reader of and a contributor to The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction br br br Authenticity and relation to the published novels br The Lewis scholar Kathryn Lindskoog advanced the theory that The Dark Tower and other posthumously published works attributed to Lewis were forgeries written by or at the behest of Walter Hooper based upon her impressions of their style and questions she raised about their provenance Lindskoog claimed that The Dark Tower resembled stories by other writers including A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L Engle and The Planet of the Dead by Clark Ashton Smith br Others accept that the story is by Lewis as the author s estate and the publishers assert by publishing it under his name The oppressive atmosphere of the book is reminiscent of Lewis s own That Hideous Strength and David Lindsay s A Voyage to Arcturus which Lewis acknowledged as an influence br The Dark Tower does differ to a degree from the published novels of Lewis s The Space Trilogy in setting and subject matter For example Ransom becomes a marginal character and the action takes place partly in an alternate universe However if as Hooper supposes the text was written prior to Perelandra and That Hideous Strength it would have had no need to maintain consistency with an as yet unwritten series especially considering that the tone and subject matter of the published series changes markedly between its first and last books br Margaret Wheatfield noted that In The Dark Tower we see an alternate reality with a dark analogue of Cambridge University where evil magic is manifest and rampant and people are made into automatons by the sting of a magical horn In That Hideous Strength evil magic is at work behind the scenes at an ancient English university in our familiar reality subtly corrupting the faculty by mundane means manipulation of academic politics offers of tempting career advances and of lucrative real estate deals The terrifying deviltry behind it becomes only gradually visible to the reader At least to this reviewer it seems entirely plausible to consider the one as an early draft of the other br Alastair Fowler Regius Professor Emeritus of Rhetoric and English Literature at the University of Edinburgh to whom Lewis served as a doctoral supervisor wrote in that he saw portions of The Dark Tower including the Stinging Man and discussed them with Lewis in br Two quantitative stylometric analyses have compared The Dark Tower to other books in the Lewis space trilogy Both analyses have supported the perception that for whatever reason the style of The Dark Tower is atypical of that employed by Lewis in the trilogy The first concluded from examination of a portion of The Dark Tower s text that with respect to the frequency of single letters and particularly letter pairs The Dark Tower fragment represents a different style than the books comprising Lewis s deep space trilogy The second concluded that vocabulary usage in The Dark Tower differs from that predicted by Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra br br br Suggested developments br Walter Hooper noted in his afterword that Scudamour s fianc e is once given the surname Ammeret and suggests a basis in the characters Sir Scudamour and Amoret in The Faerie Queene Book III Amoret was carried off by an enchanter and had to be rescued Another allusion to note is the probable reference of Orfieu to Sir Orfeo a medieval narrative poem merging the Orpheus myth with the trip to fairyland br The construction of the tower is clearly important Lewis s time lines are quite coherent in terms of the science fiction of his generation it is often forgotten by readers that he was seriously interested in science fiction long before it was fashionable In terms of the law that Any two time lines approximate to the exact degree to which their material contents are alike the tower is obviously a repeat on a grand scale of the Othertimers successful but small experiment with a railway shed constructed in the same space as ours However although Lewis was a reader of all sorts of science fiction he himself was not interested in writing the technical side he wrote in that The most superficial appearance of plausibility the merest sop to our critical intellect will do I took a hero to Mars once in a space ship but when I knew better I had angels convey him to Venus br How Lewis would have explored the threat from the Othertime world remains unknown The text mentions an idol whose face is in some way recognizable to the Cambridge observers and which is the narrator says still there at the end of the events to be narrated How Lewis intended to follow up this foreshadowing is unclear he may have intended to suggest links to contemporary world events or may have had no precise idea in mind The story could be interpreted as the germ of a dystopian novel like That Hideous Strength the Stingingmen and Jerkies could parallel the Conditioners and the Conditioned as described in The Abolition of Man The idol with many bodies and one head may express Lewis horror expressed in many of his works at the absorption and suppression of the individual into a collective controlled by a single will in Perelandra referring to a similar loss of individuality he speculates that what the Pantheists falsely hoped for in Heaven the wicked really receive in Hell br br br See also br J R R Tolkien s explorations of
