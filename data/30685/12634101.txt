The Discarded Image An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature is a non fiction book by C S Lewis It was his last book and deals with medieval cosmology and the Ptolemaic universe It portrays the medieval conception of a model of the world which Lewis described as the medieval synthesis itself the whole organization of their theology science and history into a single complex harmonious mental model of the universe br br br Synopsis br The book includes such concepts as the structure of the medieval universe the nature of its inhabitants the notion of a finite universe ordered and maintained by a celestial hierarchy and the ideas of nature At the same time Lewis takes his reader on a tour of some of the pinnacles of medieval thought some of them inherited from Classical paganism that have survived into the modern cultural and theological landscape br The titles of the chapters are br br The Medieval Situation br Reservations br Selected Materials The Classical Period br Selected Materials The Seminal Period br The Heavens br The Longaevi br Earth and Her Inhabitants br The Influence of the Model br br br The Medieval Situation and Reservations br Lewis begins by introducing the Middle Ages as a whole and by laying out the components that shaped their world view This worldview or Model of the Universe was shaped by two factors in particular the essentially bookish character of their culture and their intense love of system The bookish character combines with the need for order All the apparent contradictions must be harmonised A Model must be built which will get everything in without a clash and it can do this only by becoming intricate by mediating its unity through a great and finely ordered multiplicity br He is quick to point out the possible flaws he feels some may see in his conception The Model is primarily based in art and literature It does not account for historical changes in philosophic schools or serve as a general history of science or medicine In addition only bits and pieces of the Model served as part of the general backdrop of the age And above all Lewis is clear to state that On the highest level then the Model was recognised as provisional What we should like to know is how far down the intellectual scale this cautious view extended br br br Selected Materials The Classical Period br Lewis provides summaries of the classical texts he believes most informed the medieval Model He excludes the Bible Virgil and Ovid as texts that a student of medieval literature should already be familiar with Among the texts he covers are br br The Somnium Scipionis by Cicero br The works of Lucan br Statius Thebaid br Apuleius De Deo Socratis br br br Selected Materials The Seminal Period br Lewis refers to the seminal period as a transitional stage stretching from around to A D He spends some time discussing the pagans and Christians of this time and notes that both were monotheists br As with the Classical period he provides summaries of various texts including br br Chalcidius commentary on Plato s Timaeus br Macrobius commentary on the Somnium Scipionis br The Celestial Hierarchies of Pseudo Dionysius br Boethius De Consolatione Philosophiae br He also mentions Isidore of Seville s Etymologiae and Vincent of Beauvais Speculum Majus They are not like those I have been describing contributors to the Model but they sometimes supply the handiest evidence as to what it was Both are encyclopaedists br br br The Heavens br In medieval science the fundamental concept was that of certain sympathies antipathies and strivings inherent in the matter itself Everything has its right place its home the region that suits it and if not forcibly restrained moves thither by a sort of homing instinct a kindly enclyning to their kindly stede br In his exploration of the Heavens Lewis works to explain much of the basics of medieval cosmology He begins by explaining the phenomenon of kindly enclyning everything returns to the place from which it is drawn Lewis goes on to answer the question that may arise in response to kindly enclyning and that is Did medieval thinkers really believe that what we now call inanimate objects possess sentient and purposive qualities The answer was in general no Lewis says in general because they attributed life and even intelligence to one privileged class of objects the stars But full blown Panpsychism was not held by anyone before Camponella In support Lewis describes the four grades of terrestrial reality mere existence as in stones existence with growth as in vegetables existence and growth with sensation as in beasts and all these with reason as in men According to Lewis To talk as if inanimate bodies had a homing instinct is to bring them no nearer to us than pigeons to talk as if they could obey laws is to treat them like men and even like citizens In the medieval conception everything was made up of the Four Contraries hot cold moist and dry These combine to give us the Four Elements The union of hot and dry becomes fire that of hot and moist air of cold and moist water of cold and dry earth There is also a fifth element aether that humans do not experience In the sublunary world all the elements have sorted themselves out Earth the heaviest has gathered itself together at the centre On it lies the lighter water above that the still lighter air Fire the lightest of all whenever it was free has flown up to the circumference of Nature and forms a sphere just below the orbit of the Moon br He then briefly summarizes the Ptolemaic universe The central spherical Earth is surrounded by a series of hollow and transparent globes These are the spheres heavens Fixed in each of the first seven spheres is one luminous body Starting from Earth the order is the Moon Mercury Venus the Sun Mars Jupiter and Saturn the seven planets Beyond the sphere of Saturn is the Stellatum to which belong all the stars that we still call fixed because their positions to one another are invariable Beyond the Stellatum there is a sphere called the First Moveable or Primum Mobile its existence was inferred to account for the motions of the others br All motion moved in order from the top to the bottom from God to the Primum Mobile to the Stellatum to each lower sphere The spheres also transmitted Influences to the Earth Here Lewis takes up the question of astrology in the Middle Ages He notes that within the Medieval mind the universe was finite that it was of a perfect spherical shape containing within itself an ordered variety Lewis states that while a modern mind might gaze into the sky and interpret vast nothingness a person living within the Middle Ages would be able to admire it as one might admire grand architecture He concludes that while modern astronomy may arouse terror or bewilderment or vague reverie the spheres of the old present us with an object in which the mind can rest overwhelming in its greatness but satisfying in its harmony He asserts that these observations reveal a key difference between the present and past that the modern conception of the universe is romantic while the Medieval conception classical He also goes on to discuss the strange persistence of certain pagan ideas such as the deification of the planets He talks about each s influence metals and character br br br The Longaevi br The Longaevi or long livers are those creatures which might be called fairies Lewis gave them their own chapter because their place of residence is ambiguous between air and Earth That is to say he really couldn t find another section in the book that they d fit into so he just gave them their own place Lewis sees the word fairies as tarnished by pantomime and bad children s books with worse illustrations Lewis writes of the various creatures in the Middle Ages fearsome fair and the separate beings known as the High Fairies He then shares four theories or attempts to fit them into the Model br br They could be a third species distinct from angels and men br They are angels who have been demoted so to speak br They are the dead or at least a special class of the dead br They are fallen angels devils br Such were the efforts to find a socket into which the Fairies would fit No agreement was achieved As long as the Fairies remained at all they remained evasive br br br Earth and Her Inhabitants br In this penultimate chapter Lewis talks about various facets of Earth and how they fit into the Model br br br The Earth br Everything below the moon is mutable and subject to the influences of the spheres While the other planets have Intelligences deities associated with them the Earth was not believed to have one since she did not move and so did not require guidance Dante was the first to suggest an Intelligence for her Fortune Fortune to be sure does not steer the Earth through an orbit she fulfills the office of an Intelligence in the mode proper for a stationary globe br Despite popular modern conception the people of the Middle Ages were quite aware that the Earth was spherical Lewis believes that the misconception may arise from the mappemounde which represent the Earth as a circle or disc The purpose of these maps was more romantic than practical and was not meant to serve the practical purposes of navigation br br br Beasts br In regards to the knowledge of zoology as it appears in the bestiary tradition Lewis argues that as there was a practical geography which had nothing to do with the mappemounde so there was a practical zoology that had nothing to do with the Bestiaries Lewis sees the bestiaries as an example of encyclopaedic pulling from auctores that he sees as characteristic of the Middle Ages The focus was on the collection and on the moralitas the animals provided br br br The Human Soul br Speaking of man Lewis writes Man is a rational animal and therefore a composite being partly akin to the angels who are rational but not animal and partly akin to the beasts which are animal but not rational This gives us one of the senses in which he is the little world or microcosm Every mode of being in the whole universe contributes to him he is a cross section of being The soul of such a creature is likewise a cross section There are three kinds of Souls the Vegetable Soul the Sensitive Soul and the Rational Soul To explain Lewis writes br The powers of Vegetable Soul are nutrition growth and propagation It alone is present in plants Sensitive Soul which we find in animals has these powers but has sentience in addition Rational Soul similarly includes Vegetable and Sensitive and adds reason br br br Rational Soul br The Rational soul is the third level above the Vegetable and Sensitive Soul The Vegetable Soul is present in plants and gives the powers of nutrition growth and propagation The Sensitive Soul gives beasts these and the addition of sentience So we see in the Rational Soul in man all of the previous abilities with the addition of reason In other words man possesses all of the powers of all three soul types or though misleadingly three souls br The Rational Soul exercises two faculties Intellectus and Ratio Lewis characterizes the difference thus We are enjoying intellectus when we just see a self evident truth we are exercising ratio when we proceed step by step to prove a truth which is not self evident br br br Sensitive and Vegetable Soul br In the Sensitive Soul Lewis distinguishes ten Senses or Wits five inward and five outward Sometimes the outward are simply called senses and the inward wits The five outward are what are now known as the Five Senses sight hearing smell taste and touch The inward are memory estimation imagination phantasy and common wit or common sense br There is no need to write a separate section on the Vegetable Soul Lewis writes It is responsible for all the unconscious involuntary processes in our organism for growth secretion nutrition and reproduction br br br Soul and Body br Lewis points out two ways in which the problem of the relationship between soul and body would have presented itself to medieval thinkers First How can the soul conceived as an immaterial substance act on matter at all and second It is not possible to passe from one extreme to another but by a meane He suggests that these considerations led the thinkers to posit a tertium quid a phantom liaison officer between body and soul which was called Spirit or more often the spirits These spirits were supposedly material enough to act on the body and fine and attenuated enough to be acted upon by the immaterial soul Lewis adds This doctrine of the spirits seems to me the least reputable feature in the Medieval Model If the tertium quid is matter at all what have density and rarity to do with it both ends of the bridge rest on one side of the chasm if not both rest on the other br br br The Human Body br The four contraries which in the world come together to form elements combine within the body to create the Humours The predominance of specific Humours creates specific temperaments Sanguine Choleric Melancholy and Phlegmatic The proportion in which the Humours are blended differs from one man to another and constitutes his complexio or temperamentum his combination or mixture br Man is classified into these four categories based on which temperament is most dominant in him There is the Sanguine complexion the best of the four The Sanguine man s anger is easily roused but shortlived he is a trifle peppery but not sullen or vindictive Second there is the Choleric man Like the Sanguine he is easily moved to anger But unlike the Sanguine the Choleric are vindictive Third there is the Melancholy Today I think we should describe the Melancholy as neurotic I mean the Melancholy man of the Middle Ages Finally there is the Phlegmatic which Lewis considered to be the worst of the four The phlegmatic boy or girl fat pale sluggish dull is the despair of parents and teachers by others either made a butt or simply unnoticed br br br The Human Past br Medieval historians are a mixed collection Some of them have the scientific approach and are critical of their sources But it is not the accuracy we are after Rather it is the picture of the past In the Middle Ages then the purpose of recording history or as we know today the term historiography was to entertain our imagination to gratify our curiosity and to discharge a debt we owe our ancestors br Historically as well as cosmically medieval man stood at the foot of a stairway looking up he felt delighted The backward like the upward glance exhilarated him with a majestic spectacle and humility was rewarded with the pleasure of admiration br br br The Seven Liberal Arts br The Seven Liberal Arts are Grammar Dialectic Rhetoric Arithmetic Music Geometry and Astronomy Lewis goes on to write in more detail concerning each art describing exactly how and why it was so important for a medieval education The first three constitute the Trivium or threefold way and as such are connected to one another in some form For example Grammar and Dialectic are a progression Having learned from Grammar how to talk we must learn from Dialectic how to talk sense argue to prove and disprove Rhetoric prior to the medieval period was not so much the loveliest as the most practical of the arts By the middle ages it has become literary There is no antithesis indeed no distinction between Rhetoric and Poetry br br br The Influence of the Model br Lewis concludes by highlighting the impact the Model had on the literature and art of the era Poets and other artists depicted these things because their minds loved to dwell on them Other ages have not had a Model so universally accepted as theirs so imaginable and so satisfying to the imagination br br br Selected reviews br Most reviews of the book were positive br br Wise illuminating companionable it may well come to be seen as Lewis s best book The Observer br the final memorial to the work of a great scholar and teacher and a wise and noble mind br However some reviewers have noted Lewis tendency to oversimplify and to overcategorize br br br See also br The Waning of the Middle Ages br br br Footnotes br br br br Lewis C S The Discarded Image An
