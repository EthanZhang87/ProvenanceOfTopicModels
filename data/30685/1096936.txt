The Abolition of Man is a book by C S Lewis Subtitled Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools it uses that as a starting point for a defense of objective value and natural law as well as a warning about the consequences of doing away with them It defends man s power over nature as something worth pursuing but criticizes the use of it to debunk values the value of science itself being among them The book was first delivered as a series of three evening lectures at King s College Newcastle part of the University of Durham as the Riddell Memorial Lectures on February br br br Moral subjectivism vs natural law br Lewis begins with a critical response to The Green Book by Gaius and Titius The Control of Language A Critical Approach to Reading and Writing published in by Alexander Alec King and Martin Ketley The Green Book was used as a text for upper form students in British schools br Lewis criticises the authors for subverting student values and claims that they teach that all statements of value such as this waterfall is sublime are merely statements about the speaker s feelings and say nothing about the object Such a view Lewis argues makes nonsense of value talk It implies for example that a speaker who condemns some act as contemptible is really only saying I have contemptible feelings br By denying that values are real or that sentiments can be reasonable subjectivism saps moral motivation and robs people of the ability to respond emotionally to experiences of real goodness and real beauty in literature and in the world Moreover Lewis claims that it is impossible to be a consistent moral subjectivist Even the authors of The Green Book clearly believe that some things such as improved student learning are truly good and desirable br Lewis cites ancient thinkers such as Plato Aristotle and St Augustine who believed that the purpose of education was to train children in ordinate affections to train them to like and dislike what they ought and to love the good and hate the bad Lewis claims that although such values are universal they do not develop automatically or inevitably in children Thus they are not natural in that sense of the word but they must be taught through education Those who lack them lack the specifically human element the trunk that unites intellectual man with visceral animal man and they may be called men without chests br br br Men without chests a dystopian future br br Lewis criticizes modern attempts to debunk natural values such as those that would deny objective value to the waterfall on rational grounds He says that there is a set of objective values that have been shared with minor differences by every culture which he refers to as the traditional moralities of East and West the Christian the Pagan and the Jew Lewis calls that the Tao from the Taoist word for the ultimate way or path of reality and human conduct Although Lewis saw natural law as supernatural in origin as evidenced by his use of it as a proof of theism in Mere Christianity his argument in the book does not rest on theism br Without the Tao no value judgments can be made at all and modern attempts to do away with some parts of traditional morality for some rational reason always proceed by arbitrarily selecting one part of the Tao and using it as grounds to debunk the others br The final chapter describes the ultimate consequences of this debunking a not so distant future in which the values and morals of the majority are controlled by a small group who rule by a perfect understanding of psychology and who in turn being able to see through any system of morality that might induce them to act in a certain way are ruled only by their own unreflected whims In surrendering rational reflection on their own motivations the controllers will no longer be recognizably human the controlled will be robot like and the Abolition of Man will have been completed br An appendix to The Abolition of Man lists a number of basic values seen by Lewis as parts of the Tao supported by quotations from different cultures br A fictional treatment of the dystopian project to carry out the Abolition of Man is a theme of Lewis s novel That Hideous Strength br Passages from The Abolition of Man are included in William Bennett s book The Book of Virtues
