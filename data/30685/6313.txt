title: Classical element
id: 6313
The classical elements typically refer to earth water air fire and later aether which were proposed to explain the nature and complexity of all matter in terms of simpler substances Ancient cultures in Greece Angola Tibet India and Mali had similar lists which sometimes referred in local languages to air as wind and to aether as space br br These different cultures and even individual philosophers had widely varying explanations concerning their attributes and how they related to observable phenomena as well as cosmology Sometimes these theories overlapped with mythology and were personified in deities Some of these interpretations included atomism the idea of very small indivisible portions of matter but other interpretations considered the elements to be divisible into infinitely small pieces without changing their nature br While the classification of the material world in ancient India Hellenistic Egypt and ancient Greece into air earth fire and water was more philosophical during the Middle Ages medieval scientists used practical experimental observation to classify materials In Europe the ancient Greek concept devised by Empedocles evolved into the systematic classifications of Aristotle and Hippocrates This evolved slightly into the medieval system and eventually became the object of experimental verification in the th century at the start of the Scientific Revolution br Modern science does not support the classical elements to classify types of substances Atomic theory classifies atoms into more than a hundred chemical elements such as oxygen iron and mercury which may form chemical compounds and mixtures The modern categories roughly corresponding to the classical elements are the states of matter produced under different temperatures and pressures Solid liquid gas and plasma share many attributes with the corresponding classical elements of earth water air and fire but these states describe the similar behavior of different types of atoms at similar energy levels not the characteristic behavior of certain atoms or substances br br The ancient Greek concept of four basic elements these being earth g water h d r air a r and fire p r dates from pre Socratic times and persisted throughout the Middle Ages and into the Early modern period deeply influencing European thought and culture br br The classical elements were first proposed independently by several early Pre Socratic philosophers Greek philosophers had debated which substance was the arche first principle or primordial element from which everything else was made Thales c c BC believed that water was this principle Anaximander c c BC argued that the primordial substance was not any of the known substances but could be transformed into them and they into each other Anaximenes c c BC favored air and Heraclitus fl c BC championed fire br br The Greek philosopher Empedocles c BC was the first to propose the four classical elements as a set fire earth air and water He called them the four roots rhiz mata Empedocles also proved at least to his own satisfaction that air was a separate substance by observing that a bucket inverted in water did not become filled with water a pocket of air remaining trapped inside br Fire earth air and water have become the most popular set of classical elements in modern interpretations One such version was provided by Robert Boyle in The Sceptical Chymist which was published in in the form of a dialogue between five characters Themistius the Aristotelian of the party says br br If You but consider a piece of green Wood burning in a Chimney You will readily discern in the disbanded parts of it the four Elements of which we teach It and other mixt bodies to be compos d The fire discovers it self in the flame the smoke by ascending to the top of the chimney and there readily vanishing into air manifests to what Element it belongs and gladly returnes The water boyling and hissing at the ends of the burning Wood betrayes it self and the ashes by their weight their firiness and their dryness put it past doubt that they belong to the Element of Earth br br According to Galen these elements were used by Hippocrates c c BC in describing the human body with an association with the four humours yellow bile fire black bile earth blood air and phlegm water Medical care was primarily about helping the patient stay in or return to their own personal natural balanced state br br Plato BC seems to have been the first to use the term element stoiche on in reference to air fire earth and water The ancient Greek word for element stoicheion from stoicheo to line up meant smallest division of a sun dial a syllable as the composing unit of an alphabet it could denote a letter and the smallest unit from which a word is formed br br In On the Heavens BC Aristotle defines element in general br br An element we take it is a body into which other bodies may be analysed present in them potentially or in actuality which of these is still disputable and not itself divisible into bodies different in form That or something like it is what all men in every case mean by element br In his On Generation and Corruption Aristotle related each of the four elements to two of the four sensible qualities br br Fire is both hot and dry br Air is both hot and wet for air is like vapor br Water is both cold and wet br Earth is both cold and dry br A classic diagram has one square inscribed in the other with the corners of one being the classical elements and the corners of the other being the properties The opposite corner is the opposite of these properties hot cold and dry wet br br Aristotle added a fifth element aether aither as the quintessence reasoning that whereas fire earth air and water were earthly and corruptible since no changes had been perceived in the heavenly regions the stars cannot be made out of any of the four elements but must be made of a different unchangeable heavenly substance It had previously been believed by pre Socratics such as Empedocles and Anaxagoras that aether the name applied to the material of heavenly bodies was a form of fire Aristotle himself did not use the term aether for the fifth element and strongly criticised the pre Socratics for associating the term with fire He preferred a number of other terms indicating eternal movement thus emphasising the evidence for his discovery of a new element These five elements have been associated since Plato s Timaeus with the five platonic solids br br The Neoplatonic philosopher Proclus rejected Aristotle s theory relating the elements to the sensible qualities hot cold wet and dry He maintained that each of the elements has three properties Fire is sharp subtle and mobile while its opposite earth is blunt dense and immobile they are joined by the intermediate elements air and water in the following fashion br br A text written in Egypt in Hellenistic or Roman times called the Kore Kosmou Virgin of the World ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus associated with the Egyptian god Thoth names the four elements fire water air and earth As described in this book br br And Isis answer made Of living things my son some are made friends with fire and some with water some with air and some with earth and some with two or three of these and some with all And on the contrary again some are made enemies of fire and some of water some of earth and some of air and some of two of them and some of three and some of all For instance son the locust and all flies flee fire the eagle and the hawk and all high flying birds flee water fish air and earth the snake avoids the open air Whereas snakes and all creeping things love earth all swimming things love water winged things air of which they are the citizens while those that fly still higher love the fire and have the habitat near it Not that some of the animals as well do not love fire for instance salamanders for they even have their homes in it It is because one or another of the elements doth form their bodies outer envelope Each soul accordingly while it is in its body is weighted and constricted by these four br br The system of five elements are found in Vedas especially Ayurveda the pancha mahabhuta or five great elements of Hinduism are br br bh mi or p thv earth br pas or jala water br agn or tejas fire br v yu vy na or v ta air or wind br k a vyom or nya space or zero or aether or void br They further suggest that all of creation including the human body is made of these five essential elements and that upon death the human body dissolves into these five elements of nature thereby balancing the cycle of nature br The five elements are associated with the five senses and act as the gross medium for the experience of sensations The basest element earth created using all the other elements can be perceived by all five senses i hearing ii touch iii sight iv taste and v smell The next higher element water has no odor but can be heard felt seen and tasted Next comes fire which can be heard felt and seen Air can be heard and felt Akasha aether is beyond the senses of smell taste sight and touch it being accessible to the sense of hearing alone br br Buddhism has had a variety of thought about the five elements and their existence and relevance some of which continue to this day br In the Pali literature the mahabhuta great elements or catudhatu four elements are earth water fire and air In early Buddhism the four elements are a basis for understanding suffering and for liberating oneself from suffering The earliest Buddhist texts explain that the four primary material elements are solidity fluidity temperature and mobility characterized as earth water fire and air respectively br The Buddha s teaching regarding the four elements is to be understood as the base of all observation of real sensations rather than as a philosophy The four properties are cohesion water solidity or inertia earth expansion or vibration air and heat or energy content fire He promulgated a categorization of mind and matter as composed of eight types of kalapas of which the four elements are primary and a secondary group of four are colour smell taste and nutriment which are derivative from the four primaries br Thanissaro Bhikkhu renders an extract of Shakyamuni Buddha s from Pali into English thus br br Just as a skilled butcher or his apprentice having killed a cow would sit at a crossroads cutting it up into pieces the monk contemplates this very body however it stands however it is disposed in terms of properties In this body there is the earth property the liquid property the fire property the wind property br Tibetan Buddhist medical literature speaks of the pa ca mah bh ta five elements or elemental properties earth water fire wind and space The concept was extensively used in traditional Tibetan medicine Tibetan Buddhist theology tantra traditions and astrological texts also spoke of them making up the environment human bodies and at the smallest or subtlest level of existence parts of thought and the mind Also at the subtlest level of existence the elements exist as pure natures represented by the five female buddhas k adh tvi var Buddhalocan Mamak P ar vasin and Samayat r and these pure natures manifest as the physical properties of earth solidity water fluidity fire heat and light wind movement and energy and the expanse of space These natures exist as all qualities that are in the physical world and take forms in it br br In traditional Bakongo religion the five elements are incorporated into the Kongo cosmogram This sacred symbol also depicts the physical world Nseke the spiritual world of the ancestors Mp mba the Kal nga line that runs between the two worlds the circular void that originally formed the two worlds mb ngi and the path of the sun Each element correlates to a period in the life cycle which the Bakongo people also equate to the four cardinal directions According to their cosmology all living things go through this cycle br br Aether represents mb ngi the circular void that begot the universe br Air South represents musoni the period of conception that takes place during spring br Fire East represent kala the period of birth that takes place during summer br Earth North represents tukula the period of maturity that takes place during fall br Water West represents luvemba the period of death that takes place during winter br br In traditional Bambara spirituality the Supreme God created four additional essences of himself during creation Together these five essences of the deity correlate with the five classical elements br br Koni is the thought and void aether br Bemba also called Pemba is the god of the sky and air br Nyale also called Koroni Koundy is the goddess of fire br Faro is the androgynous god of water br Ndomadyiri is the god and master of the earth br br The elemental system used in medieval alchemy was developed primarily by the anonymous authors of the Arabic works attributed to Pseudo Apollonius of Tyana This system consisted of the four classical elements of air earth fire and water in addition to a new theory called the sulphur mercury theory of metals which was based on two elements sulphur characterizing the principle of combustibility the stone which burns and mercury characterizing the principle of metallic properties They were seen by early alchemists as idealized expressions of irreducible components of the universe and are of larger consideration within philosophical alchemy br The three metallic principles sulphur to flammability or combustion mercury to volatility and stability and salt to solidity became the tria prima of the Swiss alchemist Paracelsus He reasoned that Aristotle s four element theory appeared in bodies as three principles Paracelsus saw these principles as fundamental and justified them by recourse to the description of how wood burns in fire Mercury included the cohesive principle so that when it left in smoke the wood fell apart Smoke described the volatility the mercurial principle the heat giving flames described flammability sulphur and the remnant ash described solidity salt br br Japanese traditions use a set of elements called the godai literally five great These five are earth water fire wind air and void These came from Indian Vastu shastra philosophy and Buddhist beliefs in addition the classical Chinese elements wu xing are also prominent in Japanese culture especially to the influential Neo Confucianists during the medieval Edo period br br Earth represented rocks and stability br Water represented fluidity and adaptability br Fire represented life and energy br Wind represented movement and expansion br Void or Sky Heaven represented spirit and creative energy br br The Islamic philosophers al Kindi Avicenna and Fakhr al Din al Razi followed Aristotle in connecting the four elements with the four natures heat and cold the active force and dryness and moisture the recipients br br The medicine wheel symbol is a modern invention attributed to Native American peoples dating to approximately with the following descriptions and associations being a later addition The associations with the classical elements are not grounded in traditional Indigenous teachings and the symbol has not been adopted by all Indigenous American nations br br Earth South represents the youth cycle summer the Indigenous race and cedar medicine br Fire East represents the birth cycle spring the Asian race and tobacco medicine br Wind Air North represents the elder cycle winter the European race and sweetgrass medicine br Water West represents the adulthood cycle autumn the African race and sage medicine br br The Aristotelian tradition and medieval alchemy eventually gave rise to modern chemistry scientific theories and new taxonomies By the time of Antoine Lavoisier for example a list of elements would no longer refer to classical elements Some modern scientists see a parallel between the classical elements and the four states of matter solid liquid gas and weakly ionized plasma br Modern science recognizes classes of elementary particles which have no substructure or rather particles that are not made of other particles and composite particles having substructure particles made of other particles br br Western astrology uses the four classical elements in connection with astrological charts and horoscopes The twelve signs of the zodiac are divided into the four elements Fire signs are Aries Leo and Sagittarius Earth signs are Taurus Virgo and Capricorn Air signs are Gemini Libra and Aquarius and Water signs are Cancer Scorpio and Pisces br br The Dutch historian of science Eduard Jan Dijksterhuis writes that the theory of the classical elements was bound to exercise a really harmful influence As is now clear Aristotle by adopting this theory as the basis of his interpretation of nature and by never losing faith in it took a course which promised few opportunities and many dangers for science Bertrand Russell says that Aristotle s thinking became imbued with almost biblical authority in later centuries So much so that Ever since the beginning of the seventeenth century almost every serious intellectual advance has
