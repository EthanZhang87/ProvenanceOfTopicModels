Narnia is a fantasy world created by C S Lewis as the primary location for his series of seven fantasy novels for children The Chronicles of Narnia The world is named after the country of Narnia where much of the Chronicles takes place br In Narnia some animals talk mythical beasts abound and magic is common The series tracks the story of Narnia when humans usually children enter the Narnian world from Earth The entire Narnian timeline from its creation to its end c ran parallel to Earth years c thus on average a year on Earth meant time dilation years in Narnia br br br Inspiration br br The landscape of Lewis s native Ireland in particular his native Ulster played a large part in the creation of the Narnian landscape In his essay On Stories Lewis wrote I have seen landscapes notably in the Mourne Mountains and southwards which under a particular light made me feel that at any moment a giant might raise his head over the next ridge In a letter to his brother Lewis would later confide that part of Rostrevor which overlooks Carlingford Lough is my idea of Narnia Although in adult life Lewis lived in England he returned to Ulster often and retained fond memories of the Irish scenery saying I yearn to see County Down in the snow one almost expects to see a march of dwarfs dashing past How I long to break into a world where such things were true br Beginning in young C S Lewis visited the northern Irish seaside near Portrush in the north of County Antrim many times In later years Lewis remembered the sounds of the sea the cliffs rising above it and the ruined medieval towers of Dunluce Castle which many authors have speculated may have inspired his creation of Cair Paravel br br br Narnia and Narni Italy br Concerning Narnia and Narni Roger Lancelyn Green writes about C S Lewis and Walter Hooper br br When Walter Hooper asked C S Lewis where he found the word Narnia Lewis showed him Murray s Small Classical Atlas ed G B Grundy which he acquired when he was reading the classics with Mr William T Kirkpatrick at Great Bookham On plate of the Atlas is a map of ancient Italy Lewis had underscored the name of a little town called Narnia simply because he liked the sound of it Narnia or Narni in Italian is in Umbria halfway between Rome and Assisi Narnia a small medieval town is situated at the top of an olive covered hill It was already ancient when the Romans defeated it in BC Its thirteenth century fortress dominates a deep narrow gorge of the Nera river which runs below One of its most important archaeological features is a Romanesque cathedral which contains the relics of a number of Umbrian saints br br br Fictional geography br br br Narnia br br The novels revolve around the fantastical country of Narnia The nation of Narnia often and officially the Kingdom of Narnia was guarded over by Aslan the Great Lion and was filled with humans talking animals and other mythical creatures Narnia was a land of rolling hills rising into low mountains to the south and was predominantly forested except for marshlands in the north The country is bordered on the east by the Eastern Ocean on the west by a great mountain range on the north by the River Shribble and on the south by Archenland br The economic heart of the country centres on the Great River of Narnia which crosses the country from the northwest on an east southeasterly course to the Eastern Ocean The seat of government is the castle of Cair Paravel originally on a peninsula later an island at the mouth of the Great River on the coast of the Great Eastern Ocean Other communities along the river include from east to west br br Beruna One of four named towns in the country of Narnia Beruna grew as a strategic location because of the fords on the Great River that were located there When Narnia was conquered by the Telmarines a town was built at the Fords of Beruna and a bridge over the river was constructed In Prince Caspian Susan Pevensie and Lucy Pevensie accompany Aslan to the bridge and Bacchus destroys it at the request of the river god Loose my chains br Beaversdam A community named after the dam in the area built by Mr and Mrs Beaver who met Peter Susan Edmund and Lucy on their arrival in Narnia and led three of them to the Stone Table to meet Aslan while Edmund betrayed them to the White Witch and was later rescued by Aslan s followers These events were a key point in LWW The name kept alive memory of the beavers though in later times they became extinct in Narnia The community developed some time between then and the Telmarine conquest unless the Telmarines named it after the Old Narnian story of the Pevensies which is unlikely but it still existed under the Telmarine rule and seemed to have hosted a majority of the Telmarine descent population At the time when the usurper Miraz purged the aristocracy of anyone who might threaten his rule two brothers who were the lords of Beaversdam were locked up as madmen PC br Chippingford One of four towns named in the country of Narnia It is mentioned briefly at the start of The Last Battle when Shift the Ape sends Puzzle the donkey there to buy oranges and bananas It is a British English name made up as if derived from the Anglo Saxon C apungford which means market ford LB br br br Archenland br br Archenland is a mountainous country south of Narnia It is bordered on the north by Narnia and on the south by the Winding Arrow River and further south is the Great Desert The seat of government is at Anvard in the heart of the country a fortified area br br br Calormen br br Calormen is a semi arid empire in the south of the world of Narnia The capital of Calormen is Tashbaan located on an island near the mouth of the River of Calormen which flows from west to east in the north of Calormen just south of the Great Desert The city of Azim Balda to the south of Tashbaan is a hub where many roads meet it hosts the government s postal system Prince Caspian describes slave trade between Calormen and Telmar from areas far south of Calormen br br br Northern Countries br North of Narnia lies Ettinsmoor a cold barren plain home to the once civilized now anarchistic giants North of Ettinsmoor is a deep gorge crossed by an ancient bridge known simply as the Giant Bridge part of a long abandoned road This leads to the Wild Lands of the North home of the Ruined City of the Giants and the castle Harfang which is still inhabited by giants br br br Eastern Ocean br East of Narnia is the Great Eastern Ocean where the Bight of Calormen is home to the Merpeople and the islands of Galma Terebinthia Seven Isles and the Lone Islands Beyond the Bight of Calormen is more ocean including the islands of Dragon Island Burnt Island Death Water Island Island of the Duffers Dark Island and the Island of the Star Beyond the Island of the Star is another undersea country called the Eastern Last Sea the water of white lilies known as the Silver Sea and the Utter East which is a small plain bordering a perpetual wave and the high mountains of Aslan s Country br br br Western Lands br To Narnia s west is the landlocked Western Wild south of this country and also west of Calormen is the Far West region and somewhere beyond this is Telmar and eventually on the other side of the unnamed continent is the Western Sea The Western Sea is an uncharted territory of the Narnian world but some claim that on its islands are strange and unearthly creatures br br br Cosmology br In the domed sky are the sun and moon which rise from the Utter East and set in the Utter West The Last Sea in the east is bright with a drinkable light There are stars and planets in the sky but in the Narnian world they are people who move accordingly and some live on the surface br br br Underground br Deep below Narnia s surface is a dark sunless country Underland and even deeper than that at the world s base is the fiery nation of Bism home to the Gnomes and Salamanders br br br Fictional cosmology br The flat world of Narnia is connected to Earth and many other worlds through a nexus called the Wood between the Worlds Travel is possible through a pool each for every world The Wood is so named by Polly Plummer who is transported there when Digory Kirke s Uncle Andrew tricks her into picking up a magic yellow ring It has a slothful influence on those travelling it which is explained by C S Lewis as the Wood being a place where nothing ever happens unlike the different worlds that it connects For the child protagonists this experience is pleasant and relaxing However it affects the White Witch Jadis negatively she shrieks in despair that the wood is killing her and she is sickly and pale It could be described as a nexus of sorts existing outside the other worlds and not being a world on its own The wood derives its name from The Wood Beyond the World a fantasy novel by William Morris an author who Lewis greatly admired However the location s function stems from another Morris novel The Well at the World s End Some scholars have suggested Dante s Divine Comedy or Algnernon Blackwood s The Education of Uncle Paul both of which Lewis was known to have enjoyed as possible secondary influences br br br Fictional timeline br Lewis provided a timeline of events related to The Chronicles of Narnia in emulation of The Tale of the Years chronology in J R R Tolkien s The Lord of the Rings He gave an Outline of Narnian History in manuscript form to Walter Hooper who included it in his essay Past Watchful Dragons The Fairy Tales of C S Lewis The novels never explicitly mention the year or years in which events take place so the timeline is the only source for this information Kathryn Lindskoog along with other Lewis scholars has challenged the authenticity of some posthumous works attributed to Lewis and edited by Hooper but the validity of the outline in particular has not been questioned The outline is accepted by Lewis experts and has been included in works by Paul Ford Martha Sammons and others br br br Consistency with other works br Several people have pointed out more or less significant areas where Lewis s Outline is not consistent with the text of the Chronicles For example the outline dates Queen Swanwhite c though according to The Last Battle she ruled Narnia before Jadis returned meaning that her reign must have ended before Paul Ford author of Companion to Narnia points out that the text of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe states that Lucy and Edmund are one year apart in age the years given in the timeline for their births and respectively would put their ages at something more than a year Devin Brown author of Inside Narnia A Guide to Exploring The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe uses the timeline as a way to reconcile some of the statements concerning the timing of Aslan s appearances in Narnia with other characters recollections of those appearances br br br See also br br
