Subterranean fiction is a subgenre of speculative fiction science fiction or fantasy which focuses on fictional underground settings sometimes at the center of the Earth or otherwise deep below the surface The genre is based on and has in turn influenced the Hollow Earth theory br The earliest works in the genre were Enlightenment era philosophical or allegorical works in which the underground setting was often largely incidental In the late th century however more pseudoscientific or proto science fictional motifs gained prevalence Common themes have included a depiction of the underground world as more primitive than the surface either culturally technologically or biologically or in some combination thereof The former cases usually see the setting used as a venue for sword and sorcery fiction while the latter often features cryptids or creatures extinct on the surface such as dinosaurs or archaic humans A less frequent theme has the underground world much more technologically advanced than the surface one typically either as the refugium of a lost civilization or more rarely as a secret base for space aliens br br br Literature br br In Dante Alighieri s Divine Comedy poem
