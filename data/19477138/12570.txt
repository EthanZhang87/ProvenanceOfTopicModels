title: Gigabyte
id: 12570
The gigabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information The prefix giga means in the International System of Units SI Therefore one gigabyte is one billion bytes The unit symbol for the gigabyte is GB br This definition is used in all contexts of science especially data science engineering business and many areas of computing including storage capacities of hard drives solid state drives and tapes as well as data transmission speeds The term is also used in some fields of computer science and information technology to denote or bytes however particularly for sizes of RAM Thus some usage of gigabyte has been ambiguous To resolve this difficulty IEC clarifies that a gigabyte GB is bytes and specifies the term gibibyte GiB to denote bytes These differences are still readily seen for example when a GB drive s capacity is displayed by Microsoft Windows as GB instead of GiB Analogously a memory module that is labeled as having the size GB has one gibibyte GiB of storage capacity br In response to litigation over whether the makers of electronic storage devices must conform to Microsoft Windows use of a binary definition of GB instead of the metric decimal definition the United States District Court for the Northern District of California rejected that argument ruling that the U S Congress has deemed the decimal definition of gigabyte to be the preferred one for the purposes of U S trade and commerce br br br Definition br The term gigabyte has a standard definition of bytes as well as a discouraged meaning of bytes The latter binary usage originated as compromise technical jargon for byte multiples that needed to be expressed in a power of but lacked a convenient name As is approximately roughly corresponding to SI multiples it was used for binary multiples as well br In the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC published standards for binary prefixes requiring that the gigabyte strictly denote bytes and gibibyte denote bytes By the end of the IEC Standard had been adopted by the IEEE EU and NIST and in it was incorporated in the International System of Quantities Nevertheless the term gigabyte continues to be widely used with the following two different meanings br br br Base decimal br GB bytes B B br Based on powers of this definition uses the prefix giga as defined in the International System of Units SI This is the recommended definition by the International Electrotechnical Commission IEC This definition is used in networking contexts and most storage media particularly hard drives flash based storage and DVDs and is also consistent with the other uses of the SI prefix in computing such as CPU clock speeds or measures of performance The file manager of Mac OS X version and later versions are a notable example of this usage in software which report files sizes in decimal units br br br Base binary br GiB bytes B B br The binary definition uses powers of the base as does the architectural principle of binary computers br This usage is widely promulgated by some operating systems such as Microsoft Windows in reference to computer memory e g RAM This definition is synonymous with the unambiguous unit gibibyte br br br Consumer confusion br Since the first disk drive the IBM disk drive manufacturers expressed hard drive capacities using decimal prefixes With the advent of gigabyte range drive capacities manufacturers labelled many consumer hard drive solid state drive and USB flash drive capacities in certain size classes expressed in decimal gigabytes such as GB The exact capacity of a given drive model is usually slightly larger than the class designation Practically all manufacturers of hard disk drives and flash memory disk devices continue to define one gigabyte as bytes which is displayed on the packaging Some operating systems such as Mac OS X and Ubuntu and Debian express hard drive capacity or file size using decimal multipliers while others such as Microsoft Windows report size using binary multipliers This discrepancy causes confusion as a disk with an advertised capacity of for example GB meaning bytes equal to GiB might be reported by the operating system as GB br For RAM the JEDEC memory standards use IEEE nomenclature which quote the gigabyte as bytes bytes br The difference between units based on decimal and binary prefixes increases as a semi logarithmic linear log function for example the decimal kilobyte value is nearly of the kibibyte a megabyte is under of a mebibyte and a gigabyte is just over of a gibibyte value This means that a GB GiB hard disk might be indicated variously as GB GB or GiB depending on the operating system As storage sizes increase and larger units are used these differences become more pronounced br br br US lawsuits br A lawsuit decided in that arose from alleged breach of contract and other claims over the binary and decimal definitions used for gigabyte have ended in favour of the manufacturers with courts holding that the legal definition of gigabyte or GB is GB bytes the decimal definition Specifically the courts held that the U S Congress has deemed the decimal definition of gigabyte to be the preferred one for the purposes of U S trade and commerce The California Legislature has likewise adopted the decimal system for all transactions in this state br Earlier lawsuits had ended in settlement with no court ruling on the question such as a lawsuit against drive manufacturer Western Digital Western Digital settled the challenge and added explicit disclaimers to products that the usable capacity may differ from the advertised capacity br Seagate was sued on similar grounds and also settled br br br Other contexts br Because of their physical design the capacity of modern computer random access memory devices such as DIMM modules is always a multiple of a power of It is thus convenient to use prefixes denoting powers of known as binary prefixes in describing them For example a memory capacity of bytes B is conveniently expressed as GiB rather than as GB The former specification is however often quoted as GB when applied to random access memory br Software allocates memory in varying degrees of granularity as needed to fulfill data structure requirements and binary multiples are usually not required Other computer capacities and rates like storage hardware size data transfer rates clock speeds operations per second etc do not depend on an inherent base and are usually presented in decimal units For example the manufacturer of a GB hard drive is claiming a capacity of bytes not which would be bytes br br br Examples of gigabyte sized storage br One hour of SDTV video at Mbit s is approximately GB br Seven minutes of HDTV video at Mbit s is approximately GB br minutes of uncompressed CD quality audio at Mbit s is approximately GB br A single layer DVD R disc can hold about GB br A dual layered DVD R disc can hold about GB br A single layer Blu ray can hold about GB br The largest Nintendo Switch cartridge available on the market holds about GB br A dual layered Blu ray can hold about GB br A triple layered Ultra HD Blu ray can
