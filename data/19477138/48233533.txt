apps in August Dropbox Paper was officially released on January br br br Reception br In a comparison between Dropbox Paper and Evernote PC World s Michael Ansaldo wrote that With its emphasis on document creation you might expect formatting to be front and center in Dropbox Paper That s not the case Ansaldo noted the lack of a fixed formatting toolbar as you d find in Evernote or a word processor like Google Docs or Microsoft Word Instead the text editor appears as a floating ribbon only when you highlight selected text The only formatting options available for emphasis were bolding strikethrough bulleted and numbered lists and H and H tags Users can also add links convert text to checklists and add comments Ansaldo wrote that Both Evernote and Dropbox Paper make it easy to add images to a document but also noted that Dropbox Paper doesn t support any image editing Paper supports rich media and users can add rich content to your document just by pasting a link to the file In addition to Dropbox Paper supports media from a variety of popular services including YouTube Spotify Vimeo SoundCloud Facebook and Google s productivity suite Once the file appears you can delete the link for a cleaner display To start working with other people Paper allows you to invite people via email from within a document with sharing options for who can view the link anyone with the link or just the invited person and action permissions edit or only comment Regarding collaboration Ansaldo wrote that Creative collaboration is Paper s marquee feature and it provides a variety of ways to work effectively with others in real time Users can make any content immediately visible and accessible to a specific collaborator with mentions and You can also use mentions to create and assign task lists within a document Paper also boasts essential collaboration tools including comments editing attribution and revision history br Writing for TechRadar John Brandon wrote that Dropbox Paper might be a light tool for now without the extensive templates of Microsoft Office or the integration with other apps in the Zoho suite but it does work well with the Dropbox storage service that s so popular with office workers these days br Kyle Wiggers of Digital Trends wrote that Paper is all about minimizing distractions Its interface is quite literally a big blank canvas on which you tap out your agenda You can organize notes by title and create to do lists but even basic formatting tools are obscured from view noting Paper s floating box above words and phrases highlighted by your cursor Wiggers stated that Paper is not a to do organizer but that it s well suited to the purpose thanks to a bevy of labor saving conveniences highlighting that Paper supports more media than most of its to do and note taking counterparts He praised the collaboration tools writing that they are as extensive as you d hope and then some citing its invitation system with permission controls lists of changes and revision history comment and chat support and perhaps best of all the ability to assign tasks with a mention br Business Insider s Alex Heath praised that Paper s interface is spotless and friendly to write in You don t feel overwhelmed with formatting options but criticized the available features writing that Google Docs is much more full featured in the formatting department so Paper has some catching up to do if it wants to be on par with the competition Writing for The Verge Casey Newton praised Paper s handling of rich media complimenting it for being great and added that I imagine that creative types who work on teams will appreciate having rich media embedded in the documents they re working on rather than in a series of infinite tabs br br br
