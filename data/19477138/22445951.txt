The SheevaPlug is a plug computer designed to allow standard computing features in as small a space as possible It was a small embedded Linux ARM computer without a display which can be considered an early predecessor to the subsequent Raspberry Pi br As one of the first such computers on the market the device has a GHz Marvell Kirkwood ARM compatible CPU a k a Feroceon It is sold with Ubuntu Linux version pre installed A software development kit for the platform is also available br br br Commercial products br The following commercial products are known to be based on the SheevaPlug platform br br BarracudaDrive is a free Cloud Server for the SheevaPlug br CTERA CloudPlug by CTERA Networks a plug computer providing remote backup service at local disk speeds and overlays a file sharing service br TonidoPlug from CodeLathe a SheevaPlug based device that runs Tonido home server and NAS software and allows users to access share and sync files and media br Pogoplug by Cloud Engines a device that lets users access their files at home over the Internet without leaving a PC on br Seagate FreeAgent DockStar and Black Armor NAS both a variant of the Pogoplug br GuruPlug a SheevaPlug with additional connectivity options br DreamPlug similar to a GuruPlug br The PylonPlug by Equelex A one interface OpenWrt device that when used in conjunction with a VLAN IEEE Q capable network switch can be used as a Multi WAN network router Its operating system is OpenWrt Linux br The sipJack from pbxnsip is a Sheeva kit based plug computer and provides Voice over IP services and PBX features br The WeatherHub by Ambient Weather a server that collects data from a weather station and uploads data to Web pages or other Internet services br The GeNiJack by NETCOR An endpoint for end to end network performance assessment br BACnet Gateway by Kara Systems a M Bus Modbus and OneWire gateway which represents a BACNet Device br Pwnie Express is a Computer Security tool br AvaGigE by Avantes USB to Ethernet converter which supports the connection of Avantes spectrometers to an Ethernet network br Evercube a do it yourself home server designed for quiet continuous operation in the living room br Lockitron server for remote operation of locks with key management Control server based on the SheevaPlug br Iomega iConnect a wireless diskless NAS br ZigBee Gateway ZBG from pikkerton br Pwn Plug by Pwnie Express br br br Other operating system ports and stacks br FreedomBox for secured encrypted and fully decentralized networking based on Debian br Debian has official support for the SheevaPlug and other plug computers such as the GuruPlug br Mark Gillespie has created scripts to build and install Debian Lenny and Squeeze onto either the internal NAND or SD card br An ARM port of Fedora exists that can be installed on the SheevaPlug br Ra l Porcel has managed to run Gentoo on the plug and published an instruction on how to do so br Stuart Winter has a working Slackware port This is the official port of Slackware version to ARM Slackware for ARM now officially supports SheevaPlug br Inferno boots on the SheevaPlug br Plan supports SheevaPlug and other Kirkwood based systems in its official distribution br SheevaPlug is supported on NetBSD and FreeBSD or newer br OpenWrt supported br NixOS SVN trunk supports the SheevaPlug since the last quarter of br Plugbox Linux is an Arch Linux port for SheevaPlug and other plug devices br Amahi is a home file server which has recently been ported to the SheevaPlug and other plug computing devices br Arch Linux ARM ArchLinux for plug computer devices ARMv ARMv ARMv br Pathagar Book Server SheevaPlug Edition is an Open Publication Distribution System OPDS based Book Server running on top of Debian Squeeze br RedSleeve A distribution derived from RHEL ported to ARM ARMv ARMv ARMv br br br Variants and modifications br A version with an eSATA port for connecting a serial ATA hard disk is also available and sometimes referred to as SheevaPlug Revision of the SheevaPlug can be extended by one ESATA port but soldering is required and will void the warranty br Marvell offers a development kit to assist in the development of software for the platform The kit includes the GCC cross compiler for ARM The device includes a mini USB connector wired to an FTDI FT chip which provides the developer s computer with access to two ports a JTAG port connected to the internal JTAG bus and an RS port connected to the Kirkwood processor s serial port through which the bootstrap and kernel console can be accessed This debug console can be accessed from any computer with support for the FTDI bus translator FreeBSD Linux Mac OS X Windows br br br br br br External links br br A Note On Setting Up the SheevaPlug Linux Embedded Computer Off Grid
