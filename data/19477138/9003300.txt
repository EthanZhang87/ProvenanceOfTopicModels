Illumina Inc is an American biotechnology company headquartered in San Diego California Incorporated on April Illumina develops manufactures and markets integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and biological function The company provides a line of products and services that serves the sequencing genotyping and gene expression and proteomics markets and serves more than countries br Illumina s customers include genomic research centers pharmaceutical companies academic institutions clinical research organizations and biotechnology companies br br br History br br Illumina was founded in April by David Walt Larry Bock John Stuelpnagel Anthony Czarnik and Mark Chee While working with CW Group a venture capital firm Bock and Stuelpnagel uncovered what would become Illumina s BeadArray technology at Tufts University and negotiated an exclusive license to that technology In Illumina acquired Spyder Instruments founded by Michal Lebl Richard Houghten and Jutta Eichler for their technology of high throughput synthesis of oligonucleotides Illumina completed its initial public offering in July br Illumina began offering single nucleotide polymorphism SNP genotyping services in and launched its first system the Illumina BeadLab in using GoldenGate Genotyping technology Illumina currently offers microarray based products and services for an expanding range of genetic analysis sequencing including SNP genotyping gene expression and protein analysis Illumina s technologies are used by a broad range of academic government pharmaceutical biotechnology and other leading institutions around the globe br On January the company completed the acquisition of the British company Solexa Inc for M Solexa was founded in June by Shankar Balasubramanian and David Klenerman to develop and commercialize genome sequencing technology invented by the founders at the University of Cambridge Solexa Inc was formed in when Solexa Ltd reversed into Lynx Therapeutics of Hayward br Illumina also uses the DNA colony sequencing technology invented in by Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli and which was acquired by Solexa in from Manteia Predictive Medicine It is being used to perform a range of analyses including whole genome resequencing gene expression analysis and small ribonucleic acid sRNA analysis br In June Illumina announced the launch of their own Personal Full Genome Sequencing Service at a depth of X br Until Illumina sold only instruments that were labeled for research use only in early Illumina obtained FDA approval for its BeadXpress system to be used in clinical tests This was part of the company s strategy at the time to open its own CLIA lab and begin offering clinical genetic testing itself br Illumina acquired Epicentre Biotechnologies based in Madison Wisconsin on January On January Hoffmann La Roche made an unsolicited bid to buy Illumina for per share or about billion Roche tried other tactics including raising its offer to for about billion Illumina rejected the offer and Roche abandoned the offer in April br In the company announced a multimillion dollar product HiSeq X Ten In January Illumina already held of the market for genome sequencing machines Illumina machines accounted for more than of all DNA data produced In the company invested in the acquisition of the pre commercial firm Enancio which had developed a DNA data compression algorithm specifically targeting Illumina data capable of reducing storage footprint by e g GB compressed to GB br On July Jay Flatley who had been CEO since assumed the role of executive chairman of the board of directors Francis deSouza who had been president of the company since took on the additional role of CEO br In late Illumina spun off the company Grail focused on blood testing for cancer tumors in the bloodstream In Grail had planned to raise billion in its second round of financing and received funding from Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos investing million in series A funding and with Illumina maintaining a holding share in Grail Grail is working with a blood test trial with over women during scheduled mammogram visits in the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin as well as a partnership with the Mayo Clinic Grail uses Illumina sequencing technology for tests Grail planned to roll out the tests by In September Illumina announced a proposed cash and stock deal to acquire Grail for billion br In November Illumina proposed the acquisition of Pacific Biosciences for per share or around billion in total In December the Federal Trade Commission FTC sued to block the acquisition The proposed deal was abandoned on January with Illumina paying Pacific a million termination fee br In March the FTC sued to block Illumina s billion vertical merger with Grail In July the European Commission opened an in depth investigation into the Grail acquisition by Illumina Against the orders of active investigations by both the US FTC and the EU European Commission Illumina publicly announced it had completed its acquisition of Grail on August The FTC urged Illumina to unwind the merger shortly after and in October the European Commission ordered Illumina to keep Grail a separate company and adopted interim measures to prevent harm to competition or face penalty payments up to of their average daily turnover and or fines up to of their annual worldwide turnover under Articles and of the EU Merger Regulation respectively In September a US administrative judge ruled against the FTC s efforts to prevent the acquisition on antitrust grounds In April the FTC ordered Grail to be divested by Illumina In July the European Commission imposed a million million penalty on Illumina for closing the Grail acquisition without EU approval br In September Illumina launched NovaSeq X and NovaSeq X Plus The NovaSeq X Plus can sequence genomes per year compared to per year of Illumina s previous machines and generate up to Tb of data per run The series includes redeveloped reagents dyes and polymerases which can be shipped at ambient temperature br In June deSouza resigned as CEO of Illumina and was replaced by interim CEO Charles Dadswell the company s general counsel Also in June Hologic CEO Stephen Macmillan was named non executive Chairman of the Board of Directors br In September Agilent Technologies senior vice president Jacob Thaysen was appointed CEO br In October the European Commission ordered Grail to be divested from Illumina within the next twelve months Illumina said it would explore a third party sale or a capital markets transaction if it fails to win its ongoing challenge in court br br br Acquisition history br The following is an illustration of the company s mergers acquisitions spin offs and historical predecessors br br br Products br br br DNA sequencing br br Illumina sells a number of high throughput DNA sequencing systems also known as DNA sequencers based on technology developed by Solexa The technology features bridge amplification to generate clusters and reversible terminators for sequence determination The technology behind these sequencing systems involves ligation of fragmented DNA to a chip followed by primer addition and sequential fluorescent dNTP incorporation and detection br Depending on the kit used according to the company the MiSeq Series generates up to million reads per run With dual flow cells the NextSeq generates up to billion single reads per run and the NovaSeq X Series generates up to billion single reads per run Illumina uses next generation sequencing which is far faster and more efficient than traditional Sanger sequencing Illumina sequencers perform short read sequencing and are image based utilizing Illumina dye sequencing This technology has a higher accuracy than long read sequencing br br br Flow cells br br Illumina sequencing happens within the flow cells These flow cells are small in size and are housed in the flow cell compartment Flow cell clustering happens when a denatured DNA sample is placed in a flow cell Primers already in the flow cell channel capture and bind to the ends of the short denatured DNA sample Then DNA polymerase is added and the DNA building blocks are introduced This results in a newly synthesized strand constrained to the bottom of the flow cell Next the original template strand is washed out binding the newly synthesized strand to the other DNA sequence present on the surface DNA polymerase and building blocks are introduced again forming a new strand These steps are repeated until about copies are made in a cluster br br br Litigation br br br Czarnik suit against Illumina br In co founder and former Chief Scientific Officer Anthony Czarnik sued Illumina In the case Czarnik v Illumina Inc the trial court granted Illumina s motion to dismiss in part but allowed Czarnik s correction of inventorship claims to continue br br br Cornell University and Life Technologies suit against Illumina br In Cornell University and Life Technologies filed a lawsuit against Illumina alleging that its microarray products infringed on eight patents held by the university and exclusively licensed to the start up The case was settled in April without any finding of fault In September both parties asked to have the settlement reviewed with Cornell accusing both Illumina and Life Technologies of misrepresentation and fraud Cornell claimed that ThermoFisher had promised to settle the suit with Illumina and asked for the Markman wording to be dropped so that it could file a subsequent suit involving other patents invented at Cornell Instead of filing the suit ThermoFisher and Illumina settled another lawsuit in California and secretly sublicensed those very same patents In Dr Monib Zirvi filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Illumina and some of its key employees claiming that they knowingly incorporated ideas and ZipCode DNA sequences invented in the Barany Lab in Illumina s patent applications Although this suit was dismissed it was only after Illumina and its attorneys claimed that some of those IP misappropriation were storm warnings and thus statutes of limitations had run out on those particular claims Dr Monib Zirvi also filed a FOIA case in New Jersey in for unredacted copies for key NIH grants that Illumina filed early in its existence William Noon an in house attorney at Illumina had filed a FOIA request for of these key grants as well in January br br br Patent infringement suits br Illumina was a party in a patent lawsuit against competitor Ariosa Diagnostics The litigation began in with Verinata Health filing suit against Ariosa Illumina joined the suit after acquiring Verinata in Ariosa subsequently brought a counterclaim against Illumina The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Ariosa but the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed Ariosa initially pursued an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States but the two parties resolved the dispute before the Court decided whether to take the case br In February Illumina filed a lawsuit against Oxford Nanopore Technologies Illumina claimed that Oxford Nanopore infringed its patents on the use of a biological nanopore Mycobacterium smegmatis porinA MspA for sequencing systems In August the parties settled their lawsuit br In February Illumina filed a patent infringement suit against BGI relating to its CoolMPS sequencing products In return BGI has filed patent infringement lawsuits for violation of federal antitrust and California unfair competition laws claiming use of fraudulent behavior to obtain or enforce sequencing patents that it has asserted against BGI preventing the firm from entering the US market However in May Illumina was ordered to pay million to a U S unit of BGI in California for infringing two patents of DNA sequencing systems The jury of the case also said that Illumina willfully infringed the patents and that their former accusation of BGI s infringement was invalid br On May a jury in the U S District Court for the District of Delaware rendered a verdict that Illumina willfully infringed two patents owned by Complete Genomics and awarded approximately million to CGI in past damages The jury also invalidated three patents owned by Illumina br br br Trade secrets suit against Eltoukhy and Talasaz br In March Illumina sued Helmy Eltoukhy and Amir Talasaz the co founders of Guardant over stealing trade secrets Guardant called the lawsuit frivolous and retaliatory and framed it as a response to its concerns about the Illumina Grail merger Guardant also claimed the lawsuit was filed in order to suppress competition in the marketplace br br br br br
