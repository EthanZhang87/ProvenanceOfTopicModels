Congress of the Confederation of the United States of America used the term to refer to governors and other leaders of the executive branches of each of the Thirteen Colonies In draft additions to the Oxford English Dictionary published online in the Dictionary says that the use of CEO as an acronym for a chief executive officer originated in Australia with the first attestation being in The first American usage cited is from br br br Responsibilities br The responsibilities of an organization s CEO are set by the organization s board of directors or other authority depending on the organization s structure They can be far reaching or quite limited and are typically enshrined in a formal delegation of authority regarding business administration Typically responsibilities include being an active decision maker on business strategy and other key policy issues as well as leader manager and executor roles The communicator role can involve speaking to the press and to the public as well as to the organization s management and employees the decision making role involves high level decisions about policy and strategy The CEO is tasked with implementing the goals targets and strategic objectives as determined by the board of directors br As an executive officer of the company the CEO reports the status of the business to the board of directors motivates employees and drives change within the organization As a manager the CEO presides over the organization s day to day operations The CEO is the person who is ultimately accountable for a company s business decisions including those in operations marketing business development finance human resources etc br The use of the CEO title is not necessarily limited to describing the head of a company For example the CEO of a political party is often entrusted with fundraising particularly for election campaigns br br br International use br In some countries there is a dual board system with two separate boards one executive board for the day to day business and one supervisory board for control purposes selected by the shareholders In these countries the CEO presides over the executive board and the chairperson presides over the supervisory board and these two roles will always be held by different people This ensures a distinction between management by the executive board and governance by the supervisory board This allows for clear lines of authority The aim is to prevent a conflict of interest and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person br In the United States the board of directors elected by the shareholders is often equivalent to the supervisory board while the executive board may often be known as the executive committee the division subsidiary heads and C level officers that report directly to the CEO br In the United States and in business the executive officers are usually the top officers of a corporation the chief executive officer CEO being the best known type The definition varies for instance the California Corporate Disclosure Act defines executive officers as the five most highly compensated officers not also sitting on the board of directors In the case of a sole proprietorship an executive officer is the sole proprietor In the case of a partnership an executive officer is a managing partner senior partner or administrative partner In the case of a limited liability company an executive officer is any member manager or officer br br br Related positions br br Depending on the organization a CEO may have several subordinate executives to help run the day to day administration of the company each of whom has specific functional responsibilities referred to as senior executives executive officers or corporate officers Subordinate executives are given different titles in different organizations but one common category of subordinate executive if the CEO is also the president is the vice president VP An organization may have more than one vice president each tasked with a different area of responsibility e g VP of finance VP of human resources Examples of subordinate executive officers who typically report to the CEO include the chief operating officer COO chief financial officer CFO chief strategy officer CSO chief marketing officer CMO and chief business officer CBO The public relations focused position of chief reputation officer is sometimes included as one such subordinate executive officer but as suggested by Anthony Johndrow CEO of Reputation Economy Advisors it can also be seen as simply another way to add emphasis to the role of a modern day CEO where they are both the external face of and the driving force behind an organization culture br br br United States br In the US the term chief executive officer is used primarily in business whereas the term executive director is used primarily in the not for profit sector These terms are generally mutually exclusive and refer to distinct legal duties and responsibilities The CEO is the highest ranking executive in a company making corporate decisions managing operations allocating resources and serving as the main point of communication between the board of directors and the company br br br United Kingdom br In the UK chief executive and chief executive officer are used in local government where their position in law is described as the head of paid service and in business and in the charitable sector As of the use of the term director for senior charity staff is deprecated to avoid confusion with the legal duties and responsibilities associated with being a charity director or trustee which are normally non executive unpaid roles The term managing director is often used in lieu of chief executive officer br br br Celebrity CEOs br Business publicists since the days of Edward Bernays and his client John D Rockefeller and even more successfully the corporate publicists for Henry Ford promoted the concept of the celebrity CEO Business journalists have often adopted this approach which assumes that the corporate achievements especially in the arena of manufacturing are produced by uniquely talented individuals especially the heroic CEO In effect journalists celebrate a CEO who takes distinctive strategic actions The model is the celebrity in entertainment sports and politics compare the great man theory Guthey et al argues that these individuals are not self made but rather are created by a process of widespread media exposure to the point that their actions personalities and even private lives function symbolically to represent significant dynamics and tensions prevalent in the contemporary business atmosphere Journalism thereby exaggerates the importance of the CEO and tends to neglect harder to describe broader corporate factors There is little attention to the intricately organized technical bureaucracy that actually does the work Hubris sets in when the CEO internalizes the celebrity and becomes excessively self confident in making complex decisions There may be an emphasis on the sort of decisions that attract the celebrity journalists br Research published in by Ulrike Malmendier and Geoffrey Tate indicates that firms with award winning CEOs subsequently underperform in terms both of stock and of operating performance br br br Criticism br br br Executive compensation br br Executive compensation has been a source of criticism following a dramatic rise in pay relative to the average worker s wage For example the relative pay was to in in the US but had risen to to by The relative pay differs around the world and in some smaller countries is still around to Observers differ as to whether the rise is due to competition for talent or due to lack of control by compensation committees In recent years investors have demanded more say over executive pay br br br Diversity br br Lack of diversity amongst chief executives has also been a source of criticism In of Fortune CEOs were women In the number rose to of for Women CEO s of Fortune companies The reasons for this are explained or justified in various ways and may include biological sex differences male and female differences in Big Five personality traits and temperament sex differences in psychology and interests maternity and career breaks hypergamy phallogocentrism the existence of old boy networks tradition and the lack of female role models in that regard Some countries have passed laws mandating boardroom gender quotas In Rockefeller Foundation awarded a grant to Korn Ferry to research strategies and then action a plan to help more women to become CEO s br br br Toxic executives br There are contentious claims that a significant number of CEO s have psychopathic tendencies often characterized by power seeking behavior and dominance These individuals can often conceal their ruthlessness and antisocial behavior behind a facade of charm and eloquence Traits such as courage and risk taking generally considered desirable are often found alongside these psychopathic tendencies br Tara Swart a neuroscientist at MIT Sloan School of Management has suggested that individuals with psychopathic traits thrive in chaotic environments and are aware that others do not As a result they may intentionally create chaos in the workplace This perspective is explored in the book Snakes in Suits co authored by Robert D Hare br However Scott Lilienfeld has argued that the attention given to psychopathy in the workplace by both the media and scholars has far exceeded the available scientific evidence Emilia Bunea writing in Psychology Today has linked psychopathic traits in managers to workplace bullying employee dissatisfaction and turnover intentions Despite this Bunea cautions that excessive worry about supposed psychopathic managers could discourage individuals from pursuing careers in corporations and deter employees from addressing issues with difficult bosses br In a related development British politician Andy McDonald received praise for educating a CEO on the role of trade unions This occurred as the restaurant chain McDonald s faced scrutiny in the UK Parliament over allegations of a toxic workplace culture br br br See also br CEO succession br CEO of public schools br City manager br Executive officer br Glass cliff br List of
