differentiation in the highly competitive fast food market This situation would turn around in the mid s Starting on January elderly actress Clara Peller was featured in the successful Where s the beef North American commercial campaign written by Cliff Freeman Her famous line quickly entered the American pop culture it was even used by Walter Mondale in a debate with Gary Hart in the Democratic primary election and served to promote Wendy s hamburgers Peller age was dropped from the campaign in because she performed in a commercial for Prego spaghetti sauce saying I found it I really found it a phrase alluding to the beef in the listener s mind br Peller was soon after replaced by Wendy s founder Dave Thomas himself Soft spoken and bashful the Dave ads generally focused on Thomas praising his products and offering a commitment to quality service although there would occasionally be wackier ads as well Thomas ultimately appeared in more than commercials more than any other company founder in television history br After Dave Thomas death in Wendy s struggled to find a new advertising campaign After a round of conventional ads describing the food they serve in they tried using a character they made called Mr Wendy who claimed to be the unofficial spokesperson for the chain These proved to be extremely unsuccessful After seven months Wendy s returned to an

is sometimes seen on ABC s reality show Extreme Makeover Home Edition serving food to the more than construction workers br A Wendy s commercial featured the tune from the Violent Femmes song Blister

Wendy s pulled the television commercials created by Dick Rich Inc The nibble spots were meant to emphasize Wendy s better tasting hamburger They showed customers ripping off chunks of meat from an

advocates of the Fair Food Program FFP in the US due to corporate refusal to join the agricultural worker protection partnership established in br In the Coalition of Immokalee Workers began a US wide boycott of Wendy s to pressure the company to join the FFP supported by the Student Farmworker Alliance A key component of the predecessors to the FFP was commitment by buyers of agricultural products like tomatoes to pay growers a small amount more such as one penny per pound to be passed on to their field workers The FFP provides protections against exploitation to agricultural workers br In response Wendy s reported that it began to purchase tomatoes in solely from growers who use hydroponics and greenhouses to cultivate tomatoes subject to Wendy s corporate code of conduct for its
