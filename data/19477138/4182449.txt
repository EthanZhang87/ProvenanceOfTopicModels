id: 4182449
A tablet computer commonly shortened to tablet is a mobile device typically with a mobile operating system and touchscreen display processing circuitry and a rechargeable battery in a single thin and flat package Tablets being computers have similar capabilities but lack some input output I O abilities that others have Modern tablets largely resemble modern smartphones the only differences being that tablets are relatively larger than smartphones with screens inches cm or larger measured diagonally and may not support access to a cellular network Unlike laptops which have traditionally run off operating systems usually designed for desktops tablets usually run mobile operating systems alongside smartphones br The touchscreen display is operated by gestures executed by finger or digital pen stylus instead of the mouse touchpad and keyboard of larger computers Portable computers can be classified according to the presence and appearance of physical keyboards Two species of tablet the slate and booklet do not have physical keyboards and usually accept text and other input by use of a virtual keyboard shown on their touchscreen displays To compensate for their lack of a physical keyboard most tablets can connect to independent physical keyboards by Bluetooth or USB in PCs have keyboards distinct from tablets br The form of the tablet was conceptualized in the middle of the th century Stanley Kubrick depicted fictional tablets in the science fiction film A Space Odyssey and prototyped and developed in the last two decades of that century In Apple released the iPad the first mass market tablet to achieve widespread popularity Thereafter tablets rapidly rose in ubiquity and soon became a large product category used for personal educational and workplace applications Popular uses for a tablet PC include viewing presentations video conferencing reading e books watching movies sharing photos and more As of there are billion tablet users worldwide according to data provided by Statista while Apple holds the largest manufacturer market share followed by Samsung and Lenovo br br br History br br The tablet computer and its associated operating system began with the development of pen computing Electrical devices with data input and output on a flat information display existed as early as with the telautograph which used a sheet of paper as display and a pen attached to electromechanical actuators Throughout the th century devices with these characteristics have been imagined and created whether as blueprints prototypes or commercial products In addition to many academic and research systems several companies released commercial products in the s with various input output types tried out br br br Fictional and prototype tablets br Tablet computers appeared in a number of works of science fiction in the second half of the th century all helped to promote and disseminate the concept to a wider audience Examples include br br Isaac Asimov described a Calculator Pad in his novel Foundation br Stanis aw Lem described the Opton in his novel Return from the Stars br Numerous similar devices were depicted in Gene Roddenberry s Star Trek The Original Series br Dr Who The Dominators Educator Balan holds a tablet which he hold and inputs data into using swipe gestures br Arthur C Clarke s newspad was depicted in Stanley Kubrick s film A Space Odyssey br Douglas Adams described a tablet computer in The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy and the associated comedy of the same name br The science fiction TV series Star Trek The Next Generation featured tablet computers which were designated as PADDs notable for as with most computers in the show using a touchscreen interface both with and without a stylus br A device more powerful than today s tablets appeared briefly in The Mote in God s Eye br The Star Wars franchise features datapads first described in print in the novel Heir to the Empire and depicted on screen in the feature film Star Wars Episode I The Phantom Menace br Further real life projects either proposed or created tablet computers such as br br In computer scientist Alan Kay envisioned a KiddiComp he developed and described the concept as a Dynabook in his proposal A personal computer for children of all ages which outlines functionality similar to that supplied via a laptop computer or in some of its other incarnations a tablet or slate computer with the exception of near eternal battery life The target audience was children br In the idea of a touchscreen tablet that could detect an external force applied to one point on the screen was patented in Japan by a team at Hitachi consisting of Masao Hotta Yoshikazu Miyamoto Norio Yokozawa and Yoshimitsu Oshima who later received a US patent for their idea br In Atari showed developers the Stylus later renamed ST Pad The ST Pad was based on the TOS GEM Atari ST platform and prototyped early handwriting recognition Shiraz Shivji s company Momentus demonstrated in the same time a failed x MS DOS based Pen Computer with its own graphical user interface GUI br In the European Union initiated the NewsPad project inspired by Clarke and Kubrick s fictional work Acorn Computers developed and delivered an ARM based touch screen tablet computer for this program branding it the NewsPad the project ended in br During the November COMDEX Microsoft used the term Tablet PC to describe a prototype handheld device they were demonstrating br In Ericsson Mobile Communications announced an experimental product named the DelphiPad which was developed in cooperation with the Centre for Wireless Communications in Singapore with a touch sensitive screen Netscape Navigator as a web browser and Linux as its operating system br br br Early tablets br br Following earlier tablet computer products such as the Pencept PenPad and the CIC Handwriter in September GRiD Systems released the first commercially successful tablet computer the GRiDPad All three products were based on extended versions of the MS DOS operating system In IBM announced in April and shipped to developers in October the ThinkPad T which ran the GO Corporation s PenPoint OS Also based on PenPoint was AT T s EO Personal Communicator from which ran on AT T s own hardware including their own AT T Hobbit CPU Apple Computer launched the Apple Newton personal digital assistant in It used Apple s own new Newton OS initially running on hardware manufactured by Motorola and incorporating an ARM CPU that Apple had specifically co developed with Acorn Computers The operating system and platform design were later licensed to Sharp and Digital Ocean who went on to manufacture their own variants br Pen computing was highly hyped by the media during the early s Microsoft the dominant PC software vendor released Windows for Pen Computing in to compete against PenPoint OS The company launched the WinPad project working together with OEMs such as Compaq to create a small device with a Windows like operating system and handwriting recognition However the project was abandoned two years later instead Windows CE was released in the form of Handheld PCs in That year Palm Inc released the first of the Palm OS based PalmPilot touch and stylus based PDA the touch based devices initially incorporating a Motorola Dragonball CPU Also in Fujitsu released the Stylistic tablet format PC running Microsoft Windows on a MHz AMD DX CPU with MB RAM offering stylus input with the option of connecting a conventional Keyboard and mouse Intel announced a StrongARM processor based touchscreen tablet computer in under the name WebPAD It was later re branded as the Intel Web Tablet In Norwegian company Screen Media AS and the German company Dosch Amand Gmbh released the FreePad It was based on Linux and used the Opera browser Internet access was provided by DECT DMAP only available in Europe and provided up to Mbit s The device had MB storage MB of RAM and x compatible MHz Geode Microcontroller by National Semiconductor The screen was or and was touch sensitive It had slots for SIM cards to enable support of television set up box FreePad were sold in Norway and the Middle East but the company was dissolved in Sony released its Airboard tablet in Japan in late with full wireless Internet capabilities br br In the late s Microsoft launched the Handheld PC platform using their Windows CE operating system while most devices were not tablets a few touch enabled tablets were released on the platform such as the Fujitsu PenCentra or Siemens s SIMpad Microsoft took a more significant approach to tablets in as it attempted to define the Microsoft Tablet PC as a mobile computer for field work in business though their devices failed mainly due to pricing and usability decisions that limited them to their original purpose such as the existing devices being too heavy to be held with one hand for extended periods and having legacy applications created for desktop interfaces and not well adapted to the slate format br br Nokia had plans for an Internet tablet since before An early model was test manufactured in the Nokia M which was running on EPOC and featuring an Opera browser speakers and a inch screen but it was not released because of fears that the market was not ready for it Nokia entered the tablet space in May with the Nokia running Maemo a Debian based Linux distribution custom made for their Internet tablet line The user interface and application framework layer named Hildon was an early instance of a software platform for generic computing in a tablet device intended for internet consumption But Nokia did not commit to it as their only platform for their future mobile devices and the project competed against other in house platforms and later replaced it with the Series Nokia used the term internet tablet to refer to a portable information appliance that focused on Internet use and media consumption in the range between a personal digital assistant PDA and an Ultra Mobile PC UMPC They made two mobile phones the N that runs Maemo and N that run Meego br Before the release of iPad Axiotron introduced an aftermarket heavily modified Apple MacBook called Modbook a Mac OS X based tablet computer The Modbook uses Apple s Inkwell for handwriting and gesture recognition and uses digitization hardware from Wacom To get Mac OS X to talk to the digitizer on the integrated tablet the Modbook was supplied with a third party driver br Following the launch of the Ultra mobile PC Intel began the Mobile Internet Device initiative which took the same hardware and combined it with a tabletized Linux configuration Intel codeveloped the lightweight Moblin mobile Linux operating system following the successful launch of the Atom CPU series on netbooks In Nokia and Intel combined the Maemo and Moblin projects to form MeeGo a Linux based operating system supports netbooks and tablets The first tablet using MeeGo was the Neofonie WeTab launched September in Germany The WeTab used an extended version of the MeeGo operating system called WeTab OS WeTab OS adds runtimes for Android and Adobe AIR and provides a proprietary user interface optimized for the WeTab device On September the Linux Foundation announced that MeeGo would be replaced in by Tizen br br br Modern tablets br br Android was the first of the s era dominating platforms for tablet computers to reach the market In the first plans for Android based tablets appeared The first products were released in Among them was the Archos a pocket sized model with a inch touchscreen that was first released with a proprietary operating system and later in released with Android The Camangi WebStation was released in Q The first LTE Android tablet appeared late and was made by ICD for Verizon This unit was called the Ultra but a version called Vega was released around the same time Ultra had a inch display while Vega s was inches Many more products followed in Several manufacturers waited for Android Honeycomb specifically adapted for use with tablets which debuted in February br Apple is often credited for defining a new class of consumer device with the iPad which shaped the commercial market for tablets in the following years and was the most successful tablet at the time of its release iPads and competing devices were tested by the US military in and cleared for secure use in Its debut in pushed tablets into the mainstream Samsung s Galaxy Tab and others followed continuing the trends towards the features listed above In March PC Magazine reported that of U S Internet users owned a tablet used mainly for viewing published content such as video and news The top selling line of devices was Apple s iPad with million sold between its release in April and mid October but iPad market share number of units dropped to in with Android tablets climbing to Android tablet sales volume was million devices plus million between and respectively Individual brands of Android operating system devices or compatibles follow iPad with Amazon s Kindle Fire with million and Barnes Noble s Nook with million br The BlackBerry PlayBook was announced in September that ran the BlackBerry Tablet OS The BlackBerry PlayBook was officially released to US and Canadian consumers on April Hewlett Packard announced that the TouchPad running WebOS on a GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU would be released in June On August HP announced the discontinuation of the TouchPad due to sluggish sales In the Mozilla Foundation announced a prototype tablet model with Foxconn which ran on Firefox OS Firefox OS was discontinued in The Canonical hinted that Ubuntu would be available on tablets by In February there was a commercial release of the BQ Aquaris Ubuntu tablet using the Ubuntu Touch operating system Canonical terminated support for the project due to lack of market interest on April and it was then adopted by the UBports as a community project br As of February of mobile app developers were targeting tablets but of developers were targeting smartphones By around of B B companies were said to have deployed tablets for sales related activities according to a survey report by Corporate Visions The iPad held majority use in North America Western Europe Japan Australia and most of the Americas Android tablets were more popular in most of Asia China and Russia an exception Africa and Eastern Europe In tablet sales did not increase Apple remained the largest seller but its market share declined below Samsung vice president Gary Riding said early in that tablets were only doing well among those using them for work Newer models were more expensive and designed for a keyboard and stylus which reflected the changing uses As of early Android reigned over the market with Apple took the number spot with and Windows took a distant third with the remaining In out of billion computing devices Android accounted for billion iOS for billion and the remainder were PCs in various forms desktop notebook or tablet running various operating systems Windows macOS ChromeOS Linux etc br Since the early s various companies such as Samsung are beginning to introduce foldable technology into their tablets br br br Types br br Tablets can be loosely grouped into several categories by physical size kind of operating system installed input and output technology and uses br br br Slate br The size of a slate varies but slates begin at inches approximately cm Some models in the larger than inch cm category include the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro at inches cm the Toshiba Excite at inches cm and the Dell XPS at inches cm As of March the thinnest tablet on the market was the Sony Xperia Tablet Z at only inches mm thick On September Apple released the iPad Pro with a inches cm screen size larger than the regular iPad br br br Mini tablet br br Mini tablets are smaller and weigh less than slates with typical screen sizes between inches cm The first commercially successful mini tablets were introduced by Amazon com Kindle Fire Barnes Noble Nook Tablet and Samsung Galaxy Tab in and by Google Nexus in They operate identically to ordinary tablets but have lower specifications compared to them br On September Amazon Inc released an upgraded version of the Kindle Fire the Kindle Fire HD with higher screen resolution and more features compared to its predecessor yet remaining only inches In October Apple released the iPad Mini with a inch screen size about inches smaller than the regular iPad but less powerful than the then current iPad On July Google released an upgraded version of the Nexus with FHD display dual cameras stereo speakers more color accuracy performance improvement built in wireless charging and a variant with G LTE support for AT T T Mobile and Verizon In September Amazon further updated the Fire tablet with the Kindle Fire HDX In November Apple released the iPad Mini which remained at inches and nearly matched the hardware of the iPad Air br br br Phablet br br Smartphones and tablets are similar devices differentiated by the former typically having smaller screens and most tablets lacking cellular network capability Since crossover touchscreen smartphones with screens larger than inches have been released That size is generally considered larger than a traditional smartphone creating the hybrid category of the phablet by Forbes and other publications Phablet is a portmanteau of phone and tablet br At the time of the introduction of the first phablets they had screens of to inches but as of screen sizes up to inches are considered typical Examples of phablets from and onward are the Samsung Galaxy Note series newer models of inches the LG V V inches the Sony Xperia XA Ultra inches the Huawei Mate inches and the Huawei Honor MediaPad X inches br br br in br br A in PC is a hybrid or combination of a tablet and laptop computer that has features of both Distinct from tablets in PCs all have physical keyboards but they are either concealable by folding them back and under the touchscreen in convertible or detachable in detachable in s typically also can display a virtual keyboard on their touchscreens when their physical keyboards are concealed or detached Some in s have processors and operating systems like those of laptops such as Windows while having the flexibility of operation as a tablet Further in s may have typical laptop I O ports such as USB and DisplayPort and may connect to traditional PC peripheral devices and external displays Simple tablets are mainly used as media consumption devices while in s have capacity for both media consumption and content creation and thus in s are often called laptop or desktop replacement computers br There are two species of in s br br Convertibles have a chassis design by which their physical keyboard may be concealed by flipping folding the keyboard behind the chassis Examples include in PCs of the Lenovo Yoga series br Detachables or Hybrids have physical keyboards that may be detached from their chassis even while the in is operating Examples include in PCs of the Asus Transformer Pad and Book series the iPad Pro and the Microsoft Surface Book and Surface Pro br br br Gaming tablet br br Some tablets are modified by adding physical gamepad buttons such as D pad and thumb sticks for better gaming experience combined with the touchscreen and all other features of a typical tablet computer Most of these tablets are targeted to run native OS games and emulator games Nvidia s Shield Tablet with an inch mm display and running Android is an example It runs Android games purchased from Google Play store PC games can also be streamed to the tablet from computers with some higher end models of Nvidia powered video cards The Nintendo Switch hybrid console is also a gaming tablet that runs on its own system software features detachable Joy Con controllers with motion controls and three gaming modes table top mode using its kickstand traditional docked TV mode and handheld mode While not entirely an actual tablet form factor due to their sizes some other handheld console including the smaller version of Nintendo Switch the Nintendo Switch Lite and PlayStation Vita are treated as an gaming tablet or tablet replacement by community and reviewer publisher due to their capabilities on browsing the internet and multimedia capabilities br br br Booklet br Booklets are dual touchscreen tablet computers with a clamshell design that can fold like a laptop Examples include the Microsoft Courier which was discontinued in the Sony Tablet P considered a flop and the Toshiba Libretto W br br br Customized business tablet br Customized business tablets are built specifically for a business customer s particular needs from a hardware and software perspective and delivered in a business to business transaction For example in hardware a transportation company may find that the consumer grade GPS module in an off the shelf tablet provides insufficient accuracy so a tablet can be customized and embedded with a professional grade antenna to provide a better GPS signal Such tablets may also be ruggedized for field use For a software example the same transportation company might remove certain software functions in the Android system such as the internet browser to reduce costs from needless cellular network data consumption of an employee and add custom package management software Other applications may call for a resistive touchscreen and other special hardware and software br br A table ordering tablet is a touchscreen tablet computer designed for use in casual restaurants Such devices allow users to order food and drinks play games and pay their bill Since restaurant chains including Chili s Olive Garden and Red Robin have adopted them As of the two most popular brands were Ziosk and Presto The devices have been criticized by servers who claim that some restaurants determine their hours based on customer feedback in areas unrelated to service br br br E reader br Any device that can display text on a screen may act as an E reader While traditionally E readers are designed primarily for the purpose of reading digital e books and periodicals modern E readers that use a mobile operating system such as Android have incorporated modern functionally including internet browsing and multimedia capabilities for example Huawei MatePad Paper is a tablet that uses e ink instead of typical LCD or LED panel hence focusing on the reading digital content while maintaining the internet and multimedia capabilities Some E reader such as PocketBook InkPad Color and ONYX BOOX NOVA Color even came with colored e ink panel and speaker which allowed for higher degree of multimedia consumption and video playback br The Kindle line from Amazon was originally limited to E reading capabilities however an update to their Kindle firmware added the ability to browse the Internet and play audio allowing Kindles to be alternatives to a traditional tablet in some cases with a more readable e ink panel and greater battery life and providing the user with access to wider multimedia capabilities compared to the older model br br br Hardware br br br System architecture br br Two major architectures dominate the tablet market ARM Ltd s ARM architecture and Intel s and AMD s x Intel s x including x has powered the IBM compatible PC since and Apple s Macintosh computers since The CPUs have been incorporated into tablet PCs over the years and generally offer greater performance along with the ability to run full versions of Microsoft Windows along with Windows desktop and enterprise applications Non Windows based x tablets include the JooJoo Intel announced plans to enter the tablet market with its Atom in In October Intel s foundry operation announced plans to build FPGA based quad cores for ARM and x processors br ARM has been the CPU architecture of choice for manufacturers of smartphones ARM PDAs digital cameras ARM set top boxes DSL routers smart televisions ARM storage devices and tablet computers ARM This dominance began with the release of the mobile focused and comparatively power efficient bit ARM processor originally designed for the Apple Newton in and ARM using Acorn A laptop in The chip was adopted by Psion Palm and Nokia for PDAs and later smartphones camera phones cameras etc ARM s licensing model supported this success by allowing device manufacturers to license alter and fabricate custom SoC derivatives tailored to their own products This has helped manufacturers extend battery life and shrink component count along with the size of devices br The multiple licensees ensured that multiple fabricators could supply near identical products while encouraging price competition This forced unit prices down to a fraction of their x equivalents The architecture has historically had limited support from Microsoft with only Windows CE available but with the release of Windows Microsoft announced added support for the architecture shipping their own ARM based tablet computer branded the Microsoft Surface as well as an x Intel Core i variant branded as Microsoft Surface Pro Intel tablet chip sales were million units in and million units in Intel chairman Andy Bryant has stated that its goal is to quadruple its tablet chip sales to million units by the end of that year as an investment for br br br Display br br A key component among tablet computers is touch input on a touchscreen display This allows the user to navigate easily and type with a virtual keyboard on the screen or press other icons on the screen to open apps or files The first tablet to do this was the GRiDPad by GRiD Systems Corporation the tablet featured both a stylus a pen like tool to aid with precision in a touchscreen device as well as an on screen keyboard The system must respond to on screen touches rather than clicks of a keyboard or mouse This operation makes precise use of our eye hand coordination br Touchscreens usually come in one of two forms br br Resistive touchscreens are passive and respond to pressure on the screen They allow a high level of precision useful in emulating a pointer as is common in tablet computers but may require calibration Because of the high resolution a stylus or fingernail is often used Stylus oriented systems are less suited to multi touch br Capacitive touchscreens tend to be less accurate but more responsive than resistive devices Because they require a conductive material such as a fingertip for input they are not common among stylus oriented devices but are prominent on consumer devices Most finger driven capacitive screens do not currently support pressure input except for the iPhone S and later models but some tablets use a pressure sensitive stylus or active pen br Some tablets can recognize individual palms while some professional grade tablets use pressure sensitive films such as those on graphics tablets Some capacitive touch screens can detect the size of the touched area and the pressure used br Since mid s most tablets use capacitive touchscreens with multi touch unlike earlier resistive touchscreen devices which users needed styluses to perform inputs br There are also electronic paper tablets such as Sony Digital Paper DPTS and reMarkable that use E ink for its display technology br br br Handwriting recognition br br Many tablets support a stylus and support handwriting recognition Wacom and N trig digital pens provide approximately DPI resolution for handwriting exceeding the resolution of capacitive touch screens by more than a factor of These pens also support pressure sensitivity allowing for variable width stroke based characters such as Chinese Japanese Korean writing due to their built in capability of pressure sensing Pressure is also used in digital art applications such as Autodesk Sketchbook Apps exist on both iOS and Android platforms for handwriting recognition and in Google introduced its own handwriting input with support for languages br br br Other features br After with access to capacitive screens and the success of the iPhone other features became common such as multi touch features in which the user can touch the screen in multiple places to trigger actions and other natural user interface features as well as flash memory solid state storage and instant on warm booting external USB and Bluetooth keyboards defined tablets br Most tablets released since mid use a version of an ARM processor for longer battery life The ARM Cortex family is powerful enough for tasks such as internet browsing light creative and production work and mobile games br Other features are High definition anti glare display touchscreen lower weight and longer battery life than a comparably sized laptop wireless local area and internet connectivity usually with Wi Fi standard and optional mobile broadband Bluetooth for connecting peripherals and communicating with local devices ports for wired connections and charging for example USB ports Early devices had IR support and could work as a TV remote controller docking station keyboard and added connectivity on board flash memory ports for removable storage various cloud storage services for backup and syncing data across devices local storage on a local area network LAN br br Speech recognition Google introduced voice input in Android in and voice actions in in with up to five languages now around Siri was introduced as a system wide personal assistant on the iPhone S in and now supports nearly languages In both cases the voice input is sent to central servers to perform general speech recognition and thus requires a network connection for more than simple commands br Near field communication with other compatible devices including ISO IEC RFID tags br br br Software br br br Current tablet operating systems br Tablets like conventional PCs use several different operating systems though dual booting is rare Tablet operating systems come in two classes br br Desktop computer operating systems br Mobile operating systems br Desktop OS based tablets are currently thicker and heavier They require more storage and more cooling and give less battery life They can run processor intensive graphical applications in addition to mobile apps and have more ports br Mobile based tablets are the reverse and run only mobile apps They can use battery life conservatively because the processor is significantly smaller This allows the battery to last much longer than the common laptop br In Q Android tablets had of the market Apple s iOS had of the market and Windows had of the market In late iOS has use worldwide varies by continent e g below in South America and Africa and Android use Still Android tablets have more use than iOS in virtually all countries except for e g the US and China br br br Android br br Android is a Linux based operating system that Google offers as open source under the Apache license It is designed primarily for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers Android supports low cost ARM systems and others The first tablets running Android were released in Vendors such as Motorola and Lenovo delayed deployment of their tablets until after when Android was reworked to include more tablet features Android Honeycomb released in and later versions support larger screen sizes mainly tablets and have access to the Google Play service Android includes operating system middleware and key applications Other vendors sell customized Android tablets such as Kindle Fire and Nook which are used to consume mobile content and provide their own app store rather than using the larger Google Play system thereby fragmenting the Android market In Google began to re emphasize in house Android tablet development at this point a multi year commitment br br br Android Go br br A few tablet computers are shipped with Android Go br br br Fire OS br As mentioned above Amazon Fire OS is an Android based mobile operating system produced by Amazon for its Fire range of tablets It is forked from Android Fire OS primarily centers on content consumption with a customized user interface and heavy ties to content available from Amazon s own storefronts and services br br br ChromeOS br Several devices that run ChromeOS came on the market in as tablets or as in s with touchscreen and degree hinge br br br HarmonyOS br HarmonyOS HMOS Chinese pinyin H ngm ng is a distributed operating system developed by Huawei to collaborate and interconnect with multiple smart devices on the Internet of Things ecosystem In its current multi kernel design the operating system selects suitable kernels from the abstraction layer for devices with diverse resources For IoT devices the system is known to be based on LiteOS kernel while for smartphones and tablets it is based on a Linux kernel layer with AOSP libraries to support APK apps using ART through the Ark Compiler in addition to native HarmonyOS apps built via DevEco Studio IDE br br br iPadOS br br The iPad runs on iPadOS Prior to the introduction of iPadOS in the iPad ran iOS which was created for the iPhone and iPod Touch The first iPad was released in Although built on the same underlying Unix implementation as macOS its user interface is radically different iPadOS is designed for touch input from the user s fingers and has none of the features that required a stylus on earlier tablets Apple introduced multi touch gestures such as moving two fingers apart or together to zoom in or out also termed pinch to zoom iPadOS and iOS are built for the ARM architecture br br br Kindle firmware br br Kindle firmware is a mobile operating system specifically designed for Amazon Kindle e readers It

reviewer publisher br br br Ubuntu Touch br Ubuntu Touch is an open source GPL mobile version of the Ubuntu operating system originally developed in by Canonical Ltd and continued by the non profit UBports Foundation in Ubuntu Touch can run on a pure GNU Linux base on phones with the required drivers such as the Librem and the PinePhone To enable hardware that was originally shipped with Android Ubuntu Touch makes use of the Android Linux kernel using Android drivers and services via an LXC container but does not use any of the Java like code of Android As of February Ubuntu Touch is available on phones and tablets The UBports Installer serves as an easy to use tool to allow inexperienced users to install the operating system on third party devices without damaging their hardware br br br Windows br br Following Windows for Pen Computing for Windows in Microsoft supported tablets running Windows XP under the Microsoft Tablet PC name Microsoft Tablet PCs were pen based fully functional x PCs with handwriting and voice recognition functionality Windows XP Tablet PC Edition provided pen support Tablet support was added to both Home and Business versions of Windows Vista and Windows Tablets running Windows could use the touchscreen for mouse input hand writing recognition and gesture support Following Tablet PC Microsoft announced the Ultra mobile PC initiative in which brought Windows tablets to a smaller touch centric form factor In Microsoft showed a prototype of a two screen tablet called Microsoft Courier but cancelled the project br In Microsoft released Windows which features significant changes to various aspects of the operating system s user interface and platform which are designed for touch based devices such as tablets The operating system also introduced an application store and a new style of application optimized primarily for use on tablets Microsoft also introduced Windows RT an edition of Windows for use on ARM based devices The launch of Windows and RT was accompanied by the release of devices with the two operating systems by various manufacturers including Microsoft themselves with the release of Surface such as slate tablets hybrids and convertibles br Released in July Windows introduces what Microsoft described as universal apps expanding on Metro style apps these apps can be designed to run across multiple Microsoft product families with nearly identical code including PCs tablets smartphones embedded systems Xbox One Surface Hub and Windows Holographic The Windows user interface was revised to handle transitions between a mouse oriented interface and a touchscreen optimized interface based on available input devices particularly on in PCs both interfaces include an updated Start menu Windows replaced all earlier editions of Windows br br br Hybrid OS operation br Several hardware companies have built hybrid devices with the possibility to work with both Android and Windows Phone operating systems or in rare cases Windows as with the by now cancelled Asus Transformer Book Duet while Ars Technica stated dual OS devices are always terrible products Windows and Android almost never cross communicate so any dual OS device means dealing with separate apps data and storage pools and completely different UI paradigms So from a consumer perspective Microsoft and Google are really just saving OEMs from producing tons of clunky devices that no one will want br br br Discontinued tablet operating systems br br br BlackBerry br BlackBerry based on the QNX OS is from BlackBerry As a smartphone OS it is closed source and proprietary and only runs on phones and tablets manufactured by BlackBerry br One of the dominant platforms in the world in the late s its global market share was reduced
