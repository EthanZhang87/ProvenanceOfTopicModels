Gentex Corporation is an American electronics and technology company that develops designs and manufactures automatic dimming rear view mirrors camera based driver assistance systems and other equipment for the global automotive industry They produce dimmable aircraft windows for the commercial business and general aviation markets In addition the company produces photoelectric smoke detectors signaling devices and the HomeLink Wireless Control System for the North American fire protection market br Founded in Gentex Corporation is based in Zeeland Michigan They created the first dual sensor photoelectric smoke detector and pioneered electrochromic automatic dimming mirrors for the automotive industry and smart windows for the aviation industry Gentex has more than patents on various technologies and products br In analyses of the industry in Gentex had the highest market to book value of any automotive supplier br As of about percent of the company s sales are derived from the automotive market As of less than percent of the company s business comes from aerospace applications of dimmable windows br br br History br Gentex was founded in by Fred Bauer as a manufacturer of fire protection products Bauer became CEO of the company in May and also served as Chairman of the Board of Directors He retired in and was succeeded by Steve Downing as CEO and by James Wallace as Chairman of the Board br br br Fire protection br Gentex created the first dual sensor photoelectric smoke detector considered to be less prone to false alarms while still quickly detecting smoldering fires Gentex smoke detectors are used in hospitals hotels offices and other buildings worldwide br In the early s Gentex introduced a smoke detector equipped with a strobe light which is designed to alert deaf and hard of hearing individuals Gentex manufactures a wide range of photoelectric detectors for fire alarm systems standalone and interconnect systems br br br Automotive br br br Mirrors br Gentex first introduced a rear view mirror that automatically adjusts to potentially dangerous glare conditions in br br Gentex began selling an automatic dimming mirror based on electrochromism in An electrochromic gel is placed between two pieces of glass which allows the mirror to dim in proportion to the glare level The reduction of glare eliminates the temporary blind spot caused by the Troxler effect after the glare source leaves the field of view These mirrors have forward and rearward facing sensors to measure the ambient light level and glare of approaching vehicles respectively br In exterior electrochromic mirrors were added to the Gentex product line These mirrors operate on the same principle as the interior mirrors In the geometry of the mirror s surface was adapted to create spherically curved glass with the goals of eliminating blind spots and offering an expanded field of view br As of Gentex introduced the Gentex Full Display Mirror which provides a video display with a panoramic view of what is behind the vehicle br br br Air quality and smoke detection br As of Gentex is expanding its smoke detection capabilities developing sensing units for use in cars and other vehicles to continuously sample air quality for smoke vaping and other airborne contaminants Sensors in publicly used vehicles could have both sanitation and security applications br br br Additional features br Compass Temperature display br Map light br OnStar br HomeLink Wireless Control System br Tire pressure indicator br SmartBeam the company s automatic headlight dimmer br Automotive grade microphones br Rear camera display RCD a realtime panoramic view of the rear of the vehicle only when in reverse gear br Exterior mirror turn signal repeaters br Complex exterior mirror geometries br br br Aerospace br Gentex and PPG Aerospace have delivered electrochromic smart windows for the Boeing Dreamliner These windows use viologens and a redox agent to adjust the amount of light that is allowed through the window a similar technology to Gentex auto dimming rearview mirrors The aircraft windows are electronically controlled an electrical signal affects the action of a conductive medium between layers of glass The windows can be adjusted by the passenger or crew to control the amount of light that enters with five levels from completely clear to completely darkened The windows are percent larger than standard aircraft windows br The aircraft window was included in the exhibition Design Life Now National Design Triennial which appeared at the Smithsonian s Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum in New York City at the Institute of Contemporary Art Boston in br Gentex is also developing electronically dimmable windows for aircraft that are capable of automatically responding to changes in sunlight adapting for example when an aircraft turns The windows can darken to complete black out capability in under seconds br Gentex is AS certified an industry standard required by the majority of major aircraft manufacturers and is capable of meeting production standards as an Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM
