title: Whistleblowing
id: 33821
Whistleblowing also whistle blowing or whistle blowing is the activity of a person often an employee revealing information about activity within a private or public organization that is deemed illegal immoral illicit unsafe or fraudulent Whistleblowers can use a variety of internal or external channels to communicate information or allegations Over of whistleblowers report internally to a supervisor human resources compliance or a neutral third party within the company hoping that the company will address and correct the issues A whistleblower can also bring allegations to light by communicating with external entities such as the media government or law enforcement Some countries legislate as to what constitutes a protected disclosure and the permissible methods of presenting a disclosure Whistleblowing can occur in the private sector or the public sector br Whistleblowers often face retaliation for their disclosure including termination of employment Several other actions may also be considered retaliatory including unreasonable increase in workloads reduction of hours preventing task completion mobbing or bullying Laws in many countries attempt to provide protection for whistleblowers and regulate whistleblowing activities These laws tend to adopt different approaches to public and private sector whistleblowing br Whistleblowers do not always achieve their aims for their claims to be credible and successful they must have compelling evidence so that the government or regulating body can investigate them and hold corrupt companies and or government agencies to account To succeed they must also persist in their efforts over what can often be years in the face of extensive coordinated and prolonged efforts that institutions can deploy to silence discredit isolate and erode their financial and mental wellbeing br Whistleblowers have been likened to Prophets at work but many lose their jobs are victims of campaigns to discredit and isolate them suffer financial and mental pressures and some lose their lives Such examples include John Barnett whistleblower who died on the day he was due to give deposition testimony as a whistleblower against aerospace company Boeing and David Kelly weapons expert who was found dead two days after the UK parliamentary Intelligence and Security and Foreign Affairs Select Committees publicized that he would be called about the dubious claims used to convince the UK Parliament to vote to invade Iraq br br br Overview br br br Origin of term br U S civic activist Ralph Nader is said to have coined the phrase in the early s in order to avoid the negative connotations found in other words such as informer and snitch However the origins of the word date back to the th century br The word is linked to the use of a whistle to alert the public or a crowd about such problems as the commission of a crime or the breaking of rules during a game The phrase whistle blower attached itself to law enforcement officials in the th century because they used a whistle to alert the public or fellow police Sports referees who use a whistle to indicate an illegal or foul play also were called whistle blowers br An story in Wisconsin s Janesville Gazette called a policeman who used his whistle to alert citizens about a riot a whistle blower without the hyphen By the year the phrase had become a hyphenated word whistle blower The word began to be used by journalists in the s for people who revealed wrongdoing such as Nader It eventually evolved into the compound word whistleblower br br br Channels for whistleblowing br br br Internal channels br Most whistleblowers are internal whistleblowers who report misconduct on a fellow employee or superior within their company through anonymous reporting mechanisms often called hotlines Within such situations circumstances and factors can cause a person to either act on the spot to prevent stop illegal and unacceptable behavior or report it There are some reasons to believe that people are more likely to take action with respect to unacceptable behavior within an organization if there are complaint systems that offer not just options dictated by the planning and control organization but a choice of options for absolute confidentiality br Anonymous reporting mechanisms as mentioned previously help foster a climate whereby employees are more likely to report or seek guidance regarding potential or actual wrongdoing without fear of retaliation The coming anti bribery management systems standard ISO includes anonymous reporting as one of the criteria for the new standard br br br External channels br External whistleblowers report misconduct to outside people or entities In these cases depending on the nature of the information whistleblowers may report the misconduct to lawyers the media law enforcement or watchdog agencies or other local state or federal agencies In some cases external whistleblowing is encouraged by offering monetary rewards br br br Third party channels br Sometimes organizations use external agencies to create a secure and anonymous reporting channel for their employees often referred to as a whistleblowing hotline In addition to protecting the identity of the whistleblower these services are designed to inform the individuals at the top of the organizational pyramid of misconduct usually via integration with specialized case management software br Implementing a third party solution is often the easiest way for an organization to promote compliance or to offer a whistleblowing policy where one did not previously exist An increasing number of companies and authorities use third party services in which the whistleblower is also anonymous to the third party service provider which is made possible via toll free phone numbers and or web or app based solutions that apply asymmetrical encryption br br br Private versus public sectors br br br Private sector whistleblowing br Private sector whistleblowing is arguably more prevalent and suppressed in society today An example of private sector whistleblowing is when an employee reports to someone in a higher position such as a manager or to external factors such as their lawyer or the police Whistleblowing in the private sector is typically not high profile or openly discussed in major news outlets though occasionally third parties expose human rights violations and exploitation of workers br Many governments attempt to protect such whistleblowers In the United States for example there are organizations such as the United States Department of Labor DOL and laws such as the Sarbanes Oxley Act and the United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations FSGO that protect whistleblowers in the private sector Thus despite government efforts to help regulate the private sector the employees must still weigh their options They either expose the company and stand the moral and ethical high ground or expose the company lose their job their reputation and potentially the ability to be employed again According to a study at the University of Pennsylvania out of three hundred whistleblowers studied sixty nine percent had foregone that exact situation and were either fired or forced to retire after taking the ethical high ground It is outcomes like these that make it all that much harder to accurately track the prevalence of whistleblowing in the private sector br br br Public sector whistleblowing br br Recognition of the value of public sector whistleblowing has been growing over the last years In the United States for example both state and Federal statutes have been put in place to protect whistleblowers from retaliation The United States Supreme Court ruled that public sector whistleblowers are protected from retaliation by their First Amendment rights After many federal whistleblowers were covered in high profile media cases laws were finally introduced to protect government whistleblowers These laws were enacted to help prevent corruption and encourage people to expose misconduct illegal or dishonest activity for the good of society People who choose to act as whistleblowers often suffer retaliation from their employer They most likely are fired because they are an at will employee which means they can be fired without a reason There are exceptions in place for whistleblowers who are at will employees Even without a statute numerous decisions encourage and protect whistleblowing on grounds of public policy Statutes state that an employer shall not take any adverse employment actions against any employee in retaliation for a good faith report of a whistleblowing action or cooperating in any way in an investigation proceeding or lawsuit arising under said action Federal whistleblower legislation includes a statute protecting all government employees In the federal civil service the government is prohibited from taking or threatening to take any personnel action against an employee because the employee disclosed information that they reasonably believed showed a violation of law gross mismanagement and gross waste of funds abuse of authority or a substantial and specific danger to public safety or health To prevail on a claim a federal employee must show that a protected disclosure was made that the accused official knew of the disclosure that retaliation resulted and that there was a genuine connection between the retaliation and the employee s action br br br Whistleblowing in the scientific community br Research fraud involves data processes or observations that were never there to begin with or later added on to fit a claim or narrative A case involving the scientific community engaging in research fraudulence is that of Dr Cyril Burt Dr Cyril Burt was a British psychologist who proposed that he had discovered a heritable factor for intelligence based on studying twins Dr Oliver Gillie a former colleague of Dr Burt inquired about Dr Burt s work doubting the authenticity of the data and the certain twins that Dr Burt was basing his research on Dr Gillies s inquiry revealed that there were discrepancies to Dr Burt s work with inconsistencies in the twin s birth dates particularly with the absence of records for twins to participate in the study the falsification of data and the invention of crucial facts to support his controversial theory that intelligence is largely inherited This led to the eventual retraction of Dr Burt s work br Data manipulation is the changing or omitting of data or outcomes in such a way that the research is not accurately portrayed in the research record Dr Hwang Woo Suk a South Korean stem cell researcher gained international recognition for his groundbreaking work on cloning and stem cell research Dr Woo Suk had a claim to successfully clone human embryos and derived patient specific stem cell lines forwarding the field of regenerative medicine which was published in the Journal of Science Dr Kim Seon Jung expressed his concerns regarding the accuracy of the research data and the ethical conduct of the experiments Independent committees as well as journalists scrutinized the research data and methodology leading to an eventual retraction of his work br Ethical violations can fall under the following altering or making up new data to meet a specific goal adjusting how data is shown or explained looking at data in a biased manner and leaving out parts about data analysis and conclusions Dr Paolo Macchiarini is well known within the scientific community as a thoracic surgeon and former regenerative researcher Dr Macchiarini claimed to have made profound advancements in trachea transplantation by using synthetic tracheal scaffolds planted with the patient s own stem cells The goal was that the stem cells would eventually provide the patient with a suitable replacement trachea Dr Karl Henrik Grinnemo a member of Dr Machiarini s research team raised concerns about the accuracy of the reported results and the ethical conduct of the experiments Dr Macchiarini s ethical violations include exaggeration of success failure to disclose the adverse post operational effects and complications of the surgery Patients experienced severe health problems several died post surgery The acts of Dr Macchiarini led to the retractions of research articles from the Lancet the termination of his academic positions and criminal inquiries in Sweden It also sparked concerns over the supervision and control of clinical trials utilizing experimental techniques br br br Risks br Individual harm damage to public trust and threats to national security are three categories of harm that may come as a result of whistleblowing Revealing a whistleblower s identity can automatically put their life in danger Some media outlets associate words like traitor and treason with whistleblowers and in many countries around the world the punishment for treason is the death penalty even if whoever allegedly committed treason may not have caused anyone physical harm In some instances whistleblowers must flee their country to avoid public scrutiny threats of death or physical harm and in some cases criminal charges br Whistleblowers are often protected under law from employer retaliation but in many cases punishment such as termination suspension demotion wage garnishment and or harsh mistreatment by other employees occurs A study found that up to of whistleblowers experienced professional retaliation in some form including wrongful termination Following dismissal whistleblowers may struggle to find employment due to damaged reputations poor references and blacklisting The socioeconomic impact of whistleblowing through loss of livelihood and family strain may also impact whistleblowers psychological well being Whistleblowers often experience immense stress as a result of litigation regarding harms such as unfair dismissal which they often face with little or no support from unions Whistleblowers who continue to pursue their concerns may also face long battles with official bodies such as regulators and government departments Such bodies may reproduce the institutional silence adopted by employers adding to whistleblowers stress and difficulties Thus whistleblowers often suffer great injustice that is never acknowledged or rectified br In a few cases however harm is done by the whistleblower to innocent people Whistleblowers can make unintentional mistakes and investigations can be tainted by the fear of negative publicity An example occurred in the Canadian health ministry when a new employee wrongly concluded that nearly every research contract she saw in involved malfeasance The end result was the sudden firing of seven people false and public threats of a criminal investigation and the death of one researcher by suicide The government ultimately paid the victims millions of dollars for lost pay slander and other harms in addition to CA million spent on the subsequent investigation into the false charges br br br Attitudes toward whistleblowers br br Whistleblowers are seen by some as selfless martyrs for public interest and organizational accountability others view them as traitors or defectors Some even accuse them of solely pursuing personal glory and fame or view their behavior as motivated by greed in qui tam cases Culturally it still has connotations of betrayal from snitching at one level to denunciations at the other Speaking out is difficult especially in a culture where this is not promoted or even actively discouraged Some academics such as Thomas Faunce feel that whistleblowers should at least be entitled to a rebuttable presumption that they are attempting to apply ethical principles in the face of obstacles and that whistleblowing would be more respected in governance systems if it had a firmer academic basis in virtue ethics br It is likely that many people do not even consider whistleblowing not only because of fear of retaliation but also because of fear of losing relationships both at and outside work br Persecution of whistleblowers has become a serious issue in many parts of the world br br Employees in academia business or government might become aware of serious risks to health and the environment but internal policies might pose threats of retaliation to those who report these early warnings Private company employees in particular might be at risk of being fired demoted denied raises and so on for bringing environmental risks to the attention of appropriate authorities Government employees could be at a similar risk for bringing threats to health or the environment to public attention although perhaps this is less likely br br There are examples of early warning scientists being harassed for bringing inconvenient truths about impending harm to the notice of the public and authorities There have also been cases of young scientists being discouraged from entering controversial scientific fields for fear of harassment br In order to help whistleblowers private organizations have formed whistleblower legal defense funds or support groups Examples include the National Whistleblower Center in the United States and Whistleblowers UK and Public Concern at Work PCaW in the United Kingdom Depending on the circumstances it is not uncommon for whistleblowers to be ostracized by their coworkers discriminated against by future potential employers or even fired from their organization A campaign directed at whistleblowers with the goal of eliminating them from the organization is referred to as mobbing It is an extreme form of workplace bullying wherein the group is set against the targeted individual br br br Psychological impact br There is limited research on the psychological impacts of whistle blowing However poor experiences with whistleblowing can cause a prolonged and prominent assault on the well being of the whistleblower As workers attempt to address concerns they are often met with a wall of silence and hostility by management or colleagues Depression is often reported by whistleblowers and suicidal thoughts may occur in up to about General deterioration in health and self care has been described The range of symptomatology shares many of the features of posttraumatic stress disorder though there is debate about whether the trauma experienced by whistleblowers meets diagnostic thresholds Increased stress related physical illness has also been described in whistleblowers br The stresses involved in whistleblowing can be huge and may deter whistleblowing out of fear of failure and reprisals Some whistleblowers speak of overwhelming and persistent distress drug and alcohol problems paranoid behavior at work acute anxiety nightmares flashbacks and intrusive thoughts This fear may indeed be justified because an individual who feels threatened by whistleblowing may plan the career destruction of the complainant by reporting fictitious errors or rumors This technique labelled as gaslighting is a common approach used by organizations to manage employees who cause difficulty by raising concerns In extreme cases this technique involves the organization or manager proposing that the complainant s mental health is unstable Organizations also often attempt to ostracize and isolate whistleblowers by undermining their concerns by suggesting that they are groundless carrying out inadequate investigations or ignoring them altogether Whistleblowers may also be disciplined suspended and reported to professional bodies upon manufactured pretexts br Such extreme experiences of threat and loss inevitably cause severe distress and sometimes mental illness sometimes lasting for years afterwards This mistreatment also deters others from coming forward with concerns Thus poor practices remain hidden behind a wall of silence and prevent any organization from experiencing the improvements that may be afforded by intelligent failure Some whistleblowers who break ranks with their organizations have had their mental stability questioned such as Adrian Schoolcraft the NYPD veteran who alleged falsified crime statistics in his department and was forcibly committed to a mental institution Conversely the emotional strain of a whistleblower investigation is devastating to the accused s family br br br Ethics br Ethics is the set of moral principles that govern a person s or group s behavior Deeper questions and theories of whistleblowing and why people choose to do so can be studied through an ethical approach Whistleblowing is a topic of several myths and inaccurate definitions Leading arguments in the ideological camp maintain that whistleblowing is the most basic of ethical traits and simply telling the truth to stop illegal harmful activities or fraud against the government taxpayers In the opposite camp many corporations and corporate or government leaders see whistleblowing as being disloyal for breaching confidentiality especially in industries that handle sensitive client or patient information Hundreds of laws grant protection to whistleblowers but stipulations can easily cloud that protection and leave them vulnerable to retaliation and sometimes even threats and physical harm However the decision and action has become far more complicated with recent advancements in technology and communication br The ethical implications of whistleblowing can be negative as well as positive Some have argued that public sector whistleblowing plays an important role in the democratic process by resolving principal agent problems However sometimes employees may blow the whistle as an act of revenge Rosemary O Leary explains this in her short volume on a topic called guerrilla government Rather than acting openly guerrillas often choose to remain in the closet moving clandestinely behind the scenes salmon swimming upstream against the current of power Over the years I have learned that the motivations driving guerrillas are diverse The reasons for acting range from the altruistic doing the right thing to the seemingly petty I was passed over for that promotion Taken as a whole their acts are as awe inspiring as saving human lives out of a love of humanity and as trifling as slowing the issuance of a report out of spite or anger For example of the more than whistleblower complaints that are filed each year with the Pentagon s Inspector General about percent are not substantiated It is believed throughout the professional world that an individual is bound to secrecy within their work sector Discussions of whistleblowing and employee loyalty usually assume that the concept of loyalty is irrelevant to the issue or more commonly that whistleblowing involves a moral choice that pits the loyalty that an employee owes an employer against the employee s responsibility to serve the public interest Robert A Larmer describes the standard view of whistleblowing in the Journal of Business Ethics by explaining that an employee possesses prima facie based on the first impression accepted as correct until proved otherwise duties of loyalty and confidentiality to their employers and that whistleblowing cannot be justified except on the basis of a higher duty to the public good It is important to recognize that in any relationship which demands loyalty the relationship works both ways and involves mutual enrichment br The ethics of Edward Snowden s actions have been widely discussed and debated in news media and academia worldwide Snowden released classified intelligence to the American people in an attempt to allow Americans to see the inner workings of the government A person is diligently tasked with the conundrum of choosing to be loyal to the company or to blow the whistle on the company s wrongdoing Discussions on whistleblowing generally revolve around three topics attempts to define whistleblowing more precisely debates about whether and when whistleblowing is permissible and debates about whether and when one has an obligation to blow the whistle br br br Motivations br Many whistleblowers have stated that they were motivated to take action to put an end to unethical practices after witnessing injustices in their businesses or organizations A study found that whistleblowers are often motivated to take action when they notice a sharp decline in ethical practices as opposed to a gradual worsening There are generally two metrics by which whistleblowers determine if a practice is unethical The first metric involves a violation of the organization s bylaws or written ethical policies These violations allow individuals to concretize and rationalize blowing the whistle On the other hand value driven whistleblowers are influenced by their personal codes of ethics In these cases whistleblowers have been criticized for being driven by personal biases br In addition to ethics social and organizational pressure are a motivating forces A study shows that individuals are more likely to blow the whistle when others know about the wrongdoing because they fear the consequences of keeping silent In cases where one person is responsible for wrongdoing the whistleblower may file a formal report rather than directly confronting the wrongdoer because confrontation would be more emotionally and psychologically stressful Furthermore individuals may be motivated to report unethical behavior when they believe their organizations will support them Professionals in management roles may feel responsibility to blow the whistle to uphold the values and rules of their organizations br br br The step program used by institutions against whistleblowers br Ad hoc measures to punish silence and discredit whistleblowers have been commonplace for decades in all sectors commercial industrial government and para governmental health and social care and education particularly Higher Education br However as legal protections for whistleblowers have ostensibly increased the operations to punish suppress and discredit whistleblowers have professionalized Large institutions can purchase training to execute or covertly hire teams of consultants to run operations to execute a step program or variations thereof designed to remove the threat that whistleblowers represent all the while presenting an outward image supported by a document trail that they are only following processes and indeed are trying their best to take care of a disgruntled untrustworthy and mentally disturbed employee br The following comes from the training for such programs This is sought by and provided for institutions on a discrete basis to avoid bad publicity and so it is very difficult to find public references for it unless one has attended such training The secrecy surrounding this program is one of its strengths as whistleblowers are unaware of what is going on Because of that secrecy it is difficult to be sure whether the case studies cited below are the result of the implementation of part or all of that program with only the inclusion sequence and pattern of activities giving clues br Although officially there are laws to protect whistleblowers large institutions guilty of transgressions can engage in this step program to try to remove the threat presented by the whistleblowers themselves protecting the institution and its leadership by br br undermining the credibility mental health and financial resources of the whistleblower br isolating them from their colleagues and support structures br finding through formal investigation that the whistleblower to blame in the original and or related investigations and ensuring the whistleblower s colleagues and potential future employers find out about this br gaslighting the whistleblower so that their mental robustness is no longer up to the fight as Michael Woodford said after identifying corruption at Olympus At times I felt I was in Alice in Wonderland and I questioned my sanity I was completely isolated br creating the conditions to fuel family tensions at home for the whistleblower as Harry Templeton who was fired for blowing the whistle on Robert Maxwell s million theft from the Mirror group pension fund stated I had to bring my problems home to my family It was like banging your head against a brick wall br ensuring that the whistleblower appears to their former colleagues friends family and any external regulators or assessors to be the mentally disturbed disgruntled and possibly criminal person that the institution portrays them to be without ever leaving evidence that the institution itself manufactured that portrayal br The whistleblower in turn is unaware of this structured program and team of consultants arrayed against them and so is more easily manipulated by the following steps br Step is called The Trusted Leader In Step the management of the institution will try to win the confidence of the whistleblower by fronting a figure who is senior to the whistleblower to take charge of the investigation and who appears to be horrified at the whistleblower s story Generally institutions should chose the most senior person who whilst the institution would like to protect them is expendable should the need arise which means ensuring the TL transfers to a promotion in another institution should the institution fail in discrediting the whistleblower Therefore if the whistleblower whistleblows to their line manager it is preferable to pass this to a member of the leadership team but not to the head of the organisation to act as TL This allows the institution s leadership to win the trust of the whistleblower and so enact Steps and The position of Trusted Leader TL is a particularly valuable one to weaponize against the whistleblower whilst they are unaware of it because br br the TL has the power and credibility to brief against the whistleblower to devastating effect and is backed by on staff legal department this is especially the case if the TM is high within the leadership structure of the organisation or can influence someone who is br the TL is often well versed in the needs of influential third parties whose investment in the TL s institution might be harmed if the whistleblower is not discredited br As Aubrey Blumsohn said on leaving the University of Sheffield over the unethical information sharing and research publication tactics to promote drugs funded by Proctor and Gamble There were so many people in prominent leadership positions who behaved so appallingly I just couldn t carry on within the profession I just felt sick about the whole thing Frustrated at having every effort he made to try to get the university to correct the problem Blumsohn told the University they left him with no option but to inform the media He was suspended and notice was disseminated that he might lose his job because of breach of contract with conduct incompatible with the duties of office including briefing journalists and distributing information including a Times Higher article to third parties with apparent intent to cause embarrassment Blumsohn had to find employment outside of academia and without medical registration He concluded I m not sure other universities would necessarily have behaved differently from Sheffield When millions of pounds are at stake both in private fees for academics and university funding and a pharmaceutical company is wanting you to dance the pressure to go along and to get staff to remain quiet is overwhelming br Harinder Bahra similarly found the reputational damage done to the whistleblowing by one university tars their career in the next when he left Southampton for Brunel br Whilst Universities can punish whistleblowers who expose corrupt practices they would rather keep hidden they can be remarkably tolerant of hiring trusted leaders who gained reputations for conducting and condoning corrupt practices as when Southampton University in the UK hired Dean of Law from the University of Manitoba who left Canada after being accused of misusing faculty funds br This tactic of accusing the whistleblower of breach of contract if they whistleblow to an outside party is a common way to intimidate and punish the whistleblower as in the sacking of Professor Jane Hutton br Step Keep promises oral advises the institution that all communications between the Trusted Leader and the whistleblower should be oral so that these initial promises and assurances and the later oral threats can all be denied There will undeniably be written communications but the institution can draft these knowing how they can later be used to create the impression the institution was acting honorably br In Step Greeks bearing gifts the institution further nudges the whistleblower into trusting the Trusted Leader TL of the institution and their internal investigation by offering the whistleblower a number of named individuals who will work solely and confidentially to support the whistleblower from Human Resources HR and the counselling service etc This provides a formal paper trail that the institution is supporting the whistleblower while providing an environment where the whistleblower divulges plans and weaknesses that the counsellor HR can then feed back to the institution to secretly weaponize against the whistleblower br Step Keep it internal is the keystone of the strategy and so should only be commenced when the institution is sure that it has first convinced the whistleblower that there is a Trusted Leader TL who will spearhead the fight for truth In Step the TL must convince the whistleblower that the surest and quickest way to correct the infractions identified by the whistleblower is by getting buy in from the Top Brass The Trusted Leader must convince the whistleblower that to do this the whistleblower must refrain from contacting any external bodies e g regulators until the TL has conducted an internal investigation first to gather the facts If possible the TL will bind the whistleblower to a promise not to take their concerns outside of the organization until internal investigations are completed If such a promise is not forthcoming the TL should verbally use other coercion such as suggesting it would avoid the whistleblower incurring legal expenses accidentally breaching contract and being sued getting a bad name throughout the industry etc direct threats are best saved until a later stage and should always be oral and without witnesses and when the TL is sure no recordings are being made The whistleblower should be orally informed that during this internal investigation they cannot contact their union or legal advisers but the institution is advised never to commit this to paper as it is almost certainly unlawful On behalf of the institution the TL will promise the whistleblower month long internal investigations but protract these to a year or more to run out the clock on the allowable time window for the whistleblower to inform external bodies e g OSHA ACAS regulators etc Those investigations can then be classed as legally privileged Step Legally privilege so the whistleblower cannot access information on it Under the shield of legal privilege the internal investigations are initially headed by one member of the senior leadership Step Senior investigator such as a Vice President VP The TL is often chosen for this role For conciseness we will refer to this person as VP and the institution must choose them carefully to ensure they have enduring motivation to act against ruthlessly against the whistleblower and keep faith with and protect the institution for years to come Such motivation could be in the form of promised bonuses or promotion but these can have only transient effect and the most enduring option is to choose as chair of the investigations a senior leader who would be implicated by the whistleblower if the whistleblower knew the whole story but whose involvement in the infraction is something the whistleblower is ignorant of br The VP character can then set the terms of reference of the investigations such that critical factors are ruled out of scope in the investigation Step The scope and rules The institution can also powerfully intervene to ensure the rules by which issues are judged favor the institution as when DuPont placed its own scientists to work with West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection to revise the safe threshold of Perfluorooctanoic acid in drinking water to be higher than it was previously The VP must also control witness lists to ensure the witnesses identified by the whistleblower are never questioned whereas those who can be induced to shift blame onto the whistleblower are included and their unproven opinions given the weight of concrete evidence Step Control the Witness lists Steps and are designed enable the logical following of processes to shift the guilt from the institution and the whistleblower as when Antoine Deltour formerly of PricewaterhouseCoopers was convicted of information theft after revealing the tax avoidance schemes Amazon and Dyson had struck with Luxembourg These two steps should be re applied during Step br Step Launch multiple investigations occurs whilst the whistleblower waits trusting the VP to fairly chair that first investigation In Step during this year of internal investigation the VP will set up multiple internal sub investigations If possible the institution must not alert the whistleblower to the fact that these investigations are designed to blame the whistleblower for something by verbally communicating to the whistleblower that they are fact finding investigations in which the whistleblower is only peripherally involved as a witness Harry Templeton who blew the whistle on Robert Maxwell s pension fund theft was fired on trumped up charges after the other trustees of Mirror Group voted against challenging Maxwell s actions Each of these investigations should be led by investigators motivated to protect the institution e g by the promise of promotion For conciseness call these the AVP Associate Vice Presidents Each AVP is informally told by the institution what the scope of their investigation will be in a re application of Step and who will be on the witness list a re application of Step with the aim of absolving the institution but bend the arc of the narrative to cast the whistleblower as a bad apple or a disgruntled employee who is lying to damage the institution Some institutions have also tried to use this to give the impression that the whistleblower is mentally unfit or in breach of contract but whilst these can be useful rumors to spread they are better left out of official findings as the first is difficult to rule in scope and the second is difficult to prove If necessary those rumors can be spread to other potential employers through informal social contacts to prevent the whistleblower from finding alternative employment once the institution has cause financial distress in the whistleblower to force the whistleblower to sign a non disclosure agreement see step The HR counselling service provided by the institution to the whistleblower should work hard to win the whistleblower s trust at this stage so that they can monitor how well these investigations dispirit the whistleblower and isolate them from colleagues and family br Step Scratching backs relies heavily on Step In Step each AVP calls as witnesses to their sub investigation the other AVPs and vice versa None call witnesses recommended by the whistleblower All call the VP as a witness In this way the institution can state that all the witnesses in all the sub investigations found no evidence to support the whistleblower s claim but leak to the whistleblower s colleagues rumors that the witnesses found worrying failings by the whistleblower to do their job competently and honestly to abide by their employment contract etc These internal investigations delay the point at which the whistleblower takes his her concerns to external bodies often running out the clock entirely br Institutions are often nervous of the evidence a whistleblower might have but Step Jiu jitsu the evidence turns that evidence that vindicates the whistleblower into evidence that harms them In Step the institution uses the early internal investigations by the AVPs to test whether the whistleblower really takes time to collate evidence If the whistleblower does not carefully collate the evidence then the institution can use its own assertions and hide the fact that what it presents as testimony is in fact hearsay or manufactured controlling the witness list as it does reapplying Step to counter the assertions made by the whistleblower If the whistleblower proves to be a diligent record keeper and fastidious in finding documentary evidence the institution is advised to use the early internal investigations run by the AVPs to fatigue the whistleblower by ruling against the whistleblower time after time despite the whistleblower s documentary evidence proving their case telling them they need to find more and more evidence A sustained campaign like this for years on low level internal AVP investigations demanding the whistleblower find and present increasing volumes of evidence only for it all to be ignored by the institution will ensure that the whistleblower has no fight left to search for evidence and present it in a sensible fashion by the time the more important VP investigation comes to a head or reach the regulator The goal is to induce PTSD in the whistleblower and deplete them of the finances needed to continue the fight Specifically the institute can crush the spirit of the whistleblower so that they appear to colleagues and regulators etc to be the disgruntled mentally disturbed employee that the institution portrays them to be This approach is often very effective at depleting the finances of the whistleblower because their lawyers charges the whistleblower for large amounts of time reading through the masses of evidence the whistleblower has found only to advise that there is too much to present to a judge This shows the whistleblower that finding evidence against the institution harms the whistleblower disincentivizing them from continuing the fight After whistleblowing auditor Charles Erhart suffered persecution by Axos Bank formerly Bank of Internet including widely publicized defamatory statements about him leading to termination of his job As he attempted to clear his name the bank attempted to swamp his counsel with thousands of pages of documents to which Erhart had to respond slowing the progress to court and incurring vast legal bills for Erhart br Step Delay consolidate and jiu jitsu the blame brings to a head these various threads By using the AVP investigations in concert with the VP investigation and covering as much of the process and findings with legal privilege so that the whistleblower cannot access the records of them the institution can undermine and persecute the whistleblower by allowing rumors that multiple investigations involving the whistleblower had found them to be a fantasist and disparage the whistleblower s reputation isolating them and making their work life untenable The institution can invoke legal privilege for all these investigations so that all these tactics can be conducted under legal privilege denying the whistleblower the access to information needed to avail themselves of whistleblower protections or successfully appeal these decisions because the bias behind them is hidden This is why despite the existence of such legal protections whistleblowers are often successfully persecuted undermined isolated from colleagues who hear rumors spread by the institution and have their reputation and credibility destroyed by institutions committed to protecting their corrupt or negligent leaders There are few things more effective at crushing the ability of a whistleblower to fight on and goading them into rages in front of their colleagues that feed that mentally unstable narrative than having the whistleblower taking their evidence to and even sitting in front of a panel believing they will get a fair hearing at last only to have all the evidence ignored and the panel rule against them against all logic often leading to punishment of the whistleblower Examples include br br when the Environmental Protection Agency used veterinarians specifically selected by Dupont to rule on pollution claims br when Terry Bryan took his observations of patient abuse to the Care Quality Commission br when Osita Mba compiled evidence of the UK tax office HMRC freeing Goldman Sachs from the obligation to pay significant taxes only to be ignored by the National Audit Office and then find his own phone records and emails searched for evidence against him and lost his job br when Ray Dirks exposed massive Equity Funding crimes but ended up in front of the US Supreme Court on trumped up insider trading charges br when Dr Chris Day s consultant path career trajectory was terminated when Health Education England used semantics to dismiss his safety concerns br when Howard Shaw a former detective sergeant at the Metropolitan Police was ignored by superiors when he reported a colleague had cheated by seeing interview questions in advance and was then removed by said colleague when he joined those superiors in Shaw s line management br when Cheryl Eckard lost her job as a Quality Assurance Manager at GlaxoSmithKline when she reported to them that she had found their contamination of public water sources and failure to ensure sterile environments for their products environmental factory in Puerto Rico She expected GSK to welcome her detailed report on months finding how corners were cut at the factory to increase profits but she was subjected to isolation and humiliation and then sacked She felt she had no option but to report the problems to the FDA who raided the factory and found vast amounts of substandard drugs that were intended for sale to the public and healthcare br when Twitter s Chief Security Officer Peiter Zatko refused Twitter s demands that he cover up security vulnerabilities and was consequently terminated for what Twitter alleged to be poor performance br when Chris Smalls an activist for workers rights at Amazon was terminated by Amazon who alleged he broke their COVID protocols even though he never entered the building during the demonstration Amazon cited br when Martin Woods a former policeman who had been employed by Wachovia Bank to check for money laundering reported laundering to his bosses he was treated with disdain suffered reprimands and told to cease blacking illegal transactions and cease asking questions He was on the trail of billion laundered for drug cartels by Wachovia Bank He also noticed that the cartels stopped using the accounts he was monitoring and so inferred the Cartels had been tipped off to his activities placing him in danger Having failed to silence him with lighter touch measures such as saying he did not use precisely the correct manner to call in sick when he was admitted to hospital and citing him for a disciplinary offence for answering the phone when police called about a corrupt policy The banks began disciplinary proceedings against him scheduling a hearing for professional misconduct and rebuking him claiming that Woods s actions could expose the bank to potential regulatory jeopardy and even large fines Woods suffered illness and went for psychiatric counselling Woods had no choice but to report his findings outside of the bank to the US Drug Enforcement Agency after which the US Justice Department charged Wachovia with the largest violation of the Bank Secrecy Act in US history Woods lost his job and found it difficult to get other employment while everyone involved in the criminal activity in the bank and those responsible for his persecution were promoted within the bank or promoted to other banks br Step is Ruin credibility mental health and finances This step delivers the objective of conducting the preceding steps which is to destroy the credibility the financial security and mental health of the whistleblower such that the whistleblower no longer has the ability to expose wrongdoing When faced with reports from a whistleblower the Bournemouth University launched a counter offensive its pro vice chancellor publishing a letter in Times Higher Education in that phrases the university s own internal opinions on the whistleblower This went out to all UK Universities and prevented the whistleblower from finding another job in academia Those involved in discrediting him received promotions br If the whistleblower does seek legal support the institution uses its greater financial reserves and in house legal team if it is large enough to have one to simply delay all the legal processes so that the whistleblower faces financial ruin can no longer afford legal support and drops the complaint This is made particularly effective if the whistleblower s working environment and the measures outlined above cause the whistleblower to completely use up their paid sick leave each month of delay adds a month s legal expenses to the whistleblower who is now running their household on little or no income whilst the institution absorbs its own legal costs each month particularly if it is large enough to have its own legal department Costs for the whistleblower can be racked up by scheduling weekly meetings between the whistleblower s lawyers and the institution only for the institution to send different junior staff from its legal department to each meeting who then plead ignorance as they have not had time to read up on the issue or collect the information to answer the outstanding questions The issue does not advance but the whistleblower pays legal fees each time br As one of the first name only trainers for this program brutally explained the whistleblower stands on a chair with four legs i their marriage family and friends ii their personal financial resources iii their community of peers and colleagues who used to trust their word and make frequent contact them and iv their reputation for credibility integrity and truthfulness They explained that the object of the program is to kick that chair away br With the whistleblower mentally and financially distressed the institution can then offer to cease the investigations it has opened to tarnish and harass the whistleblower in exchange for a non disclosure agreement which prevents the whistleblower from ever discussing the malfeasance of the institution or the harassment it has visited on the whistleblower br The Universities of Southampton and Manchester were found to be within the top UK universities for binding whistleblowers to NDAs when paying out settlements using legal measures to ensure they did not divulge what problems they had found at those universities However both Southampton university and Manchester University generated beneficial self publicity and improved their league table rankings by making a show of signing up to a UK nationwide pledge to stop the use of NDAs to suppress whistleblowing on sexual misconduct bullying and other harassment However this made little change to leadership practices When the University of Southampton was directly asked in a Freedom of Information Request for the number of ex employees of the University in the last years who at the end of their period of employment signed any form of non disclosure agreement at the request of the University the response by Southampton University avoided giving the number requested by using the semantic reasoning that if an NDA is a confidentiality agreement within a Settlement Agreement it is not an NDA so the answer would be zero despite the independent audit finding they were within the top three UK Universities for using NDAs Retrospective semantic re definitions represent a common tactic by institutions to give the whistleblower s written word a meaning it did not have and so dodge a verdict that would be inconvenient to the institution In Apple were eventually criticised for using the same route to dodge accountability of including silencing clauses in small severance packages and so avoiding NDAs and were found to have straight out lied NDAs have also been used against teachers terminated by public schools after raising concerns about institutionalised cheating and fraudulent practices by the public schools to benefit pupils and the exam success rates the school could use to attract new clients br In the above example the University of Southampton signed the response Yours sincerely foi omitting any name or traceability for the decision meaning the questioner would not be able to trace who in the Legal Services team of the University of Southampton had produced the response and meaning no leader at Southampton University could be blamed for the avoiding the question and creating obstacles to hide what they do The answer by Southampton University is a good example of a Step response in that br br frustrates the questioner br puts the onus on the questioner to enter into protracted and expensive challenges at their own cost if they wished to object to Southampton University s non answer and try to get an answer to the question they asked br demonstrates the limited use of legal protections for whistleblowers when faced with the inherent inequality that protects institutions who have large salaried legal teams paid for indefinitely by the Government grants and endowments in the case of UK Universities or commercial income streams for which protection of brand is a worthwhile investment in the private sector br demonstrates how little fear such funded institutions have of a whistblower s legal protections br demonstrates that large institutions will commit to paper ludicrous and on the face of it indefensible defences to hide the decisions of its leadership if it thinks the whistleblower will have insufficient resources to argue against those or publicize them br The tactic by the University of Southampton in making the response appears to have been successful the University successfully avoiding answering the Freedom of Information Request and the questioner being unable to penetrate their obscuration and obfuscation despite having in theory a legal right to get the answer to their question br So effective is this program that the whistleblower has few defenses except br br to resist Step and insist that they take their concerns to the appropriate external regulatory body from the outset This must be done with great care to abide by the policies procedures and contracts associated with their job and institution because the institution can use any departure from this to attack the whistleblower br obtain Legal support at the earliest stage so that knowing the Steps used in this program the restrictions on scope and witness lists etc can be challenged and a glossary of definitions can be drawn up so that seemingly innocuous words that the institution insists on using cannot be retrospectively redefined to use semantics to escape accountability However obtaining legal advice from an early stage then leaves the whistleblower open to the financial penalties that come when the institution delays the case for months or years br br The steps in this program are unethical and depending on the jurisdiction often illegal but they have succeeded because the whistleblower and their support network are unaware of them and because protections for whistleblowers do not specifically call out this step program Institutions that purchase and implement all or part of it cannot be unaware that lives have been lost through the detriment visited on whistleblowers by their institutions br br br Legal protection for whistleblowers br br Legal protection for whistleblowers varies from country to country and may depend on the country of the original activity where and how secrets were revealed and how they eventually became published or publicized Over a dozen countries have now adopted comprehensive whistleblower protection laws that create mechanisms for reporting wrongdoing and provide legal protections Over countries have adopted more limited protections as part of their anti corruption freedom of information or employment laws br br For purposes of the English Wikipedia this section emphasizes the English speaking world and covers other regimes only insofar as they represent exceptionally greater or lesser protections br br br Australia br br There are laws in a number of states The former NSW Police Commissioner Tony Lauer summed up official government and police attitudes as Nobody in Australia much likes whistleblowers particularly in an organization like the police or the government The former Australian intelligence officer known as Witness K who provided evidence of Australia s controversial spying operation against the government of East Timor in face the possibility of jail if convicted br Whistleblowers Australia is an association for those who have exposed corruption or any form of malpractice especially if they were then hindered or abused br br br Canada br The Public Sector Integrity Commissioner PSIC provides a safe and confidential mechanism enabling public servants and the general public to disclose wrongdoings committed in the public sector It also protects from reprisal public servants who have disclosed wrongdoing and those who have cooperated in investigations The office s goal is to enhance public confidence in Canada s federal public institutions and in the integrity of public servants br Mandated by the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Act PSIC is a permanent and independent agent of Parliament The act which came into force in applies to most of the federal public sector approximately public servants This includes government departments and agencies parent Crown corporations the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other federal public sector bodies br Not all disclosures lead to an investigation as the act sets out the jurisdiction of the commissioner and gives the option not to investigate under certain circumstances On the other hand if PSIC conducts an investigation and finds no wrongdoing was committed the commissioner must report his findings to the discloser and to the organization s chief executive Also reports of founded wrongdoing are presented before the House of Commons and the Senate in accordance with the act br The act also established the Public Servants Disclosure Protection Tribunal PSDPT to protect public servants by hearing reprisal complaints referred by the Public Sector Integrity Commissioner The tribunal can grant remedies in favour of complainants and order disciplinary action against persons who take reprisals br br br European Union br The European Parliament approved a Whistleblower Protection Directive containing broad free speech protections for whistleblowers in both the public and the private sectors including for journalists in all member states of the European Union The Directive prohibits direct or indirect retaliation against employees current and former in the public sector and the private sector The Directive s protections apply to employees to volunteers and to those who assist them including to civil society organizations and to journalists who report on their evidence In October the EU Directorate General for Justice and Consumers Equality and the Rule of Law emphasized that ministries as legal entities in the public sector are also explicitly required to establish internal reporting channels for their employees It provides equal rights for whistleblowers in the national security sector who challenge denial or removal of their security clearances Also whistleblowers are protected from criminal prosecution and corporate lawsuits for damages resulting from their whistleblowing and provided with psychological support for dealing with harassment stress br Good government observers have hailed the EU directive as setting the global standard for best practice rights protecting freedom of speech where it counts the most challenging abuses of power that betray the public trust according to the U S based Government Accountability Project They have noted however that ambiguities remain in the directive regarding application in some areas such as duty speech that is when employees report the same information in the course of a job assignment for example to a supervisor instead of whistleblowing as formal dissent In fact duty speech is how the overwhelming majority of whistleblowing information gets communicated and where the free flow of information is needed for an organization s proper functioning However it is in response to such duty speech employee communication that the vast majority of retaliation against employees occurs These observers have noted that the Directive must be understood as applying to protection against retaliation for such duty speech because without such an understanding the Directive will miss the iceberg of what s needed br br br France br In France several recent laws have established a protection regime for whistleblowers Prior to there were several laws in force which created disparate legislation with sector specific regimes The law on transparency fight against corruption and modernization of economic life known as the Sapin Law provides for the first time a single legal definition of whistleblowers in France It defines him or her as an individual who discloses or reports in a disinterested manner and in good faith a crime or an offence a serious and manifest breach of an international commitment duly ratified or approved by France a unilateral act of an international organization adopted on the basis of such a commitment of the law or regulations or a serious threat or harm to general interest which he or she has become personally aware of It excludes certain professional secrets such as national defense secrecy medical secrecy or the secrecy of relations between a lawyer and his client br In two laws are passed to transpose the European Directive of October on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law One of them strengthens the role of the D fenseur des droits the French ombudsman tasked with advising and protecting whistleblowers The second amends the Sapin law to bring it into line with the directive and adds substantial guarantees not included in the directive among which br br The definition of whistleblowing in force under the Sapin Law which includes whistleblowing not based on work has been maintained br The protection applies to any natural person who facilitates or assists whistleblowers as required in the directive but also to entities such as NGOs Non governmental organizations or trade unions which act as a facilitator They are offered the same level of protection br Military personnel will now be afforded the same level of protection as other civil servants so long as they do not disclose information that may harm national security br The law provides that whistleblowers may be granted financial assistance when subjected to a suit by making an application to a judge who has the power to force the suing organization the employer for instance to cover their legal fees and if their financial situation has deteriorated their living expenses br The law provides that whistleblowers shall not incur criminal liability in respect to the acquisition of or access to the information that is reported or publicly disclosed They cannot be sentenced for any offenses committed in order to gather proof or information as long as they obtained it in a lawful manner br The law strengthens existing sanctions against those who retaliate against whistleblowers The criminal sanctions applicable to persons retaliating against whistleblowers can go up to three years of imprisonment and a fine of The judges may impose fines on companies taking a SLAPP action against a whistleblower br The law allows any person to apply to the D fenseur des droits for an opinion on his or her status as a whistleblower A response should be given within six months after receiving the application The organic law provides that the D fenseur des droits will publish a report every two years on the overall functioning of whistleblower protection addressed to the French President of the Republic the President of the National Assembly and the President of the Senate br br br Jamaica br In Jamaica the Protected Disclosures Act received assent in March It creates a comprehensive system for the protection of whistleblowers in the public and private sectors It is based on the Public Interest Disclosure Act br br br India br br The Government of India had been considering adopting a whistleblower protection law for several years In the Law Commission of India recommended the adoption of the Public Interest Disclosure Protection of Informers Act In August the Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill was introduced into the Lok Sabha lower house of the Parliament of India The Bill was approved by the cabinet in June The Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Persons Making the Disclosures Bill was renamed the Whistleblowers Protection Bill by the Standing Committee on Personnel Public Grievances Law and Justice The Whistleblowers Protection Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on December and by the Rajyasabha on February The Whistle Blowers Protection Act has received the Presidential assent on May and the same has been subsequently published in the official gazette of the Government of India on May by the Ministry of Law and Justice Government of India br br br Iran br In the Iranian government made public whistleblowing punishable by law if a whistleblower reveals corruption to authorities that can t be proved br br br Ireland br The government of Ireland committed to adopting a comprehensive whistleblower protection law in January The Protected Disclosures Act PDA was passed in The law covers workers in the public and private sectors and also includes contractors trainees agency staff former employees and job seekers A range of different types of misconduct may be reported under the law which provides protections for workers from a range of employment actions as well as whistleblowers identity br br br Netherlands br The Netherlands has measures in place to mitigate the risks of whistleblowing The House for Whistleblowers Huis voor klokkenluiders offers advice and support to whistleblowers and the Parliament passed a proposal in to establish this house for whistleblowers to protect them from the severe negative consequences that they might endure Kamerstuk Dutch media organizations also provide whistleblower support on September a number of major Dutch media outlets supported the launch of Publeaks which provides a secure website for people to leak documents to the media Publeaks is designed to protect whistleblowers It operates on the GlobaLeaks software developed by the Hermes Center for Transparency and Digital Human Rights which supports whistleblower oriented technologies internationally br br br Switzerland br The Swiss Council of States agreed on a draft amendment of the Swiss Code of Obligations in September The draft introduces articles abis to asepties d An amendment of article adds articles abis to asepties to the list of provisions that may not be overruled by labour and bargaining agreements br Article ater introduces an obligation on employees to report irregularities to their employer before reporting to an authority An employee will however not breach his duty of good faith if he reports an irregularity to an authority and br br a period set by the employer and no longer than days has lapsed since the employee has reported the incident to his employer and br the employer has not addressed the irregularity or it is obvious that the employer has insufficiently addressed the irregularity br Article aquarter provides that an employee may exceptionally directly report to an authority Exceptions apply in cases br br where the employee is in a position to objectively demonstrate that a report to his employer will prove ineffective br where the employee has to anticipate dismissal br where the employee must assume that the competent authority will be hindered in investigating the irregularity or br where there is a direct and serious hazard to life to health to safety or to the environment br The draft does not improve on protection against dismissal for employees who report irregularities to their employer The amendment does not provide for employees anonymously filing their observations of irregularities br br br United Kingdom br br Whistleblowing in the United Kingdom is protected by the Public Interest Disclosure Act PIDA Amongst other things under the Act protected disclosures are permitted even if a non disclosure agreement has been signed between the employer and the former or current employee a consultation on further restricting confidentiality clauses was held in br The Freedom to Speak Up Review sets out principles to bring about improvements to help whistleblowers in the NHS including br br Culture of raising concerns to make raising issues a part of normal routine business of a well led NHS organization br Culture free from bullying freedom of staff to speak out relies on staff being able to work in a culture which is free from bullying br Training every member of staff should receive training in their trust s approach to raising concerns and in receiving and acting on them br Support all NHS trusts should ensure there is a dedicated person to whom concerns can be easily reported and without formality a speak up guardian br Support to find alternative employment in the NHS where a worker who has raised a concern cannot as a result continue their role the NHS should help them seek an alternative job br Monitor produced a whistleblowing policy in November that all NHS organizations in England are obliged to follow It explicitly says that anyone bullying or acting against a whistleblower could be potentially liable to disciplinary action An observational and interviewed based study of more than Guardians found that a lack of resources especially time reduced their ability to respond to concerns and to analyse and learn from data Guardians struggled to develop their role and create a more positive culture in which staff felt free to voice concerns Guardians found their role stressful and received little psychological support and as a result many did not intend to stay in their role for long br br br United States br br Whistleblowing tradition in what would soon become the United States had a start in with Benjamin Franklin leaking a few letters in the Hutchinson affair The release of the communications from royal governor Thomas Hutchinson to Thomas Whately led to a firing a duel and arguably both through the many general impacts of the leak and its role in convincing Franklin to join the radicals cause the taking of another important final step toward the American Revolution br The first act of the Continental Congress in favor of what later came to be called whistleblowing came in the case of Samuel Shaw and Richard Marven The two seamen accused Commander in Chief of the Continental Navy Esek Hopkins of torturing British prisoners of war The Congress dismissed Hopkins and then agreed to cover the defense cost of the pair after Hopkins filed a libel suit against them under which they were imprisoned Shaw and Marven were subsequently cleared in a jury trial br To be considered a whistleblower in the United States most federal whistleblower statutes require that federal employees have reason to believe their employer violated some law rule or regulation testify in or commence a legal proceeding on the legally protected matter or refuse to violate the law br In cases where whistleblowing on a specified topic is protected by statute U S courts have generally held that such whistleblowers are protected from retaliation However a closely divided U S Supreme Court decision Garcetti v Ceballos held that the First Amendment free speech guarantees for government employees do not protect disclosures made within the scope of the employees duties br In the United States legal protections vary according to the subject matter of the whistleblowing and sometimes the state where the case arises In passing the Sarbanes Oxley Act the Senate Judiciary Committee found that whistleblower protections were dependent on the patchwork and vagaries of varying state statutes Still a wide variety of federal and state laws protect employees who call attention to violations help with enforcement proceedings or refuse to obey unlawful directions While this patchwork approach has often been criticized it is also responsible for the United States having more dedicated whistleblowing laws than any other country br The first US law adopted specifically to protect whistleblowers was the United States False Claims Act revised in which tried to combat fraud by suppliers of the United States government during the American Civil War The act encourages whistleblowers by promising them a percentage of the money recovered by the government and by protecting them from employment retaliation br Another US law specifically protecting whistleblowers is the Lloyd La Follette Act of It guaranteed the right of federal employees to furnish information to the United States Congress The first US environmental law to include an employee protection was the Clean Water Act of Similar protections are included in subsequent federal environmental laws including the Safe Drinking Water Act Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Toxic Substances Control Act of Energy Reorganization Act of through amendment to protect nuclear whistleblowers Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA or the Superfund Law and Clean Air Act Similar employee protections enforced through OSHA are included in the Surface Transportation Assistance Act to protect truck drivers the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act PSIA of the Wendell H Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the st Century AIR and the Sarbanes Oxley Act enacted on July for corporate fraud whistleblowers More recent laws with some whistleblower protection include the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act CPSIA Seamans Protection Act as amended by the Coast Guard Authorization Act of SPA Consumer Financial Protection Act CFPA FDA Food Safety Modernization Act FSMA Moving Ahead for Progress in the st Century Act MAP and Taxpayer First Act TFA br Investigation of retaliation against whistleblowers under federal statutes falls under the jurisdiction of the Directorate of Whistleblower Protection Program DWPP of the United States Department of Labor s Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA New whistleblower statutes enacted by Congress which are to be enforced by the Secretary of Labor are generally delegated by a Secretary s Order to the DWPP br The patchwork of laws means that victims of retaliation need to be aware of the laws at issue to determine the deadlines and means for making proper complaints Some deadlines are as short as days Arizona State Employees have days to file a Prohibited Personnel Practice Complaint before the Arizona State Personnel Board while others are up to days br Those who report a false claim against the federal government and suffer adverse employment actions as a result may have up to six years depending on state law to file a civil suit for remedies under the US False Claims Act FCA Under a qui tam provision the original source for the report may be entitled to a percentage of what the government recovers from the offenders However the original source must also be the first to file a federal civil complaint for recovery of the federal funds fraudulently obtained and must avoid publicizing the claim of fraud until the US Justice Department decides whether to prosecute the claim itself Such qui tam lawsuits must be filed under seal using special procedures to keep the claim from becoming public until the federal government makes its decision on direct prosecution Whistleblowers acting under the FCA are the primary enforcement tool used by the U S Department of Justice to target fraud including overbilling to government programs like Medicare Medicaid and Tricare br br The Espionage Act of has been used to prosecute whistleblowers in the United States including Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning In Manning was convicted of violating the Espionage Act and sentenced to years in prison for leaking sensitive military documents to WikiLeaks The same year Snowden was charged with violating the Espionage Act for releasing confidential documents belonging to the NSA br Section of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Dodd Frank in the United States incentivizes and protects whistleblowers By Dodd Frank the U S Securities and Exchange Commission SEC financially rewards whistleblowers for providing original information about violations of federal securities laws that results in sanctions of at least M Additionally Dodd Frank offers job security to whistleblowers by illegalizing termination or discrimination due to whistleblowing The whistleblower provision has proven successful after the enactment of Dodd Frank the SEC charged KBR company and BlueLinx Holdings Inc company with violating the whistleblower protection Rule F by having employees sign confidentiality agreements that threatened repercussions for discussing internal matters with outside parties Former President Donald Trump announced plans to dismantle Dodd Frank in He created the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection as a part of the Department of Veterans Affairs which reportedly instead punished whistleblowers br The US Department of Labor s Whistleblower Protection Program can handle many types of retaliation claims based on legal actions an employee took or was perceived to take in the course of their employment Moreover in the United States if the retaliation occurred due to the perception of who the employee is as a person the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission may be able to accept a complaint of retaliation In an effort to overcome those fears in the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was put forth to provide great incentive to whistleblowers For example if a whistleblower gave information that could be used to legally recover over one million dollars then they could receive ten to thirty percent of it br Whistleblowers have risen within the technology industry as it has expanded in recent years Protection for these specific whistleblowers falls short they often end up unemployed or in jail The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act offers an incentive for private sector whistleblowers but only if they go to the SEC with information If a whistleblower acts internally as they often do in the technology industry they are not protected by the law Scandals such as the Dragonfly search engine scandal and the Pompliano lawsuit against Snapchat have drawn attention to whistleblowers in technology br The federally recognized National Whistleblower Appreciation Day is observed annually on July on the anniversary of the country s original whistleblower protection law br br br Other countries br In New Zealand workers are protected by the Protected Disclosures Protection of Whistleblowers Act which went into effect on July It replaces the Protected Disclosures Act br South Africa adopted comprehensive legal protections for whistleblowers with the Protected Disclosures Act of PDA The PDA was further strengthened by the passage of an Amendment Act in br A number of other countries have adopted comprehensive whistleblower laws including Ghana s Whistleblowers Act Act br South Korea Uganda br Kenya and Rwanda also have Whistleblower laws The European Court of Human Rights ruled in that whistleblowing was protected as freedom of expression br Nigeria set up a whistleblowing policy against corruption and other ills Nigeria formulated a Whistleblowing Policy

bill was presented to the National Assembly for consideration by President Muhammadu Buhari in May Buhari s term as President ends as of May br br br Advocacy for protection br Many NGOs advocate for stronger and more comprehensive legal rights and protections for whistleblowers Among them are the Government Accountability Project GAP Blueprint for Free Speech Public Concern at Work PCaW the Open Democracy Advice Centre or in France the Maison des Lanceurs d Alerte MLA An international network the Whistleblowing International Network WIN aimed at gathering these NGOs br Frank Serpico an NYPD whistleblower prefers to use the term lamp lighter to describe the whistleblower s role as a watchman The Lamplighter Project which aims to encourage law enforcement officers to report corruption and abuse of power and helps them do so is named based on Serpico s usage of the term br br br Methods used br Whistleblowers who may be at risk from those they are exposing are now using encryption methods and anonymous content sharing software to protect their identity Tor a highly accessible anonymity network is frequently used by whistleblowers around the world Tor has undergone a number of large security updates to protect the identities of potential whistleblowers who may wish to leak information anonymously br Recently specialized whistleblowing software like SecureDrop and GlobaLeaks has been built on top of the Tor technology to incentivize and simplify its adoption for secure whistleblowing br br br Whistleblowing hotline br In business whistleblowing hotlines are usually deployed to mitigate risk with the intention of providing secure anonymous reporting for employees or third party suppliers who may otherwise be fearful of reprisals from their employer As such implementing a corporate whistleblowing hotline is often seen as a step toward compliance and can also highlight an organization s stance on ethics It is widely agreed that implementing a dedicated service for whistleblowers has a positive effect on organizational culture br A whistleblowing hotline is sometimes also referred to as an ethics hotline or Speak Up hotline and is often facilitated by an outsourced service provider to encourage potential disclosers to come forward br In the Harvard Business Review published findings to support the idea that whistleblowing hotlines are crucial to
