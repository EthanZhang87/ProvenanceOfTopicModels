The Curtiss Wright Corporation is a manufacturer and services provider headquartered in Davidson North Carolina with factories and operations in and outside the United States Created in from the consolidation of Curtiss Wright and various supplier companies the company was immediately the country s largest aviation firm and built more than aircraft engines for the U S military during World War II br It no longer makes aircraft but does make many related components particularly actuators aircraft controls valves and it provides surface treatment services It supplies equipment to the commercial industrial defense and energy markets It makes parts for commercial and naval nuclear power systems industrial vehicles and oil and gas related machinery br br br History br br br Merger and expansion br Curtiss Wright formed on July the result of a merger of companies associated with Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company of Buffalo New York and Wright Aeronautical of Dayton Ohio It was headquartered in Buffalo New York With million in capital equivalent to billion in it became the largest aviation company in the United States br br By September Curtiss Wright had acquired the Moth Aircraft Corporation which primarily built de Havilland Moth aircraft under licence and the Travel Air Manufacturing Company br br br Divisions br There were three main divisions the Curtiss Wright Airplane Division which manufactured airframes the Wright Aeronautical Corporation which produced aircraft engines and the Curtiss Wright Propeller Division which manufactured propellers After most engines produced by the new company were known as Wrights Existing aircraft continued using the Curtiss name while new designs used either the Curtiss or Curtiss Wright name depending on which location they were designed by with a few exceptions br br br Pre World War II br Throughout the s Curtiss Wright designed and built aircraft for military commercial and private markets but it was the Wright engine division and the longstanding relationship with the U S military that helped the company through the difficult years of the Great Depression In the company developed the P fighter aircraft resulting in the largest peacetime aircraft order ever given by the Army Air Corps Curtiss Wright also sold the P abroad where they were used in the early days of World War II br br br War production br During World War II Curtiss Wright produced aircraft engines electric propellers and airplanes Curtiss Wright employed workers and ranked second among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts behind only General Motors br br Aircraft production included almost P fighters made famous by their use by Claire Chennault s Flying Tigers in China over C Commando transport aircraft and later in the war over SB C Helldivers Its most visible success came with the P variously known as the Tomahawk Kittyhawk and Warhawk which were built between and at the main production facilities in Buffalo New York During the war a second large plant was added at Buffalo followed by new plants at Columbus Ohio St Louis Missouri and Louisville Kentucky Engine and propeller production was at plants in New Jersey Pennsylvania and Ohio br In May the U S government assigned Curtiss Wright a defense production factory for wartime aircraft construction at Louisville Kentucky to produce C Caravan cargo aircraft which was constructed mostly of wood a non priority war material After difficulties with the C including a crash of a production model in mid as well as the realization that sufficient quantities of aluminum aircraft alloys would be available for war production plans for large scale C production were rejected br The Louisville plant was converted to C Commando production delivering Commandos to supplement the roughly C s produced at Buffalo The C cargo aircraft was fitted with two powerful radial engines and could fly at higher altitudes than most other Allied aircraft Consequently it was used extensively in the China Burma India Theater br br br Defective engines sold to U S military in World War II br From to the Curtiss Aeronautical plant in Lockland Ohio produced aircraft engines under wartime contract destined for installation in U S Army Air Forces aircraft Wright officials at Lockland insisted on high engine production levels resulting in a significant percentage of engines that did not meet Army Air Forces AAF inspection standards These defective engines were nevertheless approved by inspectors for shipment and installation in U S military aircraft After investigation it was later revealed that Wright company officials at Lockland had conspired with civilian technical advisers and Army inspection officers to approve substandard or defective aircraft engines for military use br br br Post World War II br br br Demise of aircraft production br Curtiss Wright failed to make the transition to design and production of jet aircraft despite several attempts During the war the company expended only small amounts on aircraft research and development instead concentrating on incremental improvements in conventional aircraft already in wartime production This was especially true in the first two years of the war Curtiss failure to research and develop more advanced wing and airframe designs provided an opening for North American Bell Lockheed Northrop and other U S aircraft manufacturers to win contracts from the Army and Navy for more advanced aircraft designs br The P the firm s last prop driven fighter design was merely an extrapolation of its s P Hawk offering no advantage over other designs already in service With the rapid development of jet engine technology and near supersonic flight this technological lag resulted in Curtiss losing a number of critical postwar military aircraft orders The final nail in the coffin was the choice of the Northrop F Scorpion over the XF Blackhawk After the F was cancelled in October Curtiss Wright shut down its entire Aeroplane Division and sold the assets to North American Aviation Curtiss Wright continued to occasionally venture back into the realm of designing aircraft such as the TDU B Skydart target drone and the X tilt rotor but none of these amounted to anything and by the early s Curtiss Wright was no longer an aircraft manufacturer br br br Flight research br While this marked Curtiss Wright s departure from preeminence in the aviation industry one notable spin off involved Curtiss Wright s flight research laboratory founded in near the main plant at the Buffalo airport During divestiture of the airframe division the lab was given to Cornell University along with a cash gift to finish the construction of a transonic wind tunnel Cornell Aeronautical Labs or CAL as it was known was eventually spun off from the university as a private company Calspan Corporation which has been responsible for numerous innovations in flight and safety research br br br Engine development br After the government gave the development of the Whittle jet engine to GE the company concentrated on reciprocating engines and propeller production for military transport and civilian airliners With the twilight of the big piston aircraft engine Curtiss Wright needed a new design direction and in Curtiss Wright licensed the Sapphire jet engine from Armstrong Siddeley in the U K and manufactured it as the Wright J It powered models of the Martin B and several U S fighter aircraft Subsequent derivative engines were late and did not find substantial markets br Curtiss Wright briefly licensed rights to the Wankel rotary engine from NSU in as a possible aircraft power plant For this project Curtiss Wright relied on the design leadership of NSU Wankel engineer Max Bentele br br br Flight simulators br In United Airlines bought four Curtiss Wright flight simulators at a cost of million These simulators were unlike earlier ones produced in the late s for airliners but now included visuals sound and movement They were the first of today s modern flight simulators for commercial aircraft br br br Business diversification and acquisition strategy br In financially strapped automaker Studebaker Packard Corporation entered into a management agreement with Curtiss Wright to allow the nation s fifth largest automobile manufacturer to avoid insolvency The relationship lasted until at which time Curtiss Wright withdrew from the agreement The shift of civilian aircraft to jets left the company with little of its old business and during the s it shifted to components for aircraft and other types of equipment such as nuclear submarines a business that continues today br In Curtiss Wright acquired Penny Giles a supplier of black boxes and sensing devices Hybrid linear hybrid rotary and VRVT sensors br In Curtiss Wright acquired Systran Corporation a supplier of specialized data communications products for real time systems primarily for the aerospace and defense industrial automation and medical image markets The acquisition also reintroduced Curtiss Wright to Dayton Ohio br In Curtiss Wright acquired Hybricon Corporation for million in cash Hybricon is a supplier of electronic packaging for the aerospace defense and commercial markets and provides electronic subsystem integration br In Curtiss Wright acquired Ireland based Acra Control for million in cash Acra Control is a supplier of data acquisition systems and networks data recorders and telemetry ground stations for both defense and commercial aerospace markets br At the beginning of Curtiss Wright acquired Exlar Corporation for million in cash Exlar a private company is a designer and manufacturer of highly engineered electric actuators used in motion control solutions in industrial and military markets The acquired business will operate within Curtiss Wright s Motion Control segment In October Curtiss Wright completed the acquisition of the Parvus Corporation a business unit of Eurotech S p A for million Parvus is a leading designer and manufacturer of rugged small form factor computers and communications subsystems for the aerospace defense homeland security and industrial markets br Curtiss Wright acquired military communications equipment supplier Pacific Star Communications for million on November br Curtiss Wright Corporation finalized the acquisition of D Holdings LLC D for million in cash Designing and manufacturing electronic systems subsystems and shipboard enclosures D is a contributor to major U S Navy shipbuilding programs including both nuclear and non nuclear powered vessels br In February Curtiss Wright Corporation NYSE CW completed the acquisition of Dyna Flo Control Valve Services Ltd Dyna Flo for million in cash br In January Curtiss Wright Corporation CW announced an agreement to acquire assets from Safran Aerosystems Arresting Company SAA a move aimed at expanding its presence in the military aircraft emergency arresting systems sector SAA a subsidiary of Safran Aerosystems specializes in designing and manufacturing aircraft emergency arresting systems and will operate within Curtiss Wright s Naval Power segment post acquisition The completion of the acquisition valued at million is contingent on regulatory approval and other closing conditions with expectations for finalization in the third quarter of The strategic acquisition of SAA is part of Curtiss Wright s efforts to enhance growth prospects and diversify its product portfolio With an anticipated positive impact on CW s earnings the million transaction is projected to contribute to a robust free cash flow conversion rate exceeding signaling a favorable liquidity position for the company in the future br In November CW has finalized the acquisition of Keronite Group Limited involving a cash transaction of million This strategic move is expected to enhance Curtiss Wright s capabilities in Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation PEO surface treatment services Operating within Curtiss Wright s Aerospace Industrial segment the acquisition is projected to have a neutral impact on the company s earnings in the initial year It is anticipated to yield a free cash flow conversion rate underscoring the robust liquidity position This strengthened financial position can be leveraged for profitable and revenue generating strategies br br br Products br br br Aircraft br br br Curtiss Electric propellers br As well as manufacturing engines a range of electrically
