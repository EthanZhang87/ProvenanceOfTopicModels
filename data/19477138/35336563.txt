Onto Innovation Inc is an American semiconductor company formed in from the merger of Rudolph Technologies Inc and Nanometrics Incorporated Onto Innovation is traded as NYSE ONTO on the New York Stock Exchange it is a provider of process and process control equipment and software for microelectronic manufacturing industries primarily semiconductor The company s product offering includes automated defect inspection and metrology systems probe card test and analysis systems and lithography step and repeat systems In addition Onto Innovation provides a broad range of software products designed to improve yield control processes and reduce manufacturing costs br br br History br br br Rudolph Research br Rudolph Technologies Inc RTI traces its origins to when Otto Curt Rudolph formed O C Rudolph Sons Inc Originally an importer of microscopes and scientific instruments this RTI predecessor was renamed in October to Rudolph Research Corporation The company designed optical equipment for laboratories and universities br The company Otto Rudolph established continued to evolve making breakthroughs in ellipsometry including the first production oriented ellipsometer for thin transparent film measurements The company continued development of its metrology products securing new patents along the way br br br Nanometrics br Nanometrics was founded in and was a pioneer and innovator in the field of optical metrology In the company started publicly trading br br br Formation of Rudolph Technologies br In June Richard Spanier Ph D chief executive officer of Rudolph Research forged a partnership agreement with Boston based Riverside Partners and New York based Liberty Partners who along with others invested in the company At that time Dr Spanier retired his active role in the company and semiconductor industry veteran Paul F McLaughlin was named as CEO In August the name of the company was changed to Rudolph Technologies Inc br In November RTI made its initial public offering of common stock Revenues grew dramatically reaching a record million A new facility opened early in the year and the company launched a new product the MetaPULSE line of copper film measurement tools br br br Rudolph Technologies br In July RTI agreed to acquire the Richardson Texas based defect control company ISOA Inc A spin off from Texas Tech University s International Center for Informatics Research ISOA had been licensing technology to the semiconductor industry for about years offering defect detection software The deal was completed in September with ISOA becoming RTI s Yield Metrology Group br Several months later RTI expanded into China by establishing an office in Shanghai s Pudong industrial area In subsequent years the company established additional offices in all semiconductor manufacturing regions of the world including Japan Europe South Korea Taiwan and Singapore br In a merger was completed with Minnesota based August Technology Corporation growing Rudolph s workforce to employees This acquisition brought Rudolph into the back end of the manufacturing process br In the company acquired the semiconductor business of Washington based Applied Precision LLC adding probe card test and analysis to the company s portfolio The acquisition of RVSI Inspection LLC and its Wafer Scanner inspection system was announced in Adventa Control Technologies Inc a provider of process control software was acquired in and an acquisition of MKS Instruments Inc s Yield Dynamics business was completed in Rudolph announced two acquisitions in NanoPhotonics GmbH Mainz Germany unpatterned wafer inspection and Azores Corp Wilmington MA Rudolph s entry into the advanced packaging and FPD lithography markets In Rudolph announced the acquisition of selected assets of Tamar Technology Newbury Park CA a supplier of D metrology technologies Rudolph acquired the inspection technology of Stella Alliance in adding patents to enhance its inspection capability br In November Rudolph announced the retirement of Paul F McLaughlin and appointment of Michael P Plisinski as CEO and Director br As of January Rudolph Technologies Inc had a market capitalization of about million br In January Voce Capital Management LLC in a letter to investors urged merging semiconductor equipment makers Rudolph Technologies Inc and Nanometrics Inc The merger eventually occurred and closed on October According to the Joint Proxy Statement announcing the terms of the merger talks began in the first quarter of and continuing into Nanometrics and Rudolph engaged in discussions concerning a potential business combination between the two companies to be structured as a merger of equals transaction which discussions between the parties are referred to as

merged with Nanometrics Incorporated to become Onto Innovation trading as NYSE ONTO br The company is now headquartered in Wilmington Massachusetts with additional U S operations in New Jersey Minnesota California Texas Oregon and Washington Manufacturing operations for inspection and some metrology products are consolidated in Minnesota most metrology manufacturing operations is in California stepper manufacturing is located in Wilmington Massachusetts br br br Products and services br br br Semiconductor fabrication packaging and testing br Semiconductor device fabrication is the process used to create the integrated circuits that are found in commonly used electronic devices and electrical equipment It is a multiple step process during which electronic circuits are gradually built by adding elements and layers of material on a substrate made of pure silicon or various compounds in the case of specialized applications hundreds of steps performed by specialized process tools are required before the wafer moves to a final packaging facility br The focus of packaging and assembly is to ensure an electrical connection from the die to the circuit board to encapsulate the package for mechanical integrity and to withstand thermal variations The era of slim form factor devices such as smart phones implies high level of functionality in very dense footprint Due to these requirements the challenges in packaging assembly and test have significantly increased and advanced packaging techniques such as bumping or through silicon via are necessary br
