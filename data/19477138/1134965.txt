Synaptics Incorporated is a publicly traded San Jose California based developer of human interface HMI hardware and software including touchpads for computer laptops touch display driver and fingerprint biometrics technology for smartphones and touch video and far field voice technology for smart home devices and automotives Synaptics sells its products to original equipment manufacturers OEMs and display manufacturers br Synaptics invented the computer touchpad the click wheel on the classic iPod Android phones touch sensors touch and display driver integrated chips TDDI and fingerprint sensors br br br History br br br br Federico Faggin and Carver Mead founded Synaptics in They used their research on neural networks and transistors on chips to build pattern recognition products In Synaptics patented a refined winner take all circuit for teaching neural networks how to recognize patterns and images The circuit uses basic physics principles in order to select the strongest signal from the different processors br In the company used the pattern recognition techniques it developed to build the world s first touchpad for laptop computers that allowed users to control the cursor and click with no additional mechanical buttons The pad was a replacement for trackballs and mice used at the time By Twinhead and Epson America had adopted Synaptics touchpad for their computers Epson with the ActionNote followed by Apple in and later by other computer manufacturers including Compaq and Dell br br br br In Francis Lee took over as CEO The company had an initial public offering in As adoption of the touchpad grew Synaptics sought to integrate the technology with other products In Apple debuted the iPod Mini and fourth generation iPod both featuring a scrolling click wheel that used Synaptics capacitive touch technology Synaptics also provided a similar but vertical click wheel for the Creative Zen Touch portable media player br In Synaptics sensors were featured in the Samsung B the first mobile phone to use capacitive touch technology In October Synaptics provided a live demonstration of the Onyx a concept smartphone with a color touchscreen enabled by its ClearPad touch controller technology The Onyx s touch sensor could tell the difference between a finger and a cheek preventing accidental inputs during calls The company s touch technology was used in LG s Prada phone in which was the world s first mobile phone with a capacitive touchscreen br In Synaptics announced the development of the Fuse concept smartphone It had touch sensitivity on the back of the phone the ability to interact with the phone by squeezing animated icons a user interface sensitive to the phone s orientation and tilt and haptic gestures br br br present br In the company appointed Rick Bergman to succeed Francis Lee as CEO br In Synaptics introduced the first pressure recognizing touchscreen which allowed multi finger and variable force input In late Synaptics acquired Validity Sensors a fingerprint sensor vendor adding fingerprint sensing technology to the company br Synaptics is a founding member of the FIDO Fast ID Online Alliance and the Universal Stylus Initiative USI br Synaptics acquired Renesas SP Drivers Inc a Japanese company specializing in chips that manage LCD displays in The acquisition enabled Synaptics to combine touch and display driver technologies into a single TDDI Touch and Display Driver Integration chip br In the company expanded into additional markets including automotive wearables and PC peripherals In July Synaptics announced a unique match in sensor fingerprint authenticator for laptops and other devices that authenticates the fingerprint within the chip br The company introduced its first optical based fingerprint sensor in December which would allow the sensor to be placed under smartphones glass displays rather than under a separate button After improving the technology the company sent it into full production a year later In January the Chinese company Vivo announced a smartphone featuring Synaptics optical fingerprint sensor This was the world s first full production smartphone with fingerprint authentication directly in the OLED display br In July Synaptics acquired Conexant Systems an Amazon Alexa partner that creates voice and audio software and silicon products for smart homes At the same time Synaptics acquired Marvell Technology Group s Multimedia Solutions unit which creates video and audio processing technology The two acquisitions were intended to aid Synaptics expansion into the Internet of things IoT market br In August the board of directors appointed Michael Hurlston as the new CEO Under Hurlston s leadership the company focused on growing its IoT business expanding from its focus on sensors on glass towards development of low power sensors to IoT devices br In July Synaptics acquired DisplayLink the developer of software and semiconductors that connect visual devices to computers br The company expanded its IoT portfolio through the acquisitions of Broadcom s wireless IoT business assets and manufacturing rights in July and DSP Group in December From the Broadcom acquisition Synaptics acquired Broadcom s existing wireless IoT assets as well as the development team and two products on the roadmap The company completed the acquisition of DSP Group a provider of chipsets for VoIP multimedia and digital cordless applications in December br br br Technology br As of July Synaptics held patents for human technologies Many Synaptics products are based on capacitive sensing technology sensing the electrical properties of the finger s touching the sensor as opposed to a resistive touchscreen Synaptics also has optical sensing technology br br br Products br br The company originally focused on developing touch technology products and later expanded into IoT technology As of the company develops and markets products for connectivity sensing and processing as well as touch and display drivers focused on the IoT market In addition to developing workspace technology such as docking stations Synaptics technology is used in devices including gaming systems media systems cars and virtual reality headsets br Its connectivity products include wireless connectivity such as Wi Fi and Bluetooth products and technology such as its wireless device communications protocol Matter which enables devices to operate together regardless of their different wireless interfaces Synaptics acquired DisplayLink in adding that company s hardware technology for docking stations and video conferencing and software for graphics connectivity to its products It also develops wired connection products such as converters for USB Type C to HDMI or DisplayPort for high resolution video display br The company continues to develop laptop computer touchpads fingerprint biometric technology for devices including cell phones and other types of touch sensors and display drivers Synaptics has also developed sensors for multiple parameters including temperature magnetic capacitive and inductive sensors that can be integrated into devices such as video game controllers wearable devices such as earbuds br The company develops a variety of types of chips including low power edge AI processors and system on chip SoC technology for devices such as smart home wireless devices headsets and for graphics connectivity for video displays It develops and markets sound processing chips for voice recognition used in voice controlled devices including far field voice DSPs br In addition to its processors it also develops display driver IC chips for technology such as VR headsets br br br See also br Alps Electric
