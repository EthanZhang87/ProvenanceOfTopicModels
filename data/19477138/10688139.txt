id: 10688139
In computing the term remote desktop refers to a software or operating system feature that allows a personal computer s desktop environment to be run remotely from one system usually a PC but the concept applies equally to a server or a smartphone while being displayed on a separate client device Remote desktop applications have varying features Some allow attaching to an existing user s session and remote controlling either displaying the remote control session or blanking the screen Taking over a desktop remotely is a form of remote administration br br br Overview br Remote access can also be explained as the remote control of a computer by using another device connected via the internet or another network This is widely used by many computer manufacturers and large businesses help desks for technical troubleshooting of their customer s problems br Remote desktop software captures the mouse and keyboard inputs from the local computer client and sends them to the remote computer server br The remote computer in turn sends the display commands to the local computer When applications with many graphics including video or D models need to be controlled remotely a remote workstation software that sends the pixels rather than the display commands must be used to provide a smooth like local experience br Remote desktop sharing is accomplished through a common client server model The client or VNC viewer is installed on a local computer and then connects via a network to a server component which is installed on the remote computer In a typical VNC session all keystrokes and mouse clicks are registered as if the client were actually performing tasks on the end user machine br Remote desktops also have a major advantage for security development companies are able to permit software engineers who may be dispersed geographically to operate and develop from a computer which can be held within the companies office or cloud environment br The target computer in a remote desktop scenario is still able to access all of its core functions Many of these core functions including the main clipboard can be shared between the target computer and remote desktop client br Since the onset of COVID the shift to remote work environments has led many to work from home with devices without enterprise IT support As a result these workers are reliant on remote desktop software to collaborate and keep their systems available and secure br br br Uses br A main use of remote desktop software is remote administration and remote implementation This need arises when software buyers are far away from their software vendor Most remote access software can be used for headless computers instead of each computer having its own monitor keyboard and mouse or using a KVM switch one computer can have a monitor keyboard mouse and remote control software and control many headless computers The duplicate desktop mode is useful for user support and education Remote control software combined with telephone communication can be nearly as helpful for novice computer users as if the support staff were actually there br Remote desktop software can be used to access a remote computer a physical personal computer to which a user does not have physical access but that can be accessed or interacted with Unlike servers remote computers are mainly used for peer to peer connections where one device is unattended A remote computer connection is generally only possible if both devices have a network connection br Since the advent of cloud computing remote desktop software can be housed on USB hardware devices allowing users to connect the device to any PC connected to their network or the Internet and recreate their desktop via a connection to the cloud This model avoids one problem with remote desktop software which requires the local computer to be switched on at the time when the user wishes to access it remotely It is possible with a router with C S VPN support and wake on LAN equipment to establish a virtual private network VPN connection with the router over the Internet if not connected to the LAN switch on a computer connected to the router then connect to it br Remote desktop products are available in three models hosted service software and appliance br Tech support scammers use remote desktop software to connect to their victim s computer and will often lock out the computer if the victim does not cooperate br br br Protocols br Remote desktop protocols include the following br br Apple Remote Desktop Protocol ARD Original protocol for Apple Remote Desktop on macOS machines br Appliance Link Protocol ALP a Sun Microsystems specific protocol featuring audio play and record remote printing remote USB accelerated video br HP Remote Graphics Software RGS a proprietary protocol designed by Hewlett Packard specifically for high end workstation remoting and collaboration br Independent Computing Architecture ICA a proprietary protocol designed by Citrix Systems br NX technology NX a proprietary protocol designed by NoMachine with open source derivatives available from other forked projects br PC over IP PCoIP a proprietary protocol used by VMware licensed from Teradici br Remote Desktop Protocol RDP a Windows specific protocol featuring audio and remote printing br Remote Frame Buffer Protocol RFB A framebuffer level cross platform protocol that VNC is based on br SPICE Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments remote display system built for virtual environments by Qumranet now Red Hat br Splashtop a high performance remote desktop protocol developed by Splashtop fully optimized for hardware H including Intel AMD chipsets NVIDIA ATI GPU APU Qualcomm Snapdragon and NVIDIA Tegra By optimizing for different profiles of media codecs Splashtop can deliver high frame rates with low latency and also low power consumption br Xpra a protocol originally developed for forwarding X application seamlessly with audio video remote printing etc extended to support Windows and macOS servers br X Window System X a well established cross platform protocol mainly used for displaying local applications X is network transparent br Wake on LAN a standard protocol for remotely waking up computers that are in low power mode turned off but still have access to a power source br br br Malicious variants br A remote access trojan RAT sometimes called creepware is a type of malware that controls a system through a remote network connection While desktop sharing and remote administration have many legal uses RAT connotes criminal or malicious activity A RAT is typically installed without the victim s knowledge often as payload of a Trojan horse and will try to hide its operation from the victim and from computer security software and other anti virus software br br br Notable examples br Back Orifice br Back Orifice br Beast Trojan br Bifrost br Blackshades br
