Nashville Tennessee LP is the world s largest producer of OSB and manufactures engineered wood building products LP products are sold to builders and homeowners through building materials distributors and dealers and retail home centers br As of LP has mills including in the United States six in Canada two in Chile and one in Brazil br br br History br LP was incorporated on January as part of a court ordered monopoly breakup of Georgia Pacific William H Hunt a vice chairman at Georgia Pacific was selected as Louisiana Pacific s first chairman In Harry A Merlo who had been CEO of LP since its foundation succeeded Hunt as chairman while remaining CEO For its first years Louisiana Pacific was based in Portland Oregon the LP headquarters were moved to Nashville in br LP acquired several lumber companies in California Oregon Montana Washington Missouri and Alabama and in it purchased the Fibreboard Corporation a manufacturer of products used in making furniture and cabinets In the company bought fifteen building material centers in southern California from Lone Star Industries which provided LP with much needed distribution centers br In the late s the company began manufacturing OSB by slicing logs into wafers mixing the wafers with resin and then pressing them into sheets Instead of relying on old growth timber LP found ways to make structural building products from small diameter fast growing trees First introduced under the trade name Waferwood this new product offered a less expensive stronger alternative to plywood sheathing and sub flooring After opening its first Inner Seal mill in LP advertised the product as the smart man s plywood LP also manufacturers industrial wood products such as hardboard and medium density fiberboard Along with wood products the company also produces cocoon cellulose insulation plywood and pulp manufacturing The company controls over acres of timberland and owns plants in states as well as in Canada and Ireland br Over the years LP has been associated with professional sports in different manners From the company owned the Portland Timbers soccer club in the defunct North American Soccer League NASL From it owned the naming rights to LP Field the stadium which houses the Tennessee Titans and Tennessee State University football teams in Nashville br br br Expansion during the s br LP s OSB products protected the company from some of the vicissitudes of the timber market Buoyed by this success the company soon expanded its line of products made from reconstituted wood to include I beams for floor joists and rafters These structural beams used half as much lumber as their solid wood counterparts yet were stronger and lighter LP also introduced a concrete form of Inner Seal and in began to market Inner Seal siding for the exterior of homes Driven by these breakthroughs a housing boom and a thriving remodeling and repair business that increased demand for its specialty building products LP s sales grew percent between and according to the Portland Oregonian During the same period its profits increased percent Moreover OSB products accounted for an escalating portion of the company s total sales Only six percent of sales in the Inner Seal line by amounted to almost percent of total sales volume LP s sales of lumber once the mainstay of the building industry decreased from to percent over the same period br In the company purchased Kirby Forest Industries and the California properties of Timber Realization Company From these transactions LP gained almost acres of timberland which helped balance the land taken in for Redwood National Park LP received a final payment of million from the government for this land in In LP bought Weather Guard Inc a manufacturer of housing insulation made from recycled newsprint as well as MiTek Wood Products a North Carolina based producer of laminated veneer lumber and engineered wood I beams br br br The early s br During sales and profits in the company s softwood lumber plywood and building products areas slumped due to weakening demand This situation was attributed to an economic downturn increasing concerns over the U S federal budget deficit and fears about the unsettled global geopolitical environment The construction industry suffered because of bankers reluctance to finance new projects and consumers decisions to delay home purchases Housing starts for fell to million the lowest level since and down percent from LP responded to these developments by curtailing production at many of its plants and increasing exports of its specialty building products br The pulp market also experienced slowing growth in After a four year period of rapidly rising prices pulp manufacturers then faced eroding profit margins due to worldwide economic problems and larger than normal inventories Although LP saw its own pulp sales and profits peak in mid and expected only a minor recovery in the company continued to operate three pulp manufacturing mills One mill supplied paper pulp to non integrated paper producers A second mill produced dissolving pulp for manufacturers of rayon and cellophane products The third and newest pulp mill using a bleached chemi thermo mechanical pump process revolutionized pulp production by eliminating the use of chlorine and operated in a completely closed system without discharge into neighboring water supplies This mill marketed its output to manufacturers of printing and writing papers br LP was able to rebound from the downturn of While its competitors struggled in the face of dwindling timber supplies LP enjoyed record sales in and Much of LP s growth in the s came through acquisition of other building materials companies such as ABTco in the eastern United States and Forex in eastern Canada br According to the Spokane Journal of Business LP was flourishing because it had vigorously developed alternatives to dimensional lumber and plywood Indeed Merlo told the Wall Street Journal that technology not old growth timber resources had proven to be the company s lifeblood Profits for were up percent from the previous year and in the company achieved an all time high of billion in sales By that year only one third of LP s sales came from dimensional lumber the studs and solid wood joists that frame houses while over half its revenue came from OSB products and another percent from engineered wood products and pulp br br br Lawsuits threaten Louisiana Pacific s future br Despite its many achievements LP encountered a number of serious obstacles in the s Foremost among these were lawsuits pertaining to its simulated cedar Inner Seal exterior siding During the s LP was the defendant in a major class action lawsuit over its OSB siding product known as Inner Seal manufactured from the early s through The company had initiated the class action lawsuit to speed up the process and according to the judge presiding over the case got the most money to the most people in the quickest amount of time based on my experience br Many homeowners alleged that Inner Seal siding which carried a year warranty began to rot prematurely discoloring disintegrating and even growing fungi The first claims surrounded the use of OSB panels on the roofs of homes in Florida Following Hurricane Andrew in some of these homes lost shingles exposing the OSB panels to heavy rains Reports claimed that the exposed OSB began to deteriorate Two years after the first suit LP had settled all related disputes LP re engineered the product now marketed as LPSmartSide and since has sold approximately billion square feet of SmartSide siding with no warranty claims for fungal decay br Class action suits brought by various collections of homeowners as well as the attorney general of Minnesota were filed against the Inner Seal siding Although LP admitted to no wrongdoing the company moved quickly to settle the cases At the close of LP had paid over million to settle OSB claims and between and the company paid out an additional million In LP committed at least million to a settlement with homeowners who had used the Inner Seal siding br In April LP implemented a Claimant Offer Program to speed payments to claimants In what was the largest class action lawsuit in the history of the siding industry LP paid out more than claims By the end of the settlement LP had paid almost billion to satisfy claims br LP s woes did not end there however In LP paid million to settle a class action lawsuit filed the previous year by LP shareholders who alleged that the company had violated securities laws by failing to disclose that the company s oriented strand boards were defective as the Portland Oregonian reported on December It was the largest securities settlement in Oregon history Also that year the company settled a sexual harassment suit against Merlo Moreover the state of Colorado brought a count indictment against LP in charging fraud and environmental violations at its plant in Montrose Colorado The same year LP s eight person board lost confidence in the ability of Merlo and his top two lieutenants to steer the Fortune company declared the August edition of the Portland Oregonian Merlo resigned and was replaced as chairman and CEO by Mark Suwyn a former executive at International Paper br br br Rebuilding in the late s br Under this new leadership LP began the difficult task of regrouping The year had been particularly difficult one in which the company endured a net loss of million The market for building products had sunk as an influx of Canadian lumber had flooded the United States High interest rates and poor weather which affected home building only exacerbated LP s problems Even more dangerous to LP however was the inauguration of several rival OSB mills As OSB increasingly replaced plywood as a basic construction material Inner Seal became less a specialty item exclusively made by LP and more of a building commodity br Faced with these new threats Suwyn implemented a multidimensional plan for recovery First the company strove to eliminate unprofitable operations In LP closed the Ketchikan Paper Company as well as plants and mills More closings followed in and and the company sold off a number of additional operations including the Weather Seal door and window division in All told LP sold over million of assets during the three year period The assets sales will do two things for us Suwyn told Business Wire They will provide us with additional financial flexibility to grow the company and allow us to focus all our management attention on becoming the premier supplier of building materials br Suwyn also concentrated on developing LP s specialty products lines As its past innovations had become industry standards and were imitated by numerous competitors it was essential for LP to launch new products that would give the company an edge over its rivals To further this goal LP engaged in a series of targeted acquisitions In LP purchased Associated Chemists a key supplier of specialty coatings to the wood products industry as well as GreenStone Industries a manufacturer of cellulose insulation and Tecton Laminates Corp a producer of laminated veneer lumber and wood I joists used in the construction industry Two years later LP acquired ABT Building Products Corporation a transaction it heralded as a way to expand its specialty products lines and complement its low cost commodity building products according to the Wall Street Journal In LP purchased Evans Forest Products Ltd a Canadian manufacturer of engineered wood and lumber products br In LP unveiled its Advanced Technology Center which provided the company with the facilities to conceive test and improve new offerings LP soon introduced a bevy of new product systems including Smart Start siding TechShield energy efficient structural panels TopNotch flooring and Cocoon insulation br A final prong of LP s rebuilding efforts involved improving operations In the company instituted an intensive employee training course Rapid Change Technologies designed to enhance workers communication skills and to empower them to accept new ideas with ease To increase productivity LP utilized Business Process Improvement technology to make its OSB mills more efficient LP also sought to bolster the company s relationship with large and national home center chains such as Home Depot and Lowe s These superstores represented the fastest growing segment of the building industry br The outcome of LP s vigorous reorganization was not immediately evident Sales for were percent lower than in and resulted in a net yearly loss of million Although the company again operated at a net loss of million in executives remained optimistic br In LP returned once more to profitability achieving million of net profit from billion in sales Reinforced by a strong housing market a booming economy operational improvements and greater numbers of specialty products Louisiana Pacific s future looked bright br br br Company restructuring in the early s br Louisiana Pacific
