Alcoa Corporation an acronym for Aluminum Company of America is a Pittsburgh based industrial corporation It is the world s eighth largest producer of aluminum Alcoa conducts operations in countries Alcoa is a major producer of primary aluminum fabricated aluminum and alumina combined through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry technology mining refining smelting fabricating and recycling br Alcoa emerged in as the brainchild of Charles Martin Hall with the funding of Alfred E Hunt and Arthur Vining Davis Alcoa was the first mass producer of aluminum Before Alcoa s formation aluminum was difficult to refine and as a result was more expensive than silver or gold In Hall discovered the Hall H roult process the first inexpensive technique for refining aluminum drastically reducing the price of aluminum while increasing its availability Hall approached Hunt and Davis to form a company to bring his process to market the three founded Alcoa as the Pittsburgh Reduction Company which expanded quickly Hunt died in after fighting in the Spanish American War The company changed its name to the Aluminum Company of America in Alcoa increased production by during World War I and was an essential supplier of aluminum in World War II br In the s Alcoa purchased numerous competitors including Reynolds Group Holdings makers of Reynolds Wrap On November Alcoa Inc split into two entities a new one called Alcoa Corporation which is engaged in the mining and manufacture of raw aluminum and the renaming of Alcoa Inc to Arconic Inc which processes aluminum and other metals Alcoa has been criticized for its lax environmental record but it no longer ranks highly as one of the worst polluters in the United States br br br History br br br Hall s patent br In Charles Martin Hall a graduate of Oberlin College discovered the process of smelting aluminum almost simultaneously with Paul H roult in France He realized that by passing an electric current through a bath of cryolite and aluminum oxide the then semi rare metal aluminum remained as a byproduct This discovery now called the Hall H roult process along with the Bayer process are the dominant processes for production of aluminum from bauxite ore br br Fewer than ten sites in the United States and Europe produced aluminum at the time In Hall agreed to try his process at the Electric Smelting and Aluminum Company plant in Lockport New York Still it was not used and Hall left after one year teaming up with Alfred E Hunt to form a new company br After graduating from Amherst College in Arthur Vining Davis joined the new venture because Arthur s father knew Alfred Hunt At the time aluminum sold at almost per pound making it too expensive to be used commercially They were determined to lower the cost of production using Charles Hall s ideas Hall Davis and others worked hour days together for months on the experiments Their first commercial aluminum pour was on Thanksgiving Day in br br br Pittsburgh Reduction Company br The Pittsburgh Reduction Company began with an experimental smelting plant on Smallman Street in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania with Hunt as president and Hall as vice president In the company began production in New Kensington Pennsylvania Davis was named general manager and appointed to the board of directors in In a third site opened at Niagara Falls br br br Hunt s departure br Hunt left the company in to fight in the Spanish American War While in Puerto Rico he contracted Malaria Less than a year after his return to the states he died from complications of the disease at age br By about after a settlement with Hall s former employer and while its patents were in force the company was the only legal supplier of aluminum in the United States br By New Kensington consisted of sq feet on acres with employees The company operated hydropower and reduction plants in Niagara Falls NY Shawinigan Falls Quebec Northern Aluminum Company mining operations in Bauxite AR and reduction facilities in East St Louis IL The Aluminum Company of America became the firm s new name on January Davis was named company president in when the acronym Alcoa was coined Hall remained a vice president until he died in It was given as a name to two of the locales where major corporate facilities were located although one of these has since been changed and in was adopted as the official corporate name br From until additional plants in Massena New York Alcoa Tennessee Edgewater New Jersey Badin North Carolina came online while New Kensington had buildings in the complex housing six departments tubes sheets rods bar and wire extrusion jobbing foil and two subsidiaries Aluminum Cooking Utensil Company and Aluminum Seal Company In it created the company town of Pine Grove New York for workers outside Massena In Badin Alcoa Maryville and other locations the company funded the construction of schools parks playgrounds and medical facilities br br br The World Wars br Historian George David Smith notes that war was good to Alcoa By the end of World War I Alcoa s New Kensington facility accounted for workers a fifth of the local population and covered over million square feet of manufacturing space on acres The war enabled Alcoa to increase production by and to export some ninety million pounds to the Western Allies br After WWI Alcoa obtained the rights to Alfred Wilm s duralumin patent which led to additional research into other aluminum alloys By Alcoa s New Kensington Pennsylvania plant was using horizontal extrusion presses with preheated billets for aerospace and construction applications One of the first industrial uses was for the Navy s Shenandoah followed ten years later with airplane applications The Northern Aluminum Company in Quebec was renamed the Aluminum Company of Canada ALCAN in They were responsible for the rapid development of Arvida Quebec a remote area km north of Quebec City Infrastructure was necessary to support the workforce required by the aluminum plant so the company funded the construction of schools parks playgrounds and medical facilities br Davis was named chairman of Alcoa s board of directors in and remained in that role for thirty years until his retirement br In the Justice Department charged Alcoa with illegal monopolization and demanded that the company be dissolved The case of United States v Alcoa was settled six years later br Aluminum products were of crucial use during World War II A German U Boat sank the SS Alcoa Puritan in as it carried a load of bauxite ore br br br Alumax br In Alcoa acquired Alumax in a cash and share deal for billion Alcoa paid a share in cash for half of the shares and Alcoa share for each of the remaining Alumax shares Alcoa

Economy Research Institute ranked Alcoa th among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States The ranking is based on the quantity million pounds in and toxicity of the emissions More recently Alcoa ranked first in the United States even though they had reduced their emissions to less than million pounds in Alcoa s most recently published ranking has dropped to nd based on data br In Alcoa was again included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices and was named as one of the top three most sustainable corporations in the world by Corporate Knights and Innovest Strategic Value Advisors at the World Economic Forum meeting br In April Alcoa Inc agreed to spend an estimated million to install a new coal fired power plant with state of the art pollution controls to eliminate the vast majority of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions from the power plant at Alcoa s aluminum production facility in Rockdale Texas The settlement was the ninth case the Bush administration pursued to bring the coal fired power plant industry into full compliance with the Clean Air Act Alcoa was unlawfully operating at the Rockdale facility since it overhauled the Rockdale power plant without installing necessary pollution controls and without first obtaining proper permits required by New Source Review program of the Clean Air Act br In February Alcoa cleaned soils and sediment contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls PCB and lead at the York Oil federal Superfund site in Moira New York in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency The site a former waste oil recycling storage facility accepted waste oil from several companies including Alcoa The facility was improperly managed and operated and as a result soils on the York Oil Property and nearby wetlands sediments and groundwater were contaminated The United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA issued a Superfund Unilateral Order on December requiring Alcoa to excavate treat and dispose of the contaminated wetlands sediments br br br Operations by country br br br Jamaica br Alcoa formed the Alcoa Minerals of Jamaica subsidiary on the island in shipping their first load of bauxite in from Rocky Point Later in Alcoa established a tonne per year refinery that processes bauxite into alumina They have continued to upgrade the plant through the years and it is now capable of tonnes per year In the Jamaican government gained a share in the subsidiary and renamed the operation to Jamalco Alcoa being the managing partner Expansion of the operation in resulted in Alcoa owning of the operation Alcoa continues to mine bauxite in the Jamaican parishes of Clarendon and Manchester while competitors operations occur in nearby parishes br br br Dominican Republic br In the s Alcoa negotiated with the Dominican Republic government concerning its bauxite mining operations The U S Department of State expressed concerns that the Dominican Republic might follow Jamaica s lead in imposing higher taxes on Alcoa s operations This period was marked by intense discussions and negotiations regarding the taxation and revenue from bauxite mining highlighting the complexities of international business operations and the impact of global commodity markets on local economies br Alcoa Road also known as El Aceitillar is a significant part of Alcoa s legacy in the Dominican Republic Originally constructed for a bauxite mine it now leads to Sierra de Bahoruco National Park This area offers an opportunity to observe endemic species and serves as a reminder of the environmental dimensions of industrial operations Alcoa Road s transition from an access route for mining to a gateway for environmental observation underscores the evolving relationship between industry and conservation br br br Ghana br Alcoa s affiliate in Ghana the Volta Aluminum Company was completely closed between May and early due to problems with its electricity supply br br br Guinea br Alcoa is a major owner of the Compagnie des Bauxites de Guin e through Halco Mining together with Rio Tinto Alcan and the Guinean government Guinea is the second global producer of bauxite

greenfield smelter in more than years albeit under heavy criticism by local and international NGOs related to a controversial dam project exclusively dedicated to supplying electricity to this smelter br The Fjar a l smelter in eastern Iceland was completed in June and brought into full operation the following April The plant processes tons of aluminum a day with a capacity of metric tons a year making it Alcoa s second largest capacity smelter For power the plant relies on the K rahnj kar Hydropower Plant constructed and operated by the state owned Landsvirkjun specifically for the smelting operation That project was subject to controversy due to its impact on the environment br In Alcoa and the government of Iceland signed an agreement on instigating a thorough feasibility study for a new tpy Tons Per Year smelter in Bakki by H sav k in Northern Iceland In October the proposed project was dropped because the power availability and proposed pricing would not support an aluminum smelter br Alcoa announced plans to close the office in Reykjavik br br br Russia br In Alcoa acquired two major production facilities in Russia at Samara and Belaya Kalitva br br br Wales br On November Alcoa announced that it planned to close the Waunarlwydd works in Swansea with the loss of jobs Production ceased at the Swansea plant on January A small site closure team worked until
