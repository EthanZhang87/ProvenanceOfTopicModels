and Gwenda Evans Both of his parents were from Llanelli His father was an engineer who worked for the local electricity board and subsequently worked for the electronics company Plessey Evans has an elder brother called Richard often called Dik and a younger sister called Gillian and is a cousin of actress Juliet Aubrey The family initially lived in Chadwell Heath Around Garvin was offered a promotion which took the family to Dublin During his childhood in Dublin Evans talked in two different accents using a Welsh accent at home and an Irish accent whenever he was outside He later said The reason for this dual identity was mainly to be understood by my peers but also to be accepted He later commented that there were times of frustration for him growing up in a Catholic country and this may have played a part in his musical development Evans has retained his British citizenship into adulthood br Evans received his initial formal education at St Andrew s National School in Malahide As a child he also received piano and guitar lessons and practised music with Dik He received his first guitar at the age of seven when his mother bought him a Spanish guitar He did not know how to properly tune it or hold it and referred to it as little more than a toy but he was fascinated by how cool it was At the age of nine the first proper guitar came to the Evans household when his mother purchased an old acoustic guitar at a jumble sale for a pound He and Dik both experimented with this instrument replacing the rusty wire strings with nylon ones and learning to properly play it The Edge said in of this early experimentation Me and my elder brother Dik both played it plonking away all very rudimentary stuff open chords and all that br br br Musical career br br br U br br br While the Evans brothers were at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin in they went along to a meeting in response to an advert posted by another pupil Larry Mullen Jr on the school s noticeboard seeking musicians to form a new band with him Among the several other pupils who also responded to the note were Paul Bono Hewson and Adam Clayton The band went through a number of reformations before becoming known as U in March Richard Evans having left before this to join another band leaving his younger brother as the lead guitarist br Early in the band s career Evans was given the nickname the Edge by members of the Lypton Village surrealist street gang to which Bono belonged The nickname is commonly believed to be derived from the angular shape of Evans head However the origin of the name is disputed and other theories include a description of his guitar playing and his preference for not becoming fully involved and therefore remaining on the edge of things br br U began its public performance life in small venues in Dublin in occasionally playing at other venues elsewhere in Ireland In December they performed their first concerts outside Ireland in London and in began extensive touring across the British Isles developing a following Their debut album Boy was released in br In leading up to the October Tour the Edge came very close to leaving U for religious reasons but he decided to stay During this period he became involved with a group called the Shalom Fellowship with which Bono and Mullen were also involved Shortly after deciding to remain with the band he wrote a piece of music that later became Sunday Bloody Sunday br br br Other musical pursuits br In addition to his regular role within U the Edge has also recorded with such artists as Johnny Cash B B King Tina Turner Ronnie Wood Jah Wobble Holger Czukay Jay Z and Rihanna Through his working relationships with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois the Edge connected with Michael Brook the creator of the infinite guitar and collaborated with him on the score to the film Captive The soundtrack included the song Heroine the vocal of which was co written and sung by a young Sin ad O Connor Larry Mullen Jr played drums on the track br br The Edge has collaborated with U bandmate Bono on numerous musical projects outside of the group They wrote the musical score for the Royal Shakespeare Company s London stage adaptation of A Clockwork Orange which opened in The duo also wrote the eponymous theme song of the James Bond film GoldenEye which was performed by Tina Turner The Edge and Bono ventured into theatre again when they composed the music and lyrics for the musical Spider Man Turn Off the Dark which opened in A single titled Rise Above by Reeve Carney featuring Bono and the Edge was released digitally from the musical s soundtrack The music video was released on July The Edge and Bono collaborated with Dutch DJ Martin Garrix on the song We Are the People which served as the official song of the UEFA Euro tournament and was released on May br The Edge wrote the theme song for seasons one and two of The Batman which aired in and respectively br In the Edge participated in the Davis Guggenheim directed documentary film It Might Get Loud The film examines the history of the electric guitar focusing on the careers and styles of the Edge Jimmy Page and Jack White The film premiered on September at the Toronto International Film Festival br On April the Edge performed in the Sistine Chapel as part of a conference for the Angiogenesis Foundation making him the first rock artist to stage a concert at the site br In the Edge was a guest musician on the songs Train with No Station and Noche Oscura for the album Los Angeles by Lol Tolhurst Budgie and Jacknife Lee br br br Musical style br br br Guitar playing br The Edge s style of playing guitar is distinguished by his chiming timbres echoing notes sparse voicings and extensive use of effects units He favours the perfect fifth interval and often plays chords consisting of just two notes the fifth and the root note while eliminating the third This style is not explicitly in a major or minor key but implies both creating a musical ambiguity For these chords he often plays the same notes on multiple strings some of which are left open creating an Irish influenced drone Against this drone he changes other notes to imply a harmony Among the Edge s signature techniques are playing arpeggios sixteenth note percussive strumming and harmonics the latter of which he described as so pure and finely focused that they have the incredible ability to pierce through their environment of sound just like lightning Author Henrik Marstal said that his use of harmonics and chiming timbres emulates the concept of bell ringing and embod ies a spiritual dimension br The Edge takes a relatively understated approach to guitar playing viewing notes as expensive and preferring to play simple parts that best serve their song He eschews virtuosity in favour of atmospherics subtlety minimalism and clever signal processing according to Guitar Player Rather than emulate common playing styles the Edge is interested in tearing up the rule book and finding new ways to approach the instrument He cited guitarists such as Tom Verlaine of Television John McGeoch Rory Gallagher and Patti Smith as some of his strongest influences Marstal speculated that the Edge also found points of reference in the playing styles of guitarists John McKay Stuart Adamson Stephen Fellows Keith Levene and Robert Smith br br The Edge s guitar sound is frequently modulated with a delay set to a dotted eighth note for rhythmic effect After acquiring his first delay pedal the Electro Harmonix Memory Man he became fascinated with how to use its return echo to fill in notes that he s not playing like two guitar players rather than one The effect unit became a mainstay in his guitar rig and had a significant impact on the band s creative output The Edge became known for his extensive use of effects units and for his meticulous nature in crafting specific sounds and guitar tones from his equipment choices Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page called him a sonic architect while Neil McCormick described him as an effects maestro Critics have variously referred to the Edge s guitar sounds as evoking the image of fighter planes on Bullet the Blue Sky resembling a dentist s drill on Love Is Blindness and resembling an airplane turbine on Mofo The Edge said that rather than using effects merely to modify his sound he uses them to spark ideas during his songwriting process br br The Edge developed his playing style during his teenage years partially as a result of him and Mullen trying to accommodate the eccentric bass playing of Clayton by being the timekeepers of the band In their early days the Edge s only guitar was his Gibson Explorer Limited Edition which became a signature of the group However he found the sound of the Explorer s bass strings unsatisfactory and avoided them in his playing early on resulting in a trebly sound He said by focusing on one area of the fretboard he was developing a very stylized way of doing something that someone else would play in a normal way Other equipment choices contribute to the Edge s unique sound His Vox AC Top Boost amplifier housed in a s cabinet is favoured for its sparkle tone and is the basis for his sound both in the studio and live The Edge has also used plectrums manufactured by the German company Herdim that he turns sideways or upside down so the dimpled grip strums against the strings resulting in a rasping top end to his guitar tone br About his playing style the Edge said in br br I like a nice ringing sound on guitar and most of my chords I find two strings and make them ring the same note so it s almost like a string sound So for E I might play a B E E and B and make it ring It works very well with the Gibson Explorer br br br Vocals br br The Edge provides the backing vocals for U Their live album and video release Under a Blood Red Sky and U Live at Red Rocks Under a Blood Red Sky are good reference points for his singing as are the live DVDs from the Elevation Tour U Go Home Live from Slane Castle and Elevation Live from Boston For example he sings the chorus to Sunday Bloody Sunday Bono harmonises on the final Sunday U used this tradeoff technique later in Bullet the Blue Sky as well His backing vocals are sometimes in the form of a repeated cry examples of songs that use this approach include Beautiful Day New Year s Day and Stay Faraway So Close Another technique he uses in his backing vocals is the falsetto in songs such as Stuck in a Moment You Can t Get Out Of Sometimes You Can t Make It on Your Own A Man and a Woman The Wanderer live versions of The Fly and Window in the Skies br The Edge sings the lead vocal on Van Diemen s Land and Numb the first half of the song Seconds dual vocals with Bono in Discotheque and the bridge in the song Miracle Drug He also sings the occasional lead vocal in live renditions of other songs such as Sunday Bloody Sunday during the PopMart Tour and Party Girl during the Rotterdam Zoo TV show when it was Bono s birthday and has sung the second verse of the Stand by Me cover on a few shows A solo acoustic version of the song Love is Blindness which is featured in the documentary film From the Sky Down is sung by him as well br br br Other instruments br He has played keyboards on many of the band s songs including I Fall Down October So Cruel New Year s Day Running to Stand Still Miss Sarajevo The Hands that Built America and Original of the Species and others In live versions of New Year s Day The Unforgettable Fire Your Blue Room Moment of Surrender and Raised By Wolves he plays both the piano and guitar parts alternately In most live versions of Original of the Species piano is the only instrument played during the song Although the Edge is the band s lead guitarist he occasionally plays bass guitar including the live performances of the song where the Edge and bassist Adam Clayton switch instruments br br br

Dublin s two star bedroom Clarence Hotel and converted it into a five star bedroom hotel In they sold the hotel leasehold but they continue to own the building with Paddy McKillen Sr br Evans has been criticised for his efforts to build five luxury mansions on a acre hectare plot of land in Malibu California The California Coastal Commission voted against his plans The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy agreed to remain neutral on the issue following a million donation from Evans and a commitment to designate acres of the land as open space for public footpaths br The Edge reportedly has a net worth of million br br br Discography br br br Philanthropy br br The Edge Bob Ezrin and Henry Juszkiewicz co founded Music Rising in a charity that helped provide replacement instruments for
