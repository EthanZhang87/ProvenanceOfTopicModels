furniture so they sold their furniture store in Kelowna and went into the auction business full time br Ritchie Bros Auctioneers established one of the trademarks of its auctions at the Radium Hot Springs auction It was raining on the day of the auction Instead of making the bidders walk around in the rain during the auction they set up the auction under the eaves of a nearby shop and drove the equipment in to be sold piece by piece The crowd stayed dry and the ramp and stage method became a fixture at Ritchie Bros auctions thereafter br br br years of unreserved industrial auctions br On June Ritchie Bros celebrated years since the company s first major unreserved industrial auction in Radium Hot Springs British Columbia It was at this Radium Hot Springs auction that Ritchie Bros adopted the ramp and stage approach for selling all mobile equipment This approach involves a staging area designed as a ramp located in front of a viewing theater where bidders sit waiting for mobile equipment to come to center stage Each piece of equipment is numbered and once it comes to rest at the center of the ramp the auctioneer begins asking for bids The crowd of bidders signals their bid increments to roving bid catchers who in turn signal the auctioneer when a bid is made The auctioneer increases the call price until there are no more bids being placed At a Ritchie Bros auction bids are called until no more are forthcoming in approximately one minute when the auctioneer calls that the item has been sold to the highest bidder br The company has pioneered the ramp and stage method
