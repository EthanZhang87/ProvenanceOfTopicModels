Office and Office do not comply with GDPR the European law which regulates data protection and privacy for all citizens in and outside the EU and EFTA region The investigation was initiated by the observation that Microsoft does not reveal or share publicly any data collected about users of its software In addition the company does not provide users of its Office software an option to turn off diagnostic and telemetry data sent back to the company Researchers found that most of the data that the Microsoft software collects and sends home is diagnostics Researchers also observed that Microsoft seemingly tried to make the system GDPR compliant by storing Office documents on servers based in the EU However they discovered the software packages collected additional data that contained private user information some of which was stored on servers located in the US The Netherlands Ministry of Justice hired Privacy Company to probe and evaluate the use of Microsoft Office products in the public sector Microsoft systematically collects data on a large scale about the individual use of Word Excel PowerPoint and Outlook Covertly without informing people researchers of the Privacy Company stated in their blog post Microsoft does not offer any choice with regard to the amount of data or possibility to switch off the collection or ability to see what data are collected because the data stream is encoded br The researchers commented that there is no need for Microsoft to store information such as IPs and email addresses which are collected automatically by the software Microsoft should not store these transient functional data unless the retention is strictly necessary for example for security purposes the researchers conclude in the final report by the Netherlands Ministry of Justice br As a result of this in depth study and its conclusions the Netherlands regulatory body concluded that Microsoft has violated GDPR on many counts including lack of transparency and purpose limitation and the lack of a legal ground for the processing Microsoft has provided the Dutch authorities with an improvement plan that should satisfy Dutch regulators that it would end all violations The Dutch regulatory body is monitoring the situation and states that If progress is deemed insufficient or if the improvements offered are unsatisfactory SLM Microsoft Rijk will reconsider its position and may ask the Dutch Data Protection Authority to carry out a prior consultation and to impose enforcement measures When asked for a response by an IT professional publication a Microsoft spokesperson stated We are committed to our customers privacy putting them in control of their data and ensuring that Office ProPlus and other Microsoft products and services comply with GDPR and other applicable laws We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our diagnostic data handling practices in Office ProPlus with the Dutch Ministry of Justice and look forward to a
