id: 4696394
A password manager is a computer program that allows users to store and manage their passwords for local applications or online services such as web applications online shops or social media A web browser generally has a built in version of a password manager These have been criticized frequently as many have stored the passwords in plaintext allowing hacking attempts br Password managers can generate passwords and fill online forms Password managers may exist as a mix of computer applications mobile applications or as web browser extensions br A password manager may assist in generating passwords storing passwords usually in an encrypted database Aside from passwords these applications may also store data such as credit card information addresses and frequent flyer information br The main purpose of password managers is to alleviate a cyber security phenomenon known as password fatigue where an end user can become overwhelmed from remembering multiple passwords for multiple services and which password is used for what service br Password managers typically require a user to create and remember one master password to unlock and access all information stored in the application Password managers may choose to integrate multi factor authentication through fingerprints or through facial recognition software Although this is not required to use the application browser extension br br br History br The first password manager software designed to securely store passwords was Password Safe created by Bruce Schneier which was released as a free utility on September Designed for Microsoft Windows Password Safe used Schneier s Blowfish algorithm to encrypt passwords and other sensitive data Although Password Safe was released as a free utility due to U S cryptography export restrictions in place at the time only U S and Canadian citizens and permanent residents were initially allowed to download it As Google Chrome became the most used browser the built in Google Password Manager became the most used password manager as of December br br br Types br Password managers come in various forms each offering distinct advantages and disadvantages Here s a breakdown of the most common types br br Browser based password managers br These are built directly into web browsers like Chrome Safari Firefox and Edge They offer convenient access for basic password management on the device where the browser is used However some may lack features like secure syncing across devices or strong encryption br Local password managers br These are standalone applications installed on a user s device They offer strong security as passwords are stored locally but access may be limited to that specific device Popular open source options include KeepassXC KeePass and Password Safe br Cloud based password managers br These store passwords in encrypted form on remote servers allowing access from supported internet connected devices They typically offer features like automatic syncing secure sharing and strong encryption Examples include Password Bitwarden and Dashlane br Enterprise password managers br Designed for businesses these cater to managing access credentials within an organization They integrate with existing directory services and access control systems often offering advanced features like role based permissions and privileged access management Leading vendors include CyberArk and Delinea formerly Thycotic br Hardware password managers br These physical devices often USB keys provide an extra layer of security for password management Some function as secure tokens for account database access such as Yubikey and OnlyKey while others also offer offline storage for passwords such as OnlyKey br br br Vulnerabilities br br br Weak vault storage br Some applications store passwords as an unencrypted file leaving the passwords easily accessible to malware or people attempted to steal personal information br br br Master password as single point failure br Some password managers require a user selected master password or passphrase to form the key used to encrypt passwords stored for the application to read The security of this approach depends on the strength of the chosen password which may be guessed through malware and also that the passphrase itself is never stored locally where a malicious program or individual could read it A compromised master password may render all of the protected passwords vulnerable meaning that a single point of entry can compromise the confidentiality of sensitive information This is known as a single point of failure br br br Device security dependency br While password managers offer robust security for credentials their effectiveness hinges on the user s device security If a device is compromised by malware like Raccoon which excels at stealing data the password manager s protections can be nullified Malware like keyloggers can steal the master password used to access the password manager granting full access to all stored credentials Clipboard sniffers can capture sensitive information copied from the manager and some malware might even steal the encrypted password vault file itself In essence a compromised device with password stealing malware can bypass the security measures of the password manager leaving the stored credentials vulnerable br As with password authentication techniques key logging or acoustic cryptanalysis may be used to guess or copy the master password Some password managers attempt to use virtual keyboards to reduce this risk though this is still vulnerable to key loggers that take the keystrokes and send what key was pressed to the person people trying to access confidential information br br br Cloud based storage br Cloud based password managers offer a centralized location for storing login credentials However this approach raises security concerns One potential vulnerability is a data breach at the password manager itself If such an event were to occur attackers could potentially gain access to a large number of user credentials A security incident involving LastPass exemplifies this risk br br br Password generator security br Some password managers may include a password generator Generated passwords may be guessable if the password manager uses a weak method of randomly generating a seed that all passwords generated by this program There are documented cases like the one with Kaspersky Password Manager in where a flaw in the password generation method resulted in predictable passwords br br br Others br A paper by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University found that while browsers refuse to autofill passwords if the login page protocol differs from when the password was saved HTTP vs HTTPS some password managers insecurely filled passwords for the unencrypted HTTP version of saved passwords for encrypted HTTPS sites Additionally most managers lacked protection against iframe and redirection based attacks potentially exposing additional passwords when password synchronization was used across multiple devices br br br Blocking of password managers br br Various high profile websites have attempted to block password managers often backing down when publicly challenged Reasons cited have included protecting against automated attacks protecting against phishing blocking malware or simply denying compatibility The Trusteer client security software from IBM features explicit options to block password managers br Such blocking has been criticized by information security professionals as making users less secure The typical blocking implementation involves setting autocomplete off on the relevant password web form br This option is now consequently ignored on encrypted sites such as Firefox Chrome and Safari from about br br br See also br List of password managers br Password fatigue br Password management br Security token br
