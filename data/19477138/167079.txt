A smartphone often simply called a phone is a mobile device that combines the functionality of a traditional mobile phone with advanced computing capabilities It typically has a touchscreen interface allowing users to access a wide range of applications and services such as web browsing email and social media as well as multimedia playback and streaming Smartphones have built in cameras GPS navigation and support for various communication methods including voice calls text messaging and internet based messaging apps br Smartphones are distinguished from older design feature phones by their more advanced hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems access to the internet business applications mobile payments and multimedia functionality including music video gaming radio and television br Smartphones typically contain a number of metal oxide semiconductor MOS integrated circuit IC chips include various sensors that can be leveraged by pre installed and third party software such as a magnetometer a proximity sensor a barometer a gyroscope an accelerometer and more and support diverse wireless communication protocols such as LTE G NR Wi Fi Bluetooth and satellite navigation In the mid s smartphone manufacturers have begun to integrate satellite messaging connectivity and satellite emergency services into devices for use in remote regions where there is no reliable cellular network br Following the rising popularity of the iPhone in the late s the majority of smartphones have featured thin slate like form factors with large capacitive touch screens with support for multi touch gestures rather than physical keyboards Most modern smartphones have the ability for users to download or purchase additional applications from a centralized app store They often have support for cloud storage and cloud synchronization and virtual assistants br Smartphones have largely replaced personal digital assistant PDA devices handheld palm sized PCs portable media players PMP point and shoot cameras camcorders and to a lesser extent handheld video game consoles e reader devices pocket calculators and GPS tracking units br Since the early s improved hardware and faster wireless communication due to standards such as LTE and G NR have bolstered the growth of the smartphone industry As of over a billion smartphones are sold globally every year In alone billion smartphone units were shipped worldwide percent of the world population were smartphone users as of br br br History br br Early smartphones were marketed primarily towards the enterprise market attempting to bridge the functionality of standalone PDA devices with support for cellular telephony but were limited by their bulky form short battery life slow analog cellular networks and the immaturity of wireless data services These issues were eventually resolved with the exponential scaling and miniaturization of MOS transistors down to sub micron levels Moore s law the improved lithium ion battery faster digital mobile data networks Edholm s law and more mature software platforms that allowed mobile device ecosystems to develop independently of data providers br In the s NTT DoCoMo s i mode platform BlackBerry Nokia s Symbian platform and Windows Mobile began to gain market traction with models often featuring QWERTY keyboards or resistive touchscreen input and emphasizing access to push email and wireless internet br br br Forerunner br br In the early s IBM engineer Frank Canova realised that chip and wireless technology was becoming small enough to use in handheld devices The first commercially available device that could be properly referred to as a smartphone began as a prototype called Angler developed by Canova in while at IBM and demonstrated in November of that year at the COMDEX computer industry trade show A refined version was marketed to consumers in by BellSouth under the name Simon Personal Communicator In addition to placing and receiving cellular calls the touchscreen equipped Simon could send and receive faxes and emails It included an address book calendar appointment scheduler calculator world time clock and notepad as well as other visionary mobile applications such as maps stock reports and news br The IBM Simon was manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric which integrated features with its own cellular radio technologies It featured a liquid crystal display LCD and PC Card support The Simon was commercially unsuccessful particularly due to its bulky form factor and limited battery life using NiCad batteries rather than the nickel metal hydride batteries commonly used in mobile phones in the s or lithium ion batteries used in modern smartphones br The term smart phone in two words was not coined until a year after the introduction of the Simon appearing in print as early as describing AT T s PhoneWriter Communicator br The term smartphone as one word was first used by Ericsson in to describe a new device concept the GS br br br PDA phone hybrids br br Beginning in the mid to late s many people who had mobile phones carried a separate dedicated PDA device running early versions of operating systems such as Palm OS Newton OS Symbian or Windows CE Pocket PC These operating systems would later evolve into early mobile operating systems Most of the smartphones in this era were hybrid devices that combined these existing familiar PDA OSes with basic phone hardware The results were devices that were bulkier than either dedicated mobile phones or PDAs but allowed a limited amount of cellular Internet access PDA and mobile phone manufacturers competed in reducing the size of devices The bulk of these smartphones combined with their high cost and expensive data plans plus other drawbacks such as expansion limitations and decreased battery life compared to separate standalone devices generally limited their popularity to early adopters and business users who needed portable connectivity br In March Hewlett Packard released the OmniGo LX a modified HP LX palmtop PC with a Nokia mobile phone piggybacked onto it and ROM based software to support it It had a resolution CGA compatible four shade gray scale LCD screen and could be used to place and receive calls and to create and receive text messages emails and faxes It was also DOS compatible allowing it to run thousands of existing software titles including early versions of Windows br br In August Nokia released the Nokia Communicator a digital cellular PDA based on the Nokia with an integrated system based on the PEN GEOS operating system from Geoworks The two components were attached by a hinge in what became known as a clamshell design with the display above and a physical QWERTY keyboard below The PDA provided e mail calendar address book calculator and notebook applications text based Web browsing and could send and receive faxes When closed the device could be used as a digital cellular telephone br In June Qualcomm released the pdQ Smartphone a CDMA digital PCS smartphone with an integrated Palm PDA and Internet connectivity br Subsequent landmark devices included br br The Ericsson R December by Ericsson Mobile Communications the first phone running the operating system later named Symbian it ran EPOC Release which was renamed Symbian OS at Release It had PDA functionality and limited Web browsing on a resistive touchscreen utilizing a stylus While it was marketed as a smartphone users could not install their own software on the device br The Kyocera February a dual nature device with a separate Palm OS PDA operating system and CDMA mobile phone firmware It supported limited Web browsing with the PDA software treating the phone hardware as an attached modem br The Nokia Communicator June the first phone running Symbian Release with Nokia s Series platform v This was the first Symbian phone platform allowing the installation of additional applications Like the Nokia Communicator it is a large clamshell device with a full physical QWERTY keyboard inside br Handspring s Treo the first smartphone that fully integrated the Palm OS on a GSM mobile phone having telephony SMS messaging and Internet access built into the OS The model had a thumb type keyboard and the g version had a Graffiti handwriting recognition area instead br br br Japanese cell phones br br In Japanese wireless provider NTT DoCoMo launched i mode a new mobile internet platform which provided data transmission speeds up to kilobits per second and access web services available through the platform such as online shopping NTT DoCoMo s i mode used cHTML a language which restricted some aspects of traditional HTML in favor of increasing data speed for the devices Limited functionality small screens and limited bandwidth allowed for phones to use the slower data speeds available The rise of i mode helped NTT DoCoMo accumulate an estimated million subscribers by the end of and ranked first in market capitalization in Japan and second globally br Japanese cell phones increasingly diverged from global standards and trends to offer other forms of advanced services and smartphone like functionality that were specifically tailored to the Japanese market such as mobile payments and shopping near field communication NFC allowing mobile wallet functionality to replace smart cards for transit fares loyalty cards identity cards event tickets coupons money transfer etc downloadable content like musical ringtones games and comics and seg mobile television Phones built by Japanese manufacturers used custom firmware however and did not yet feature standardized mobile operating systems designed to cater to third party application development so their software and ecosystems were akin to very advanced feature phones As with other feature phones additional software and services required partnerships and deals with providers br The degree of integration between phones and carriers unique phone features non standardized platforms and tailoring to Japanese culture made it difficult for Japanese manufacturers to export their phones especially when demand was so high in Japan that the companies did not feel the need to look elsewhere for additional profits br The rise of G technology in other markets and non Japanese phones with powerful standardized smartphone operating systems app stores and advanced wireless network capabilities allowed non Japanese phone manufacturers to finally break in to the Japanese market gradually adopting Japanese phone features like emojis mobile payments NFC etc and spreading them to the rest of the world br br br Early smartphones br br Phones that made effective use of any significant data connectivity were still rare outside Japan until the introduction of the Danger Hiptop in which saw moderate success among U S consumers as the T Mobile Sidekick Later in the mid s business users in the U S started to adopt devices based on Microsoft s Windows Mobile and then BlackBerry smartphones from Research In Motion American users popularized the term CrackBerry in due to the BlackBerry s addictive nature In the U S the high cost of data plans and relative rarity of devices with Wi Fi capabilities that could avoid cellular data network usage kept adoption of smartphones mainly to business professionals and early adopters br Outside the U S and Japan Nokia was seeing success with its smartphones based on Symbian originally developed by Psion for their personal organisers and it was the most popular smartphone OS in Europe during the middle to late s Initially Nokia s Symbian smartphones were focused on business with the Eseries similar to Windows Mobile and BlackBerry devices at the time From onwards Nokia started producing consumer focused smartphones popularized by the entertainment focused Nseries Until Symbian was the world s most widely used smartphone operating system br The touchscreen personal digital assistant PDA derived nature of adapted operating systems like Palm OS the Pocket PC versions of what was later Windows Mobile and the UIQ interface that was originally designed for pen based PDAs on Symbian OS devices resulted in some early smartphones having stylus based interfaces These allowed for virtual keyboards and handwriting input thus also allowing easy entry of Asian characters br By the mid s the majority of smartphones had a physical QWERTY keyboard Most used a keyboard bar form factor like the BlackBerry line Windows Mobile smartphones Palm Treos and some of the Nokia Eseries A few hid their full physical QWERTY keyboard in a sliding form factor like the Danger Hiptop line Some even had only a numeric keypad using T text input like the Nokia Nseries and other models in the Nokia Eseries Resistive touchscreens with stylus based interfaces could still be found on a few smartphones like the Palm Treos which had dropped their handwriting input after a few early models that were available in versions with Graffiti instead of a keyboard br br br Form factor and operating system shifts br br The late s and early s saw a shift in smartphone interfaces away from devices with physical keyboards and keypads to ones with large finger operated capacitive touchscreens The first phone of any kind with a large capacitive touchscreen was the LG Prada announced by LG in December This was a fashionable feature phone created in collaboration with Italian luxury designer Prada with a x pixel screen a Megapixel digital camera with p video recording ability an LED flash and a miniature mirror for self portraits br In January Apple Computer introduced the iPhone It had a capacitive touchscreen with twice the common resolution of most smartphone screens at the time and introduced multi touch to phones which allowed gestures such as pinching to zoom in or out on photos maps and web pages The iPhone was notable as being the first device of its kind targeted at the mass market to abandon the use of a stylus keyboard or keypad typical of contemporary smartphones instead using a large touchscreen for direct finger input as its main means of interaction br The iPhone s operating system was also a shift away from older operating systems which older phones supported and which were adapted from PDAs and feature phones to an operative system powerful enough to not require using a limited stripped down web browser that can only render pages specially formatted using technologies such as WML cHTML or XHTML and instead ran a version of Apple s Safari browser that could render full websites not specifically designed for mobile phones br Later Apple shipped a software update that gave the iPhone a built in on device App Store allowing direct wireless downloads of third party software This kind of centralized App Store and free developer tools quickly became the new main paradigm for all smartphone platforms for software development distribution discovery installation and payment in place of expensive developer tools that required official approval to use and a dependence on third party sources providing applications for multiple platforms br The advantages of a design with software powerful enough to support advanced applications and a large capacitive touchscreen affected the development of another smartphone OS platform Android with a more BlackBerry like prototype device scrapped in favor of a touchscreen device with a slide out physical keyboard as Google s engineers thought at the time that a touchscreen could not completely replace a physical keyboard and buttons Android is based around a modified Linux kernel again providing more power than mobile operating systems adapted from PDAs and feature phones The first Android device the horizontal sliding HTC Dream was released in September br In Asus started experimenting with a convertible docking system named PadFone where the standalone handset can when necessary be inserted into a tablet sized screen unit with integrated supportive battery and used as such br In and Samsung experimented with the hybrid combination of compact camera and smartphone releasing the Galaxy S Zoom and K Zoom each equipped with integrated optical zoom lens and manual parameter settings including manual exposure and focus years before these were widely adapted among smartphones The S Zoom additionally has a rotary knob ring around the lens and a tripod mount br While screen sizes have increased manufacturers have attempted to make smartphones thinner at the expense of utility and sturdiness since a thinner frame is more vulnerable to bending and has less space for components namely battery capacity br br br Operating system competition br br The iPhone and later touchscreen only Android devices together popularized the slate form factor based on a large capacitive touchscreen as the sole means of interaction and led to the decline of earlier keyboard and keypad focused platforms Later navigation keys such as the home back menu task and search buttons have also been increasingly replaced by nonphysical touch keys then virtual simulated on screen navigation keys commonly with access combinations such as a long press of the task key to simulate a short menu key press as with home button to search More recent bezel less types have their screen surface space extended to the unit s front bottom to compensate for the display area lost for simulating the navigation keys While virtual keys offer more potential customizability their location may be inconsistent among systems depending on screen rotation and software used br Multiple vendors attempted to update or replace their existing smartphone platforms and devices to better compete with Android and the iPhone Palm unveiled a new platform known as webOS for its Palm Pre in late to replace Palm OS which featured a focus on a task based card metaphor and seamless synchronization and integration between various online services as opposed to the then conventional concept of a smartphone needing a PC to serve as a canonical authoritative repository for user data HP acquired Palm in and released several other webOS devices including the Pre and HP TouchPad tablet As part of a proposed divestment of its consumer business to focus on enterprise software HP abruptly ended development of future webOS devices in August and sold the rights to webOS to LG Electronics in for use as a smart TV platform br Research in Motion introduced the vertical sliding BlackBerry Torch and BlackBerry OS in which featured a redesigned user interface support for gestures such as pinch to zoom and a new web browser based on the same WebKit rendering engine used by the iPhone The following year RIM released BlackBerry OS and new models in the Bold and Torch ranges which included a new Bold with a touchscreen alongside its keyboard and the Torch the first BlackBerry phone to not include a physical keyboard In it replaced the legacy BlackBerry OS with a revamped QNX based platform known as BlackBerry with the all touch BlackBerry Z and keyboard equipped Q as launch devices br In Microsoft unveiled a replacement for Windows Mobile known as Windows Phone featuring a new touchscreen centric user interface built around flat design and typography a home screen with live tiles containing feeds of updates from apps as well as integrated Microsoft Office apps In February Nokia announced that it had entered into a major partnership with Microsoft under which it would exclusively use Windows Phone on all of its future smartphones and integrate Microsoft s Bing search engine and Bing Maps which as part of the partnership would also license Nokia Maps data into all future devices The announcement led to the abandonment of both Symbian as well as MeeGo a Linux based mobile platform it was co developing with Intel Nokia s low end Lumia saw strong demand and helped Windows Phone gain niche popularity in some markets overtaking BlackBerry in global market share in br In mid June Meizu released its mobile operating system Flyme OS br Many of these attempts to compete with Android and iPhone were short lived Over the course of the decade the two platforms became a clear duopoly in smartphone sales and market share with BlackBerry Windows Phone and other operating systems eventually stagnating to little or no measurable market share In BlackBerry began to pivot away from its in house mobile platforms in favor of producing Android devices focusing on a security enhanced distribution of the software The following year the company announced that it would also exit the hardware market to focus more on software and its enterprise middleware and began to license the BlackBerry brand and its Android distribution to third party OEMs such as TCL for future devices br In September Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Nokia s mobile device business for billion as part of a strategy under CEO Steve Ballmer for Microsoft to be a devices and services company Despite the growth of Windows Phone and the Lumia range which accounted for nearly of all Windows Phone devices sold the platform never had significant market share in the key U S market and Microsoft was unable to maintain Windows Phone s momentum in the years that followed resulting in dwindling interest from users and app developers After Balmer was succeeded by Satya Nadella who has placed a larger focus on software and cloud computing as CEO of Microsoft it took a billion write off on the Nokia assets in July and laid off nearly the entire Microsoft Mobile unit in May br Prior to the completion of the sale to Microsoft Nokia released a series of Android derived smartphones for emerging markets known as Nokia X which combined an Android based platform with elements of Windows Phone and Nokia s feature phone platform Asha using Microsoft and Nokia services rather than Google br br br Camera advancements br br The first commercial camera phone was the Kyocera Visual Phone VP released in Japan in May It was called a mobile videophone at the time and had a pixel front facing camera It could send up to two images per second over Japan s Personal Handy phone System PHS cellular network and store up to JPEG digital images which could be sent over e mail The first mass market camera phone was the J SH a Sharp J Phone model sold in Japan in November It could instantly transmit pictures via cell phone telecommunication br By the mid s higher end cell phones commonly had integrated digital cameras In camera phones outsold stand alone digital cameras and in they outsold film and digital stand alone cameras Five billion camera phones were sold in five years and by more than half of the installed base of all mobile phones were camera phones Sales of separate cameras peaked in br Many early smartphones did not have cameras at all and earlier models that had them had low performance and insufficient image and video quality that could not compete with budget pocket cameras and fulfill user s needs By the beginning of the s almost all smartphones had an integrated digital camera The decline in sales of stand alone cameras accelerated due to the increasing use of smartphones with rapidly improving camera technology for casual photography easier image manipulation and abilities to directly share photos through the use of apps and web based services By cell phones with integrated cameras were selling hundreds of millions per year In digital camera sales were million units or only less than a third of digital camera sales numbers at their peak and also slightly less than film camera sold number at their peak br Contributing to the rise in popularity of smartphones being used over dedicated cameras for photography smaller pocket cameras have difficulty producing bokeh in images but nowadays some smartphones have dual lens cameras that reproduce the bokeh effect easily and can even rearrange the level of bokeh after shooting This works by capturing multiple images with different focus settings then combining the background of the main image with a macro focus shot br In the Nokia N was notable as a smartphone that had a Megapixel MP camera when most others had cameras with around MP or less than MP Some specialized feature phones like the LG Viewty Samsung SGH G and Sony Ericsson K i all released later that year also had MP cameras By MP cameras were common a few smartphones had MP cameras and the Nokia N Sony Ericsson Satio and Samsung M Pixon feature phone had MP The main camera of the Nokia N uniquely features a three level aperture lens br The Altek Leo a megapixel smartphone with x optical zoom lens and p HD video camera was released in late br In the same year the Nintendo DS was released HTC unveiled the Evo D a D phone with a dual five megapixel rear camera setup for spatial imaging among the earliest mobile phones with more than one rear camera br The Samsung Galaxy S introduced the ability to capture photos using voice commands br In Nokia announced and released the Nokia PureView featuring a megapixel inch sensor and a high resolution f Zeiss all aspherical one group lens The high resolution enables four times of lossless digital zoom at p and six times at p resolution using image sensor cropping The Nokia Lumia has a similar high resolution camera setup with the addition of optical image stabilization and manual camera settings years before common among high end mobile phones although lacking expandable storage that could be of use for accordingly high file sizes br Mobile optical image stabilization was first introduced by Nokia in with the Lumia and the earliest known smartphone with an optically stabilized front camera is the HTC from Optical image stabilization enables prolonged exposure times for low light photography and smoothing out handheld video shaking since the appearance of shakes magnifies over a larger display such as a monitor or television set which would be detrimental to the watching experience br Since smartphones have become increasingly able to capture photos while filming The resolution of those photos resolution may vary between devices Samsung has used the highest image sensor resolution at the video s aspect ratio which at is Megapixels on the Galaxy S and Megapixels on the Galaxy S The earliest iPhones with such functionality iPhone and s captured simultaneous photos at Megapixels while filming br Starting in on the Xperia Z Sony experimented with real time augmented reality camera effects such as floating text virtual plants volcano and a dinosaur walking in the scenery Apple later did similarly in with the iPhone X br In the same year iOS introduced the later widely implemented viewfinder intuition where exposure value can be adjusted through vertical swiping after focus and exposure has been set by tapping and even while locked after holding down for a brief moment On some devices this intuition may be restricted by software in video slow motion modes and for front camera br In Samsung unveiled the Galaxy S Zoom smartphone with the grip shape of a compact camera and a optical zoom lens as well as a rotary knob ring around the lens as used on higher end compact cameras and an ISO tripod mount It is equipped with manual parameter settings including for focus and exposure The successor Samsung Galaxy K Zoom brought resolution and performance enhancements but lacks the rotary knob and tripod mount to allow for a more smartphone like shape with less protruding lens br The Panasonic Lumix DMC CM was another attempt at mixing mobile phone with compact camera so much so that it inherited the Lumix brand While lacking optical zoom its image sensor has a format of as used in high end compact cameras such as the Lumix DMC LX and Sony CyberShot DSC RX series with multiple times the surface size of a typical mobile camera image sensor as well as support for light sensitivities of up to ISO well beyond the typical mobile camera light sensitivity range As of no successor has been released br In and HTC experimentally traded in pixel count for pixel surface size on their One M and M both with only four megapixels marketed as UltraPixel citing improved brightness and less noise in low light though the more recent One M lacks optical image stabilization br The One M additionally was one of the earliest smartphones to be equipped with a dual camera setup Its software allows generating visual spatial effects such as D panning weather effects and focus adjustment UFocus simulating the postphotographic selective focusing capability of images produced by a light field camera HTC returned to a high megapixel single camera setup on the One M br Meanwhile in LG Mobile started experimenting with time of flight camera functionality where a rear laser beam that measures distance accelerates autofocus br Phase detection autofocus was increasingly adapted throughout the mid s allowing for quicker and more accurate focusing than contrast detection br In Apple introduced the iPhone Plus one of the phones to popularize a dual camera setup The iPhone Plus included a main MP camera along with a MP telephoto camera In early Huawei released a new flagship phone the Huawei P Pro one of the first triple camera lens setups with Leica optics In late Samsung released a new mid range smartphone the Galaxy A with the world s first quad camera setup The Nokia PureView was released in featuring a penta lens camera system br saw the commercialization of high resolution sensors which use pixel binning to capture more light MP and MP sensors developed by Sony and Samsung are commonly used by several manufacturers MP sensors were first implemented in late and early br br br Video resolution br br With stronger getting chipsets to handle computing workload demands at higher pixel rates mobile video resolution and framerate has caught up with dedicated consumer grade cameras over years br In the Samsung Omnia HD became the first mobile phone with p HD video recording In the same year Apple brought video recording initially to the iPhone GS at p whereas the original iPhone and iPhone G lacked video recording entirely br p was more widely adapted in on smartphones such as the original Samsung Galaxy S Sony Ericsson Xperia X iPhone and HTC Desire HD br The early s brought a steep increase in mobile video resolution p mobile video recording was achieved in on the Samsung Galaxy S HTC Sensation and iPhone s br In and select devices with p filming at frames per second were released the Asus PadFone and HTC One M unlike flagships of Samsung Sony and Apple However the Samsung Galaxy S Zoom does support it br In the Samsung Galaxy Note introduced p K video recording at frames per second as well as p doubled to frames per second for smoothness br Other vendors adapted p recording in including the optically stabilized LG G Apple first implemented it in late on the iPhone s and s Plus br The framerate at p was widely doubled to in and starting with the iPhone Galaxy S LG G and OnePlus br Sufficient computing performance of chipsets and image sensor resolution and its reading speeds have enabled mobile p K filming in introduced with the Samsung Galaxy S and Redmi K Pro though some upper resolution levels were foregone skipped throughout development including p K p K and p K except p on Samsung Galaxy front cameras br br Mid class br Among mid range smartphone series the introduction of higher video resolutions was initially delayed by two to three years compared to flagship counterparts p was widely adapted in including with the Samsung Galaxy S Mini Sony Xperia go and p in on the Samsung Galaxy S Mini and HTC One mini br The proliferation of video resolutions beyond p has been postponed by several years The mid class Sony Xperia M supported p filming in whereas Samsung s mid class series such as the Galaxy J and A series were strictly limited to p in resolution and frames per second at any resolution for six years until around whether and how much for technical reasons is unclear br br Setting br A lower video resolution setting may be desirable to extend recording time by reducing space storage and power consumption br The camera software of some sophisticated devices such as the LG V is equipped with separate controls for resolution frame rate and bit rate within a technically supported range of pixel rate br br br Slow motion video br A distinction between different camera software is the method used to store high frame rate video footage with more recent phones retaining both the image sensor s original output frame rate and audio while earlier phones do not record audio and stretch the video so it can be played back slowly at default speed br While the stretched encoding method used on earlier phones enables slow motion playback on video player software that lacks manual playback speed control typically found on older devices if the aim were to achieve a slow motion effect the real time method used by more recent phones offers greater versatility for video editing where slowed down portions of the footage can be freely selected by the user and exported into a separate video A rudimentary video editing software for this purpose is usually pre installed The video can optionally be played back at normal real time speed acting as usual video br br Development br The earliest smartphone known to feature a slow motion mode is the Samsung i Omnia II which can record at QVGA at fps frames per second Slow motion was not available on the Galaxy S Galaxy S Galaxy Note and Galaxy S flagships br In early the HTC One X allowed pixel slow motion filming at an undocumented frame rate The output footage has been measured as a third of real time speed br In late the Galaxy Note brought back slow motion with D at fps In early the Galaxy S and HTC One M recorded at that frame rate with followed by the Note and iPhone s with p in late the latter of which retaines audio and original sensor frame rate as with all later iPhones In early the Sony Xperia Z and HTC One M adapted this resolution as well In late the iPhone doubled the frame rate to fps and in late the iPhone s added support for p at frames per second In early the Galaxy S became the first Samsung mobile phone to retain the sensor framerate and audio and in early the Galaxy S became the first Samsung mobile phone with fps recording also at p br In early the MT chipset by MediaTek promised p fps video recording The project s status remains indefinite br Since early starting with the Sony Xperia XZ smartphones have been released with a slow motion mode that unsustainably records at framerates multiple times as high by temporarily storing frames on the image sensor s internal burst memory Such a recording endures few real time seconds at most br In late the iPhone brought p at fps as well as p at fps followed by the Galaxy S in early In mid the OnePlus brought p at fps sustainable for one minute br In early the OnePlus Pro became the first phone with p at fps br br br HDR video br The first smartphones to record HDR video were the early Sony Xperia Z and mid Xperia Z Ultra followed by the early Galaxy S all at p br br br Audio recording br Mobile phones with multiple microphones usually allow video recording with stereo audio for spaciality with Samsung Sony and HTC initially implementing it in on their Samsung Galaxy S Sony Xperia S and HTC One X Apple implemented stereo audio starting with the iPhone Xs family and iPhone XR br br br Front cameras br br br Photo br Emphasis is being put on the front camera since the mid s where front cameras have reached resolutions as high as typical rear cameras such as the LG G megapixels Sony Xperia C Ultra megapixels and Sony Xperia XA Ultra megapixels optically stabilized The LG V brought a dual front camera system where the second has a wider angle for group photography Samsung implemented a front camera sweep panorama panorama selfie feature since the Galaxy Note to extend the field of view br br br Video br In the Galaxy S and iPhone brought p HD front video recording at fps In early the Samsung Galaxy S HTC One M and Sony Xperia Z brought p Full HD at that framerate and in late the Galaxy Note introduced p video recording on the front camera Apple adapted p front camera video with the late iPhone br In smartphones started adapting p K video recording on the front camera six years after rear camera p commenced with the Galaxy Note br br br Display advancements br br In the early s larger smartphones with screen sizes of at least millimetres in diagonal dubbed phablets began to achieve popularity with the Samsung Galaxy Note series gaining notably wide adoption In Huawei launched the Huawei Mate series sporting a millimetres in HD x IPS LCD display which was considered to be quite large at the time br Some companies began to release smartphones in incorporating flexible displays to create curved form factors such as the Samsung Galaxy Round and LG G Flex br By p displays began to appear on high end smartphones In Sony released the Xperia Z Premium featuring a K resolution display although only images and videos could actually be rendered at that resolution all other software was shown at p br New trends for smartphone displays began to emerge in with both LG and Samsung releasing flagship smartphones LG G and Galaxy S utilizing displays with taller aspect ratios than the common ratio and a high screen to body ratio also known as a bezel less design These designs allow the display to have a larger diagonal measurement but with a slimmer width than displays with an equivalent screen size br Another trend popularized in were displays containing tab like cut outs at the top centre colloquially known as a notch to contain the front facing camera and sometimes other sensors typically located along the top bezel of a device These designs allow for edge to edge displays that take up nearly the entire height of the device with little to no bezel along the top and sometimes a minimal bottom bezel as well This design characteristic appeared almost simultaneously on the Sharp Aquos S and the Essential Phone which featured small circular tabs for their cameras followed just a month later by the iPhone X which used a wider tab to contain a camera and facial scanning system known as Face ID The LG V had a precursor to the concept with a portion of the screen wrapped around the camera area in the top left corner and the resulting area marketed as a second display that could be used for various supplemental features br br Other variations of the practice later emerged such as a hole punch camera such as those of the Honor View and Samsung s Galaxy A s and Galaxy S eschewing the tabbed notch for a circular or rounded rectangular cut out within the screen instead while Oppo released the first all screen phones with no notches at all including one with a mechanical front camera that pops up from the top of the device Find X and a prototype for a front facing camera that can be embedded and hidden below the display using a special partially translucent screen structure that allows light to reach the image sensor below the panel The first implementation was the ZTE Axon G with a MP sensor manufactured by Visionox br Displays supporting refresh rates higher than Hz such as Hz or Hz also began to appear on smartphones in initially confined to gaming smartphones such as the Razer Phone and Asus ROG Phone they later became more common on flagship phones such as the Pixel and Samsung Galaxy S series Higher refresh rates allow for smoother motion and lower input latency but often at the cost of battery life As such the device may offer a means to disable high refresh rates or be configured to automatically reduce the refresh rate when there is low on screen motion br br br Multi tasking br An early implementation of multiple simultaneous tasks on a smartphone display are the picture in picture video playback mode pop up play and live video list with playing video thumbnails of the Samsung Galaxy S the former of which was later delivered to the Samsung Galaxy Note through a software update Later that year a split screen mode was implemented on the Galaxy Note later retrofitted on the Galaxy S through the premium suite upgrade br The earliest implementation of desktop and laptop like windowing was on the Samsung Galaxy Note br br br Foldable smartphones br br Smartphones utilizing flexible displays were theorized as possible once manufacturing costs and production processes were feasible In November the startup company Royole unveiled the first commercially available foldable smartphone the Royole FlexPai Also that month Samsung presented a prototype phone featuring an Infinity Flex Display at its developers conference with a smaller outer display on its cover and a larger tablet sized display when opened Samsung stated that it also had to develop a new polymer material to coat the display as opposed to glass Samsung officially announced the Galaxy Fold based on the previously demonstrated prototype in February for an originally scheduled release in late April Due to various durability issues with the display and hinge systems encountered by early reviewers the release of the Galaxy Fold was delayed to September to allow for design changes br In November Motorola unveiled a variation of the concept with its re imagining of the Razr using a horizontally folding display to create a clamshell form factor inspired by its previous feature phone range of the same name Samsung would unveil a similar device known as the Galaxy Z Flip the following February br br br Other developments in the s br The first smartphone with a fingerprint reader was the Motorola Atrix G in In September the iPhone S was unveiled as the first smartphone on a major U S carrier since the Atrix to feature this technology Once again the iPhone popularized this concept One of the barriers of fingerprint reading amongst consumers was security concerns however Apple was able to address these concerns by encrypting this fingerprint data onto the A Processor located inside the phone as well as make sure this information could not be accessed by third party applications and is not stored in iCloud or Apple servers br In Samsung introduced the Galaxy S GT i with retrofittable wireless charging pop up video playback G LTE variant GT i quad core processor br In Fairphone launched its first socially ethical smartphone at the London Design Festival to address concerns regarding the sourcing of materials in the manufacturing followed by Shiftphone in In late QSAlpha commenced production of a smartphone designed entirely around security encryption and identity protection br In October Motorola Mobility announced Project Ara a concept for a modular smartphone platform that would allow users to customize and upgrade their phones with add on modules that attached magnetically to a frame Ara was retained by Google following its sale of Motorola Mobility to Lenovo but was shelved in That year LG and Motorola both unveiled smartphones featuring a limited form of modularity for accessories the LG G allowed accessories to be installed via the removal of its battery compartment while the Moto Z utilizes accessories attached magnetically to the rear of the device br Microsoft expanding upon the concept of Motorola s short lived Webtop unveiled functionality for its Windows operating system for phones that allows supported devices to be docked for use with a PC styled desktop environment br Samsung and LG used to be the last standing manufacturers to offer flagship devices with user replaceable batteries br But in Samsung succumbed to the minimalism trend set by Apple introducing the Galaxy S without a user replaceable battery br In addition Samsung was criticised for pruning long standing features such as MHL MicroUSB water resistance and MicroSD card support of which the latter two came back in with the Galaxy S and S Edge br As of the global median for smartphone ownership was Statista forecast that billion people would own smartphones in br Within the same decade rapid deployment of LTE cellular network and general availability of smartphones have increased popularity of the streaming television services and the corresponding mobile TV apps br Major technologies that began to trend in included a focus on virtual reality and augmented reality experiences catered towards smartphones the newly introduced USB C connector and improving LTE technologies br In adjustable screen resolution known from desktop operating systems was introduced to smartphones for power saving whereas variable screen refresh rates were popularized in br In the first smartphones featuring fingerprint readers embedded within OLED displays were announced followed in by an implementation using an ultrasonic sensor on the Samsung Galaxy S br In the majority of smartphones released have more than one camera are waterproof with IP and IP ratings and unlock using facial recognition or fingerprint scanners br br Designs first implemented by Apple have been replicated by other vendors several times These include a sealed body that does not allow replacing the battery a lack of the physical audio connecter since the iPhone from a screen with a cut out area at the top for the earphone and front facing camera and sensors colloquially known as notch since the iPhone X from the exclusion of a charging wall adapter from the scope of delivery since the iPhone from and a camera user interface with circular and usually solid colour shutter button and a camera mode selector using perpendicular text and separate camera modes for photo and video since iOS from br br br Other developments in the s br In the first smartphones featuring high speed G network capability were announced br Since smartphones have decreasingly been shipped with rudimentary accessories like a power adapter and headphones that have historically been almost invariably within the scope of delivery This trend was initiated with Apple s iPhone followed by Samsung and Xiaomi on the Galaxy S and Mi respectively months after having mocked the same through advertisements The reason cited is reducing environmental footprint though reaching raised charging rates supported by newer models demands a new charger shipped through separate packaging with its own environmental footprint br br With the development of the PinePhone and Librem in the s there are intensified efforts to make open source GNU Linux for smartphones a major alternative to iOS and Android Moreover associated software enabled convergence beyond convergent and hybrid apps by allowing the smartphones to be used like a desktop computer when connected to a keyboard mouse and monitor br In the early s manufacturers began to integrate satellite connectivity into smartphone devices for use in remote areas where local terrestrial communication infrastructures such as landline and cellular networks are not available Due to the antenna limitations in the conventional phones in the early stages of implementation satellite connectivity would be limited to the satellite messaging and satellite emergency services br br br Hardware br br A typical smartphone contains a number of metal oxide semiconductor MOS integrated circuit IC chips which in turn contain billions of tiny MOS field effect transistors MOSFETs A typical smartphone contains the following MOS IC chips br br Application processor CMOS system on a chip br Flash memory floating gate MOS memory br Cellular modem baseband RF CMOS br RF transceiver RF CMOS br Phone camera image sensor CMOS image sensor br Power management integrated circuit power MOSFETs br Display driver LCD or LED driver br Wireless communication chips Wi Fi Bluetooth GPS receiver br Sound chip audio codec and power amplifier br Gyroscope br Capacitive touchscreen controller ASIC and DSP br RF power amplifier LDMOS br Some are also equipped with an FM radio receiver a hardware notification LED and an infrared transmitter for use as remote control A few models have additional sensors such as thermometer for measuring ambient temperature hygrometer for humidity and a sensor for ultraviolet ray measurement br A few smartphones designed around specific purposes are equipped with uncommon hardware such as a projector Samsung Beam i and Samsung Galaxy Beam i optical zoom lenses Samsung Galaxy S Zoom and Samsung Galaxy K Zoom thermal camera and even PMR walkie talkie radio transceiver br br br Central processing unit br Smartphones have central processing units CPUs similar to those in computers but optimised to operate in low power environments In smartphones the CPU is typically integrated in a CMOS complementary metal oxide semiconductor system on a chip SoC application processor br The performance of mobile CPU depends not only on the clock rate generally given in multiples of hertz but also on the memory hierarchy Because of these challenges the performance of mobile phone CPUs is often more appropriately given by scores derived from various standardized tests to measure the real effective performance in commonly used applications br br br Buttons br br Smartphones are typically equipped with a power button and volume buttons Some pairs of volume buttons are unified Some are equipped with a dedicated camera shutter button Units for outdoor use may be equipped with an SOS emergency call and PTT push to talk button The presence of physical front side buttons such as the home and navigation buttons has decreased throughout the s increasingly becoming replaced by capacitive touch sensors and simulated on screen buttons br As with classic mobile phones early smartphones such as the Samsung Omnia II were equipped with buttons for accepting and declining phone calls Due to the advancements of functionality besides phone calls these have increasingly been replaced by navigation buttons such as menu also known as options back and tasks Some early s smartphones such as the HTC Desire were additionally equipped with a Search button for quick access to a web search engine or apps internal search feature br Since smartphones home buttons started integrating fingerprint scanners starting with the iPhone s and Samsung Galaxy S br Functions may be assigned to button combinations For example screenshots can usually be taken using the home and power buttons with a short press on iOS and one second holding Android OS the two most popular mobile operating systems On smartphones with no physical home button usually the volume down button is instead pressed with the power button Some smartphones have a screenshot and possibly screencast shortcuts in the navigation button bar or the power button menu br br br Display br br One of the main characteristics of smartphones is the screen Depending on the device s design the screen fills most or nearly all of the space on a device s front surface Many smartphone displays have an aspect ratio of but taller aspect ratios became more common in as well as the aim to eliminate bezels by extending the display surface to as close to the edges as possible br br br Screen sizes br Screen sizes are measured in diagonal inches Phones with screens larger than inches are often called phablets Smartphones with screens over inches in size are commonly difficult to use with only a single hand since most thumbs cannot reach the entire screen surface they may need to be shifted around in the hand held in one hand and manipulated by the other or used in place with both hands Due to design advances some modern smartphones with large screen sizes and edge to edge designs have compact builds that improve their ergonomics while the shift to taller aspect ratios have resulted in phones that have larger screen sizes whilst maintaining the ergonomics associated with smaller displays br br br Panel types br Liquid crystal displays LCDs and organic light emitting diode OLED displays are the most common Some displays are integrated with pressure sensitive digitizers such as those developed by Wacom and Samsung and Apple s Force Touch system A few phones such as the YotaPhone prototype are equipped with a low power electronic paper rear display as used in e book readers br br br Alternative input methods br br Some devices are equipped with additional input methods such as a stylus for higher precision input and hovering detection or a self capacitive touch screens layer for floating finger detection The latter has been implemented on few phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S Note S Alpha and Sony Xperia Sola making the Galaxy Note the only smartphone with both so far br Hovering can enable preview tooltips such as on the video player s seek bar in text messages and quick contacts on the dial pad as well as lock screen animations and the simulation of a hovering mouse cursor on web sites br Some styluses support hovering as well and are equipped with a button for quick access to relevant tools such as digital post it notes and highlighting of text and elements when dragging while pressed resembling drag selection using a computer mouse Some series such as the Samsung Galaxy Note series and LG G Stylus series have an integrated tray to store the stylus in br Few devices such as the iPhone s until iPhone Xs and Huawei Mate S are equipped with a pressure sensitive touch screen where the pressure may be used to simulate a gas pedal in video games access to preview windows and shortcut menus controlling the typing cursor and a weight scale the latest of which has been rejected by Apple from the App Store br Some early s HTC smartphones such as the HTC Desire Bravo and HTC Legend are equipped with an optical track pad for scrolling and selection br br br Notification light br br Many smartphones except Apple iPhones are equipped with low power light emitting diodes besides the screen that are able to notify the user about incoming messages missed calls low battery levels and facilitate locating the mobile phone in darkness with marginial power consumption br To distinguish between the sources of notifications the colour combination and blinking pattern can vary Usually three diodes in red green and blue RGB are able to create a multitude of colour combinations br br br Sensors br Smartphones are equipped with a multitude of sensors to enable system features and third party applications br br br Common sensors br Accelerometers and gyroscopes enable automatic control of screen rotation Uses by third party software include bubble level simulation An ambient light sensor allows for automatic screen brightness and contrast adjustment and an RGB sensor enables the adaption of screen colour br Many mobile phones are also equipped with a barometer sensor to measure air pressure such as Samsung since with the Galaxy S and Apple since with the iPhone It allows estimating and detecting changes in altitude br A magnetometer can act as a digital compass by measuring Earth s magnetic field br br br Rare sensors br Samsung equips their flagship smartphones since the Galaxy S and Galaxy Note with a heart rate sensor to assist in fitness related uses and act as a shutter key for the front facing camera br So far only the Samsung Galaxy S and Note are equipped with an ambient temperature sensor and a humidity sensor and only the Note with an ultraviolet radiation sensor which could warn the user about excessive exposure br A rear infrared laser beam for distance measurement can enable time of flight camera functionality with accelerated autofocus as implemented on select LG mobile phones starting with LG G and LG V br Due to their currently rare occurrence among smartphones not much software to utilize these sensors has been developed yet br br br Storage br While eMMC embedded multi media card flash storage was most commonly used in mobile phones its successor UFS Universal Flash Storage with higher transfer rates emerged throughout the s for upper class devices br br Capacity br While the internal storage capacity of mobile phones has been near stagnant during the first half of the s it has increased steeper during its second half with Samsung for example increasing the available internal storage options of their flagship class units from GB to GB within only years between and br br br Memory cards br br The space for data storage of some mobile phones can be expanded using MicroSD memory cards whose capacity has multiplied throughout the s SD card SDXC Benefits over USB on the go storage and cloud storage include offline availability and privacy not reserving and protruding from the charging port no connection instability or latency no dependence on voluminous data plans and preservation of the limited rewriting cycles of the device s permanent internal storage Large amounts of data can be moved immediately between devices by changing memory cards large scale data backups can be created offline and data can be read externally should the smartphone be inoperable br In case of technical defects which make the device unusable or unbootable as a result of liquid damage fall damage screen damage bending damage malware or bogus system updates etc data stored on the memory card is likely rescueable externally while data on the inaccessible internal storage would be lost A memory card can usually immediately be re used in a different memory card enabled device with no necessity for prior file transfers br Some dual SIM mobile phones are equipped with a hybrid slot where one of the two slots can be occupied by either a SIM card or a memory card Some models typically of higher end are equipped with three slots including one dedicated memory card slot for simultaneous dual SIM and memory card usage br br Physical location br The location of both SIM and memory card slots vary among devices where they might be located accessibly behind the back cover or else behind the battery the latter of which denies hot swapping br Mobile phones with non removable rear cover typically house SIM and memory cards in a small tray on the handset s frame ejected by inserting a needle tool into a pinhole br Some earlier mid range phones such as the Samsung Galaxy Fit and Ace have a sideways memory card slot on the frame covered by a cap that can be opened without tool br br br File transfer br Originally mass storage access was commonly enabled to computers through USB Over time mass storage access was removed leaving the Media Transfer Protocol as protocol for USB file transfer due to its non exclusive access ability where the computer is able to access the storage without it being locked away from the mobile phone s software for the duration of the connection and no necessity for common file system support as communication is done through an abstraction layer br However unlike mass storage Media Transfer Protocol lacks parallelism meaning that only a single transfer can run at a time for which other transfer requests need to wait to finish This for example denies browsing photos and playing back videos from the device during an active file transfer Some programs and devices lack support for MTP In addition the direct access and random access of files through MTP is not supported Any file is wholly downloaded from the device before opened br br br Sound br Some audio quality enhancing features such as Voice over LTE and HD Voice have appeared and are often available on newer smartphones Sound quality can remain a problem due to the design of the phone the quality of the cellular network and compression algorithms used in long distance calls Audio quality can be improved using a VoIP application over Wi Fi Cellphones have small speakers so that the user can use a speakerphone feature and talk to a person on the phone without holding it to their ear The small speakers can also be used to listen to digital audio files of music or speech or watch videos with an audio component without holding the phone close to the ear However integrated speakers may be small and of restricted sound quality to conserve space br Some mobile phones such as the HTC One M and the Sony Xperia Z are equipped with stereophonic speakers to create spacial sound when in horizontal orientation br br br Audio connector br The mm headphone receptible coll headphone jack allows the immediate operation of passive headphones as well as connection to other external auxiliary audio appliances Among devices equipped with the connector it is more commonly located at the bottom charging port side than on the top of the device br The decline of the connector s availability among newly released mobile phones among all major vendors commenced in with its lack on the Apple iPhone An adapter reserving the charging port can retrofit the plug br Battery powered wireless Bluetooth headphones are an alternative Those tend to be costlier however due to their need for internal hardware such as a Bluetooth transceiver and a battery with a charging controller and a Bluetooth coupling is required ahead of each operation br br br Battery br Smartphones typically feature lithium ion or lithium polymer batteries due to their high energy densities br Batteries chemically wear down as a result of repeated charging and discharging throughout ordinary usage losing both energy capacity and output power which results in loss of processing speeds followed by system outages Battery capacity may be reduced to after few hundred recharges and the drop in performance accelerates with time br Some mobile phones are designed with batteries that can be interchanged upon expiration by the end user usually by opening the back cover While such a design had initially been used in most mobile phones including those with touch screen that were not Apple iPhones it has largely been usurped throughout the s by permanently built in non replaceable batteries a design practice criticized for planned obsolescence br br br Charging br br Due to limitations of electrical currents that existing USB cables copper wires could handle charging protocols which make use of elevated voltages such as Qualcomm Quick Charge and MediaTek Pump Express have been developed to increase the power throughput for faster charging to maximize the usage time without restricted ergonomy and to minimize the time a device needs to be attached to a power source br The smartphone s integrated charge controller IC requests the elevated voltage from a supported charger VOOC by Oppo also marketed as dash charge took the counter approach and increased current to cut out some heat produced from internally regulating the arriving voltage in the end device down to the battery s charging terminal voltage but is incompatible with existing USB cables as it requires the thicker copper wires of high current USB cables Later USB Power Delivery USB PD was developed with the aim to standardize the negotiation of charging parameters across devices of up to Watts but is only supported on cables with USB C on both endings due to the connector s dedicated PD channels br While charging rates have been increasing with watts in Watts in and watts in the power throughput may be throttled down significantly during operation of the device br Wireless charging has been widely adapted allowing for intermittent recharging without wearing down the charging port through frequent reconnection with Qi being the most common standard followed by Powermat Due to the lower efficiency of wireless power transmission charging rates are below that of wired charging and more heat is produced at similar charging rates br By the end of smartphone battery life has become generally adequate however earlier smartphone battery life was poor due to the weak batteries that could not handle the significant power requirements of the smartphones computer systems and color screens br Smartphone users purchase additional chargers for use outside the home at work and in cars and by buying portable external battery packs External battery packs include generic models which are connected to the smartphone with a cable and custom made models that piggyback onto a smartphone s case In Samsung had to recall millions of the Galaxy Note smartphones due to an explosive battery issue For consumer convenience wireless charging stations have been introduced in some hotels bars and other public spaces br br br Power management br A technique to minimize power consumption is the panel self refresh whereby the image to be shown on the display is not sent at all times from the processor to the integrated controller IC of the display component but only if the information on screen is changed The display s integrated controller instead memorizes the last screen contents and refreshes the screen by itself This technology was introduced around and has reduced power consumption by a few hundred milliwatts br br br Cameras br br Cameras have become standard features of smartphones As of phone cameras are now a highly competitive area of differentiation between models with advertising campaigns commonly based on a focus on the quality or capabilities of a device s main cameras br Images are usually saved in the JPEG file format some high end phones since the mid s also have RAW imaging capability br br br Space constraints br Typically smartphones have at least one main rear facing camera and a lower resolution front facing camera for selfies and video chat Owing to the limited depth available in smartphones for image sensors and optics rear facing cameras are often housed in a bump that is thicker than the rest of the phone Since increasingly thin mobile phones have more abundant horizontal space than the depth that is necessary and used in dedicated cameras for better lenses there is additionally a trend for phone manufacturers to include multiple cameras with each optimized for a different purpose telephoto wide angle etc br Viewed from back rear cameras are commonly located at the top center or top left corner A cornered location benefits by not requiring other hardware to be packed around the camera module while increasing ergonomy as the lens is less likely to be covered when held horizontally br Modern advanced smartphones have cameras with optical image stabilisation OIS larger sensors bright lenses and even optical zoom plus RAW images HDR Bokeh mode with multi lenses and multi shot night modes are now also familiar Many new smartphone camera features are being enabled via computational photography image processing and multiple specialized lenses rather than larger sensors and lenses due to the constrained space available inside phones that are being made as slim as possible br br br Dedicated camera button br Some mobile phones such as the Samsung i Omnia some Nokia Lumias and some Sony Xperias are equipped with a physical camera shutter button br Those with two pressure levels resemble the point and shoot intuition of dedicated compact cameras The camera button may be used as a shortcut to quickly and ergonomically launch the camera software as it is located more accessibly inside a pocket than the power button br br br Back cover materials br Back covers of smartphones are typically made of polycarbonate aluminium or glass Polycarbonate back covers may be glossy or matte and possibly textured like dotted on the Galaxy S or leathered on the Galaxy Note and Note br While polycarbonate back covers may be perceived as less premium among fashion and trend oriented users its utilitarian strengths and technical benefits include durability and shock absorption greater elasticity against permanent bending like metal inability to shatter like glass which facilitates designing it removable better manufacturing cost efficiency and no blockage of radio signals or wireless power like metal br br br Accessories br A wide range of accessories are sold for smartphones including cases memory cards screen protectors chargers wireless power stations USB On The Go adapters for connecting USB drives and or in some cases a HDMI cable to an external monitor MHL adapters add on batteries power banks headphones combined headphone microphones which for example allow a person to privately conduct calls on the device without holding it to the ear and Bluetooth enabled powered speakers that enable users to listen to media from their smartphones wirelessly br Cases range from relatively inexpensive rubber or soft plastic cases which provide moderate protection from bumps and good protection from scratches to more expensive heavy duty cases that combine a rubber padding with a hard outer shell Some cases have a book like form with a cover that the user opens to use the device when the cover is closed it protects the screen Some book like cases have additional pockets for credit cards thus enabling people to use them as wallets br Accessories include products sold by the manufacturer of the smartphone and compatible products made by other manufacturers br However some companies like Apple stopped including chargers with smartphones in order to reduce carbon footprint etc causing many customers to pay extra for charging adapters br br br Software br br br Mobile operating systems br br A mobile operating system or mobile OS is an operating system for phones tablets smartwatches or other mobile devices Globally Android and IOS are the two most used mobile operating systems based on usage share with the former having been the best selling OS globally on all devices since br Mobile operating systems combine features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use usually including and most of the following considered essential in modern mobile systems a touchscreen cellular Bluetooth Wi Fi Protected Access Wi Fi Global Positioning System GPS mobile navigation video and single frame picture cameras speech recognition voice recorder music player near field communication and infrared blaster By Q over million smartphones were sold with percent running Android percent running iOS and a negligible number of smartphones running other OSes Android alone is more popular than the popular desktop operating system Windows and in general smartphone use even without tablets exceeds desktop use Other well known mobile operating systems are Flyme OS and Harmony OS br Mobile devices with mobile communications abilities e g smartphones contain two mobile operating systems the main user facing software platform is supplemented by a second low level proprietary real time operating system which operates the radio and other hardware Research has shown that these low level systems may contain a range of security vulnerabilities permitting malicious base stations to gain high levels of control over the mobile device br br br Mobile app br br A mobile app is a computer program designed to run on a mobile device such as a smartphone The term app is a short form of the term software application br br br Application stores br br The introduction of Apple s App Store for the iPhone and iPod Touch in July popularized manufacturer hosted online distribution for third party applications software and computer programs focused on a single platform There are a huge variety of apps including video games music products and business tools Up until that point smartphone application distribution depended on third party sources providing applications for multiple platforms such as GetJar Handango Handmark and PocketGear Following the success of the App Store other smartphone manufacturers launched application stores such as Google s Android Market later renamed to the Google Play Store and RIM s BlackBerry App World Android related app stores like Aptoide Cafe Bazaar F Droid GetJar and Opera Mobile Store In February of mobile developers were

manufacturer Apple s smartphone shipments dropped Xiaomi secured the third spot with a market share br br br By operating system br br br Use br br br Contemporary use and convergence br br The rise in popularity of touchscreen smartphones and mobile apps distributed via app stores along with rapidly advancing network mobile processor and storage technologies led to a convergence where separate mobile phones organizers and portable media players were replaced by a smartphone as the single device most people carried Advances in digital camera sensors and on device image processing software more gradually led to smartphones replacing simpler cameras for photographs and video recording The built in GPS capabilities and mapping apps on smartphones largely replaced stand alone satellite navigation devices and paper maps became less common Mobile gaming on smartphones greatly grew in popularity allowing many people to use them in place of handheld game consoles and some companies tried creating game console phone hybrids based on phone hardware and software People frequently have chosen not to get fixed line telephone service in favor of smartphones Music streaming apps and services have grown rapidly in popularity serving the same use as listening to music stations on a terrestrial or satellite radio Streaming video services are easily accessed via smartphone apps and can be used in place of watching television People have often stopped wearing wristwatches in favor of checking the time on their smartphones and many use the clock features on their phones in place of alarm clocks Mobile phones can also be used as a digital note taking text editing and memorandum device whose computerization facilitates searching of entries br Additionally in many lesser technologically developed regions smartphones are people s first and only means of Internet access due to their portability with personal computers being relatively uncommon outside of business use The cameras on smartphones can be used to photograph documents and send them via email or messaging in place of using fax facsimile machines Payment apps and services on smartphones allow people to make less use of wallets purses credit and debit cards and cash Mobile banking apps can allow people to deposit checks simply by photographing them eliminating the need to take the physical check to an ATM or teller Guide book apps can take the place of paper travel and restaurant business guides museum brochures and dedicated audio guide equipment br br br Mobile banking and payment br br In many countries mobile phones are used to provide mobile banking services which may include the ability to transfer cash payments by secure SMS text message Kenya s M PESA mobile banking service for example allows customers of the mobile phone operator Safaricom to hold cash balances which are recorded on their SIM cards Cash can be deposited or withdrawn from M PESA accounts at Safaricom retail outlets located throughout the country and can be transferred electronically from person to person and used to pay bills to companies br Branchless banking has been successful in South Africa and the Philippines A pilot project in Bali was launched in by the International Finance Corporation and an Indonesian bank Bank Mandiri br Another application of mobile banking technology is Zidisha a US based nonprofit micro lending platform that allows residents of developing countries to raise small business loans from Web users worldwide Zidisha uses mobile banking for loan disbursements and repayments transferring funds from lenders in the United States to borrowers in rural Africa who have mobile phones and can use the Internet br Mobile payments were first trialled in Finland in when two Coca Cola vending machines in Espoo were enabled to work with SMS payments Eventually the idea spread and in the Philippines launched the country s first commercial mobile payments systems with mobile operators Globe and Smart br Some mobile phones can make mobile payments via direct mobile billing schemes or through contactless payments if the phone and the point of sale support near field

attention as they walk possibly risking an accident in the process an increasing social phenomenon The issue of slow moving smartphone users led to the temporary creation of a mobile lane for walking in Chongqing China The issue of distracted smartphone users led the city of Augsburg Germany to embed pedestrian traffic lights in the pavement br br br While driving br br Mobile phone use while driving including calling text messaging playing media web browsing gaming using mapping apps or operating other phone features is common but controversial since it is widely considered dangerous due to what is known as distracted driving Being distracted while operating a motor vehicle has been shown to increase the risk of accidents In September the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA reported that people were killed by drivers distracted by phones In March a US insurance company State Farm Insurance announced the results of a study which showed of drivers

free calling on a mobile phone which uses a speakerphone is banned In other countries including the UK and France and in many US states calling is only banned on handheld phones while hands free calling is permitted br A study reported that over of college students surveyed text initiate reply or read while driving br The scientific literature on the danger of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone or texting while driving is limited A simulation study at the University of Utah found a sixfold increase in distraction related accidents when texting Due to the complexity of smartphones that began to grow more after this has introduced additional difficulties for law enforcement officials when attempting to distinguish one usage from another in drivers using their devices This is more apparent in countries which ban both handheld and hands free usage rather than those which ban handheld use only as officials cannot easily tell which function of the phone is being used simply by looking at the driver This can lead to drivers being stopped for using their device illegally for a call when in fact they were using the device legally for example when using the phone s incorporated controls for car stereo GPS or satnav br br A study reviewed the incidence of phone use while cycling and its effects on behavior and safety In a national survey in the US

functionality to change the color temperature of a screen to a warmer hue based on the time of day to reduce the amount of blue light generated became available through several apps for Android and the f lux software for jailbroken iPhones iOS integrated a similar system level feature known as Night Shift Several Android device manufacturers bypassed Google s initial reluctance to make Night Mode a standard feature in Android and included software for it on their hardware under varying names before Android Oreo added it to the OS for compatible devices br It has also been theorized that for some users addiction to use of their phones especially before they go to bed can result in ego depletion Many people also use their phones as alarm clocks which can also lead to loss of sleep br br br Replacement of dedicated digital cameras br As the s decade commenced the sale figures of dedicated compact cameras decreased sharply since mobile phone cameras were increasingly perceived as serving as a sufficient surrogate camera br Increases in computing power in mobile phones enabled fast image processing and high resolution filming with p Full HD being achieved in and the barrier to
