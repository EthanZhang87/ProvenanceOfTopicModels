Dolby Laboratories Inc often shortened to Dolby Labs and known simply as Dolby is a British American technology corporation specializing in audio noise reduction audio encoding compression spatial audio and HDR imaging Dolby licenses its technologies to consumer electronics manufacturers br br br History br Dolby Labs was founded by Ray Dolby in London England in In the same year he invented the Dolby Noise Reduction system a form of audio signal processing for reducing the background hissing sound on cassette tape recordings His first U S patent on the technology was filed in four years later The method was first used by Decca Records in the UK After this other companies began purchasing Dolby s A technology which was the professional noise reduction system used in recording motion picture broadcasting stations and communications networks These companies include BBC Pye IBC CBS Studios RCA and Granada br He moved the company headquarters to the United States San Francisco California in The first product Dolby Labs produced was the Dolby unit which incorporated Type A Dolby Noise Reduction a compander based noise reduction system These units were intended for use in professional recording studios br Dolby was persuaded by Henry Kloss of KLH to manufacture a consumer version of his noise reduction Dolby worked more on companding systems and introduced Type B in br Dolby also sought to improve film sound As the corporation s history explains br br Upon investigation Dolby found that many of the limitations in optical sound stemmed directly from its significantly high background noise To filter this noise the high frequency response of theatre playback systems was deliberately curtailed To make matters worse to increase dialogue intelligibility over such systems sound mixers were recording soundtracks with so much high frequency pre emphasis that high distortion resulted br The first film with Dolby sound was A Clockwork Orange The company was approached by Stanley Kubrick who wanted to use Dolby s noise reduction system to facilitate the film s extensive mixing The film went on to use Dolby noise reduction on all pre mixes and masters but a conventional optical soundtrack on release prints Callan was the first film with a Dolby encoded optical soundtrack In Dolby released Dolby Stereo which included a noise reduction system in addition to more audio channels Dolby Stereo could actually contain additional center and surround channels matrixed from the left and right The first film with a Dolby encoded stereo optical soundtrack was Lisztomania although this only used an LCR Left Center Right encoding technique The first true LCRS Left Center Right Surround soundtrack was encoded on the movie A Star Is Born in In less than ten years cinemas worldwide were equipped to use Dolby Stereo sound Dolby reworked the system slightly for home use and introduced Dolby Surround which only extracted a surround channel and the more impressive Dolby Pro Logic which was the domestic equivalent of the theatrical Dolby Stereo br Dolby developed a digital surround sound compression scheme for the cinema Dolby Stereo Digital now simply called Dolby Digital was first featured on the film Batman Returns Introduced to the home theater market as Dolby AC with the laserdisc release of Clear and Present Danger the format did not become widespread in the consumer market partly because of extra hardware that was necessary to make use of it until it was adopted as part of the DVD specification Dolby Digital is now found in the HDTV ATSC standard of the United States DVD players and many satellite TV and cable TV receivers br Dolby developed a digital surround sound compression scheme for the TV series The Simpsons br On February the company became public offering its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DLB On March Dolby celebrated its th anniversary at the ShoWest Festival in San Francisco br On January Dolby announced the arrival of Dolby Volume at the International Consumer Electronics Show br On June Dolby introduced Dolby Surround and set up theaters worldwide with surround speaker setups to deliver theatrical surround sound The first film to be released with this format was Pixar s Toy Story which was later followed by fifty releases using the format About of films released are now mixed in Dolby Surround by default br In April Dolby introduced its Dolby Atmos a new cinematic technology adding overhead sound first applied in Pixar s motion picture Brave In July Dolby Laboratories announced plans to bring Atmos to home theater The first television show to use the technology on disc was Game of Thrones br On February Dolby acquired Doremi Labs for million in cash plus an additional million in contingent consideration that may be earned over a four year period br In May Dolby decided to add Dolby Atmos to hundreds of newer songs in the music industry br In May Dolby launched a developer platform Dolby io aimed at providing developers self service access to Dolby technologies through public APIs It allows any person organization small and big to integrate in their websites apps games etc features such as media enhancements and transcoding spatial audio high quality video communication and low latency streaming br br br Technologies br br br Analog audio noise reduction br Dolby A professional noise reduction systems for analog reel to reel tape and cassettes br Dolby NR B C S consumer noise reduction systems for tapes and analog cassettes br Dolby SR Spectral Recording professional four channel noise reduction system in use since which improves the dynamic range of analog recordings and transmissions by as much as dB Dolby SR is utilized by recording and post production engineers broadcasters and other audio professionals It is also the benchmark in analog film sound being included today on nearly all mm film prints On films with digital soundtracks the SR track is used in cinemas not equipped for digital playback and it serves as a backup in case of problems with the digital track br Dolby FM noise reduction system for FM broadcast radio Dolby FM was tried by a few radio stations starting with WFMT in It used Dolby B combined with microsecond pre emphasis A small number of models of tuners and receivers were offered with the necessary decoder built in In addition a few cassette deck models appeared that allowed the deck s internal Dolby B decoder to be put in the line level pass through path permitting its use with Dolby FM broadcasts The system was not successful and was on the decline by br Dolby HX Pro single ended system used on high end tape recorders to increase headroom The recording bias is lowered as the high frequency component of the signal being recorded increases and vice versa It does nothing to the actual audio that is being recorded and it does not require a special decoder Any HX Pro recorded tape will have in theory better sound on any deck br Dolby Advanced Audio Dolby surround sound locking preferred volume level optimizes audio performance for specific PC models and lets turning up the volume to the built in speakers without distorting the sound br br br Audio encoding compression br Dolby Surround br Dolby Digital also known as AC is a lossy audio compression format It supports channel configurations from mono up to six discrete channels referred to as This format first allowed and popularized surround sound It was first developed for movie theater sound and spread to Laserdisc and DVD It has been adopted in many broadcast formats including all North American digital television ATSC DVB T direct broadcast satellite cable television DTMB IPTV and surround sound radio services It is also part of both the Blu ray and the now defunct HD DVD standards Dolby Digital is used to enable surround sound output by most video game consoles Several personal computers support converting all audio to Dolby Digital for output br Dolby Digital EX introduces a matrix encoded center rear surround channel to Dolby Digital for channel output This center rear channel is often split to two rear back speakers for channel output br Dolby Digital Plus also known as E AC is a lossy audio codec based on Dolby Digital that is backward compatible but more advanced The DVD Forum has selected Dolby Digital Plus as a standard audio format for HD DVD video It supports data rates up to Mbit s an increase from Dolby Digital s kbit s maximum On Blu ray Dolby Digital Plus is implemented differently as a legacy kbit s Dolby Digital stream plus an additional stream to expand the surround sound with a total bandwidth of approximately Mbit s Dolby Digital Plus is also optimized for limited data rate environments such as Digital broadcasting br Dolby Digital Live is a real time hardware encoding technology for interactive media such as video games It converts any audio signals on a PC or game console into the channel Dolby Digital format and transports it via a single S PDIF cable A similar technology known as DTS Connect is available from competitor DTS br Dolby E professional coding system optimized for the distribution of surround and multichannel audio through digital two channel post production and broadcasting infrastructures or for recording surround audio on two audio tracks of conventional digital video tapes video servers communication links switchers and routers The Dolby E signal does not reach viewers at home It is transcoded to Dolby Digital at a lower data rate for final DTV transmission br Dolby Stereo also known as Stereo A original analog optical technology developed for mm prints and is encoded with four sound channels Left Center Right which are located behind the screen and Surround which is heard over speakers on the sides and rear of the theatre for ambient sound and special effects This technology also employs A type or SR type noise reduction listed above with regards to analog cassette tapes See also Dolby Surround br Dolby TrueHD Offers bit for bit sound reproduction identical to the studio master Over seven full range bit kHz discrete channels are supported plus an LFE channel making it surround along with the HDMI interface Theoretically Dolby TrueHD can support more channels but this number has been limited to for HD DVD and Blu ray Disc br Dolby Pulse released in it is identical to the HE AAC v codec except for the addition of Dolby metadata which is common for Dolby s other digital audio codecs This metadata ensures consistency of broadcast quality br Dolby AC is a lossy audio compression format that can contain audio channels and or audio objects br Dolby Atmos is a suite of technologies for immersive audio having both horizontal and vertical sound placement using a combination of channel and object based mixing and delivery It was first introduced in cinemas with Brave film The first game released with Dolby Atmos audio was Star Wars Battlefront video game The means of delivering the channels and objects differ given the technical limitations across different media and the target platform Dolby Atmos is not a codec on the consumer market pre recorded Dolby Atmos is delivered as an extension to a Dolby TrueHD Dolby Digital Plus or Dolby AC stream br br br Audio
