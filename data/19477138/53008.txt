Iridium Communications Inc formerly Iridium Satellite LLC is a publicly traded American company headquartered in McLean Virginia United States Iridium operates the Iridium satellite constellation a system of satellites are active satellites and the remaining nine function as in orbit spares Iridium Satellites are used for worldwide voice and data communication from handheld satellite phones satellite messenger communication devices and integrated transceivers as well as for two way satellite messaging service from supported conventional mobile phones The nearly polar orbit and communication between satellites via inter satellite links provide global service availability br br br History br The Iridium communications service was launched on November formerly known as Iridium SSC The first Iridium call was made from Vice President of the United States Al Gore to Gilbert Grosvenor the great grandson of Alexander Graham Bell and chairman of the National Geographic Society Motorola provided the technology and major financial backing The logo of the company represents the Big Dipper The company derives its name from the chemical element iridium which has an atomic number of equaling the initial number of satellites which were calculated to be required for global coverage However due to optimizations of orbit trajectories technology updates and real world conditions only are required for global coverage A total of satellites were launched in this constellation with active and the remaining satellites operating as spares br On August nine months after the launch of the organization the founding company went into Chapter bankruptcy The handsets could not operate as promoted until the entire constellation of satellites was in place requiring a massive initial capital cost of billions of dollars The cost of service dissuaded many potential users Reception indoors was difficult and the handheld devices when compared to terrestrial cellular mobile phones were bulkier and more expensive both of which discouraged adoption among potential users br Mismanagement is another major factor that was cited in the original program s failure In CNN writer David Rohde detailed how he applied for Iridium service and was sent information kits but was never contacted by a sales representative He encountered programming problems on Iridium s website and a run around from the company s representatives After Iridium filed bankruptcy it cited difficulty gaining subscribers br The initial commercial failure of Iridium had a damping effect on other proposed commercial satellite constellation projects including Teledesic Other schemes Orbcomm ICO Global Communications and Globalstar followed Iridium into bankruptcy protection while a number of other proposed schemes were never even constructed br In August Motorola announced that the Iridium satellites would have to be deorbited Despite this they remained in orbit and operational In December the US government stepped in to save Iridium by providing US million in exchange for a two year contract They also approved the fire sale of the company from US bankruptcy court for million in March This erased over billion in debt br Iridium service was restarted in by the newly founded Iridium Satellite LLC which was owned by a group of private investors br On February the Iridium satellite collided with a defunct Russian satellite named Kosmos kilometres mi over Siberia Two large debris clouds were created br br br Iridium NEXT launch campaign br Iridium replaced its original constellation by sending new Iridium satellites into space on SpaceX Falcon rockets in a series of launches The campaign also consisted of upgrades to Iridium ground infrastructure br The Iridium NEXT launch campaign was announced in Within three years Iridium completed financing and began work on launching new satellites In June Iridium announced a fixed price contract with Thales Alenia Space for the design and construction of the next generation satellites for the upgraded constellation Two weeks later Iridium announced a million contract designating the Falcon as a major provider of launch services for the Iridium NEXT campaign becoming the largest single commercial launch deal ever signed simultaneously representing a benchmark in cost effective satellite delivery to space br On January years after the campaign was first announced the first of eight Iridium NEXT launches took place with SpaceX from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California Over the next two years Iridium sent an additional satellites into low Earth orbit to completely replace the original satellite constellation The final Iridium NEXT launch took place on January less than two years after the first launch br The Iridium NEXT network covers the entire Earth including poles oceans and airways with satellites with the remaining nine acting as active backups for a total of launched Six remain on the ground as spares for a total of built br br br Present status br Iridium Satellite LLC merged with a special purpose acquisition company GHQ created by the investment bank Greenhill Co in September to create Iridium Communications Inc The public company trades on NASDAQ under the symbol IRDM The company surpassed one million subscribers in March Revenue for the full year was million with operational EBITDA of million a increase from million in the prior year br Iridium manages several operations centers including Tempe Arizona and Leesburg Virginia United States br The system is being used by the U S Department of Defense br Matt Desch is the current CEO of Iridium LLC br br br Hosted Payload Alliance br Iridium is a founding member of the Hosted Payload Alliance HPA a satellite industry alliance program Membership in the HPA is open to satellite operators satellite manufacturers system integrators and other interested parties br br br Air safety communications br In July the Federal Aviation Administration FAA issued a ruling that approves the use of Iridium for Future Air Navigation System FANS data links enabling satellite data links with air traffic control for aircraft flying in the FANS environment including areas not served by Inmarsat above or below degrees latitude which includes polar routes br br br Global Maritime Distress and Safety System br In January the Iridium constellation was certified for use in the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System GMDSS The certification ended a monopoly on the provision of maritime distress services that had previously been held by Inmarsat since the system became operational in br br br Adoption of standard based solutions for cellphones br In Qualcomm and Iridium announced an agreement that was supposed to bring two way satellite messaging service to Android smartphones The service called Snapdragon Satellite should have been supported starting with devices that feature Snapdragon Gen chipsets which was expected to be launched in the second half of The solution for smartphones was supposed to utilize Iridium s L Band spectrum for downlink and uplink br On November Iridium announced that Qualcomm had notified them about the end of their partnership due to a lack of interest in Qualcomm s and Iridium s proprietary solution by smartphone manufacturers A Qualcomm spokesman stated Smartphone makers have indicated a preference towards standards based solutions for satellite to phone connectivity We expect to continue to collaborate with Iridium on standards based solutions while discontinuing efforts on the proprietary solution that was introduced earlier this year br In Iridium introduceed Project Stardust a GPP standard based satellite to cellphone service focusing on messaging emergency communications and IoT for devices like cars smartphones tablets and related consumer applications The solution will be supported using a version of the NB IoT standard for G non terrestrial networks NTN Scheduled for launch in it won t replace the company s proprietary solution for voice and high speed data instead it will co exist with that offering on the Iridium s existing global low earth orbit satellite network br br br Russo Ukrainian War br From Iridium Satellite was selling navigation systems directly to its Russian subsidiary Iridium Communications In the Moscow based subsidiary gave the National Guard of Russia access to the satellite constellation br Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine Iridium structured their operations to comply with US sanctions and stopped shipment of end user equipment to Russia Despite this In Iridium Communications via some unknown intermediaries imported machines made by the American parent company for receiving and converting voice and images br br br Iridium satellite constellation br br The Iridium system requires active satellites in low Earth orbit to complete its constellation and spare satellites are kept in orbit to serve in case of failure The satellites are in six polar orbital planes at a height of approximately miles km Satellites communicate with neighboring satellites via Ka band intersatellite links to relay communications to and from ground stations The original constellation was launched in the late s before the company went through bankruptcy In January Iridium began to launch its next generation satellites through its billion launch campaign Iridium NEXT The new satellites were sent into space on SpaceX Falcon launch vehicles from Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex in California over the course of eight launches between January and January On January SpaceX launched of the new Iridium satellites into orbit The second launch of Iridium NEXT satellites took place on June on a SpaceX Falcon rocket out of Vandenberg Air Force Base This was the second of eight scheduled launches The third launch of NEXT satellites took place on October On December ten additional satellites were deployed after a successful launch on a SpaceX Falcon rocket On May SpaceX successfully launched an additional five Iridium NEXT satellites from Vandenberg Air Force Base br On January the final ten satellites were placed in orbit by SpaceX br br br Subscriber equipment br br br Handsets br Iridium offers four satellite handsets the A which is only available to US government customers the Extreme and the Extreme PTT br br br Wi Fi Hotspots br In Iridium began to offer the Iridium Go hotspot which can also be used as a distress beacon under certain circumstances As of September Iridium s manufacturing contractor Beam Communications had built of these devices br br br One way pagers br Two pagers were made for the Iridium network the Motorola and Kyocera SP K These are one way devices that could receive messages sent in the form of SMS br Messages are delivered to pre selected MDAs which cover a certain geographic area Three of these MDAs may be selected on a web based portal or updated automatically if the paging service is bound to an Iridium phone Each country has its own MDA based on its country code some of the larger countries are divided into several MDAs while separate MDAs exist for sections of ocean and common aeronautic routes br Pagers are assigned with telephone numbers in area code and can also be contacted using email SMS and the web based interface used to send messages to Iridium phones br br br Two way satellite messengers br In Garmin announced inReach SE and inReach Explorer satellite communicators which use Iridium satellite network for global coverage Garmin inReach mini a satellite messenger was announced a year later These devices can send and receive text messages with any cell phone number email address or another inReach device as well as to provide location sharing navigation and direct communication options to emergency services br ZOLEO satellite communicator uses global Iridium network when cellular or Wi Fi coverage is unavailable It does so by means of Bluetooth connection to provide two way messaging to connected smartphone or tablet devices br br br Other satellite phones br Several other Iridium based telephones exist such as payphones and equipment intended for installation on ships and aircraft The DPL handset made by NAL Research combined with a transceiver is used for some of these products This handset provides a user interface nearly identical to that of the series phones br br br Standalone transceiver units br These can be used for data logging applications in remote areas as in data collection satellites Some types of buoys such as those used for the tsunami warning system use Iridium satellites to communicate with their base The remote device is programmed to call or send short burst data SBD messages to the base at specified intervals or it can be set to accept calls in order for it to offload its collected data br The following transceivers have been released over the years br br Iridium Core Similar to the B a modular transceiver released in br Iridium B A transceiver released in late is smaller than the A and has similar features It also supports Circuit Switched Data CSD not just SBD br Iridium A Based on the some variants have built in GPS and autonomous reporting functions Supports SBD br Motorola Last Motorola transceiver supports outgoing SMS but no SBD br Motorola Original transceiver module does not support outgoing SMS or SBD Designed for use in vehicles with accompanying handset br br br Short burst data modems br These devices support only SBD for Internet of things IoT services and do not use a SIM card br br Iridium Supports only SBD several tracking devices and other products have been built around this modem It was an Iridium manufactured product designed as an OEM module for integration into applications that only use the Iridium Short Burst Data Service Short Burst Data applications are supported through an RS interface Examples of these applications include maritime vessel tracking or automatic vehicle tracking br Iridium Smaller cheaper version of released in br Iridium One fourth the volume and half the footprint of br br br Iridium OpenPort br Iridium OpenPort is a broadband satellite voice and data communications system for maritime vessels The system is used for crew calling and e mail services on sea vessels such as merchant fleets government and navy vessels fishing fleets and personal yachts br Iridium operates at only to kbit s which requires very aggressive voice compression and decompression algorithms By comparison AMR used in G phones requires a minimum of kbit s G requires kbit s and iLBC requires kbit s Latency for data connections averages ms round trip with a mode of to ms and a minimum around ms Latency is highly variable depending on the path data takes through the satellite constellation as well the need for retransmissions due to errors which may be around to for mobile originated packets under good conditions br br br Iridium Certus br One of the Iridium NEXT services is Iridium Certus a globally available satellite broadband which is capable of up to Kbps of bandwidth across maritime aviation land mobile government and IoT applications Terminals for the service are provided by Cobham Intellian Technologies and Thales br br br Iridium STL br Iridium is providing Satellite Time
