Seafile is an open source cross platform file hosting software system Files are stored on a central server and can be synchronized with personal computers and mobile devices through apps Files on the Seafile server can also be accessed directly via the server s web interface Seafile s functionality is similar to other popular file hosting services such as Dropbox and Google Drive The primary difference between Seafile and Dropbox Google Drive is that Seafile is a self hosted file sharing solution for private cloud applications In private clouds storage space and client connection limits are determined exclusively by the users own infrastructure and settings rather than the terms and conditions of a cloud service provider Additionally organizations whose data privacy policies bar them from using public cloud services can draw on Seafile to build a file sharing system of their own br br br History br In Daniel Pan and other former students of Tsinghua University Beijing embarked on a project aiming at building a peer to peer file sharing software Seafile was the name chosen for their software project The development team decided in to abandon this initial goal and refocussed on building a file syncing software with a more traditional client server architecture the architecture also used by Dropbox and other file hosting service providers br In Daniel Pan Jonathan Xu and
