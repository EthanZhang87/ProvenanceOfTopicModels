chips for magnetic storage products David D French joined Cirrus Logic Inc as president and chief operating officer in June and was named chief executive officer in February Soon after joining the company through an acquisition strategy French repositioned the company into a premier supplier of high performance analog and digital processing chip solutions for consumer entertainment electronics and soon afterwards M Yousuf Palla joined as Vice President of Operations and Manufacturing contributing further to its success The company announced in April that it had completed moving its

collaboration with Elliptic to optimize the CS L smart boosted amplifier using the Elliptic Labs AI Virtual Smart Sensor Platform br br br Graphics history br In the early s Cirrus Logic was a supplier of low cost PC graphics chips Cirrus s Microsoft Windows D GUI accelerators GDI were among the fastest in the low end market segment outperforming competing VGA chips from Oak Technologies Trident Microsystems and Paradise Western Digital For example the Cirrus GD supported hardware acceleration for both bit color and bit color It was one of the lowest priced SVGA controllers to support both br By the mid s when PCs had migrated to the PCI bus Cirrus had fallen behind S and Trident Microsystems When the announced release date of the GD Mondello came and went Cirrus s reputation in desktop PC graphics suffered Mondello development took a back seat to the GD which was near completion and proved to be a much faster design with the use of Rambus Because of this Mondello never got off the ground br The company s final graphics chips the GD x Laguna series of PCI AGP D accelerators were novel in that they were one of the few video cards to use Rambus RDRAM The patented use of tiled memory by the GD x chips is still used by nearly all graphics processors today However like many other D and D chips at the time were gate limited by the process technology available at the time the feature set of perspective correct texture mapping bilinear filtering single pass lighting gouraud shading and alpha blending was incomplete compared to the next generation of D chips The GD x family was limited by CPU processing at the time CPUs could not feed it enough triangles which was the real performance block The raw processing power of the GD x was nearly million pixel triangles per second much faster than competitors br When Intel announced they were entering the D market with the i Cirrus Logic exited the market which at the time for Cirrus Logic was worth million dollars annually Intel didn t catch up in performance for many years the i was not widely accepted and did not win any major designs br Cirrus Logic graphic cards are used in emulators Both QEMU and Bochs
