Masimo Corporation is a health technology and consumer electronics company based in Irvine California The company primarily manufactures patient monitoring devices and technologies including non invasive sensors using optical technology patient management and telehealth platforms In the company expanded into home audio by acquiring Sound United and began to manufacture health oriented wearable devices br br br History br Masimo was founded in by electrical engineer Joe Kiani who was later joined by fellow engineer Mohamed Diab br Masimo went public in and is currently traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the symbol MASI In Forbes named Masimo to its list of top public companies under a billion dollars in revenue br In Masimo acquired Sound United which owns premium audio brands such as Bowers Wilkins Denon Marantz Definitive Technology Polk Audio Class and Boston Acoustics The company stated that the acquisition gave it access to more retail channels and product engineers and that it planned to leverage Denon s HEOS network connected speakers as smart home hubs for aggregating health data from its services and devices br In October the United States International Trade Commission ITC ruled that Apple Inc had infringed upon patents for light based pulse oximetry owned by Masimo in its Apple Watch product line Masimo accused Apple of poaching engineers from the company after it declined offers to partner with or be acquired by Apple Apple denied these claims stating that it had discussed partnerships with several vendors and declined to work with Masimo because it was not in the consumer market br br br Technology br br br Signal Extraction Technology SET pulse oximetry br Pulse oximetry uses two light emitting diodes LEDs one red and one infrared to measure the absorption of light and translates that into the percentage of hemoglobin molecules that are bound to oxygen which is called arterial oxygen saturation SpO Conventional pulse oximetry assumes that arterial blood is the only blood moving pulsating in the measurement site However during patient motion the venous blood also moves which can cause conventional pulse oximetry to under read SpO levels because it cannot distinguish between the arterial and venous blood br SET identifies the venous blood signal which has a lower oxygen saturation level than arterial blood isolates it and uses adaptive filters to extract the arterial signal in order to report accurate SpO and pulse rate In addition SET pulse oximetry provides perfusion index PI and pleth variability index PVI Multiple studies have shown that compared to non SET pulse oximeters SET increases the ability to detect life threatening events and reduces false alarms Additional studies have also shown the impact of SET on patient outcomes such as helping clinicians br br Decrease retinopathy of prematurity ROP in neonates br Increase detection of critical congenital heart disease CCHD in newborns br Reduce ventilator weaning time by titrating FiO faster and reduce arterial blood gas measurements in the Intensive Care Unit ICU br Decrease rapid response activations and Intensive Care Unit ICU transfers through earlier identification of patients in distress through low SpO and abnormal pulse rate measurements br Decrease fluid administered during surgery and reduce patient risk br In the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U S Department of Health and Human Services recommended mandatory screening for all newborns using motion tolerant pulse oximeters that report functional oxygen saturation have been validated in low perfusion conditions To make this recommendation the CCHD workgroup relied on two independent studies that exclusively used SET pulse oximetry to assess newborns In Masimo received FDA k clearance for devices and sensors with labeling for screening newborns for CCHD It marked the first time the FDA cleared specific labeling indicating the use of pulse oximeters in conjunction with a physical examination to screen newborns for CCHD br In the National Health Service NHS Technology Adoption Centre in the United Kingdom advised hospitals to use Intraoperative Fluid Management and included Masimo s PVI among technologies available for helping clinicians manage fluid during surgeries In the French Society for Anaesthesia and Intensive Care SFAR added PVI to its guidelines for optimal hemodynamic management of surgical patients br br br Rainbow Pulse CO Oximetry br Rainbow Pulse CO Oximetry uses more than seven wavelengths of light to continuously and noninvasively measure hemoglobin SpHb carboxyhemoglobin SpCO and methemoglobin SpMet in addition to oxygen saturation SpO pulse rate perfusion index Pi and pleth variability index PVi A study at Massachusetts General Hospital showed that SpHb monitoring helped clinicians decrease the frequency of patients receiving blood transfusions during surgery from to Another study from Cairo University showed that SpHb monitoring helped clinicians reduce blood transfusions in high blood loss surgery by an average of units per patient A study at CHU Limoges in France found that monitoring with SpHb and PVi integrated into a hospital wide fluid and blood administration protocol was associated with earlier transfusion and reduced mortality at and days by and respectively Emergency department studies have shown that SpCO helps clinicians increase the detection of carbon monoxide CO poisoning and decreases the time to treatment compared to invasive methods The Pronto device for noninvasive spot checking of hemoglobin along with SpO and pulse rate has been recognized with a gold Medical Design Excellence Award The World Health Organization called noninvasive hemoglobin an innovative medical technology for cost effectively addressing global health concerns and needs br In October Masimo announced CE Marking of Oxygen Reserve Index or ORi the company s th noninvasive parameter which provides real time visibility to oxygenation status ORi is intended to supplement not replace oxygen saturation SpO monitoring and partial pressure of oxygen PaO measurements ORi can be trended and has optional alarms to notify clinicians of changes in a patient s oxygen reserve and may enable proactive interventions to avoid hypoxia and unintended hyperoxia br br br Patient and consumer monitoring br br br SafetyNet br Patient SafetyNet is a remote monitoring and notification system designed for patients on medical surgical care floors A large study by Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center showed Patient SafetyNet helped clinicians achieve a reduction in distress codes and rescue activations and a decrease in patient transfers to intensive care units ICU yielding a savings of Intensive Care Unit ICU days annually for an annual opportunity cost savings of million br In Dartmouth Hitchcock published a retrospective study showing that over ten years of using Patient SafetyNet there were zero patient deaths and no patients were harmed by opioid induced respiratory depression while continuous monitoring with Masimo SET was in use ECRI Institute gave Dartmouth its Health Devices Achievement Award for its use of Patient SafetyNet to prevent severe patient harm Masimo has introduced Halo ION in the Patient SafetyNet system combining multiple physiologic parameters into one number to help clinicians assess overall patient status br In amid the COVID pandemic the company released Masimo SafetyNet a telehealth system for remote patient monitoring via sensors connected to smartphones The mobile apps transmit this data to a HIPAA compliant cloud server allowing it to be monitored by physicians br br br Rainbow acoustic monitoring br Rainbow acoustic monitoring provides non invasive and continuous measurement of respiration rate using an adhesive sensor with an integrated acoustic transducer that is applied to the patient s neck Researchers have evaluated acoustic respiration rate RRa and found the acceptable accuracy and significantly fewer false alarms than traditional respiration rate monitoring methods end tidal carbon dioxide EtCO and impedance pneumography br br br SedLine brain function monitoring br In Masimo began offering brain function monitoring to measure the effects of anesthesia and sedation by monitoring both sides of the brain s electrical activity EEG Studies have shown this results in more individualized titration and improved care br br br Capnography and gas monitoring br Masimo began offering ultra compact mainstream and sidestream capnography as well as multigas analyzers for end tidal carbon dioxide CO nitrous oxide N O oxygen O and anesthetic agents for use in the operating room procedural sedation and in intensive care units ICU A multi center study at Cincinnati Children s Hospital Medical Center University Medical Center Tucson Arizona and Children s Medical Center Dallas found that respiratory rate measured from noninvasive acoustic monitoring had similar accuracy and precision as nasal capnography the current standard of care when used in pediatric patients br br br Opioid monitoring and treatments br In June the company released Bridge a medical device intended to reduce symptoms of opioid withdrawal via neuromodulation br In April the company received FDA approval for a pulse oximetry based device for preventing opioid overdose by providing alerts of respiratory depression The device which was the subject of an innovation challenge issued by the FDA received a De Novo classification allowing it to be distributed over the counter and through prescription br br br Smartwatches br In Masimo released the W a smartwatch that includes continuous health monitoring features and integrated with Masimo s other product lines It was released in a limited public launch in the U S and to telehealth providers internationally br br br br br br External links
