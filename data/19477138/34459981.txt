and Novaled Back in UDC claimed that virtually all AMOLEDs on the market use our technology Based in Ewing New Jersey with international offices in Ireland South Korea Hong Kong Japan and Taiwan Universal Display works with a network of organizations including Princeton University the University of Southern California the University of Michigan and PPG Industries br UDC has been subject to a number of patent disputes The patents however have been upheld as valid br br br Technological advantages br br The different manufacturing process of OLEDs lends itself to several advantages over flat panel displays made with current LCD technology br br Lower cost in the future br OLEDs can be printed onto any suitable substrate by an inkjet printer or even by screen printing theoretically making them cheaper to produce than LCD or plasma displays However fabrication of the OLED substrate is more costly than that of a TFT LCD until mass production methods lower cost through scalability Roll to roll vapour deposition methods for organic devices do allow mass production of thousands of devices per minute for minimal cost although this technique also induces problems in that devices with multiple layers can be challenging to make because of registration lining up the different printed layers to the required degree of accuracy br Lightweight and flexible plastic substrates br OLED displays can be fabricated on flexible plastic substrates leading to the possible fabrication of flexible organic light emitting diodes for other new applications such as roll up displays embedded in fabrics or clothing As the substrate used can be flexible such as polyethylene terephthalate PET the displays may be produced inexpensively br Wider viewing angles and improved brightness br OLEDs can enable a greater artificial contrast ratio both dynamic range and static measured in purely dark conditions and a wider viewing angle compared to LCDs because OLED pixels emit light directly OLED pixel colors appear correct and unshifted even as the viewing angle approaches from normal br Better power efficiency and thickness br LCDs filter the light emitted from a backlight allowing a small fraction of light through So they cannot show true black However an inactive OLED element does not produce light or consume power thus allowing true blacks Dismissing the backlight also makes OLEDs lighter because some substrates are not needed This allows electronics potentially to be manufactured more cheaply but first a larger production scale is needed because OLEDs still somewhat are niche products When looking at top emitting OLEDs thickness also plays a role when talking about index match layers IMLs Emission intensity is enhanced when the IML thickness is nm The refractive value and the matching of the optical IMLs property including the device structure parameters also enhance the emission intensity at these thicknesses br Response time br OLEDs also can have a faster response time than standard LCD screens Whereas LCD displays are capable of between and ms response time offering a refresh rate of to Hz an OLED theoretically can have a response time less than ms enabling a refresh rate up to Hz OLEDs also can be run as a flicker display similar to a CRT in order to eliminate the sample and hold effect that creates motion blur on OLEDs br Some disadvantages include br br Power consumption br While an OLED will consume around of the power of an LCD displaying an image that is primarily black for the majority of images it will consume of the power of an LCD However an OLED can use more than three times as much power to display an image with a white background such as a document or web site This can lead to reduced battery life in mobile devices when white backgrounds are used br According to OLED Display Samsung Display uses different Sub Pixel Matrix technologies for their smartphone Super Amoled Displays For the Galaxy S and S they use the Diamond Pixel Matrix br br br Smartphones br br Universal Display s OLED screens currently feature in Samsung s Galaxy S S II and S III S IV and S V smartphones The Galaxy S sold million units in the first three months after its launch in April Also their Galaxy Note has sold million units since launch br Samsung s new flagship smartphone the Galaxy S sports a Full HD x PPI Super AMOLED display behind a Corning Gorilla Glass br Universal Display reported that Samsung Display Corporation SDC adopted UDC s green PHOLED host and emitter in the Full HD Super AMOLED display used in the GS smartphone This is a significant development as the green PHOLED increases energy efficiency of displays by up to br Nokia s new Lumia smartphone and BlackBerry s Q and Z models are the most recent phones to sport OLED screens br In October Samsung released the first ever curved display smartphone called the Galaxy Round Samsung also introduced the Roll Effect where when the phone s screen is off and is rolled it displays basic information like time or battery percentage While it is possible to curve LCD screens analysts say OLED screens provide better technical benefits br The Galaxy S launched in Feb has a inch Super AMOLED screen The unique feature is the GS also has a new software feature when the battery is low it switches to an ultra power saving mode which changes the screen to monochrome lowers the brightness and closes all non essential features In this low power mode the GS can last up to hours in standby on that battery br Samsung introduced the Galaxy Round smartphone in the Korean market in October The device features a p screen measuring inches cm that curves on the vertical axis in a rounded case The corporation has promoted the following advantages A new feature called Round Interaction that allows users to look at information by tilting the handset on a flat surface with the screen off and the feel of one continuous transition when the user switches between home screens

June Samsung announced the Korean availability of a inch curved OLED HDTV Priced at million Korean won around Samsung also reiterates the claim LG made when it launched its own curved OLED model that keeping all parts of the screen an equal distance from the viewer makes for a better viewing experience By August Samsung dropped the price of the OLED television by claiming better yields in manufacturing br In September at the IFA electronics show Samsung unveiled their inch K AMOLED television br LG showcased an Ultra High Definition UHD curved inch screen at the IFA electronics show This is a K WRGB OLEd screen In October LG reported that their Television sales has jumped x in volume shipments since br CNET reviewed the LG EC OLED Television in September and called it The best Picture Ever Combining the best qualities of LED and Plasma without the disadvantages br With the arrival of Quantum Dot LCD displays LG released an article describing why they still see OLED as the future of Television displays In fact OLED technology is the technology that is so much advanced that it should not be compared to an LCD based QD Hence even though LG already has the technology to create QD backlighting it is focusing on developing OLED br Consumer Reports an American Magazine covering reviews of consumer products published their review of OLED televisions saying that their TV

microdisplays made by Samsung Display with licensed technology from Universal Display br Sony have announced the rd generation of their Heads Up Micro Displays HMD using OLED panels from UDC br OLEDs enable screens to be made in curved or flexible format Samsung s flexible AMOLEDs will be fabricated on a plastic Polyimide substrate and will be able to withstand high temperature up to degrees The displays can be bendable but since the first products will use them inside rigid glass cases so it ll actually be curved displays and not flexible ones A plastic based AMOLED will be shatterproof and will also be lighter and thinner compared to glass based OLEDs br OLED Info reports that for flexible displays on plastic UDC s UniversalBarrier single layer encapsulation technology is being evaluated by Samsung UDC has a working R D deposition machine for the encapsulation layer They go on to describe how Corning Glass have developed a flexible glass to help speed up the adoption of bendable OLED screens On Aug Corning and AU Optronics announced that Corning is an important and strategic highperformance display glass collaborator for AUO s line of AMOLED panels AUO selected the Corning Lotus Glass platform based on the glass substrate s outstanding thermal and dimensional stability This aids AUO with efficient manufacturing during the high temperature processes that are required to develop its AMOLED panels Corning is also developing a Roll to Roll manufacturing process that will greatly reduce costs of mass producing flexible displays br UBI Research published a new report on flexible OLED displays forecasting a very fast growth from million units in to million units in UBI sees billion in flexible OLED revenues in This is far more optimistic than the recent report by Markets Markets who see the entire flexible display market at billion in br The Flexible Display Center announced that it has successfully manufactured the world s largest flexible color AMOLED prototype using advanced mixed oxide thin film transistors TFTs Measuring diagonal inches the device was developed at the FDC in conjunction with Army Research Labs scientists It also meets a critical target set by the U S Department of Defense to advance the development of full color full motion video flexible OLED displays for use in thin lightweight bendable and highly rugged devices br This is a significant manufacturing breakthrough for flexible display technology said Nick Colaneri director of the FDC It provides a realistic path forward for the production of high performance flexible full color OLED displays accelerating commercialization of the technology in the process br Universal Display s Sid Rosenblatt talking about the future of OLED technology was quoted as saying Samsung is going to introduce flexible screens but the flexible plastic substrates are difficult to manufacture Plastic is porous and oxygen with moisture causes OLEDs to degrade However These kind of displays are unbreakable flexible on stainless steel foil It would result in a thinner device because you don t have the pieces of glass It could conform around the sides so you can show information on the sides It would be lighter So you can either make it smaller or thinner or you can make a larger battery so that it lasts longer The challenges are encapsulation so you need an encapsulation process The temperature is too high to deposit them directly to the plastic so they do is they literally deposit them on glass Further SID Rosenblatt thinks that flexible OLEDs will be initially a niche market for the high end br iSuppli a market research firm sees the flexible OLED display market growing significantly from to Their estimates are from a market value of million in to million in and reaching billion by IHS says this will bring about unprecedented change s in flat displays Both LG and Samsung believe that flexible displays will make up as much as of the Smartphone maker by br At the Flextech Conference in Phoenix Arizona Plastic Logic and Novaled demonstrated a new really bendable and completely organic AMOLED display OLED News said This is a very important technological advance For the first time we have an entirely plastic AMOLED with backplane electronics manufactured in a special low temperature process The industrial techniques applied open up real prospects of mass producing these displays at a very competitive unit cost Plastic Logic CEO Indro Mukerjee spoke of as the year when wearable technology is going to really take off He described the advance that has been made in the following Flexible electronics is a reality already proven through the development and manufacture of plastic bendable displays and sensors For the first time a fully organic plastic flexible AMOLED demonstration has been achieved with a real industrial fabrication process This marks the start of a revolution in wearable products the next frontier in consumer br br br Apple br Apple began using OLED panels in its watches in and in its laptops in with the introduction of an OLED touchbar to the MacBook Pro In Apple announced the introduction of their tenth

Dietmar Thomas Philips OLED communication and brand manager says Philips OLED performance increased dramatically in the past years Their most advanced panel the GL Gen offers lumens and lm W In mid Philips expects to release a panel the GL Gen that will be brighter lumens and more efficient lm W br According to OLED Display net OLED technology has been found useful in creating new forms of lighting Because of the potential inherent with OLED technology in terms of its flexibility transparency and thickness a myriad of new possibilities exist for OLED illumination lighting and light display shows The potential is almost infinite because OLED technology has proven to show lifetimes over hours and because it burns at rates that surpass the efficiency of halogen and can reach up to lm W In addition OLED lighting utilizes less CO requires less energy and contains no toxic substances This opens up a revolutionary concept of lighting displays and light based art conceptions br OLED technology is at a premium relative to LED but there are superior lighting quality benefits said Jeannine Fisher Wang director of business development and marketing for Acuity s OLED group The overall design and construction of these luminaires is very high quality reflective of the superior nature of the OLED light source OLED will become mainstream predicts Darice Liu a spokeswoman for UDC We believe that OLED lighting has the potential to dominate many of the residential and commercial market applications br br br Patent disputes br In UDC reported two favorable patent decisions The first one is from Japan regarding two patents JP and JP relating to UDC s L MX technology The patents were upheld as valid by the Japanese patent office The second decision related to one of the OVJP patents in Korea The Korean patent office issued a favorable decision which upheld the patent as valid Some financial analysts have contended that Universal Display s patents are likely to be rescinded in November at the EPO Board of Appeal However Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uekwitz already chimed in to defend them saying Asensio s latest article contains nothing new or valuable that wasn t already disclosed in its most recent quarterly report br br br
