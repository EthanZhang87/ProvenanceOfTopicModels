The United States dollar symbol currency code USD also abbreviated US to distinguish it from other dollar denominated currencies referred to as the dollar U S dollar American dollar or colloquially buck is the official currency of the United States and several other countries The Coinage Act of introduced the U S dollar at par with the Spanish silver dollar divided it into cents and authorized the minting of coins denominated in dollars and cents U S banknotes are issued in the form of Federal Reserve Notes popularly called greenbacks due to their predominantly green color br The monetary policy of the United States is conducted by the Federal Reserve System which acts as the nation s central bank br The U S dollar was originally defined under a bimetallic standard of grains g troy ounces fine silver or from grains g fine gold or per troy ounce The Gold Standard Act of linked the dollar solely to gold From its equivalence to gold was revised to per troy ounce In all links to gold were repealed br The U S dollar became an important international reserve currency after the First World War and displaced the pound sterling as the world s primary reserve currency by the Bretton Woods Agreement towards the end of the Second World War The dollar is the most widely used currency in international transactions and a free floating currency It is also the official currency in several countries and the de facto currency in many others with Federal Reserve Notes and in a few cases U S coins used in circulation br As of February currency in circulation amounted to US trillion trillion of which is in Federal Reserve Notes the remaining billion is in the form of coins and older style United States Notes br As of September the Federal Reserve estimated that the total amount of currency in circulation was approximately US trillion br br br Overview br br br In the Constitution br Article I Section of the U S Constitution provides that Congress has the power t o coin money Laws implementing this power are currently codified in Title of the U S Code under Section which prescribes the forms in which the United States dollars should be issued These coins are both designated in the section as legal tender in payment of debts The Sacagawea dollar is one example of the copper alloy dollar in contrast to the American Silver Eagle which is pure silver Section also provides for the minting and issuance of other coins which have values ranging from one cent U S Penny to dollars These other coins are more fully described in Coins of the United States dollar br Article I Section of the Constitution provides that a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time which is further specified by Section of Title of the U S Code The sums of money reported in the Statements are currently expressed in U S dollars thus the U S dollar may be described as the unit of account of the United States Dollar is one of the first words of Section in which the term refers to the Spanish milled dollar or the coin worth eight Spanish reales br br br Coinage Act br In the U S Congress passed the Coinage Act of which Section authorized the production of various coins including Dollars or Units each to be of the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current and to contain three hundred and seventy one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver Section of the Act designates the United States dollar as the unit of currency of the United States T he money of account of the United States shall be expressed in dollars or units and that all accounts in the public offices and all proceedings in the courts of the United States shall be kept and had in conformity to this regulation br br br Decimal units br Unlike the Spanish milled dollar the Continental Congress and the Coinage Act prescribed a decimal system of units to go with the unit dollar as follows the mill or one thousandth of a dollar the cent or one hundredth of a dollar the dime or one tenth of a dollar and the eagle or ten dollars The current relevance of these units br br Only the cent is used as everyday division of the dollar br The dime is used solely as the name of the coin with the value of cents br The mill is relatively unknown but before the mid th century was familiarly used in matters of sales taxes as well as gasoline prices which are usually in the form of per gallon e g commonly written as br The eagle is also largely unknown to the general public This term was used in the Coinage Act of for the denomination of ten dollars and subsequently was used in naming gold coins br The Spanish peso or dollar was historically divided into eight reales colloquially bits hence pieces of eight Americans also learned counting in non decimal bits of cents before when Mexican bits were more frequently encountered than American cents in fact this practice survived in New York Stock Exchange quotations until br In Secretary of the Treasury James Guthrie proposed creating and gold coins to be referred to as a union half union and quarter union respectively thus implying a denomination of Union However no such coins were ever struck and only patterns for the half union exist br When currently issued in circulating form denominations less than or equal to a dollar are emitted as U S coins while denominations greater than or equal to a dollar are emitted as Federal Reserve Notes disregarding these special cases br br Gold coins issued for circulation until the s up to the value of known as the double eagle br Bullion or commemorative gold silver platinum and palladium coins valued up to as legal tender though worth far more as bullion br Civil War paper currency issue in denominations below i e fractional currency sometimes pejoratively referred to as shinplasters br br br Etymology br br In the th century Count Hieronymus Schlick of Bohemia began minting coins known as joachimstalers named for Joachimstal the valley in which the silver was mined In turn the valley s name is titled after Saint Joachim whereby thal or tal a cognate of the English word dale is German for valley The joachimstaler was later shortened to the German taler a word that eventually found its way into many languages including br tolar Czech Slovak and Slovenian daler Danish and Swedish talar Polish br dalar and daler Norwegian daler or daalder Dutch br talari Ethiopian br tall r Hungarian br tallero Italian br Arabic and dollar English br Though the Dutch pioneered in modern day New York in the th century the use and the counting of money in silver dollars in the form of German Dutch reichsthalers and native Dutch leeuwendaalders lion dollars it was the ubiquitous Spanish American eight real coin which became exclusively known as the dollar since the th century br br br Nicknames br br The colloquialism buck s much like the British quid for the pound sterling is often used to refer to dollars of various nations including the U S dollar This term dating to the th century may have originated with the colonial leather trade or it may also have originated from a poker term br Greenback is another nickname originally applied specifically to the th century Demand Note dollars which were printed black and green on the backside created by Abraham Lincoln to finance the North for the Civil War It is still used to refer to the U S dollar but not to the dollars of other countries The term greenback is also used by the financial press in other countries such as br Australia New Zealand South Africa and India br Other well known names of the dollar as a whole in denominations include greenmail green and dead presidents the latter of which referring to the deceased presidents pictured on most bills Dollars in general have also been known as bones e g twenty bones The newer designs with portraits displayed in the main body of the obverse rather than in cameo insets upon paper color coded by denomination are sometimes referred to as bigface notes or Monopoly money br Piastre was the original French word for the U S dollar used for example in the French text of the Louisiana Purchase Though the U S dollar is called dollar in Modern French the term piastre is still used among the speakers of Cajun French and New England French as well as speakers in Haiti and other French speaking Caribbean islands br Nicknames specific to denomination br br The quarter dollar coin is known as two bits alluding the dollar s origins as the piece of eight bits or reales br The bill is nicknamed buck or single br The infrequently used bill is sometimes called deuce Tom or Jefferson after Thomas Jefferson br The bill is sometimes called Lincoln after Abraham Lincoln fin fiver or five spot br The bill is sometimes called sawbuck ten spot or Hamilton after Alexander Hamilton br The bill is sometimes called double sawbuck Jackson after Andrew Jackson or double eagle br The bill is sometimes called a yardstick or a grant after President Ulysses S Grant br The bill is called Benjamin Benji Ben or Franklin referring to its portrait of Benjamin Franklin Other nicknames include C note C being the Roman numeral for century note or bill e g two bills br Amounts or multiples of are sometimes called grand in colloquial speech abbreviated in written form to G K or k from kilo e g k Likewise a large or stack can also refer to a multiple of e g fifty large br br br Dollar sign br br The symbol usually written before the numerical amount is used for the U S dollar as well as for many other currencies The sign was the result of a late th century evolution of the scribal abbreviation ps for the peso the common name for the Spanish dollars that were in wide circulation in the New World from the th to the th centuries The p and the s eventually came to be written over each other giving rise to br Another popular explanation is that it is derived from the Pillars of Hercules on the Spanish Coat of arms of the Spanish dollar These Pillars of Hercules on the silver Spanish dollar coins take the form of two vertical bars and a swinging cloth band in the shape of an S br Yet another explanation suggests that the dollar sign was formed from the capital letters U and S written or printed one on top of the other This theory popularized by novelist Ayn Rand in Atlas Shrugged does not consider the fact that the symbol was already in use before the formation of the United States br br br History br br br Origins the Spanish dollar br The U S dollar was introduced at par with the Spanish American silver dollar or Spanish peso Spanish milled dollar eight real coin piece of eight The latter was produced from the rich silver mine output of Spanish America was minted in Mexico City Potos Bolivia Lima Peru and elsewhere and was in wide circulation throughout the Americas Asia and Europe from the th to the th centuries The minting of machine milled Spanish dollars since boosted its worldwide reputation as a trade coin and positioned it to be the model for the new currency of the United States br Even after the United States Mint commenced issuing coins in locally minted dollars and cents were less abundant in circulation than Spanish American pesos and reales hence Spanish Mexican and American dollars all remained legal tender in the United States until the Coinage Act of In particular colonists familiarity with the Spanish two real quarter peso was the reason for issuing a quasi decimal cent quarter dollar coin rather than a cent coin br For the relationship between the Spanish dollar and the individual state colonial currencies see Connecticut pound Delaware pound Georgia pound Maryland pound Massachusetts pound New Hampshire pound New Jersey pound New York pound North Carolina pound Pennsylvania pound Rhode Island pound South Carolina pound and Virginia pound br br br Coinage Act of br br On July the Continental Congress resolved that the money unit of the United States the dollar would contain grains of fine silver on August the Continental Congress continued that definition and further resolved that the money of account corresponding with the division of coins would proceed in a decimal ratio with the sub units being mills at of a dollar cents at of a dollar and dimes at of a dollar br After the adoption of the United States Constitution the U S dollar was defined by the Coinage Act of It specified a dollar based on the Spanish milled dollar to contain grains of fine silver or grains g of standard silver of fineness as well as an eagle to contain grains of fine gold or grains g of karat or fine gold Alexander Hamilton arrived at these numbers based on a treasury assay of the average fine silver content of a selection of worn Spanish dollars which came out to be grains Combined with the prevailing gold silver ratio of the standard for gold was calculated at grains fine gold or grains K gold Rounding the latter to grains finalized the dollar s standard to grains of fine gold or grains grams troy ounces of fine silver br The same coinage act also set the value of an eagle at dollars and the dollar at eagle It called for silver coins in denominations of and dollar as well as gold coins in denominations of and eagle The value of gold or silver contained in the dollar was then converted into relative value in the economy for the buying and selling of goods This allowed the value of things to remain fairly constant over time except for the influx and outflux of gold and silver in the nation s economy br Though a Spanish dollar freshly minted after theoretically contained grains of silver of fineness or grains fine silver reliable assays of the period in fact confirmed a fine silver content of grains g for the average Spanish dollar in circulation br br The new U S silver dollar of grains g therefore compared favorably and was received at par with the Spanish dollar for foreign payments and after the United States Mint had to suspend making this coin out of its limited resources since it failed to stay in domestic circulation It was only after Mexican independence in when their peso s fine silver content of grains was firmly upheld which the U S later had to compete with using a heavier grains g Trade dollar coin br br br Design br The early currency of the United States did not exhibit faces of presidents as is the custom now although today by law only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on United States currency In fact the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency a practice compared to the policies of European monarchs The currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early th century before that heads side of coinage used profile faces and striding seated and standing figures from Greek and Roman mythology and composite Native Americans The last coins to be converted to profiles of historic Americans were the dime the half Dollar and the Dollar br br br Continental currency br br After the American Revolution the Thirteen Colonies became independent Freed from British monetary regulations they each issued sd paper money to pay for military expenses The Continental Congress also began issuing Continental Currency denominated in Spanish dollars For its value relative to states currencies see Early American currency br Continental currency depreciated badly during the war giving rise to the famous phrase not worth a continental A primary problem was that monetary policy was not coordinated between Congress and the states which continued to issue bills of credit Additionally neither Congress nor the governments of the several states had the will or the means to retire the bills from circulation through taxation or the sale of bonds The currency was ultimately replaced by the silver dollar at the rate of silver dollar to continental dollars This resulted in the clause No state shall make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts being written into the United States Constitution article section br br br Silver and gold standards th century br From implementation of the Mint Act to the implementation of the gold standard the dollar was on a bimetallic silver and gold standard defined as either grains g of fine silver or grains of fine gold gold silver ratio br Subsequent to the Coinage Act of the dollar s fine gold equivalent was revised to grains it was slightly adjusted to grains g in gold silver ratio The same act also resolved the difficulty in minting the standard silver of fineness by revising the dollar s alloy to grains silver still containing grains fine silver Gold was also revised to fineness grains gross grains fine gold br Following the rise in the price of silver during the California Gold Rush and the disappearance of circulating silver coins the Coinage Act of reduced the standard for silver coins less than from grains to grains g silver per cents slightly revised to g silver in The Act also limited the free silver right of individuals to convert bullion into only one coin the silver dollar of grains smaller coins of lower standard can only be produced by the United States Mint using its own bullion br Summary and links to coins issued in the th century br br In base metal cent cent cents br In silver half dime dime quarter dollar half dollar silver dollar br In gold gold quarter eagle half eagle eagle double eagle br Less common denominations bronze cents nickel cents silver cents silver cents gold br br br Note issues th century br br In order to finance the War of Congress authorized the issuance of Treasury Notes interest bearing short term debt that could be used to pay public dues While they were intended to serve as debt they did function to a limited extent as money Treasury Notes were again printed to help resolve the reduction in public revenues resulting from the Panic of and the Panic of as well as to help finance the Mexican American War and the Civil War br Paper money was issued again in without the backing of precious metals due to the Civil War In addition to Treasury Notes Congress in authorized the Treasury to borrow million in the form of Demand Notes which did not bear interest but could be redeemed on demand for precious metals However by December the Union government s supply of specie was outstripped by demand for redemption and they were forced to suspend redemption temporarily In February Congress passed the Legal Tender Act of issuing United States Notes which were not redeemable on demand and bore no interest but were legal tender meaning that creditors had to accept them at face value for any payment except for public debts and import tariffs However silver and gold coins continued to be issued resulting in the depreciation of the newly printed notes through Gresham s Law In Supreme Court ruled in Hepburn v Griswold that Congress could not require creditors to accept United States Notes but overturned that ruling the next year in the Legal Tender Cases In Congress passed the Specie Payment Resumption Act requiring the Treasury to allow U S Notes to be redeemed for gold after January br br br Gold standard th century br br Though the dollar came under the gold standard de jure only after the bimetallic era was ended de facto when the Coinage Act of suspended the minting of the standard silver dollar of Troy grains g ozt the only fully legal tender coin that individuals could convert bullion into in unlimited or Free silver quantities and right at the onset of the silver rush from the Comstock Lode in the s This was the so called Crime of br The Gold Standard Act of repealed the U S dollar s historic link to silver and defined it solely as grains g of fine gold or per troy ounce of grains In gold coins were confiscated by Executive Order under Franklin D Roosevelt and in the standard was changed to per troy ounce fine gold or grains g per dollar br After a series of revisions to the gold peg was implemented culminating in the Nixon Shock of August which suddenly ended the convertibility of dollars to gold The U S dollar has since floated freely on the foreign exchange markets br br br Federal Reserve Notes th century to present br br Congress continued to issue paper money after the Civil War the latest of which is the Federal Reserve Note that was authorized by the Federal Reserve Act of Since the discontinuation of all other types of notes Gold Certificates in Silver Certificates in and United States Notes in U S dollar notes have since been issued exclusively as Federal Reserve Notes br br br Emergence as reserve currency br br The U S dollar first emerged as an important international reserve currency in the s displacing the British pound sterling as it emerged from the First World War relatively unscathed and since the United States was a significant recipient of wartime gold inflows After the United States emerged as an even stronger global superpower during the Second World War the Bretton Woods Agreement of established the U S dollar as the world s primary reserve currency and the only post war currency linked to gold Despite all links to gold being severed in the dollar continues to be the world s foremost reserve currency for international trade to this day br The Bretton Woods Agreement of also defined the post World War II monetary order and relations among modern day independent states by setting up a system of rules institutions and procedures to regulate the international monetary system The agreement founded the International Monetary Fund and other institutions of the modern day World Bank Group establishing the infrastructure for conducting international payments and accessing the global capital markets using the U S dollar br The monetary policy of the United States is conducted by the Federal Reserve System which acts as the nation s central bank It was founded in under the Federal Reserve Act in order to furnish an elastic currency for the United States and to supervise its banking system particularly in the aftermath of the Panic of br For most of the post war period the U S government has financed its own spending by borrowing heavily from the dollar lubricated global capital markets in debts denominated in its own currency and at minimal interest rates This ability to borrow heavily without facing a significant balance of payments crisis has been described as the United States s exorbitant privilege br br br Coins br br The United States Mint has issued legal tender coins every year from to the present From to the present the only denominations produced for circulation have

Federal Open Market Committee which is composed of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and out of the Federal Reserve Bank presidents and is implemented by all twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks br Monetary policy refers to actions made by central banks that determine the size and growth rate of the money supply available in the economy and which would result in desired objectives like low inflation low unemployment and stable financial systems The economy s aggregate money supply is the total of br br M money or Monetary Base dollars in currency and bank money balances credited to the

commercial bank that should be held as a reserve i e as deposits with the Federal Reserve with the rest available to loan or invest Higher requirements mean less money loaned or invested helping keep inflation in check Raising the federal funds rate earned on those reserves also helps achieve this objective br Open market operations the Federal Reserve buys or sells US Treasury bonds and other securities held by banks in exchange for reserves more reserves increase a bank s capacity to loan or invest elsewhere br Discount window lending banks can borrow from the Federal Reserve br Monetary

and inflation in the United States Effective monetary policy complements fiscal policy to support economic growth br The adjusted monetary base has increased from approximately billion in to billion in and to over trillion in br When the Federal Reserve makes a purchase it credits the seller s reserve account with the Federal Reserve This money is not transferred from any existing funds it is at this point that the Federal Reserve has created new high powered money Commercial banks then decide how much money to keep in deposit with the Federal Reserve and how much to hold as physical currency In the latter case the Federal Reserve places an order for printed money from the U S Treasury Department The Treasury Department in turn sends these requests to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to print new dollar bills and the Bureau of the Mint to stamp the coins br The Federal Reserve s monetary policy objectives to keep prices stable and unemployment low is often called the dual mandate This replaces past practices under a gold standard where the main concern is the gold equivalent of the local currency or under a gold exchange standard where the concern is fixing the exchange rate

br br br Ascendancy br The primary currency used for global trade between Europe Asia and the Americas has historically been the Spanish American silver dollar which created a global silver standard system from the th to th centuries due to abundant silver supplies in Spanish America br The U S dollar itself was derived from this coin The Spanish dollar was later displaced by the British pound sterling in the advent of the international gold standard in the last quarter of the th century br The U S dollar began to displace the pound sterling as international reserve currency from the s since it emerged from the First World War relatively unscathed and since the United States was a significant recipient of wartime gold inflows br After the U S emerged as an even stronger global

eurodollars not to be confused with the euro which are outside the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve System Private individuals also hold dollars outside the banking system mostly in the form of US bills of which of its supply is held overseas br The United States Department of the Treasury exercises considerable oversight over the SWIFT financial transfers network and consequently has a huge sway on the global financial transactions systems with the ability to impose sanctions on foreign entities and individuals br br br In the global markets br The U S dollar is predominantly the standard currency unit in which goods are quoted and traded and with which payments are settled in the global commodity markets The U S Dollar Index is an important indicator of the dollar s strength or weakness versus a basket of six foreign currencies br The United States Government is capable of borrowing trillions of dollars from the global capital markets in U S dollars issued by the Federal Reserve which is itself under U S government purview at minimal interest rates and with virtually zero default risk In contrast foreign governments and corporations incapable of raising money in their own local currencies are forced to issue debt denominated in U S dollars along with its consequent higher interest rates and risks of default The United States s ability to borrow in its own currency without facing a significant balance of payments crisis has been frequently described as its exorbitant privilege br A frequent topic of debate is whether the strong dollar policy of the United States

br Value br br The th paragraph of Section of Article of the U S Constitution provides that the U S Congress shall have the power to coin money and to regulate the value of domestic and foreign coins Congress exercised those powers when it enacted the Coinage Act of That Act provided for the minting of the first U S dollar and it declared that the U S dollar shall have the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current br The table above shows the equivalent amount of goods that in a particular year could be purchased with The table shows that from through the U S dollar has lost about of its buying power br The decline in the value of the U S dollar corresponds to price inflation which is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services in an economy over a period of time A consumer price index CPI is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services purchased by households The United States Consumer Price Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics is a measure estimating the average price of consumer goods and services in the United States It reflects inflation as experienced by consumers in their day to day living expenses A graph showing the U S CPI relative to and the annual year over year change in CPI is shown at right br The value of the U S dollar declined significantly during wartime especially during the American Civil War World War I and World War II The Federal Reserve which was established in was designed to furnish an elastic currency subject to substantial changes of quantity over short periods which differed significantly from previous forms of high powered money such as gold national banknotes and silver coins Over the very long run the prior gold standard kept prices stable for instance the price level and the value of the U S dollar in were not very different from the price level in the s The Federal Reserve initially succeeded in maintaining the value of the U S dollar and price stability reversing the inflation caused by the First World War and stabilizing the value of the dollar during the s before presiding over a deflation in U S prices in the s br Under the Bretton Woods system established after World War II the value of gold was fixed to per ounce and the value of the U S dollar was thus anchored to the value of gold Rising government spending in the s however led to doubts about the ability of the United States to maintain this convertibility gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold and as a result the value of the dollar began to decline Facing an emerging currency crisis and the imminent danger that the United States would no longer be able to redeem dollars for gold gold convertibility was finally terminated in by President Nixon resulting in the Nixon shock br The value of the U S dollar was therefore no longer anchored to gold and it fell upon the Federal Reserve to maintain the value of the U S currency The Federal Reserve however continued to increase the money supply resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the U S dollar in the s This was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked the Phillips curve and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign Between and the U S dollar lost two thirds of its value br In President Carter appointed Paul Volcker Chairman of the Federal Reserve The Federal Reserve tightened the money supply and inflation was substantially lower in the s and hence the value of the U S dollar stabilized br Over the thirty year period from to the U S dollar lost over half its value This is because the Federal Reserve has targeted not zero inflation but a low stable rate of inflation between and the rate of inflation was approximately and between and it was approximately The so called Great Moderation of economic conditions since the s is credited to monetary policy targeting price stability br There is an ongoing debate about whether central banks should target zero inflation which would mean a constant value for the U S dollar over time or low stable inflation which would mean a continuously but slowly declining value of the dollar over time as is the case now Although some economists are in favor of a zero inflation policy and therefore a constant value for the U S dollar others contend that such a policy limits the ability of the central bank to control interest rates and stimulate the economy when needed br br br Pegged currencies br
