A local area network LAN is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area such as a residence school laboratory university campus or office building By contrast a wide area network WAN not only covers a larger geographic distance but also generally involves leased telecommunication circuits br Ethernet and Wi Fi are the two most common technologies in use for local area networks Historical network technologies include ARCNET Token Ring and AppleTalk br br br History br The increasing demand and usage of computers in universities and research labs in the late s generated the need to provide high speed interconnections between computer systems A report from the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory detailing the growth of their Octopus network gave a good indication of the situation br A number of experimental and early commercial LAN technologies were developed in the s Ethernet was developed at Xerox PARC between and Cambridge Ring was developed at Cambridge University starting in ARCNET was developed by Datapoint Corporation in and announced in It had the first commercial installation in December at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York In the Electronic voting systems for the European Parliament was the first installation of a LAN connecting hundreds of microprocessor controlled voting terminals to a polling selecting central unit with a multidrop bus with Master slave technology arbitration br The development and proliferation of personal computers using the CP M operating system in the late s and later DOS based systems starting in meant that many sites grew to dozens or even hundreds of computers The initial driving force for networking was to share storage and printers both of which were expensive at the time There was much enthusiasm for the concept and for several years from about onward computer industry pundits habitually declared the coming year to be The year of the LAN br In practice the concept was marred by the proliferation of incompatible physical layer and network protocol implementations and a plethora of methods of sharing resources Typically each vendor would have its own type of network card cabling protocol and network operating system A solution appeared with the advent of Novell NetWare which provided even handed support for dozens of competing card and cable types and a much more sophisticated operating system than most of its competitors br Of the competitors to NetWare only Banyan Vines had comparable technical strengths but Banyan never gained a secure base Com produced Share and Microsoft produced MS Net These then formed the basis for collaboration between Microsoft and Com to create a simple network operating system LAN Manager and its cousin IBM s LAN Server None of these enjoyed any lasting success Netware dominated the personal computer LAN business from early after its introduction in until the mid s when Microsoft introduced Windows NT br In TCP IP was first shown capable of supporting actual defense department applications on a Defense Communication Agency LAN testbed located at Reston Virginia The TCP IP based LAN successfully supported Telnet FTP and a Defense Department teleconferencing application This demonstrated the feasibility of employing TCP IP LANs to interconnect Worldwide Military Command and Control System WWMCCS computers at command centers throughout the United States However WWMCCS was superseded by the Global Command and Control System GCCS before that could happen br During the same period Unix workstations were using TCP IP networking Although the workstation market segment is now much reduced the technologies developed in the area continue to be influential on the Internet and in all forms of networking and the TCP IP protocol has replaced IPX AppleTalk NBF and other protocols used by the early PC LANs br Econet was Acorn Computers s low cost local area network system intended for use by schools and small businesses It was first developed for the Acorn Atom and Acorn System computers in br In the s several token ring network implementations for LANs were developed IBM released their own implementation of token ring in It ran at Mbit s IBM claimed that their token ring systems were superior to Ethernet especially under load but these claims were debated IBM s implementation of token ring was the basis of the IEEE standard A Mbit s version of Token Ring was standardized by the working group in IBM had market dominance over Token Ring for example in IBM equipment was the most widely used for Token Ring networks br Fiber Distributed Data Interface FDDI a LAN standard was considered an attractive campus backbone network technology in the early to mid s since existing Ethernet networks only offered Mbit s data rates and Token Ring networks only offered Mbit s or Mbit s rates Thus it was a relatively high speed choice of that era with speeds such as Mbit s br By vendors included Cisco Systems National Semiconductor Network Peripherals SysKonnect acquired by Marvell Technology Group and Com FDDI installations have largely been replaced by Ethernet deployments br br br Cabling br br In the Electronic voting systems for the European Parliament was using kilometers of simple unshielded twisted pair category cable the same cable used for telephone systems installed inside the benches of the European Parliament Hemicycles in Strasbourg and Luxembourg br Early Ethernet BASE and BASE used coaxial cable Shielded twisted pair was used in IBM s Token Ring LAN implementation In StarLAN showed the potential of simple unshielded twisted pair by using category cable the same cable used for telephone systems This led to the development of BASE T and its twisted pair successors and structured cabling which is still the basis of most commercial LANs today br While optical fiber cable is common for links between network switches use of fiber to the desktop is rare br br br Wireless media br In a wireless LAN users have unrestricted movement within the coverage area Wireless networks have become popular in residences and small businesses because of their ease of installation Most wireless LANs use Wi Fi as wireless adapters are typically integrated into smartphones tablet computers and laptops Guests are often offered Internet access via a hotspot service br br br Technical aspects br Network topology describes the layout of interconnections between devices and network segments At the data link layer and physical layer a wide variety of LAN topologies have been used including ring bus mesh and star br Simple LANs generally consist of cabling and one or more switches A switch can be connected to a router cable modem or ADSL modem for Internet access A LAN can include a wide variety of other network devices such as firewalls load balancers and network intrusion detection Advanced LANs are characterized by their use of redundant links with switches using the spanning tree protocol to prevent loops their ability to manage differing traffic types via quality of service QoS and their ability to segregate traffic with VLANs br At the higher network layers protocols such as NetBIOS IPX SPX AppleTalk and others were once common but the Internet protocol suite TCP IP has prevailed as the standard of choice br LANs can maintain connections with other LANs via leased lines leased services or across the Internet using virtual private network technologies Depending on how the connections are established and secured and the distance involved such linked LANs may also be classified as a metropolitan area network MAN or a wide area network WAN br br br See also br Asynchronous Transfer Mode br Chaosnet br LAN messenger br LAN party br
