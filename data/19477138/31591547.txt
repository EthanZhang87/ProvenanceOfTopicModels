of the Following tab from the app which had allowed users to view a feed of the likes and comments made by users they follow The change was made official in October with head of product Vishal Shah

pop up requires the user to log in to continue viewing content br That month Instagram launched a separate app known as Threads Similar to Snapchat the app allowed users to communicate through messaging and video chats It was integrated with Instagram s Close friends feature so that users could send images photos and texts privately to others and also had Instagram s photo editing system embedded into the app However Instagram discontinued this version of Threads in December mainly due to most of its features being rolled out on Instagram itself as well as low usage compared to other social media applications Threads was not well received among Instagram s user base Since its launch only approximately users globally downloaded the app which represented less than of Instagram s monthly active users indicating a lack of success in driving adoption br br br present New features br In March Instagram launched a new feature called Co Watching The new feature allows users to share posts with each other over video calls According to Instagram they pushed forward the launch of Co Watching in order to meet the demand for virtually connecting with friends and family due to

ability to see recent posts from various hashtags This change became permanent and system wide a year later and now hashtags can only be used to see a selection of curated content from top users These changes are ostensibly an attempt to hinder the spread of misinformation while Instagram has also repeatedly stated that hashtags do not help posts get views br In April Instagram announced that they

app The feature was updated in April to let users organize saved posts into named collections Users can also archive their posts in a private storage area out of visibility for the public and other users The move was seen as a way to prevent users from deleting photos that don t garner a desired number of likes or are deemed boring but also as a way to limit the emergent behavior of deleting photos which deprives the service of content In August Instagram announced that it would start organizing comments into threads letting users more easily interact with replies br Since February up to ten pictures or videos can be included in a single post with the content appearing as a swipeable carousel The feature originally limited photos to the square format but received an update in August

photographs stand out and to attract like minded Instagram users br Users on Instagram have created trends through hashtags The trends deemed the most popular on the platform often highlight a specific day of the week to post the material on Examples of popular trends include SelfieSunday in which users post a photo of their faces on Sundays MotivationMonday in which users post motivational photos on Mondays TransformationTuesday in which users post photos highlighting differences from the past to the present WomanCrushWednesday in which users post photos of women they have a romantic interest in or view favorably as well as its ManCrushMonday counterpart centered on men and ThrowbackThursday in which users post a photo from their past highlighting a particular moment br In December Instagram began to allow users to follow hashtags which display relevant highlights of the topic in their feeds The ability to search Recent hashtags was temporarily disabled during the U S elections to prevent the spread of misinformation In this was again tested on some users and in April the ability to search recent hashtags was removed entirely Now users are only able to see a curated selection of popular posts using a given hashtag Instagram said that this is to prevent abuse and so that hashtags do not help users gain views but it has been noted that using hashtags is the only free method for a user to reach past their existing followers br br br Explore br In June Instagram introduced Explore a tab inside the app that displays popular photos photos taken at nearby locations and search The tab was updated in June to feature trending tags and places curated content and the ability to search for locations In April Instagram added a Videos You Might Like channel to

promote public Stories content from nearby places br br br Photographic filters br Instagram offers a number of photographic filters that users can apply to their images In February Instagram added a Lux filter an effect that lightens shadows darkens highlights and increases contrast In December Slumber Crema Ludwig Aden and Perpetua were five new filters added to the Instagram filter family br br br Video br Initially a purely photo sharing service Instagram incorporated second video sharing in June The addition was seen by some in the technology media as Facebook s attempt at competing with the then popular video sharing application Vine In August Instagram added support for widescreen videos In March Instagram increased the second video limit to one minute Albums were introduced in February which allow up to minutes of video to be shared in one post br br br IGTV br br IGTV was a vertical video application launched by Instagram in June Basic functionality is also available within the Instagram app and website IGTV allows uploads of up to minutes in length with a file size of up to MB with verified and popular users allowed to upload videos of up to one hour in length with a file size of up to GB The app automatically begins playing videos as soon as it is launched which CEO Kevin Systrom contrasted to video hosts where one must first locate a video In March the application was shut down br br br Reels br In November it was reported that Instagram had begun to pilot a new video feature known as Reels in Brazil expanding to France and Germany afterwards It is similar in functionality to the Chinese video sharing service TikTok with a focus on allowing users to record short videos set to pre existing sound clips from other posts Users could make up to later second videos using this feature Reels also integrates with existing Instagram filters and editing tools br In July Instagram rolled out Reels to India after TikTok was banned in the country The following month Reels officially launched in countries including the United States Canada and United Kingdom Instagram introduced a reels button on the home page br On June Instagram launched full screen advertisements in Reels The ads are similar to regular reels and can run up to seconds They are distinguished from regular content by the sponsored tag under the account name br Despite the TikTokification of Reels and the parent company Meta spending millions on courting content creators user engagement continued to lag far behind TikTok as of br br br Instagram Direct br In December Instagram announced Instagram Direct a feature that lets users interact through private messaging colloquially called DM OR DMs in some regions the messages may be known simply as direct directs Users who follow each other can send private messages with photos and videos in contrast to the public only requirement that was previously in place When users receive a private message from someone they don t follow the message is marked as pending and the user must accept to see it Users can send a photo to a maximum of people The feature received a major update in September adding conversation threading and making it possible for users to share locations hashtag pages and profiles through private messages directly from the news feed Additionally users can now reply to private messages with text emoji or by clicking on a heart icon A camera inside Direct lets users take a photo and send it to the recipient without leaving the conversation A new update in November let users make their private messages disappear after being viewed by the recipient with the sender receiving a notification if the recipient takes a screenshot br In April Instagram redesigned Direct to combine all private messages both permanent and ephemeral into the same message threads In May Instagram made it possible to send website links in messages and also added support for sending photos in their original portrait or landscape orientation without cropping br In April Direct became accessible from the Instagram website allowing users to send direct messages from a web version using WebSocket technology br In August Facebook started merging Instagram Direct into Facebook Messenger After the update which is rolled out to a segment of the user base the Instagram Direct icon transforms into Facebook Messenger icon br In March a feature was added that prevents adults from messaging users under who do not follow them as part of a series of new child safety policies br In August Instagram introduced new adjustments to protect user privacy and prevent harassment and spam Users can now only receive one direct message from accounts that they do not follow and must approve the message request before further messages can be sent This setting can be changed to allow unlimited messages from other accounts that the user does not follow br br br Instagram Stories br br In August Instagram launched Instagram Stories a feature that allows users to take photos add effects and layers and add them to their Instagram story Images uploaded to a user s story expire after hours The media noted the feature s similarities to Snapchat In response to criticism that it copied functionality from Snapchat CEO Kevin Systrom told Recode that Day One Instagram was a combination of Hipstamatic Twitter and some stuff from Facebook like the Like button You can trace the roots of every feature anyone has in their app somewhere in the history of technology Although Systrom acknowledged the criticism as fair Recode wrote that he likened the two social apps common features to the auto industry Multiple car companies can coexist with enough differences among them that they serve different consumer audiences Systrom further stated that When we adopted Stories we decided that one of the really annoying things about the format is that it just kept going and you couldn t pause it to look at something you couldn t rewind We did all that we implemented that He also told the publication that Snapchat didn t have filters originally They adopted filters because Instagram had filters and a lot of others were trying to adopt filters as well br In November Instagram added live video functionality to Instagram Stories allowing users to broadcast themselves live with the video disappearing immediately after ending br In January Instagram launched skippable ads where five second photo and second video ads appear in between different stories br In April Instagram Stories incorporated augmented reality stickers a clone of Snapchat s functionality br In May Instagram expanded the augmented reality sticker feature to support face filters letting users add specific visual features onto their faces br Later in May TechCrunch reported about tests of a Location Stories feature in Instagram Stories where public Stories content at a certain location are compiled and displayed on a business landmark or place s Instagram page A few days later Instagram announced Story Search in which users can search for geographic locations or hashtags and the app displays relevant public Stories content featuring the search term br In June Instagram revised its live video functionality to allow users to add their live broadcast to their story for availability in the next hours or discard the broadcast immediately In July Instagram started allowing users to respond to Stories content by sending photos and videos complete with Instagram effects such as filters stickers and hashtags br Stories were made available for viewing on Instagram s mobile and desktop websites in late August br On December Instagram introduced Story Highlights also known as Permanent Stories which are similar to Instagram Stories but don t expire They appear as circles below the profile picture and biography and are accessible from the desktop website as well br In June the daily active story users of Instagram had reached million users and monthly active users had reached billion active users br br br Verified badges on Instagram br Instagram introduced the verification feature known as the blue verified badge in December This feature allows users to verify their accounts to confirm their authenticity br Instagram began allowing users to request verification for their accounts in August This marked a significant shift from the previous system where verification was typically initiated by Instagram itself for accounts it deemed to be of public interest or high profile With the introduction of this feature eligible users could apply for verification directly through the Instagram app br The Instagram blue verified badge is a symbol displayed next to an account s name to signify that the account is authentic credible and belongs to a public figure celebrity brand or entity of significant public interest It helps users easily identify legitimate accounts amidst the vast number of profiles on the platform The badge appears as a blue checkmark located next to the account s username in search results profile pages and comments br Obtaining the blue verified badge typically requires meeting certain criteria set by Instagram such as being notable authentic unique complete and adhering to the platform s terms of service and community guidelines Instagram verifies accounts based on its own discretion and not all accounts meeting the criteria may be verified Users can apply for verification through Instagram s settings but the decision to grant verification ultimately rests with Instagram s team br Meta formerly Facebook launched paid verification on Instagram in This allowed eligible Instagram users to request verification for their accounts by paying a fee rather than relying solely on meeting the platform s traditional criteria for verification br br br Advertising br Emily White joined Instagram as Director of Business Operations in April She said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in September that the company should be ready to begin selling advertising by September as a way to generate business from a popular entity that had not yet created profit for its parent company White left Instagram in December to join Snapchat In August James Quarles became Instagram s Global Head of Business and Brand Development tasked with overseeing advertisement sales efforts and developing new monetization products according to a spokesperson br In October Instagram announced that video

to display multiple images with options for linking to additional content The company launched carousel image ads in October and video carousel ads in March br In February Instagram announced that it had advertisers on the platform This number increased to by September and million in March br In May Instagram launched new tools for business accounts including business profiles analytics and the ability to promote posts as ads To access the tools businesses had to link a corresponding Facebook page The new analytics page known as Instagram Insights allowed business accounts to view top posts reach impressions engagement and demographic data Insights rolled out first in the United States Australia and New Zealand and expanded to the rest of the world later in br In November Instagram added the ability for business accounts to add product links directing users to a purchase page or to save them to a shopping list In April Instagram added the option to Checkout on Instagram which allows merchants to sell products directly through the Instagram app br In March via a blog post Instagram announced that they are making major moderation changes in order to decrease the flow of disinformation hoaxes and fake news regarding COVID on its platform We ll remove COVID accounts from account recommendations and we are working to remove some COVID related content from Explore unless posted by a credible health organization We will also start to downrank content in feed and Stories that has been rated false by third party fact checkers br In June Instagram launched a native affiliate marketing tool creators can use to earn commissions based on sales Commission enabled posts are labeled Eligible for Commission on the user side to identify them as affiliate posts Launch partners included Sephora MAC and Kopari br br br Stand alone apps br Instagram has developed and released three stand alone apps with specialized functionality In July it released Bolt a messaging app where users click on a friend s profile photo to quickly send an image with the content disappearing after being seen It was followed by the release of Hyperlapse in August an iOS exclusive app that uses clever algorithm processing to create tracking shots and fast time lapse videos Microsoft launched a Hyperlapse app for Android and Windows in May but there has been no official Hyperlapse app from Instagram for either of these platforms to date In October it released Boomerang a video app that combines photos into short one second videos that play back and forth in a loop br br br Third party services br The popularity of Instagram has led to a variety of third party services designed to integrate with it including services for creating content to post on the service and generating content from Instagram photos including physical print outs analytics and alternative clients for platforms with insufficient or no official support from Instagram such as in the past iPads br In November Instagram announced that effective June it would end feed API access to its platform in order to maintain control for the community and provide a clear roadmap for developers and set up a more sustainable environment built around authentic experiences on the platform including those oriented towards content creation publishers and advertisers Additionally third party clients have been prohibited from using the text strings insta or gram in their name It was reported that these changes were primarily intended to discourage third party clients replicating the entire Instagram experience due to increasing monetization of the service and security reasons such as preventing abuse by automated click farms and the hijacking of accounts In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal Instagram began to impose further restrictions on its API in br Third party services can be used for unlimited browsing of public Instagram profiles without having to create an account as well as for anonymous browsing of someone else s Stories Stories are more authentic than typical photos posted as posts because users know that in hours their Stories will disappear if they don t add them as highlighted however users can check who saw their Story for hours after it was published For this reason they are very valuable for market research br br br Fact checking br On December Facebook announced it would expand its fact checking programs towards Instagram by using third party fact checkers organizations false information is able to be identified reviewed and labeled as false information Content when rated as false or partly false is removed from the explore page and hashtag pages additionally content rated as false or partly false are labeled as such With the addition of Facebook fact checking program came the use of image matching technology to find further instances of misinformation If a piece of content is labeled false or partly false on Facebook or Instagram then duplicates of such content will also be labeled as false br br br Algorithm and design changes br In April Instagram began rolling out a change to the order of photos visible in a user s timeline shifting from a strictly chronological order to one determined by an algorithm Instagram said the algorithm was designed so that users would see more of the photos by users that they liked but there was significant negative feedback with many users asking their followers to turn on post notifications in order to make sure they see updates The company wrote a tweet to users upset at the prospect of the change but did not back down nor provide a way to change it back which they reaffirmed in However in December Adam Mosseri in a Senate hearing on child safety issues stated that the company is developing a version of the feed that would show user posts in chronological order He later clarified the company would introduce two modes a classic chronological feed and a version of it that would let users pick favorite users whose posts would be shown at the top in chronological order while other posts would be mixed in below br Since Instagram has employed the ability to reduce the prominence of accounts shadowbanning it believes may be generating non genuine engagement and spam including excessive use of unneeded hashtags preventing posts from appearing in search results and in the app s Explore section In a now deleted Facebook post Instagram wrote that When developing content we recommend focusing on your business objective or goal rather than hashtags Instagram has since been accused of extending the practice to censor posts under vague and inconsistent circumstances particularly in regards to sexually suggestive material br Instagram caused the userbase to fall into outrage with the December update They found an attempt to alter the flow of the feed from the traditional vertical scroll to emulate and piggy back the popularity of their Instagram Stories with a horizontal scroll by swiping left Various backtracking statements were released explaining it as a bug or as a test release that had been accidentally deployed to too large an audience br In November Instagram replaced the activity feed tab with a new Shop tab moving the activity feed to the top The new post button was also relocated to the top and replaced with a Reels tab The company states that the Shop tab gives you a better way to connect with brands and creators and discover products you love and the Reels tab makes it easier for you to discover short fun videos from creators all over the world and people just like you However users have not responded well to the change taking their complaints to Twitter and Reddit and The New York Times has shunned Reels in particular saying Not only does Reels fail in every way as a TikTok clone but it s confusing frustrating and impossible to navigate br Also in Instagram rolled out a feature titled suggested posts which adds posts from accounts Instagram thinks a user would like to such user s feed The feature was met with controversy from The Verge which reported that suggested posts would keep users glued to their feed give Instagram more advertising space and ultimately harm the mental health of users while Instagram executive Julian Gutman rebutted stating the feature was not intended to keep users glued to their screens Suggested posts received more controversy after Fast Company stated that the feature would be impossible to turn off br On June Instagram announced a test change to the suggested posts feature The company will put suggested posts ahead of posts from people who the user is following in the Instagram feed citing positive reception as the reason for this change br br br Mental health br br br Internal data from Meta br In The Wall Street Journal obtained and published internal research Meta had conducted over several years The internal Facebook presentations seen by the Journal in show that Instagram can worsen poor body self image of young people with teenage girls particularly vulnurable The presentations were seen by the company s executives and the findings mentioned to Mark Zuckerberg in Facebook did not mention the data when asked by U S senators for its internal findings on the impact of Instagram on youth mental health The company told Forbes that its research is kept confidential to promote frank and open dialogue and brainstorming internally In a blog post Instagram said that the WSJ story focuses on a limited set of findings and casts them in a negative light On September weeks after the WSJ report was released Facebook announced that it had paused development of Instagram Kids a product aimed at children The company stated it was looking into concerns raised by the regulators and parents Based on Facebook s leaked internal research Instagram has had negative effects on the body image of one in three teenagers Leaked internal documents also indicate that two thirds of teen girls and percent of teen boys experience negative social comparison and that Instagram makes percent of the teens feel worse about themselves According to the leaked research Instagram has higher impact on appearance comparison than TikTok or Snapchat percent of British and percent of US teenager users with suicidal thoughts could trace them to Instagram use br br br Depression anxiety and stress br Khodarahimi and Fathi found evidence that Instagram users displayed higher levels of depressive and anxious symptoms compared to non users However Frison Eggermont found that among both boys and girls browsing could predict the presence of depressive symptoms liking and posting seemed to have no effect In addition their study showed that the presence of depressive symptoms in a given user could positively predict that they would make posts The study showed that the viewing of celebrity and peer pictures could make the moods of women more negative In a study Mun Kim pointed out that Instagram users with a strong need for approval were more likely to falsely present themselves on their Instagram accounts which in turn increased the likelihood of depression However depression was mitigated by the users perception of their own popularity br Lub Trub showed that following more strangers increases social comparisons and depressive symptoms Multiple studies have found that increasing time spent on Instagram increases social anxiety and anxiety related to personal traits physical appearance and high stress body areas in particular Sherlock Wagstaff showed that both the number of followers and followees can slightly increase anxiety over personal traits Additionally Moujaes Verrier observed a connection between online engagement with mothering based influencers known as InstaMums and anxiety However Mackson et al suggested beneficial effects of Instagram use on anxiety symptoms br br br Body image br Instagram users report higher body surveillance the habitual monitoring of one s body shape and size appearance related pressure eating disorder related pathology and lower body satisfaction than non users Multiple studies have also shown that users who take more selfies before making a post and those who strategically present themselves by participating in such activities as editing or manipulating selfies report higher levels of body surveillance and body dissatisfaction and lower body esteem overall Tiggermann et al showed that facial satisfaction can decrease when one spends greater time editing selfies for Instagram Comments related to appearance on Instagram can lead to higher dissatisfaction with one s body br br br Loneliness and social exclusion br Mackson et al found that Instagram users were less lonely than non users and that Instagram membership predicts lower self reported loneliness A study by B ttner Rudertb also showed that not being tagged in an Instagram photo triggers the feeling of social exclusion and ostracism especially for those with higher needs to belong However Brailovskaia Margraf found a significant positive relationship between Instagram membership and extraversion life satisfaction and social support Their study showed only a marginally significant negative association between Instagram membership and self conscientiousness Fioravanti et al showed that women who had to take a break from Instagram for seven days reported higher life satisfaction compared to women who continued their habitual pattern of Instagram use The effects seemed to be specific for women where no significant differences were observed for men The relationship between Instagram use and the fear of missing out or FOMO has been confirmed in multiple studies Research shows that Instagram browsing predicts social comparison which generates FOMO which can ultimately lead to depression br br br Alcohol and drug use br There is a small positive correlation between the intensity of one s Instagram usage and alcohol consumption with binge drinkers reporting greater intensity of Instagram use than non binge drinkers Boyle et al found a small to moderate positive relationship between alcohol consumption enhanced drinking motives and drinking behavior during college and Instagram usage br br br Eating disorders br A comparison of Instagram users with non users showed that boys with an Instagram account differ from boys without an account in terms of over evaluation of their shape and weight skipping meals and levels of reported disordered eating cognitions Girls with an Instagram account only differed from girls without an account in terms of skipping meals they also had a stricter exercise schedule a pattern not found in boys This suggests a possible negative effect of Instagram usage on body satisfaction and disordered eating for both boys and girls Several studies identified a small positive relationship between time spent on Instagram and both internalization of beauty or muscular ideals and self objectification Both Appel et al and Feltman et al found a positive link between the intensity of Instagram use and both body surveillance and dietary behaviors or disordered eating br br br Suicide and self harm br Picardo et al examined the relationship between self harm posts and actual self harm behaviours offline and found such content had negative emotional effects on some users The study also reported preliminary evidence of the online posts affecting offline behavior but stopped short of claiming causality At the same time some benefits for those who engage with self harm content online have been suggested Instagram has published resources to help users in need of support br br br Sharenting risks br br Sharenting is when parents post content online including images about their children Instagram is one of the most popular social media channels for sharenting The hashtag letthembelittle contains over million images related to children on Instagram Bare analysed randomly selected publicly available images under the hashtag and found that the corresponding images tended to contain children s personal information including
