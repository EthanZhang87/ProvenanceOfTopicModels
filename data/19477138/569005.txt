conversation view similar to an Internet forum The service is notable among website developers for its early adoption of Ajax br Google s mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes including to filter spam and malware and prior to June to add context sensitive advertisements next to emails This advertising practice has been significantly criticized by privacy advocates with concerns over unlimited data retention ease of monitoring by third parties users of other email providers not having agreed to the policy upon sending emails to Gmail addresses and the potential for Google to change its policies to further decrease privacy by combining information with other Google data usage The company has been the subject of lawsuits concerning the issues Google has stated that email users must necessarily expect their emails to be subject to automated processing and claims that the service refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages such as those mentioning race religion sexual orientation health or financial statements In June Google announced the end of the use of contextual Gmail content for advertising purposes relying instead on data gathered from the use of its other services br br br Features br br br Storage br br On April Gmail was launched with one gigabyte GB of storage space a significantly higher amount than

from other web mail systems with its focus on search and conversation threading of emails grouping several messages between two or more people onto a single page an approach that was later copied by its competitors Gmail s user interface designer Kevin Fox intended users to feel as if they were always on one page and just changing things on that page rather than having to navigate to other places

Google creates a database of child pornography pictures Each one of the images is given a unique numerical number known as a hash Google then scans Gmail looking for the unique hashes When suspicious images are located Google reports the incident to the appropriate national authorities br br br History br br The idea for Gmail was developed by Paul Buchheit several years before it was announced to the public The project was known by the code name Caribou During early development the project was kept secret from most of Google s own engineers This changed once the project improved and by early most employees were using it to access the company s internal email system br Gmail was announced to the public by Google on April as a limited beta release br In November Google began offering a Java

December users had to approve to see images in emails which acted as a security measure This changed in December when Google citing improved image handling enabled images to be visible without user approval Images are now routed through Google s secure proxy servers rather than the original external host servers MarketingLand noted that the change to image handling means email marketers will no longer be able to track the recipient s IP address or information about what kind of device the recipient is using However Wired stated that the new change means senders can track the time when an email is first opened as the initial loading of the images requires the system to make a callback to the original server br br br Growth br In June Google announced that Gmail had million active users

sensitive information such as race religion sexual orientation health or sensitive financial categories br br br Automated scanning of email content br Google s mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes including filtering spam and malware and until adding context sensitive advertisements next to emails br Privacy advocates raised concerns about this practice concerns included that allowing email content to be read by a machine as opposed to a person can allow Google to keep unlimited amounts of information forever the automated background scanning of data raises the risk that the expectation of privacy in email usage will be reduced or eroded information collected from emails could be retained by Google for years after its current relevancy to build complete profiles on users emails sent by users from other email providers get scanned despite never having agreed to Google s privacy policy or terms of service Google can change its privacy policy unilaterally and for minor changes to the policy it can do so without informing users in court cases governments and organizations can potentially find it easier to legally monitor email communications at any time Google can change its current company policies to allow combining information from emails with data gathered from use of its other services and any internal security problem on Google s systems can potentially expose many or all of its users br In thirty one privacy and civil liberties organizations wrote a letter calling upon Google to suspend its Gmail service until the privacy issues were adequately addressed The letter also called upon Google to clarify its written information policies regarding data retention and data sharing among its business units The organizations also voiced their concerns about Google s plan to scan the text of all incoming messages for the purposes of ad placement noting that the scanning of confidential email for inserting third party ad content violates the implicit trust of an email service provider br On June Google announced that later in it would phase out the scanning of email content to generate contextual advertising relying on personal data collected through other Google services instead The company stated that this change was meant to clarify its practices and quell concerns among enterprise G Suite now Google Workspace customers who felt an ambiguous distinction between the free consumer and paid professional variants the latter being advertising free br br br Lawsuits br In March a former Gmail user in Texas sued Google claiming that its Gmail service violates users privacy by scanning e mail messages to serve relevant ads br In July some California residents filed two class action lawsuits against Google and Yahoo claiming that they illegally intercept emails sent by individual non Gmail or non Yahoo email users to Gmail and Yahoo recipients without the senders knowledge consent or permission A motion filed by Google s attorneys in the case concedes that Gmail users have no expectation of privacy br br A court filing uncovered by advocacy group Consumer Watchdog in August revealed that Google stated in a court filing that no reasonable expectation exists among Gmail users in regard to the assured confidentiality of their emails In response to a lawsuit filed in May Google explained all users of email must necessarily expect that their emails will be subject to automated processing Just as a sender of a letter to a business colleague cannot be surprised that the recipient s assistant opens the letter people who use web based email today cannot be surprised if their communications are processed by the recipient s ECS electronic communications service provider in the course of delivery A Google spokesperson stated to the media on August that the corporation takes the privacy and security concerns of Gmail users very seriously br br br April Terms of service update br Google updated its terms of service for Gmail in April to create full transparency for its users in regard to the scanning of email content The relevant revision states Our automated systems analyse your content including emails to provide you personally relevant product features such as customised search results tailored advertising and spam and malware detection This analysis occurs as the content is sent received and when it is stored A Google spokesperson explained that the corporation wishes for its policies to be simple and easy for users to understand br In response to the update Jim Killock executive director of the Open Rights Group stated The really dangerous things that Google is doing are things like the information held in Analytics cookies in advertising and the profiling that it is able to do on individual accounts br br br Microsoft ad campaign against Google br In Microsoft launched an advertising campaign to attack Google for scanning email messages arguing that most consumers are not aware that Google monitors their personal messages to deliver targeted ads Microsoft claims that its email service Outlook does not scan the contents of messages and a Microsoft spokesperson called the issue of privacy Google s kryptonite In response Google stated We work hard to make sure that ads are safe unobtrusive and relevant No humans read your e mail or Google Account information in order to show you advertisements or related information An automated algorithm similar to that used for features like Priority Inbox or spam filtering determines which ads are shown The New York Times cites Google supporters who say that Microsoft s ads are distasteful the last resort of a company that has been unsuccessful at competing against Google on the more noble battleground of products br br br Other privacy issues br br br attack from China br In January Google detected a highly sophisticated cyberattack on its infrastructure that originated from China The targets of the attack were Chinese human rights activists but Google discovered that accounts belonging to European American and Chinese activists for human rights in China had been routinely accessed by third parties Additionally Google stated that their investigation revealed that at least other large companies from a wide range of businesses including the Internet finance technology media and chemical sectors had been similarly targeted Google was in the process of notifying those companies and it had also worked with relevant US authorities In light of the attacks Google enhanced the security and architecture of its infrastructure and advised individual users to install anti virus and anti spyware on their computers update their operating systems and web browsers and be cautious when clicking on Internet links or when sharing personal information in instant messages and emails br br br Social network integration br The February launch of Google Buzz a former social network that was linked to Gmail immediately drew criticism for publicly sharing details of users contacts unless the default settings were changed A new Gmail feature was launched in January whereby users can email people with Google accounts even though they do not know the email address of the recipient Marc Rotenberg President of the Electronic Privacy Information Center called the feature troubling and compared it to the Google Buzz initial launch privacy flaw br br br Update to DoubleClick privacy policy br In June Julia Angwin of ProPublica wrote about Google s updated privacy policy which deleted a clause that had stated Google would not combine DoubleClick web browsing cookie information with personally identifiable information from its other services This change has allowed Google to merge users personally identifiable information from different Google services to create one unified ad profile for each user After publication of the article Google reached out to ProPublica to say that the merge would not include Gmail keywords in ad targeting br br br Outages br Gmail suffered at least seven outages in causing doubts about the reliability of its service It suffered a new outage on February in which a bug caused Gmail accounts to seem empty Google stated in a blog post that email was never lost and restoration was in progress Other outages occurred on April September January January and August br Google has stated that Gmail remains more than available to all users and we re committed to keeping events like the outage notable for their rarity br br br On behalf of tag br In May Farhad Manjoo wrote on The New York Times blog about Gmail s on behalf of tag Manjoo explained The problems sic is when you try to send outbound mail from your Gmail universal inbox Gmail adds a tag telling your recipients that you re actually using Gmail and not your office e mail If your recipient is using Microsoft Outlook he ll see a message like From youroffice domain com on behalf of yourgmail gmail com Manjoo further wrote that Google explains that it adds the tag in order to prevent your e mail from being considered spam by your recipient the theory is that if the e mail is honest about its origins it shouldn t arouse suspicion by spam checking software The following July Google announced a new option that would remove the On behalf of tag by sending the email from the server of the other email address instead of using Gmail s servers br br br See also br br Comparison of mail servers br Comparison of webmail providers br List of Google products br br br br br br
