id: 507285
A layoff or downsizing is the temporary suspension or permanent termination of employment of an employee or more commonly a group of employees collective layoff for business reasons such as personnel management or downsizing reducing the size of an organization Originally layoff referred exclusively to a temporary interruption in work or employment but this has evolved to a permanent elimination of a position in both British and US English requiring the addition of temporary to specify the original meaning of the word A layoff is not to be confused with wrongful termination br Laid off workers or displaced workers are workers who have lost or left their jobs because their employer has closed or moved there was insufficient work for them to do or their position or shift was abolished Borbely Downsizing in a company is defined to involve the reduction of employees in a workforce Downsizing in companies became a popular practice in the s and early s as it was seen as a way to deliver better shareholder value as it helps to reduce the costs of employers downsizing Research on downsizing in the US UK and Japan suggests that downsizing is being regarded by management as one of the preferred routes to help declining organizations cutting unnecessary costs and improve organizational performance Usually a layoff occurs as a cost cutting measure A study of downsizing announcements of the S P firms for the period found that layoff announcements resulted in substantial increase in the companies stock prices and that the gain was larger when the company had prior layoffs The authors suggested that the stock price manipulation alone creates a sufficient motivation for publicly traded corporations to adopt the practice of regular layoffs br br br Terminology br Euphemisms are often used to soften the blow in the process of firing and being fired The term layoff originally meant a temporary interruption in work and usually pay The term became a euphemism for permanent termination of employment and now usually means that requiring the addition of temporary to refer to the original meaning Many other euphemisms have been coined for permanent layoff including downsizing excess reduction rightsizing leveraging synergies delayering smartsizing redeployment workforce reduction workforce optimization simplification force shaping recussion manage out people resource action and reduction in force also called RIF especially in the government employment sector Mass layoff is defined by the United States Department of Labor as or more workers laid off from the same company around the same time Attrition implies that positions will be eliminated as workers quit or retire Early retirement means workers may quit now yet still remain eligible for their retirement benefits later br Redundancy is a specific legal term in UK labour law with a definition in section of the Employment Rights Act see Redundancy in United Kingdom law br When an employer is faced with work of a particular type ceasing or diminishing at a particular location it may be perceived as obfuscation Firings imply misconduct or failure while layoffs imply economic forces beyond the employer s and employees control especially in the face of a recession br br br Common abbreviations for reduction in force br RIF A generic reduction in force of undetermined method Often pronounced like the word riff rather than spelled out Sometimes used as a verb as in the employees were pretty heavily riffed br eRIF Layoff notice by email br IRIF Involuntary reduction in force The employee s did not voluntarily choose to leave the company This usually implies that the method of reduction involved either layoffs firings or both but would not usually imply resignations or retirements If the employee is fired rather than laid off the term with cause may be appended to indicate that the separation was due to this employee s performance and or behavior rather than being financially motivated br VRIF Voluntary reduction in force The employee s did play a role in choosing to leave the company most likely through resignation or retirement In some instances a company may exert pressure on an employee to make this choice perhaps by implying that a layoff or termination would otherwise be imminent or by offering an attractive severance or early retirement package Conversely the company is not obliged to accept an employee s decision and may not accept every employee who volunteers for a VRIF br WFR Work force reduction br br br In the public sector br Following the recession of the public sector has seen significantly smaller job growth in employment versus the private sector and layoffs have been used to ensure sustainability As the public sector declines the demand for services from the private sector declines as well Layoffs in the public sector have put limitations on the growth rate of the private sector inevitably burdening the entire flow of markets br br br Unemployment compensation br Risks of being laid off vary depending on the workplace and country a person is working in Unemployment compensation in any country or workplace typically has two main factors The first factor of unemployment compensation depends on the distribution of unemployment benefits in a workplace outlined in an employee handbook The second factor is the risk of inequality being conditioned upon the political regime type in the country an employee is working in The amount of compensation will usually depend on what level the employee holds in the company br Packages may also vary if the employee is laid off or voluntarily quits in the face of a layoff VRIF The method of separation may have an effect on a former employee s ability to collect whatever form of unemployment compensation might be available in their jurisdiction In many U S states workers who are laid off can file an unemployment claim and receive compensation Depending on local or state laws workers who leave voluntarily are generally ineligible to collect unemployment benefits as are those who are fired for gross misconduct Also lay offs due to a firm s moving production overseas may entitle one to increased re training benefits Some companies in the United States utilize Supplemental Unemployment Benefits Since they were first introduced by organized labor and the Department of Labor in the early s and first issued in a Revenue Ruling by the IRS in SUB Pay Plans have enabled employers to supplement the receipt of state unemployment insurance benefits for employees that experience an involuntary layoff By establishing severance payments as SUB Pay benefits the payments are not considered wages for FICA FUTA and SUI tax purposes and employee FICA tax To qualify for SUB Pay benefits the participant must be eligible for state unemployment insurance benefits and the separation benefit must be paid on a periodic basis There have also been increasing concerns about the organizational effectiveness of the post downsized anorexic organization The benefits which organizations claim to be seeking from downsizing center on savings in labor costs speedier decision making better communication reduced product development time enhanced involvement of employees and greater responsiveness to customers De Meuse et al p However some writers draw attention to the obsessive pursuit of downsizing to the point of self starvation marked by excessive cost cutting organ failure and extreme pathological fear of becoming inefficient Hence trimming and tightening belts are the order of the day br br br Effects br Traditionally layoffs directly affect the employee However the employee terminated is not alone in this Layoffs affect the workplace environment and the economy as well as the employee Layoffs have a widespread effect and the three main components of layoff effects are in the workplace to the employee and effects to the economy One framework to examine the effects on the macro level is PSB which examines the stakeholders perspective in global downsizing This framework examines the global perspective of positive and negative stakeholders behavior during downsizing br br br Effects of layoffs in the workplace br Layoffs have remained the greatest way for a company to cut costs Although from the employer s perspective a layoff is beneficial for the business layoffs create an uncertainty in the workplace environment and lowers other employees job security as well as creates an apprehension and fear of termination for the remaining employees and subsequently lowers overall motivation in the workplace environment According to Healing the Wounds Overcoming the Trauma of Layoffs and Revitalizing Downsized Organizations in the post layoff environment there is a need for empathy tangibility self knowledge and relentlessly seeking customers among the surviving employees The remaining employees may have feelings of survivors guilt In order to diminish negative effects of layoffs Wayne Cascio suggests alternative approaches to layoff and downsizing as Responsible restructuring approach Optimism is critical for rebuilding the workplace environment because employees look to their leaders for stability and predictability No matter the position in an organization employees will look for job security br br br Effects of layoffs to the employee br Employees or former employees in this case can be affected in a couple of different ways When an employee is laid off his or her general trust in long term work may decrease reducing expectations upon rehire After an employee withstands a layoff the effects can trickle into future employment and attitudes Layoffs in the workplace often leave the former employee less inclined to trust future employers which can lead to behavioral conflicts among co workers and management Despite new employers not being responsible for a prior circumstances job performance may still be affected by prior layoffs Many companies work to make layoffs as minimally burdensome to the employee At times employers may layoff multiple people at once to soften the impact br br Denial stage is the first stage in the emotional reaction to change or layoffs in which an employee denies that an organization change or layoff will occur br Anger stage is the second stage of the emotional reaction to downsizing in which an employee becomes angry at the organization br Fear stage is the third emotional stage following an announcement of layoff in which employees worry about how they will survive financially br Acceptance stage is the fourth and final stage of the emotional reaction to downsizing in which employees accept that layoffs will occur and are ready to take steps to secure their future br br br Effects of layoffs in the American economy br Layoffs create lower job security overall and an increased competitiveness for available and opening positions Layoffs have generally two major effects on the economy and stockholders The way layoffs affect the economy varies from the industry that is doing the layoffs and the size of the layoff If an industry that employs a majority of a region freight in the northeast for example suffers and has to lay employees off there will be mass unemployment in an economically rich area This can have leave ripple effects nationwide Unemployment is the biggest effect on the economy that can come from layoffs br br br Around the world br In francophone Belgium the term Proc dure Renault has become a synonym for the consultation process leading to mass redundancies due to a controversial mass layoff and resultant legislation in the late s br When an employee has been laid off in Australia their employer has to give them redundancy pay which is also known as severance pay The only time that a redundancy payment doesn t have to be paid is if an employee is casual working for a small business or has worked for a business for less than twelve months The redundancy compensation payment for employees depends on the length of time an employee has worked for an employer which excludes unpaid leave If an employer can t afford the redundancy payment they are supposed to give their employee once making them redundant or they find their employee another job that is suitable for the employee An employer is able to apply for a reduction in the amount of money they have to pay the employee they have made redundant An employer can do this by applying to the Fair Work Commission for a redundancy payment reduction br A layoff is also known as a retrenchment in South African English In the UK permanent termination due to elimination of a position is usually called redundancy Certain countries such as Belgium Netherlands Portugal Spain Italy France and Germany distinguish between leaving the company of one s own free will in which case the person is not entitled to unemployment benefits but may receive a onetime payment and leaving a company as part of a reduction in labour force size in which case the person is entitled to them A RIF reduces the number of positions rather than laying off specific people and is usually accompanied by internal redeployment br br br Mass layoff br Department of Labor Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act WARN
