id: 65533
A business model describes how an organization creates delivers and captures value in economic social cultural or other contexts For a business it describes the specific way in which it conducts itself spends and earns money in a way that generates profit The process of business model construction and modification is also called business model innovation and forms a part of business strategy br In theory and practice the term business model is used for a broad range of informal and formal descriptions to represent core aspects of an organization or business including purpose business process target customers offerings strategies infrastructure organizational structures profit structures sourcing trading practices and operational processes and policies including culture br br The literature has provided very diverse interpretations and definitions of a business model A systematic review and analysis of manager responses to a survey defines business models as the design of organizational structures to enact a commercial opportunity Further extensions to this design logic emphasize the use of narrative or coherence in business model descriptions as mechanisms by which entrepreneurs create extraordinarily successful growth firms br br Business models are used to describe and classify businesses especially in an entrepreneurial setting but they are also used by managers inside companies to explore possibilities for future development Well known business models can operate as recipes for creative managers Business models are also referred to in some instances within the context of accounting for purposes of public reporting br br Over the years business models have become much more sophisticated The bait and hook business model also referred to as the razor and blades business model or the tied products business model was introduced in the early th century This involves offering a basic product at a very low cost often at a loss the bait then charging compensatory recurring amounts for refills or associated products or services the hook Examples include razor bait and blades hook cell phones bait and air time hook computer printers bait and ink cartridge refills hook and cameras bait and prints hook A variant of this model was employed by Adobe a software developer that gave away its document reader free of charge but charged several hundred dollars for its document writer br In the s new business models came from McDonald s Restaurants and Toyota In the s the innovators were Wal Mart and Hypermarkets The s saw new business models from FedEx and Toys R Us the s from Blockbuster Home Depot Intel and Dell Computer the s from Southwest Airlines Netflix eBay Amazon com and Starbucks br Today the type of business models might depend on how technology is used For example entrepreneurs on the internet have also created new models that depend entirely on existing or emergent technology Using technology businesses can reach a large number of customers with minimal costs In addition the rise of outsourcing and globalization has meant that business models must also account for strategic sourcing complex supply chains and moves to collaborative relational contracting structures br br Design logic views the business model as an outcome of creating new organizational structures or changing existing structures to pursue a new opportunity Gerry George and Adam Bock conducted a comprehensive literature review and surveyed managers to understand how they perceived the components of a business model In that analysis these authors show that there is a design logic behind how entrepreneurs and managers perceive and explain their business model In further extensions to the design logic George and Bock use case studies and the IBM survey data on business models in large companies to describe how CEOs and entrepreneurs create narratives or stories in a coherent manner to move the business from one opportunity to another They also show that when the narrative is incoherent or the components of the story are misaligned that these businesses tend to fail They recommend ways in which the entrepreneur or CEO can create strong narratives for change br br Berglund and Sandstr m argued that business models should be understood from an open systems perspective as opposed to being a firm internal concern Since innovating firms do not have executive control over their surrounding network business model innovation tends to require soft power tactics with the goal of aligning heterogeneous interests In a study of collaborative research and external sourcing of technology Hummel et al similarly found that in deciding on business partners it is important to make sure that both parties business models are complementary For example they found that it was important to identify the value drivers of potential partners by analyzing their business models and that it is beneficial to find partner firms that understand key aspects of one s own firm s business model br The University of Tennessee conducted research into highly collaborative business relationships Researchers codified their research into a sourcing business model known as Vested Outsourcing a hybrid sourcing business model in which buyers and suppliers in an outsourcing or business relationship focus on shared values and goals to create an arrangement that is highly collaborative and mutually beneficial to each br br From about some research and experimentation has theorized about a so called liquid business model br br Sangeet Paul Choudary distinguishes between two broad families of business models in an article in Wired magazine Choudary contrasts pipes linear business models with platforms networked business models In the case of pipes firms create goods and services push them out and sell them to customers Value is produced upstream and consumed downstream There is a linear flow much like water flowing through a pipe Unlike pipes platforms do not just create and push stuff out They allow users to create and consume value br Alex Moazed founder and CEO of Applico defines a platform as a business model that creates value by facilitating exchanges between two or more interdependent groups usually consumers and producers of a given value As a result of digital transformation it is the predominant business model of the st century br In an op ed on MarketWatch Choudary Van Alstyne and Parker further explain how business models are moving from pipes to platforms leading to disruption of entire industries br br There are three elements to a successful platform business model The toolbox creates connection by making it easy for others to plug into the platform This infrastructure enables interactions between participants The magnet creates pull that attracts participants to the platform For transaction platforms both producers and consumers must be present to achieve critical mass The matchmaker fosters the flow of value by making connections between producers and consumers Data is at the heart of successful matchmaking and distinguishes platforms from other business models br Chen stated that the business model has to take into account the capabilities of Web such as collective intelligence network effects user generated content and the possibility of self improving systems He suggested that the service industry such as the airline traffic transportation hotel restaurant information and communications technology and online gaming industries will be able to benefit in adopting business models that take into account the characteristics of Web He also emphasized that Business Model has to take into account not just the technology effect of Web but also the networking effect He gave the example of the success story of Amazon in making huge revenues each year by developing an open platform that supports a community of companies that re use Amazon s on demand commerce services br br Jose van Dijck identifies three main ways that media platforms choose to monetize which mark a change from traditional business models One is the subscription model in which platforms charge users a small monthly fee in exchange for services She notes that the model was ill suited for those accustomed to free content and services leading to a variant the freemium model A second method is via advertising Arguing that traditional advertising is no longer appealing to people used to user generated content and social networking she states that companies now turn to strategies of customization and personalization in targeted advertising Eric K Clemons asserts that consumers no longer trust most commercial messages Van Dijck argues platforms are able to circumvent the issue through personal recommendations from friends or influencers on social media platforms which can serve as a more subtle form of advertisement Finally a third common business model is monetization of data and metadata generated from the use of platforms br br Malone et al found that some business models as defined by them indeed performed better than others in a dataset consisting of the largest U S firms in the period through while they did not prove whether the existence of a business model mattered br In the healthcare space and in particular in companies that leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence the design of business models is particularly challenging as there are a multitude of value creation mechanisms and a multitude of possible stakeholders An emerging categorization has identified seven archetypes br The concept of a business model has been incorporated into certain accounting standards For example the International Accounting Standards Board IASB utilizes an entity s business model for managing the financial assets as a criterion for determining whether such assets should be measured at amortized cost or at fair value in its International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS In their proposal for accounting for financial instruments the Financial Accounting Standards Board also proposed a similar use of business model for classifying financial instruments The concept of business model has also been introduced into the accounting of deferred taxes under International Financial Reporting Standards with amendments to IAS addressing deferred taxes related to investment property br Both IASB and FASB have proposed using the concept of business model in the context of reporting a lessor s lease income and lease expense within their joint project on accounting for leases In its lease accounting model IFRS the IASB chose not to include a criterion of stand alone utility in its lease definition because entities might reach different conclusions for contracts that contain the same rights of use depending on differences between customers resources or suppliers business models The concept has also been proposed as an approach for determining the measurement and classification when accounting for insurance contracts As a result of the increasing prominence the concept of business model has received in the context of financial reporting the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group EFRAG which advises the European Union on endorsement of financial reporting standards commenced a project on the Role of the Business Model in Financial Reporting in br br Business model design generally refers to the activity of designing a company s business model It is part of the business development and business strategy process and involves design methods Massa and Tucci highlighted the difference between crafting a new business model when none is in place as it is often the case with academic spinoffs and high technology entrepreneurship and changing an existing business model such as when the tooling company Hilti shifted from selling its tools to a leasing model They suggested that the differences are so profound for example lack of resource in the former case and inertia and conflicts with existing configurations and organisational structures in the latter that it could be worthwhile to adopt different terms for the two They suggest business model design to refer to the process of crafting a business model when none is in place and business model reconfiguration for the process of changing an existing business model also highlighting that the two processes are not mutually exclusive meaning reconfiguration may involve steps which parallel those of designing a business model br br Al Debei and Avison consider value finance as one of the main dimensions of business modelling which depicts information related to costing pricing methods and revenue structure Stewart and Zhao defined the business model as a statement of how a firm will make money and sustain its profit stream over time br br Osterwalder et al consider the Business Model as the blueprint of how a company does business Slywotzky regards the business model as the totality of how a company selects its customers defines and differentiates it offerings defines the tasks it will perform itself and those it will outsource configures its resources goes to market creates utility for customers and captures profits br br Mayo and Brown considered the business model as the design of key interdependent systems that create and sustain a competitive business Casadesus Masanell and Ricart explain a business model as a set of choices policy assets and governance and consequences flexible and rigid and underline the importance of considering how it interacts with models of other players in the industry instead of thinking of it in isolation br br Zott and Amit consider business model design from the perspectives of design themes and design content Design themes refer to the system s dominant value creation drivers and design content examines in greater detail the activities to be performed the linking and sequencing of the activities and who will perform the activities br br Developing a framework for business model development with an emphasis on design themes Lim proposed the environment strategy structure operations ESSO business model development which takes into consideration the alignment of the organization s strategy with the organization s structure operations and the environmental factors in achieving competitive advantage in varying combination of cost quality time flexibility innovation and affective br br Business model design includes the modeling and description of a company s br br value propositions br target customer segments br distribution channels br customer relationships br value configurations br core capabilities br commercial network br partner network br cost structure br revenue model br A business model design template can facilitate the process of designing and describing a company s business model In a paper published in Johnson demonstrated how matrix methods may usefully be deployed to characterise the architecture of resources costs and revenues that a business uses to create and deliver value to customers which defines its business model Systematisation of this technique Johnson settles on a business genomic code of seven matrix elements of a business model would support a taxonomical approach to empirical studies of business models in the same way that Linnaeus taxonomy revolutionised biology br Daas et al developed a decision support system DSS for business model design In their study a decision support system DSS is developed to help SaaS in this process based on a design approach consisting of a design process that is guided by various design methods br br In the early history of business models it was very typical to define business model types such as bricks and mortar or e broker However these types usually describe only one aspect of the business most often the revenue model Therefore more recent literature on business models concentrate on describing a business model as a whole instead of only the most visible aspects br The following examples provide an overview for various business model types that have been in discussion since the invention of term business model br br Bricks and clicks business model br Business model by which a company integrates both offline bricks and online clicks presences One example of the bricks and clicks model is when a chain of stores allows the user to order products online but lets them pick up their order at a local store br Collective business models br Business system organization or association typically composed of relatively large numbers of businesses tradespersons or professionals in the same or related fields of endeavor which pools resources shares information or provides other benefits for their members For example a science park or high tech campus provides shared resources e g cleanrooms and other lab facilities to the firms located on its premises and in addition seeks to create an innovation community among these firms and their employees br Cutting out the middleman model br The removal of intermediaries in a supply chain cutting out the middleman Instead of going through traditional distribution channels which had some type of intermediate such as a distributor wholesaler broker or agent companies may now deal with every customer directly for example via the Internet br Direct sales model br Direct selling is marketing and selling products to consumers directly away from a fixed retail location Sales are typically made through party plan one to one demonstrations and other personal contact arrangements A text book definition is The direct personal presentation demonstration and sale of products and services to consumers usually in their homes or at their jobs br Distribution business models various br Fee in free out br Business model which works by charging the first client a fee for a service while offering that service free of charge to subsequent clients br Franchise br Franchising is the practice of using another firm s successful business model For the franchisor the franchise is an alternative to building chain stores to distribute goods and avoid investment and liability over a chain The franchisor s success is the success of the franchisees The franchisee is said to have a greater incentive than a direct employee because he or she has a direct stake in the business br Sourcing business model br Sourcing Business Models are a systems based approach to structuring supplier relationships A sourcing business model is a type of business model that is applied to business relationships where more than one party needs to work with another party to be successful There are seven sourcing business models that range from the transactional to investment based The seven models are Basic Provider Approved Provider Preferred Provider Performance Based Managed Services Model Vested outsourcing Business Model Shared Services Model and Equity Partnership Model Sourcing business models are targeted for procurement professionals who seek a modern approach to achieve the best fit between buyers and suppliers Sourcing business model theory is based on a collaborative research effort by the University of Tennessee UT the Sourcing Industry Group SIG the Center for Outsourcing Research and Education CORE and the International Association for Contracts and Commercial Management IACCM This research formed the basis for the book Strategic Sourcing in the New Economy Harnessing the Potential of Sourcing Business Models in Modern Procurement br Freemium business model br Business model that works by offering basic Web services or a basic downloadable digital product for free while charging a premium for advanced or special features br Pay what you can PWYC br A non profit or for profit business model which does not depend on set prices for its goods but instead asks customers to pay what they feel the product or service is worth to them It is often used as a promotional tactic but can also be the regular method of doing business It is a variation on the gift economy and cross subsidization in that it depends on reciprocity and trust to succeed Pay what you want PWYW is sometimes used synonymously but pay what you can is often more oriented to charity or socially oriented uses based more on ability to pay while pay what you want is often more broadly oriented to perceived value in combination with willingness and ability to pay br Value added reseller model br Value Added Reseller is a model where a business makes something which is resold by other businesses but with modifications which add value to the original product or service These modifications or additions are mostly industry specific in nature and are essential for the distribution Businesses going for a VAR model have to develop a VAR network It is one of the latest collaborative business models which can help in faster development cycles and is adopted by many Technology companies especially software br Other examples of business models are br br Auction business model br All in one business model br Chemical leasing br Low cost carrier business model br Loyalty business models br Monopolistic business model br Multi level marketing business model br Network effects business model br Online auction business model br Online content business model br Premium business model br Professional open source model br Pyramid scheme business model br Razor and blades model br Servitization of products business model br Subscription business model br Network Orchestrators Companies br Virtual business model br br Technology centric communities have defined frameworks for business modeling These frameworks attempt to define a rigorous approach to defining business value streams It is not clear however to what extent such frameworks are actually important for business planning Business model frameworks represent the core aspect of any company they involve the totality of how a company selects its customers defines and differentiates its offerings defines the tasks it will perform itself and those it will outsource configures its resource goes to market creates utility for customers and captures profits A business framework involves internal factors market analysis products services promotion development of trust social influence and knowledge sharing and external factors competitors and technological aspects br br Business reference model br Business reference model is a reference model concentrating on the architectural aspects of the core business of an enterprise service organization or government agency br Component business model br Technique developed by IBM to model and analyze an enterprise It is a logical representation or map of business components or building blocks and can be depicted on a single page It can be used to analyze the alignment of enterprise strategy with the organization s capabilities and investments identify redundant or overlapping business capabilities etc br Industrialization of services business model br Business model used in strategic management and services marketing that treats service provision as an industrial process subject to industrial optimization procedures br Business Model Canvas br Developed by A Osterwalder Yves Pigneur Alan Smith and practitioners from countries the business model canvas is one of the most used frameworks for describing the elements of business models br OGSM br The OGSM is developed by Marc van Eck and Ellen van Zanten of Business Openers into the Business plan on page Translated in several languages all over the world Management book in The Netherlands in The foundation of Business plan on page is the OGSM Objectives Goals Strategies and Measures dashboard and actions br br The process of business model design is part of business strategy Business model design and innovation refer to the way a firm or a network of firms defines its business logic at the strategic level br In contrast firms implement their business model at the operational level through their business operations This refers to their process level activities capabilities functions and infrastructure for example their business processes and business process modeling their organizational structures e g organograms workflows human resources and systems e g information technology architecture production lines br The brand is a consequence of the business model and has a symbiotic relationship with it because the business model determines the brand promise and the brand equity becomes a feature of the model Managing this is a task of integrated marketing br The standard terminology and examples of business models do not apply to most nonprofit organizations since their sources of income are generally not the same as the beneficiaries The term funding model is generally used instead br The model is defined by the organization s vision mission and values as well as sets of boundaries for the organization what products or services it will deliver what customers or markets it will target and what supply and delivery channels it will use Mission and vision together make part of the overall business purpose While the business model includes high level strategies and tactical direction for how the organization will implement the model it also includes the annual goals that set the specific steps the organization intends to undertake in the next year and the measures for their expected accomplishment Each of these is likely to be part of internal documentation that is available to the internal auditor br br When an organisation creates a new business model the process is called business model innovation There is a range of reviews on the topic The concept facilitates the analysis and planning of transformations from one business model to another Frequent and successful business model innovation can increase an organisation s resilience to changes in its environment and if an organisation has the capability to do this it can become a competitive advantage Although business model innovation promises financial returns periods of radical business model innovation can reduce the person organization fit and thus lead to a greater fluctuation in the workforce br br As a specific instance of Business Model Dynamics a research strand derived from the evolving changes in business models BMA identifies an update of the current business model to changes derived from the context BMA can be innovative or not depending on the degree of novelty of the changes implemented As a consequence of the new context several business model elements are promoted to answer those challenges pivoting the business model towards new models Companies adapt their business model when someone or something such as COVID has disrupted the market BMA could fit any organization but incumbents are more motivated to adapt their current BM than to change it radically or create a new one br br A Afuah and C
