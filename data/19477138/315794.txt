Secure Digital officially abbreviated as SD is a proprietary non volatile flash memory card format the SD Association SDA developed for use in portable devices br Because of their small physical dimensions SD cards became widely used in many consumer electronic devices such as digital cameras camcorders video game consoles mobile phones action cameras such as the GoPro Hero series and camera drones br The standard was introduced in August by SanDisk Panasonic Matsushita and Toshiba as an improvement on MultiMediaCards MMCs SDs have become an industry standard The three companies formed SD C LLC a company that licenses and enforces intellectual property IP rights associated with SD memory cards and SD host and ancillary products br In January the companies formed the SD Association SDA a non profit organization to create and promote SD Card standards As of the SDA has approximately member companies It uses several SD C owned trademarked logos to enforce compliance with its specifications and denote compatibility br br br History br br br Creation and introduction of smaller formats br In SanDisk Panasonic Matsushita and Toshiba agreed to develop and market the Secure Digital SD memory card The card was derived from the MultiMediaCard MMC and provided digital rights management DRM based on the Secure Digital Music Initiative SDMI standard and a high memory density data bits per physical space i e a large quantity of data could be stored in a small physical space br SD was designed to compete with the Memory Stick a flash storage format with DRM Sony had released the year before Toshiba hoped the SD card s DRM would encourage music suppliers concerned about piracy to use SD cards br The trademarked SD logo was originally developed for the Super Density Disc which was the unsuccessful Toshiba entry in the DVD format war For this reason the letter D is styled to resemble an optical disc br At the Consumer Electronics Show CES the three companies announced the creation of the SD Association SDA to promote SD cards The SD Association which was headquartered in San Ramon California United States then had member companies and product manufacturers that made interoperable memory cards and devices Early samples of the SD card became available in the first quarter of and production quantities of and megabyte MB cards became available three months later The first MB cards were offered for sale for USD SD was envisioned as a single memory card format for several kinds of electronic devices that could also function as an expansion slot for adding new capabilities for a device The first MB and MB SD cards were announced in br br br miniSD br br At March CeBIT SanDisk Corporation introduced announced and demonstrated the miniSD form factor The SDA adopted the miniSD card in as a small form factor extension to the SD card standard While the new cards were designed for mobile phones they were usually packaged with a miniSD adapter that provided compatibility with a standard SD memory card slot br br br microSD br MicroSD form factor memory cards were introduced in by SanDisk at CeBIT and originally called T Flash and later TransFlash which was abbreviated to T Flash or TF T Flash was renamed microSD in when it was adopted by the SDA TransFlash and microSD cards are functionally identical allowing either to operate in devices made for the other An adapter allowed the use of microSD and TransFlash cards in SD card slots br br br SDHC and SDIO br br In September SanDisk announced the GB miniSDHC Like the SD and SDHC the miniSDHC card has the same form factor as the older miniSD card but the HC card requires HC support built into the host device Devices that support miniSDHC work with miniSD and miniSDHC but devices without specific support for miniSDHC work only with the older miniSD card Since miniSD cards are no longer produced due to market domination of the even smaller microSD cards br br br SDXC br br The storage density of memory cards increased significantly throughout the s allowing the earliest devices to offer support for the SD XC standard such as the Samsung Galaxy S III and Samsung Galaxy Note II mobile phones to expand their available storage to several hundreds of gigabytes br In January the SDA announced the SDXC family which supports cards up to TB and speeds up to MB s SDXC cards are formatted with the exFAT file system by default SDXC was announced at the Consumer Electronics Show CES January At the same show SanDisk and Sony also announced a comparable Memory Stick XC variant with the same TB maximum as SDXC and Panasonic announced plans to produce GB SDXC cards On March Pretec introduced the first SDXC card a GB card with a read write speed of Mbit s But only early in did compatible host devices come onto the market including Sony s Handycam HDR CX V camcorder Canon s EOS D also known as Rebel T i Digital SLR camera a USB card reader from Panasonic and an integrated SDXC card reader from JMicron The earliest laptops to integrate SDXC card readers relied on a USB bus which does not have the bandwidth to support SDXC at full speed br In early commercial SDXC cards appeared from Toshiba GB Panasonic GB and GB and SanDisk GB br In early Centon Electronics Inc GB and GB and Lexar GB began shipping SDXC cards rated at Speed Class Pretec offered cards from GB to GB rated at Speed Class In September SanDisk released a GB microSDXC card Kingmax released a comparable product in br In April Panasonic introduced MicroP card format for professional video applications The cards are essentially full size SDHC or SDXC UHS II cards rated at UHS Speed Class U An adapter allows MicroP cards to work in current P card equipment br Panasonic MicroP cards shipped in March and were the first UHS II compliant products on market initial offer includes a GB SDHC card and a GB SDXC card Later that year Lexar released the first GB SDXC card based on nm NAND flash technology br In February SanDisk introduced the first GB microSDXC card which was followed by a GB microSDXC card in March September saw SanDisk announce the first GB SDXC card br Samsung announced the world s first EVO Plus GB microSDXC card in May and in September Western Digital SanDisk announced that a prototype of the first TB SDXC card would be demonstrated at Photokina br In August SanDisk launched a GB microSDXC card br In January Integral Memory unveiled its GB microSDXC card In May PNY launched a GB microSDXC card In June Kingston announced its Canvas series of microSD cards which were capable of capacities up to GB in three variations Select Go and React br In February Micron and SanDisk unveiled their microSDXC cards of TB capacity br br br present SDUC br The Secure Digital Ultra Capacity SDUC format supports cards up to TB and offers speeds up to MB s br In April Western Digital SanDisk revealed the world s first TB SD card at NAB which will make use of the SDUC format It is set to release in br br br Capacity br Secure Digital includes five card families available in three form factors The five families are the original standard capacity SDSC high capacity SDHC extended capacity SDXC ultra capacity SDUC and SDIO which combines input output functions with data storage br br br SD SDSC br br The second generation Secure Digital SDSC or Secure Digital Standard Capacity card was developed to improve on the MultiMediaCard MMC standard which continued to evolve but in a different direction Secure Digital changed the MMC design in several ways br br Asymmetrical shape of the sides of the SD card prevents inserting it upside down whereas an MMC goes in most of the way but makes no contact if inverted br Most standard size SD cards are mm inches thick with microSD versions being mm inches thick compared to mm inches for MMCs The SD specification defines a card called Thin SD with a thickness of mm but they occur only rarely as the SDA went on to define even smaller form factors br The card s electrical contacts are recessed beneath the surface of the card protecting them from contact with a user s fingers br The SD specification envisioned capacities and transfer rates exceeding those of MMC and both of these functionalities have grown over time For a comparison table see below br While MMC uses a single pin for data transfers the SD card added a four wire bus mode for higher data rates br The SD card added Content Protection for Recordable Media CPRM security circuitry for digital rights management DRM content protection br Addition of a write protect notch br Full size SD cards do not fit into the slimmer MMC slots and other issues also affect the ability to use one format in a host device designed for the other br br br SDHC br br The Secure Digital High Capacity SDHC format announced in January and defined in version of the SD specification supports cards with capacities up to GB The SDHC trademark is licensed to ensure compatibility br SDHC cards are physically and electrically identical to standard capacity SD cards SDSC The major compatibility issues between SDHC and SDSC cards are the redefinition of the Card Specific Data CSD register in version see below and the fact that SDHC cards are shipped preformatted with the FAT file system br Version also introduces a high speed bus mode for both SDSC and SDHC cards which doubles the original Standard Speed clock to produce MB s br SDHC host devices are required to accept older SD cards However older host devices do not recognize SDHC or SDXC memory cards although some devices can do so through a firmware upgrade Older Windows operating systems released before Windows require patches or service packs to support access to SDHC cards br br br SDXC br br The Secure Digital eXtended Capacity SDXC format announced in January and defined in version of the SD specification supports cards up to TB compared to a limit of GB for SDHC cards in the SD specification SDXC adopts Microsoft s exFAT file system as a mandatory feature br Version also introduced the Ultra High Speed UHS bus for both SDHC and SDXC cards with interface speeds from MB s to MB s for four bit UHS I bus this number has since been exceeded with SanDisk proprietary technology for MB s read which is not proprietary anymore as Lexar has the x running at MB s read and MB s write via UHS and Kingston also has their Canvas Go Plus also running at MB s br Version introduced in June allows speeds of MB s to MB s over the four lane two differential lanes UHS II bus which requires an additional row of physical pins br Version was announced in February at CP and added Video Speed Class ratings for UHS cards to handle higher resolution video formats like K The new ratings define a minimal write speed of MB s br br br SDUC br br The Secure Digital Ultra Capacity SDUC format described in the SD specification and announced in June supports cards up to TB and offers speeds up to MB s regardless of form factor either micro or full size or interface type including UHS I UHS II UHS III or SD Express The SD Express interface can also be used with SDHC and SDXC cards br br br exFAT filesystem br br SDXC and SDUC cards are normally formatted using the exFAT file system thereby limiting their use to a limited set of operating systems br Windows Vista SP and later and OS X and later have native support for exFAT Windows XP and Server can support exFAT via an optional update from Microsoft br Most BSD and Linux distributions did not for legal reasons though in Linux kernel Microsoft open sourced the spec and allowed the inclusion of an exFAT driver Users of older kernels or BSD can manually install third party implementations of exFAT as a FUSE module in order to be able to mount exFAT formatted volumes However SDXC cards can be reformatted to use any file system such as ext UFS VFAT or NTFS alleviating the restrictions associated with exFAT availability br Except for the change of file system SDXC cards are mostly backward compatible with SDHC readers and many SDHC host devices can use SDXC cards if they are first reformatted to the FAT file system br The SD Association provides a formatting utility for Windows and Mac OS X that checks and formats SD SDHC SDXC and SDUC cards br br br Speed br SD card speed is customarily rated by its sequential read or write speed The sequential performance aspect is the most relevant for storing and retrieving large files relative to block sizes internal to the flash memory such as images and multimedia Small data such as file names sizes and timestamps falls under the much lower speed limit of random access which can be the limiting factor in some use cases br With early SD cards a few card manufacturers specified the speed as a times rating which compared the average speed of reading data to that of the original CD ROM drive This was superseded by the Speed Class Rating which guarantees a minimum rate at which data can be written to the card br The newer families of SD card improve card speed by increasing the bus rate the frequency of the clock signal that strobes information into and out of the card Whatever the bus rate the card can signal to the host that it is busy until a read or a write operation is complete Compliance with a higher speed rating is a guarantee that the card limits its use of the busy indication br br br Bus br br br Default Speed br SD cards will read and write at speeds of MB s br br br High Speed br High Speed Mode MB s was introduced to support digital cameras with spec version br br br Ultra High Speed UHS br The Ultra High Speed UHS bus is available on some SDHC and SDXC cards br Cards that comply with UHS show Roman numerals I II or III next to the SD card logo and report this capability to the host device Use of UHS I requires that the host device command the card to drop from volt to volt operation over the I O interface pins and select the four bit transfer mode while UHS II requires volt operation br The higher speed rates of UHS II and III are achieved by using two lane V low voltage differential signaling LVDS on a second row of pins Each lane is capable of transferring up to MB s In full duplex mode one lane is used for Transmit while the other is used for Receive In half duplex mode both lanes are used for the same direction of data transfer allowing a double data rate at the same clock speed In addition to enabling higher data rates the UHS II interface allows for lower interface power consumption lower I O voltage and lower electromagnetic interference EMI br The following ultra high speeds are specified br br br UHS I br Specified in SD version Supports a clock frequency of MHz a quadrupling of the original Default Speed which in four bit transfer mode could transfer MB s SDR UHS I cards declared as UHS SDR also support a clock frequency of MHz which could transfer MB s Double data rate operation at MHz DDR is also specified in Version and is mandatory for microSDHC and microSDXC cards labeled as UHS I In this mode four bits are transferred when the clock signal rises and another four bits when it falls transferring an entire byte on each full clock cycle hence a MB s operation could be transferred using a MHz clock br There is a proprietary UHS I extension called DDR originally created by SanDisk that increases transfer speed further to MB s Unlike UHS II it does not use additional pins It achieves this by using the MHz frequency of the standard SDR mode but using DDR transfers This extension has since then been used by Lexar for their x series MB s Kingston Canvas Go Plus MB s and the MyMemory PRO SD card MB s br br br UHS II br br Specified in version further raises the data transfer rate to a theoretical maximum of MB s full duplex or MB s half duplex using an additional row of pins for LVDS signalling a total of pins for full size and pins for micro size cards While first implementations in compact system cameras were seen three years after specification it took many more years until UHS II was implemented on a regular basis At the beginning of almost DSLR and mirrorless cameras support UHS II br br br UHS III br Version released in February added two new data rates to the standard FD provides MB s while FD doubles that Both are full duplex The physical interface and pin layout are the same as with UHS II retaining backward compatibility br br br SD Express br br The SD Express bus was released in June with SD specification It uses a single PCIe lane to provide full duplex MB s transfer speed Supporting cards must also implement the NVM Express storage access protocol The Express bus can be implemented by SDHC SDXC and SDUC cards For legacy application use SD Express cards must also support High Speed bus and UHS I bus The Express bus re uses the pin layout of UHS II cards and reserves the space for additional two pins that may be introduced in the future br Hosts which implement version of the spec allow SD Cards to do direct memory access which increases the attack surface of the host dramatically in the face of malicious SD cards br Version was announced on May with support for two PCIe lanes with an additional row of contacts and PCIe transfer rates for a maximum bandwidth of MB s br Version was released in February br Version was announced in October br br br microSD Express br In February the SD Association announced microSD Express The microSD Express cards offer PCI Express and NVMe interfaces as the June SD Express release did alongside the legacy microSD interface for continued backwards compatibility The SDA also released visual marks to denote microSD Express memory cards to make matching the card and device easier for optimal device performance br br br Bus speed comparison br br br Compatibility br br NOTE If the card reader uses the DDR controller on the UHS pins the card reader will perform at MB s on applicable UHS cards br br br Class br br The SD Association defines standard speed classes for SDHC SDXC cards indicating minimum performance minimum serial data writing speed Both read and write speeds must exceed the specified value The specification defines these classes in terms of performance curves that translate into the following minimum read write performance levels on an empty card and suitability for different applications br The SD Association defines three types of Speed Class ratings the original Speed Class UHS Speed Class and Video Speed Class br br br Original Speed Class br Speed Class ratings and assert that the card supports the respective number of megabytes per second as a minimum sustained write speed for a card in a fragmented state br Class asserts that the card supports MB s as a minimum non fragmented sequential write speed and uses a High Speed bus mode The host device can read a card s speed class and warn the user if the card reports a speed class that falls below an application s minimum need By comparison the older rating measured maximum speed under ideal conditions and was vague as to whether this was read speed or write speed br The graphical symbol for the speed class has a number encircled with C C C C and C br br br UHS Speed Class br UHS I and UHS II cards can use UHS Speed Class rating with two possible grades class for minimum write performance of at least MB s U symbol featuring number inside U and class for minimum write performance of MB s U symbol featuring inside U targeted at recording K video Before November the rating was branded UHS Speed Grade and contained grades no symbol and U symbol Manufacturers can also display standard speed class symbols C C C and C alongside or in place of UHS speed class br UHS memory cards work best with UHS host devices The combination lets the user record HD resolution videos with tapeless camcorders while performing other functions It is also suitable for real time broadcasts and capturing large HD videos br br br Video Speed Class br Video Speed Class defines a set of requirements for UHS cards to match the modern MLC NAND flash memory and supports progressive K and K video with minimum sequential writing speeds of MB s The graphical symbols use a stylized V followed by a number designating write speed i e V V V V and V br br br Comparison br br br Application Performance Class br Application Performance Class is a newly defined standard from the SD Specification and which not only define sequential Writing Speeds but also mandates a minimum IOPS for reading and writing Class A requires a minimum of reading and writing operations per second using kbytes blocks while class A requires and IOPS A class cards require host driver support as they use command queuing and write caching to achieve their higher speeds Without they are guaranteed to at least reach A speeds As of kernel Linux fully supports A br br br rating br br The rating which was used by some card manufacturers and made obsolete by speed classes is a multiple of the standard CD ROM drive speed of KB s approximately Mbit s Basic cards transfer data at up to six times the CD ROM speed that is kbit s or Mbit s The specification defines speeds up to but is not as specific as Speed Classes are on how to measure speed Manufacturers may report best case speeds and may report the card s fastest read speed which is typically faster than the write speed Some vendors including Transcend and Kingston report their cards write speed When a card lists both a speed class and an rating the latter may be assumed a read speed only br br br Real world performance br In applications that require sustained write throughput such as video recording the device might not perform satisfactorily if the SD card s class rating falls below a particular speed For example a high definition camcorder may require a card of not less than Class suffering dropouts or corrupted video if a slower card is used Digital cameras with slow cards may take a noticeable time after taking a photograph before being ready for the next while the camera writes the first picture br The speed class rating does not totally characterize card performance Different cards of the same class may vary considerably while meeting class specifications A card s speed depends on many factors including br br The frequency of soft errors that the card s controller must re try br Write amplification The flash controller may need to overwrite more data than requested This has to do with performing read modify write operations on write blocks freeing up the much larger erase blocks while moving data around to achieve wear leveling br File fragmentation where there is not sufficient space for a file to be recorded in a contiguous region it is split into non contiguous fragments This does not cause rotational or head movement delays as with electromechanical hard drives but may decrease speed for instance by requiring additional reads and computation to determine where on the card the file s next fragment is stored br In addition speed may vary markedly between writing a large amount of data to a single file sequential access as when a digital camera records large photographs or videos and writing a large number of small files a random access use common in smartphones A study in found that in this random access use some Class cards achieved a write speed of MB s while all cards tested of Class or greater and some of lower Classes lower Class does not necessarily mean better small file performance including those from major manufacturers were over times slower In a blogger measured a fold performance difference on small writes this time the best card in this category was a class card br br br Features br br br Card security br br br Commands to disable writes br The host device can command the SD card to become read only to reject subsequent commands to write information to it There are both reversible and irreversible host commands that achieve this br br br Write protect notch br br Most full size SD cards have a mechanical write protect switch allowing the user to advise the host computer that the user wants the device to be treated as read only This does not protect the data on the card if the host is compromised It is the responsibility of the host to protect the card The position i e setting of the write protect switch is unknown to the internal circuitry of the card Some host devices do not support write protection which is an optional feature of the SD specification and drivers and devices that do obey a read only indication may give the user a way to override it br The switch is a sliding tab that covers a notch in the card The miniSD and microSD formats do not directly support a write protection notch but they can be inserted into full size adapters which do br When looking at the SD card from the top the right side the side with the beveled corner must be notched br On the left side there may be a write protection notch If the notch is omitted the card can be read and written If the card is notched it is read only If the card has a notch and a sliding tab which covers the notch the user can slide the tab upward toward the contacts to declare the card read write or downward to declare it read only The diagram to the right shows an orange sliding write protect tab in both the unlocked and locked positions br Cards sold with content that must not be altered are permanently marked read only by having a notch and no sliding tab br br br Card password br br A host device can lock an SD card using a password of up to bytes typically supplied by the user A locked card interacts normally with the host device except that it rejects commands to read and write data A locked card can be unlocked only by providing the same password The host device can after supplying the old password specify a new password or disable locking Without the password typically in the case that the user forgets the password the host device can command the card to erase all the data on the card for future re use except card data under DRM but there is no way to gain access to the existing data br Windows Phone devices use SD cards designed for access only by the phone manufacturer or mobile provider An SD card inserted into the phone underneath the battery compartment becomes locked to the phone with an automatically generated key so that the SD card cannot be read by another phone device or PC Symbian devices however are some of the few that can perform the necessary low level format operations on locked SD cards It is therefore possible to use a device such as the Nokia N to reformat the card for subsequent use in other devices br br br smartSD cards br A smartSD memory card is a microSD card with an internal secure element that allows the transfer of ISO Application Protocol Data Unit commands to for example JavaCard applets running on the internal secure element through the SD bus br Some of the earliest versions of microSD memory cards with secure elements were developed in by DeviceFidelity Inc a pioneer in near field communication NFC and mobile payments with the introduction of In Pay and CredenSE products later commercialized and certified for mobile contactless transactions by Visa in DeviceFidelity also adapted the In Pay microSD to work with the Apple iPhone using the iCaisse and pioneered the first NFC transactions and mobile payments on an Apple device in br Various implementations of smartSD cards have been done for payment applications and secured authentication In Good Technology partnered with DeviceFidelity to use microSD cards with secure elements for mobile identity and access control br microSD cards with Secure Elements and NFC near field communication support are used for mobile payments and have been used in direct to consumer mobile wallets and mobile banking solutions some of which were launched by major banks around the world including Bank of America US Bank and Wells Fargo while others were part of innovative new direct to consumer neobank programs such as moneto first launched in br microSD cards with Secure Elements have also been used for secure voice encryption on mobile devices which allows for one of the highest levels of security in person to person voice communications Such solutions are heavily used in intelligence and security br In HID Global partnered with Arizona State University to launch campus access solutions for students using microSD with Secure Element and MiFare technology provided by DeviceFidelity Inc This was the first time regular mobile phones could be used to open doors without need for electronic access keys br br br Vendor enhancements br br br Vendors have sought to differentiate their products in the market through various vendor specific features br br Integrated Wi Fi Several companies produce SD cards with built in Wi Fi transceivers supporting static security WEP WPA PSK and WPA PSK The card lets any digital camera with an SD slot transmit captured images over a wireless network or store the images on the card s memory until it is in range of a wireless network Examples include Eye Fi SanDisk Transcend Wi Fi Toshiba FlashAir Trek Flucard PQI Air Card and LZeal ez Share Some models geotag their pictures br Pre loaded content In SanDisk announced Gruvi a microSD card with extra digital rights management features which they intended as a medium for publishing content SanDisk again announced pre loaded cards in under the slotMusic name this time not using any of the DRM capabilities of the SD card In SanDisk offered various collections of songs on a single slotMusic card for about now restricted to compatible devices and without the ability to copy the files br Integrated USB connector The SanDisk SD Plus product can be plugged directly into a USB port without needing a USB card reader Other companies introduced comparable products such as the Duo SD product of OCZ Technology and the Way microSDHC SDHC and USB product of A DATA which was available in only br Different colors SanDisk has used various colors of plastic or adhesive label including a gaming line in translucent plastic colors that indicated the card s capacity br Integrated display In A DATA announced a Super Info SD card with a digital display that provided a two character label and showed the amount of unused memory on the card br br br SDIO cards br br A SDIO Secure Digital Input Output card is an extension of the SD specification to cover I O functions SDIO cards are only fully functional in host devices designed to support their input output functions typically PDAs like the Palm Treo but occasionally laptops or mobile phones These devices can use the SD slot to support GPS receivers modems barcode readers FM radio tuners TV tuners RFID readers digital cameras and interfaces to Wi Fi Bluetooth Ethernet and IrDA Many other SDIO devices have been proposed but it is now more common for I O devices to connect using the USB interface br SDIO cards support most of the memory commands of SD cards SDIO cards can be structured as eight logical cards although currently the typical way that an SDIO card uses this capability is to structure itself as one I O card and one memory card br The SDIO and SD interfaces are mechanically and electrically identical Host devices built for SDIO cards generally accept SD memory cards without I O functions However the reverse is not true because host devices need suitable drivers and applications to support the card s I O functions For example an HP SDIO camera usually does not work with PDAs that do not list it as an accessory Inserting an SDIO card into any SD slot causes no physical damage nor disruption to the host device but users may be frustrated that the SDIO card does not function fully when inserted into a seemingly compatible slot USB and Bluetooth devices exhibit comparable compatibility issues although to a lesser extent thanks to standardized USB device classes and Bluetooth profiles br The SDIO family comprises Low Speed and Full Speed cards Both types of SDIO cards support Serial Peripheral Interface SPI and one bit SD bus types Low Speed SDIO cards are allowed to also support the four bit SD bus Full Speed SDIO cards are required to support the four bit SD bus To use an SDIO card as a combo card for both memory and I O the host device must first select four bit SD bus operation Two other unique features of Low Speed SDIO are a maximum clock rate of kHz for all communications and the use of Pin as interrupt to try to initiate dialogue with the host device br br br Compatibility br br Host devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide backward compatibility and accept older SD cards For example SDXC host devices accept all previous families of SD memory cards and SDHC host devices also accept standard SD cards br Older host devices generally do not support newer card formats and even when they might support the bus interface used by the card there are several factors that arise br br A newer card may offer greater capacity than the host device can handle over GB for SDHC over GB for SDXC br A newer card may use a file system the host device cannot navigate FAT for SDHC exFAT for SDXC br Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input output functions the card provides br The hardware interface of the card was changed starting with the version new high speed bus clocks redefinition of storage capacity bits and SDHC family ultra high speed UHS bus br UHS II has physically more pins but is backwards compatible to UHS I and non UHS for both slot and card br Some vendors produced SDSC cards above GB before the SDA had standardized a method of doing so br br br Markets br br Due to their compact size Secure Digital cards are used in many consumer electronic devices and have become a widespread means of storing several gigabytes of data in a small size Devices in which the user may remove and replace cards often such as digital cameras camcorders and video game consoles tend to use full sized cards Devices in which small size is paramount such as mobile phones action cameras such as the GoPro Hero series and camera drones tend to use microSD cards br br br Mobile phones br The microSD card has helped propel the smartphone market by giving both manufacturers and consumers greater flexibility and freedom br While cloud storage depends on stable internet connection and sufficiently voluminous data plans memory cards in mobile devices provide location independent and private storage expansion with much higher transfer rates and no network delay enabling applications such as photography and video recording While data stored internally on bricked devices is inaccessible data stored on the memory card can be salvaged and accessed externally by the user as mass storage device A benefit over USB on the go storage expansion is uncompromised ergonomy The usage of a memory card also protects the mobile phone s non replaceable internal storage from weardown from heavy applications such as excessive camera usage and portable FTP server hosting over WiFi Direct Due to the technical development of memory cards users of existing mobile devices are able to expand their storage further and priceworthier with time br Recent versions of major operating systems such as Windows Mobile and Android allow applications to run from microSD cards creating possibilities for new usage models for SD cards in mobile computing markets as well as clearing available internal storage space br SD cards are not the most economical solution in devices that need only a small amount of non volatile memory such as station presets in small radios They may also not present the best choice for applications that require higher storage capacities or speeds as provided by other flash card standards such as CompactFlash These limitations may be addressed by evolving memory technologies such as the new SD specifications which allow storage capabilities of up to TB br Many personal computers of all types including tablets and mobile phones use SD cards either through built in slots or through an active electronic adapter Adapters exist for the PC card ExpressBus USB FireWire and the parallel printer port Active adapters also let SD cards be used in devices designed for other formats such as CompactFlash The FlashPath adapter lets SD cards be used in a floppy disk drive br Some devices such as the Samsung Galaxy Fit and Samsung Galaxy Note have an SD card compartment located externally and accessible by hand while it is located under the battery cover on other devices More recent mobile phones use a pin hole ejection system for the tray which houses both the memory card and SIM card br br br Counterfeits br br Commonly found on the market are mislabeled or counterfeit Secure Digital cards that report a fake capacity or run slower than labeled br Software tools exist to check and detect counterfeit products br and in some cases it is possible to repair these devices to remove the false capacity information and use its real storage limit br Detection of counterfeit cards usually involves copying files with random data to the SD card until the card s capacity is reached and copying them back The files that were copied back can be tested either by comparing checksums e g MD or trying to compress them The latter approach leverages the fact that counterfeited cards let the user read back files which then consist of easily compressible uniform data for example repeating xFFs br br br Digital cameras br br Secure Digital memory cards can be used in Sony XDCAM EX camcorders with an adapter br br br Personal computers br Although many personal computers accommodate SD cards as an auxiliary storage device using a built in slot or can accommodate SD cards by means of a USB adapter SD cards cannot be used as the primary hard disk through the onboard ATA controller because none of the SD card variants support ATA signalling Primary hard disk use requires a separate SD host controller or an SD to CompactFlash converter However on computers that support bootstrapping from a USB interface an SD card in a USB adapter can be the boot disk provided it contains an operating system that supports USB access once the bootstrap is complete br In laptop and tablet computers memory cards in an integrated memory card reader offer an ergonomical benefit over USB flash drives as the latter sticks out of the device and the user would need to be cautious not to bump it while transporting the device which could damage the USB port Memory cards have a unified shape and do not reserve a USB port when inserted into a computer s dedicated card slot br Since late newer Apple computers with installed SD card readers have been able to boot in macOS from SD storage devices when properly formatted to Mac OS Extended file format and the default partition table set to GUID Partition Table br SD cards are increasing in usage and popularity among owners of vintage computers like Atari bit computers For example SIO SD SIO is an Atari port for connecting external devices is used nowadays Software for an bit Atari may be included on one SD card that may have less than GB of disk size br br br Embedded systems br br In the SDA specified Embedded SD leverag ing well known SD standards to enable non removable SD style devices on printed circuit boards However this standard was not adopted by the market while the MMC standard became the de facto standard for embedded systems SanDisk provides such embedded memory components under the iNAND brand br While some modern microcontrollers integrate SDIO hardware which uses the faster proprietary four bit SD bus mode almost all modern microcontrollers at least have SPI units that can interface to an SD card operating in the slower one bit SPI bus mode If not SPI can also be emulated by bit banging e g a SD card slot soldered to a Linksys WRT G TM router and wired to GPIO pins using DD WRT s Linux kernel achieved only Mbit s throughput br br br

sizes br br SPI bus mode Serial Peripheral Interface Bus is primarily used by embedded microcontrollers This bus type supports only a volt interface This is the only bus type that does not require a host license br One bit SD bus mode Separate command and data channels and a proprietary transfer format br Four bit SD bus mode Uses extra pins plus some reassigned pins This is the same protocol as the one bit SD bus mode which uses one command and four data lines for faster data transfer All SD cards support this mode UHS I and UHS II require this bus type br Two differential lines SD UHS II mode Uses two low voltage differential signaling interfaces to transfer commands and data UHS II cards include this interface in addition to the SD bus modes br The physical interface comprises pins except that the miniSD card adds two unconnected pins in the center and the microSD card omits one of the two VSS Ground pins br br Notes br br Direction is relative to card I Input O Output br PP Push Pull logic OD Open Drain logic br S Power Supply NC Not Connected or logical high br br br Interface br br br Command interface br SD cards and host devices initially communicate through a synchronous one bit interface where the host device provides a clock signal that strobes single bits in and out of the SD card The host device thereby sends bit commands and receives responses The card can signal that a response will be delayed but the host device can abort the dialogue br Through issuing various commands the host device can br br Determine the type memory capacity and capabilities of the SD card br Command the card to use a different voltage different clock speed or advanced electrical interface br Prepare the card to receive a block to write to the flash memory or read and reply with the contents of a specified block br The command interface is an extension of the MultiMediaCard MMC interface SD cards dropped support for some of the commands in the MMC protocol but added commands related to copy protection By using only commands supported by both standards until determining the type of card inserted a host device can accommodate both SD and MMC cards br br br Electrical interface br All SD card families initially use a volt electrical interface On command SDHC and SDXC cards can switch to V operation br At power up or card insertion the voltage on pin selects either the Serial Peripheral Interface SPI bus or the SD bus The SD bus starts in one bit mode but the host device may issue a command to switch to the four bit mode if the SD card supports it For various card types support for the four bit SD bus is either optional or mandatory br After determining that the SD card supports it the host device can also command the SD card to switch to a higher transfer speed Until determining the card s capabilities the host device should not use a clock speed faster than kHz SD cards other than SDIO see below have a Default Speed clock rate of MHz The host device is not required to use the maximum clock speed that the card supports It may operate at less than the maximum clock speed to conserve power Between commands the host device can stop the clock entirely br br br MBR and FAT br br Most SD cards ship preformatted with one or more MBR partitions where the first or only partition contains a file system This lets them operate like the hard disk of a personal computer Per the SD card specification an SD card is formatted with MBR and the following file system br br For SDSC cards br Capacity of less than logical sectors smaller than MB FAT with partition type h and BPB or EBPB br Capacity of to logical sectors between MB and MB FAT with partition type h and BPB or EBPB br Capacity of at least logical sectors larger than MB FAT B with partition type h and EBPB br For SDHC cards br Capacity of less than logical sectors smaller than GB FAT with partition type Bh and EBPB br Capacity of at least logical sectors larger than GB FAT with partition type Ch and EBPB br For SDXC cards exFAT with partition type h br Most consumer products that take an SD card expect that it is partitioned and formatted in this way Universal support for FAT FAT FAT B and FAT allows the use of SDSC and SDHC cards on most host computers with a compatible SD reader to present the user with the familiar method of named files in a hierarchical directory tree br On such SD cards standard utility programs such as Mac OS X s Disk Utility or Windows SCANDISK can be used to repair a corrupted filing system and sometimes recover deleted files Defragmentation tools for FAT file systems may be used on such cards The resulting consolidation of files may provide a marginal improvement in the time required to read or write the file but not an improvement comparable to defragmentation of hard drives where storing a file in multiple fragments requires additional physical and relatively slow movement of a drive head Moreover defragmentation performs writes to the SD card that count against the card s rated lifespan The write endurance of the physical memory is discussed in the article on flash memory newer technology to increase the storage capacity of a card provides worse write endurance br When reformatting an SD card with a capacity of at least MB logical sectors or more but not more than GB FAT B with partition type h and EBPB is recommended if the card is for a consumer device FAT B is also an option for GB cards but it requires the use of KB clusters which are not widely supported FAT B does not support cards above GB at all br The SDXC specification mandates the use of Microsoft s proprietary exFAT file system which sometimes requires appropriate drivers e g exfat utils exfat fuse on Linux br br br Risks of reformatting br Reformatting an SD card with a different file system or even with the same one may make the card slower or shorten its lifespan Some cards use wear leveling in which frequently modified blocks are mapped to different portions of memory at different times and some wear leveling algorithms are designed for the access patterns typical of FAT FAT or FAT In addition the preformatted file system may use a cluster size that matches the erase region of the physical memory on the card reformatting may change the cluster size and make writes less efficient The SD Association provides freely downloadable SD Formatter software to overcome these problems for Windows and Mac OS X br SD SDHC SDXC memory cards have a Protected Area on the card for the SD standard s security function Neither standard formatters nor the SD Association formatter will erase it The SD Association suggests that devices or software which use the SD security function may format it br br br Power consumption br The power consumption of SD cards varies by its speed mode manufacturer and model br During transfer it may be in the range of mW mA at a supply voltage of V Specifications from TwinMOS Technologies list a maximum of mW mA during transfer Toshiba lists mW mA Standby current is much lower less than mA for one microSD card If there is data transfer for significant periods battery life may be reduced noticeably for reference the capacity of smartphone batteries is typically around Wh Samsung Galaxy S mAh V br Modern UHS II cards can consume up to W if the host device supports bus speed mode SDR or UHS II Minimum power consumption in the case of a UHS II host is mW br br br Storage capacity and compatibilities br All SD cards let the host device determine how much information the card can hold and the specification of each SD family gives the host device a guarantee of the maximum capacity a compliant card reports br By the time the version SDHC specification was completed in June vendors had already devised GB and GB SD cards either as specified in Version or by creatively reading Version The resulting cards do not work correctly in some host devices br br br SDSC cards above GB br br SD version assumed bytes per block This permitted SDSC cards up to B GB br Version let an SDSC card use a bit field to indicate or bytes per block instead Doing so enabled cards with GB and GB capacity such as the Transcend GB SD card the Memorette GB SD card and the Hoco GB microSD card br br br Storage capacity calculations br The format of the Card Specific Data CSD register changed between version SDSC and version which defines SDHC and SDXC br br br Version br In version of the SD specification capacities up to GB are calculated by combining fields of the CSD as follows br br Capacity C SIZE C SIZE MULT READ BL LEN br where br C SIZE br C SIZE MULT br READ BL LEN is for bytes sector or for bytes sector br br Later versions state at Section that a GB SDSC card shall set its READ BL LEN and WRITE BL LEN to indicate bytes so that the above computation correctly reports the card s capacity but that for consistency the host device shall not request by CMD block lengths over B br br br Versions and br br In the definition of SDHC cards in version the C SIZE portion of the CSD is bits and it indicates the memory size in multiples of KB the C SIZE MULT field is removed and READ BL LEN is no longer used to compute capacity Two bits that were formerly reserved now identify the card family is SDSC is SDHC or SDXC and are reserved Because of these redefinitions older host devices do not correctly identify SDHC or SDXC cards nor their correct capacity br br SDHC cards are restricted to reporting a capacity not over GB br SDXC cards are allowed to use all bits of the C SIZE field An SDHC card that did so reported C SIZE to indicate a capacity of over GB would violate the specification A host device that relied on C SIZE rather than the specification to determine the card s maximum capacity might support such a card but the card might fail in other SDHC compatible host devices br Capacity is calculated thus br br Capacity C SIZE br where for SDHC br C SIZE br GB Capacity GB br where for SDXC br C SIZE br GB Capacity TB br br Capacities above GB can only be achieved by following version or later versions In addition capacities equal to GB must also do so to guarantee compatibility br br br Openness of specification br br Like most memory card formats SD is covered by numerous patents and trademarks Excluding SDIO cards royalties for SD card licenses are imposed for manufacture and sale of memory cards and host adapters US year plus membership at US year br Early versions of the SD specification were available under a non disclosure agreement NDA prohibiting development of open source drivers However the system was eventually reverse engineered and free software drivers provided access to SD cards not using DRM Subsequent to the release of most open source drivers the SDA provided a simplified version of the specification under a less restrictive license helping reduce some incompatibility issues br Under a disclaimers agreement the simplified specification released by the SDA in as opposed to that of SD cards was later extended to the physical layer ASSD extensions SDIO and SDIO Bluetooth Type A br The Simplified Specification is available br Again most of the information had already been discovered and Linux had a fully free driver for it Still building a chip conforming to this specification caused the One Laptop per Child project to claim the first truly Open Source SD implementation with no need to obtain an SDI license or sign NDAs to create SD drivers or applications br The proprietary nature of the complete SD specification affects embedded systems laptop computers and some desktop computers many desktop computers do not have card slots instead using USB based card readers if necessary These card readers present a standard USB mass storage interface to memory cards thus separating the operating system from the details of the underlying SD interface However embedded systems such as portable music players usually gain direct access to SD cards and thus need complete programming information Desktop card readers are themselves embedded systems their manufacturers have usually paid the SDA for complete access to the SD specifications Many notebook computers now include SD card readers not based on USB device drivers for these essentially gain direct access to the SD card as do embedded systems br The SPI bus interface mode is the only type that does not require a host license for accessing SD cards br br br Data recovery br A malfunctioning SD card can be repaired using specialized equipment as long as the middle part containing the flash storage is not physically damaged The controller can in this way be circumvented This might be harder or even impossible in the case of monolithic card where the controller resides on the same physical die br br br See also br Comparison of memory cards br Flash memory br Microdrive br
