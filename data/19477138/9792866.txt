Bruker Corporation is an American manufacturer of scientific instruments for molecular and materials research as well as for industrial and applied analysis It is headquartered in Billerica Massachusetts and is the publicly traded parent company of Bruker Scientific Instruments Bruker AXS Bruker BioSpin Bruker Daltonics and Bruker Optics and Bruker Energy Supercon Technologies BEST divisions br In April Bruker created a Chemical Analysis Division headquartered in Fremont CA under the Bruker Daltonics subsidiary This division contains three former Varian product lines ICPMS systems laboratory gas chromatography GC and GC triple quadrupole mass spectrometer originally designed by Bear Instruments and acquired by Varian in br In it sponsored the Fritz Feigl Prize and since the company has also sponsored the G nther Laukien Prize br br br History br The company was founded on September in Karlsruhe Germany as Bruker Physik AG by five people one of them being G nther Laukien who was a professor at the University of Karlsruhe at the time The name Bruker originates from co founder Emil Bruker as G nther Laukien himself was formally not allowed to commercialize his research whilst being a professor Bruker produced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy NMR and EMR spectroscopy equipment then br In the early s the company had around employees and was growing rapidly One of the early success products was the HFX NMR spectroscopy system with three independent channels and which was also the first NMR system using only semiconductor transistors br In Bruker launched the first commercial Fourier transform NMR spectroscopy system FT NMR and in the s the company was the first to commercialize a superconducting FT NMR Later the company would expand their product range with MRI FTIR and FT Raman spectrometers and with mass spectrometers br In Bruker shipped NMR systems to Yale University in Connecticut After that demand from the US grew so Bruker opened an office in Elmsford New York which marked the start of their US activities In after a corporate reorganization lasting years all divisions were merged in a unified Bruker Corporation br G nther Laukien died in one of his four sons Frank Laukien is currently the CEO of Bruker Another son J rg C Laukien also works for the company Another son Dirk D Laukien is a former company executive br br br Acquisitions br Bruker acquisitions include GE NMR Instruments Siemens AXS Nonius MacScience Vacuumschmelze Hanau R ntec SOCABIM PGT Keymaster Quantron JuWe SIS ACCEL Michrom Bioresources Skyscan Prairie Technologies Oncovision Preclinical PET imaging business Oxford Instruments Superconducting Technology Hysitron Inc XGLab Luxendo Alicona PMOD Technologies LLC Optimal Group and Neurescence Inc br br br Other br In the company bought the NMR division of the Swiss Tr b T uber br Bruker made several offers to take over its supplier Oxford Instruments during the s but after almost a decade of negotiations an acquisition was eventually rejected by Oxford Instruments br In the analytical X ray division of Siemens was acquired by Bruker br In Bruker bought product lines from Agilent which Agilent had acquired from Varian These included mass spectrometry and gas chromatography instruments They have since divested these products to Scion Instruments with the exception of the triple quadrupole br In Bruker bought parts of Carestream Health including their in vivo imaging portfolio and related aspects br In Bruker bought Alicona known for production of metrology equipment based on focus variation to extend its analytics business in the industrial market br In November it was announced Bruker had acquired the Mountain View headquartered miniaturized microscope miniscope company Inscopix Inc br br br Products br br Bruker develops and delivers a wide variety of professional and scientific analysis devices including mass spectrometers single Crystal and powder X ray diffractometers X ray tomography devices NMR spectroscopy devices fluorescence microscopes raman spectroscopes atomic force microscopes and profilometers br br br Notable product use br Bruker products are used globally in a variety of situations The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Florida State University selected Bruker to build the world s first tesla FT ICR MS br The Total Carbon Column Observing Network uses high resolution FT IR spectrometers made by Bruker to measure various greenhouse gases across the globe br br br Awards br In May Frost Sullivan selected the Company s Bruker Daltonics subsidiary for their Product Line Innovation Award for the Life Sciences Bruker Daltonics received this award for its innovative development of sophisticated mass spectrometers br br br br br br External links br Official website
