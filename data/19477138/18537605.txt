Vishay Intertechnology Inc is an American manufacturer of discrete semiconductors and passive electronic components founded by Polish born businessman Felix Zandman Vishay has manufacturing plants in Israel Asia Europe and the Americas where it produces rectifiers diodes MOSFETs optoelectronics selected integrated circuits resistors capacitors and inductors Vishay Intertechnology revenues for were billion At the end of Vishay had approximately full time employees br Vishay is one of the world s foremost manufacturers of power MOSFETs They have a wide range of power electronic applications including portable information appliances internet communications infrastructure power integrated circuits cell phones and notebook computers br br br History br br Vishay Intertechnology was founded in by Polish born Holocaust survivor Felix Zandman The company was named after Zandman s ancestral village in present day Lithuania Veisiejai It began operations with a patented technology that had two product lines foil resistors and foil resistance strain gauges In having grown from a start up into the world s leading manufacturer of these original products the company began an ongoing series of acquisitions to become a broadline manufacturer of electronics components br Having expanded into so many product lines Vishay announced in October that it would be creating a spin off company which focuses on their high precision technologies in Foil Technology Vishay Precision Group represents approximately of Vishay annual revenue and included their product lines in Bulk Metal Foil Resistors micro measurements load cells process weighing and on board weighing In July Vishay Intertechnology completed the spin off of Vishay Precision Group VPG br Since Vishay has pursued a business strategy that principally consists of the following elements expanding within the electronic components industry primarily through the acquisition of other manufacturers of electronic components reducing expenses transferring manufacturing operations to countries with lower labor costs and government sponsored incentives maintaining significant production facilities in regions where Vishay markets the bulk of its products continually rolling out new products and strengthening relationships with customers and strategic partners As a result of this strategy Vishay has grown from a small manufacturer of precision resistors and resistance strain gages to one of the world s largest manufacturers and suppliers of a broad line of electronic components br The former Spectrol Reliance factory in Swindon England UK arm of Spectrol Electronics that was acquired by Vishay in originally known as Reliance Controls was the last design by Team Richard Rogers Norman Foster and their respective wives and is considered the first example of High tech architecture in the United Kingdom It opened in and was demolished in Spectrol Reliance moving to a different part of Swindon br br br Acquisitions br Some of the manufacturers that Vishay has acquired include HiRel Systems the resistor business of Huntington Electric the wet tantalum capacitor business of KEMET the PCS business of International Rectifier BCcomponents Beyschlag Centralab components which was previously part of Philips Electronics Components General Semiconductor the infrared components business of Infineon Mallory NACC and Tansitor Cera Mite Electro Films and Spectrol Siliconix and Telefunken Vitramon Roederstein Sprague Sfernice Draloric and Dale br Vishay agreed to purchase the Inmos microprocessor factory from Nexperia for million in November In March the UK government approved the acquisition as announced by Secretary of State Oliver Dowden br br br See also br Robert C Sprague founder of Sprague Electric company br br br br br br External links br Official website br Business data for Vishay Intertechnology Inc
