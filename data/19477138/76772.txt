Tomorrow focus on the loss of his mother He said because of the way I grew up in Finglas sleeping on a couch or because my mother died when I was a kid I was in the house on my own a lot of the time so I d knock on the door of the Hanveys at teatime or the Rowens at lunchtime br During his childhood and adolescence Bono and his friends were part of a surrealist street gang called Lypton Village

Mullen Jr seeking people interested in forming a rock band The band had occasional jam sessions in which they did covers of other bands Tired of long guitar solos and hard rock Bono wanted to play The Rolling Stones and Beach Boys songs The band could not play covers very well so they started writing their own songs The band went by the name Feedback for a few months before changing to The Hype later on After Dik Evans left the group to join another local band the Virgin Prunes the remaining four officially changed the name from The Hype to U Initially Bono sang played guitar and wrote the band s songs He said of his early guitar playing in a interview When we started out I was the guitar player along with the Edge except I couldn t play guitar I still can t I was such a lousy guitar player that one day they broke it to me that maybe I should sing instead I had tried before but I had no voice at all I remember the day I found I could sing I said Oh that s how you do it When The Edge s guitar playing improved Bono was relegated mostly to the microphone although he occasionally still plays rhythm guitar and harmonica As of Bono has taken piano lessons from his children s piano teacher as a means to improve his songwriting br On July U performed at the Live Aid benefit concert at Wembley Stadium before a crowd of fans and a worldwide television audience of billion people During a minute performance of Bad Bono climbed down from the stage to embrace and dance with a female fan he had picked out of the crowd showing television viewers the personal connection that he could make with audiences Bono s impromptu departure from the stage extended the length of Bad cutting into their allotted time and forcing them to drop Pride In the Name of Love their biggest hit at the time from their setlist The group initially regarded the concert as a missed opportunity but many journalists called their performance one of the show s highlights The Guardian cited Live Aid as the event that made stars of U and their performance as one of key events in rock history br br Bono writes the lyrics for almost all U songs which often have social and political themes His lyrics frequently allude to a religious connection or meaning evident in songs such as Gloria from the band s album October and I Still Haven t Found What I m Looking For from The Joshua Tree During the band s early years Bono was known for his rebellious tone which turned to political anger and rage during the band s War The Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum eras Following the Enniskillen bombing that left dead and injured on November the Provisional IRA paramilitaries threatened to kidnap Bono IRA supporters also attacked a vehicle carrying the band members These acts were in response to his speech condemning the Enniskillen bombing during a live performance of Sunday Bloody Sunday Bono had been advised to cut his on stage outburst from the Rattle and Hum film but it was left in br The film also contains footage of the band s November free Save the Yuppies concert at Justin Herman Plaza in San Francisco during which Bono spray painted Rock N Roll Stops the Traffic on the Vaillancourt Fountain sculpture Bono was criticised by Mayor Dianne Feinstein and faced a misdemeanor for defacing public property He apologised in a written statement to local officials and the band s promoter Bill Graham agreed to pay to clean up the graffiti With the band feeling a sense of musical stagnation towards the end of the Lovetown Tour Bono hinted at changes to come during a December concert before a hometown crowd in Dublin he said on stage that it was the end of something for U and that we have to go away and dream it all up again br br U s sound and focus dramatically changed with their album Achtung Baby Bono s lyrics became more personal inspired by experiences related to the private lives of the members of the band During the band s Zoo TV Tour Bono assumed a number of costumed stage personae in an attempt to be more lighthearted and escape the group s reputation of being overly serious and self righteous Bono said All through the Eighties we tried to be ourselves and failed when the lights were on Which is what set us up for Zoo TV We decided to have some fun being other people or at least other versions of ourselves Bono s primary persona during the tour was the Fly which originated from him wearing an oversized pair of blaxploitation sunglasses given to him by wardrobe manager Fintan Fitzgerald to lighten the mood in the studio He developed the persona into a leather clad egomaniac and described his outfit as having Lou Reed s glasses Elvis Presley s jacket and Jim Morrison s leather trousers To match the character s dark fashion Bono dyed his naturally brown hair black In contrast to his earnest stage demeanour of the s as the Fly Bono strutted around the stage with swagger and style exhibiting mannerisms of an egotistical rock star He often stayed in character as the Fly away from the stage including for public appearances and when staying in hotels br For his Mirror Ball Man stage character Bono dressed in a shining silver lam suit with matching shoes and cowboy hat The character was meant to parody greedy American televangelists showmen and car salesman and was inspired by Phil Ochs Elvis persona from his tour Bono said that the character represented a kind of showman America He had the confidence and charm to pick up a mirror and look at himself and give the glass a big kiss He loved cash and in his mind success was God s blessing Mirror Ball Man appeared during encores of concerts in and made prank calls from the stage often to the White House in an attempt to reach U S President George H W Bush Bono portrayed this alter ego on the first three legs of the tour but replaced him with MacPhisto in MacPhisto was created to parody the devil and was named after Mephistopheles of the Faust legend As MacPhisto Bono wore a gold lam suit with gold platform shoes pale makeup lipstick and devil s horns on his head As the character Bono spoke with an exaggerated upper class English accent similar to that of a down on his luck character actor According to him We came up with a sort of old English Devil a pop star long past his prime returning regularly from sessions on The Strip in Vegas and regaling anyone who would listen to him at cocktail hour with stories from the good old bad old days As MacPhisto Bono continued his routine of making in concert prank calls targeting local politicians and mocking them by engaging them in character as the devil he said When you re dressed as the Devil your conversation is immediately loaded so if you tell somebody you really like what they re doing you know it s not a compliment br During performances Bono attempts to interact with the crowd as often as possible He is known for pulling audience members onto the stage or moving himself down to the physical level of the audience In during U s Vertigo Tour stop in Chicago he pulled a boy onto the stage during the song An Cat Dubh Into the Heart Bono has often allowed fans to come on stage and perform songs with the band br While accepting the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for The Hands That Built America Bono called the award really really fucking brilliant during the live television broadcast In response the Parents Television Council condemned Bono for his profanity and started a campaign for its members to file complaints with the FCC Although Bono s use of fuck violated FCC indecency standards the FCC refused to fine NBC because the network did not receive advance notice of the consequences of broadcasting such profanity and the profanity in question was not used in its literal sexual meaning br In apparent reaction to the refusal a group of congressmen introduced House Resolution the Clean Airwaves Act on December aiming to amend section of title of the United States Code to provide an explicit list of profane words and phrases and remove ambiguity that could enable certain uses of the phrases to be allowed The bill was not enacted The incident has had a long term impact in the handling of profanity on live broadcasts br br U were criticised in for moving part of their multimillion euro song catalogue from Ireland to Amsterdam six months before Ireland ended a tax exemption on musicians royalties Under Dutch tax law bands are subject to low to non existent tax rates U manager Paul McGuinness stated that the arrangement was legal and customary and businesses often sought to minimise their tax burdens The move prompted criticisms in the Irish parliament The band later responded by stating that approximately of their business took place outside Ireland and that they were taxed globally because of this Bono was one of several wealthy figures whose tax arrangements were singled out for criticism in a report by the charity Christian Aid in br br br Solo br In November Bono embarked on a date book tour across North America and Europe called Stories of Surrender to promote his memoir Surrender Songs One Story For the shows he recited and acted out

was released on YouTube retitled SING LIFE as a collaboration with will i am Jennifer Hudson and Yoshiki br br br Musical style br br br Vocals br br Bono is known for his impassioned vocal style often delivered in a high register through open throated belting Bono has been classified as a tenor and according to him has a three octave vocal range one analysis found it to span from C to G on studio recordings over the course of his career He frequently employs whoa oh oh vocalisations in his singing Rock musician Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day said He s a physical singer like the leader of a gospel choir and he gets lost in the melodic moment He goes to a place outside himself especially in front of an audience when he hits those high notes He added that Bono is not afraid to go beyond what he s capable of br In the early days of U Bono unintentionally developed an English vocal accent as a result of him mimicking his musical influences such as Siouxsie and the Banshees He said I still think that I sing like Siouxsie from The Banshees on the first two U albums But I found my voice through Joey Ramone at that gig in Dublin I stood there and heard him singing He sang a bit like a girl too It was all going to be OK after all That was my way in His vocal style evolved during the band s exploration of roots music for The Joshua Tree Spin said that he learned to command the full whisper to shout range of blues mannerisms Bono attributed this maturation to loosening up discover ing other voices and employing more restraint in his singing For Where the Streets Have No Name Bono varied the timbre of his voice extensively and used rubato to vary its timing while author Susan Fast found With or Without You to be the first track on which he extended his vocal range downward in an appreciable way br Bono continued to explore a lower range in the s using what Fast described as breathy and subdued colors for Achtung Baby One technique used on the album is octave doubling in which his vocals are sung in two different octaves either simultaneously or alternating between verses and choruses According to Fast this technique introduces a contrasting lyrical idea and vocal character to deliver it leading to both literal and ironic interpretations of Bono s vocals On tracks such as Zoo Station and The Fly his vocals were highly processed giving them a different emotional feel from his previous work Bono said that lowering his voice helped him find a new vocal vocabulary as he previously felt limited to certain words and tones by his tenor voice His singing on Zooropa was an even further departure from U s previous style throughout the record Bono underplay ed his lung power according to Jon Pareles and he also used an operatic falsetto he calls the Fat Lady voice on the tracks Lemon and Numb As he has aged Bono has continued to evolve his singing relying more on the croon than the belt according to Rolling Stone s Joe Gross br br br Activism and philanthropy br br Bono has been involved in philanthropy and activism for human rights and social justice causes both as a member of U and as an individual He explained that he was motivated to become involved in social and political causes by seeing one of the Secret Policeman s Ball benefit shows staged by Monty Python member John Cleese and producer Martin Lewis for the human rights

one act plays to teach Ethiopian children important information about issues such as health and hygiene During the trip he also became aware of the corruption trade agreements and debts that were all

activist efforts br In Bono and U performed on Amnesty International s Conspiracy of Hope Tour of benefit concerts in the United States alongside musicians such as Sting and Bryan Adams br br Since Bono has become increasingly involved with raising awareness of the plight of Africa and campaigning on its behalf From to Bono was involved with the Jubilee coalition working as an activist on its

stars such as Bono Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie labelling them as mythomaniacs people who wish to convince the world of their worth Theroux who lived in Africa as a Peace Corps volunteer added that
