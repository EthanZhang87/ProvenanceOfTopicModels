U are an Irish rock band formed in Dublin in The group consists of Bono lead vocals and rhythm guitar the Edge lead guitar keyboards and backing vocals Adam Clayton bass guitar and Larry Mullen Jr drums and percussion Initially rooted in post punk U s musical style has evolved throughout their career yet has maintained an anthemic quality built on Bono s expressive vocals and the Edge s chiming effects based guitar sounds Bono s lyrics often embellished with spiritual imagery focus on personal and sociopolitical themes Popular for their live performances the group have staged several elaborate tours over their career br The band was formed when the members were teenaged pupils of Mount Temple Comprehensive School and had limited musical proficiency Within four years they signed with Island Records and released their debut album Boy Works such as their first UK number one album War and singles Sunday Bloody Sunday and Pride In the Name of Love helped establish U s reputation as a politically and socially conscious group Their fourth album The Unforgettable Fire was their first collaboration with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois whose influence resulted in a more abstract ambient sound for the band By the mid s U had become renowned globally for their live act highlighted by their performance at Live Aid in Their fifth album The Joshua Tree made them international stars and was their greatest critical and commercial success One of the world s best selling albums with million copies sold it produced the group s only number one singles in the US to date With or Without You and I Still Haven t Found What I m Looking For br Facing creative stagnation and a backlash to their documentary and double album Rattle and Hum U reinvented themselves in the s Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album Achtung Baby and the multimedia spectacle of the Zoo TV Tour the band pursued a new musical direction influenced by alternative rock electronic dance music and industrial music and they embraced a more ironic flippant image This experimentation continued on Zooropa and concluded with Pop and the PopMart Tour which were mixed successes U regained critical and commercial favour with the records All That You Can t Leave Behind and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb returning to a more conventional mainstream sound Although their twelfth album No Line on the Horizon did not meet commercial expectations the supporting U Tour of set records for the highest attended and highest grossing concert tour both of which stood until In the s U released two companion albums Songs of Innocence which received criticism for its pervasive no cost release through the iTunes Store and Songs of Experience In U released Songs of Surrender an album of re recorded songs and began the U UV Achtung Baby Live concert residency to inaugurate Sphere in the Las Vegas Valley br U have released studio albums and are one of the world s best selling music artists having sold an estimated million records worldwide They have won Grammy Awards more than any other band and in they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility Rolling Stone ranked U at number on its list of the Greatest Artists of All Time Throughout their career as a band and as individuals they have campaigned for human rights and social justice causes working with organisations and coalitions that include Amnesty International Jubilee DATA the ONE Campaign Product Red War Child and Music Rising br br br History br br br Formation and early years br br In Larry Mullen Jr then a year old pupil of Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin Ireland posted a note on the school s notice board in search of musicians for a new band At least five people responded and attended the first practice which was held on September in Mullen s kitchen Mullen played drums and was joined by Paul Hewson Bono on lead vocals David Evans the Edge and his older brother Dik Evans on guitar Adam Clayton a friend of the Evans brothers on bass guitar and Ivan McCormick Mullen later described it as The Larry Mullen Band for about ten minutes then Bono walked in and blew any chance I had of being in charge Peter Martin a friend of Mullen and McCormick loaned his guitar and amplifier for the first practice but he could not play and was quickly phased out sources differ on whether he was in attendance at the first meeting or not McCormick was dropped from the group after a few weeks The remaining five members settled on the name Feedback for the group because it was one of the few technical terms they knew Early rehearsals took place in their music teacher s classroom at Mount Temple Most of their initial material consisted of cover songs which they admitted was not their forte Emerging punk rock acts such as the Stranglers the Jam the Clash Buzzcocks and Sex Pistols were strong influences on the group The popularity of punk convinced them that musical proficiency was not a prerequisite to success br br In April Feedback played their first gig for a paying audience at St Fintan s High School Shortly thereafter the band changed their name to The Hype Dik Evans who was older and by that time attending college was becoming the odd man out The rest of the band was leaning towards the idea of a four piece ensemble In March the group changed their name to U Steve Averill a punk rock musician with the Radiators from Space and a family friend of Clayton s had suggested six potential names from which the band chose U for its ambiguity and open ended interpretations and because it was the name that they disliked the least Dik Evans was officially phased out of the band with a farewell concert at the Presbyterian Hall in Sutton on March During the show which featured the group playing cover songs as the Hype Dik ceremonially walked offstage The remaining four band members returned later in the concert to play original material as U Dik joined another band the Virgin Prunes which comprised mutual friends of U s the Prunes were their default opening act early on and the two groups often shared members for live performances to cover for occasional absences On March the four piece U won the Pop Group talent contest sponsored by the Evening Press and Guinness s Harp Lager as part of Limerick Civic Week The win was an important milestone and affirmation for the fledgling act The contest prize consisted of and a recording session for a demo that would be heard by record label CBS Ireland U s demo tape was recorded at Keystone Studios in Dublin in April but the results were largely unsuccessful due to their inexperience br br Irish magazine Hot Press was influential in shaping U s future in addition to being one of their earliest allies the publication s journalist Bill Graham introduced the band to Paul McGuinness who agreed to be their manager in mid With the connections he was making within the music industry McGuinness booked demo sessions for the group and sought to garner them a record deal The band continued to build their fanbase with performances across Ireland the most famous of which were a series of weekend afternoon shows at Dublin s Dandelion Market in the summer of In August U recorded demos at Windmill Lane Studios with CBS talent scout Chas de Whalley as producer marking the first of the band s many recordings at the studio during their career The following month three songs from the session were released by CBS as the Ireland only EP Three It was the group s first chart success selling all copies of its limited edition inch vinyl almost immediately In December the band performed in London for their first shows outside Ireland although they were unable to gain much attention from audiences or critics On February their second single Another Day was released on the CBS label but again only for the Irish market The same day U played a show at the seat National Stadium in Dublin as part of an Irish tour Despite their gamble of booking a concert in such a large venue the move paid off Bill Stewart an A R representative for Island Records was in attendance and offered to sign them to the label The following month the band signed a four year four album contract with Island which included a advance and in tour support br br br Boy and October br br In May U released O Clock Tick Tock their first international single and their debut on Island but it failed to chart Martin Hannett who produced the single was slated to produce the band s debut album Boy but ultimately was replaced with Steve Lillywhite From July to September U recorded the album at Windmill Lane Studios drawing from their nearly song repertoire at the time Lillywhite suggested recording Mullen s drums in a stairwell and recording smashed bottles and forks played against a spinning bicycle wheel The band found Lillywhite to be very encouraging and creative Bono called him such a breath of fresh air while the Edge said he had a great way of pulling the best out of everybody The album s lead single A Day Without Me was released in August Although it did not chart the song was the impetus for the Edge s purchase of a delay effect unit the Electro Harmonix Memory Man which came to define his guitar playing style and had a significant impact on the group s creative output br Released in October Boy received generally positive reviews Paul Morley of NME called it touching precocious full of archaic and modernist conviction while Declan Lynch of Hot Press said he found it almost impossible to react negatively to U s music Bono s lyrics reflected on adolescence innocence and the passage into adulthood themes represented on the album cover through the photo of a young boy s face Boy peaked at number in the United Kingdom and number in the United States The album included the band s first songs to receive airplay on US radio including the single I Will Follow which reached number on the Top Tracks rock chart Boy s release was followed by the Boy Tour U s first tour of continental Europe and the US Despite being unpolished these early live performances demonstrated the band s potential as critics complimented their ambition and Bono s exuberance br br The band faced several challenges in writing their second album October On an otherwise successful American leg of the Boy Tour Bono s briefcase containing in progress lyrics and musical ideas was lost backstage during a March performance at a nightclub in Portland Oregon The band had limited time to write new music on tour and in July began a two month recording session at Windmill Lane Studios largely unprepared forcing Bono to quickly improvise lyrics Lillywhite reprising his role as producer called the sessions completely chaotic and mad October s lead single Fire was released in July and was U s first song to chart in the UK Despite garnering the band an appearance on UK television programme Top of the Pops the single fell in the charts afterwards On August the group opened for Thin Lizzy at the inaugural Slane Concert but the Edge called it one of the worst shows U ever played in their lives Adding to this period of self doubt Bono s the Edge s and Mullen s involvement in a Charismatic Christian group in Dublin called the Shalom Fellowship led them to question the relationship between their religious faith and the lifestyle of a rock band Bono and the Edge considered quitting U due to their perceived spiritual conflicts before deciding to leave Shalom instead br br October was released in October and contained overtly spiritual themes The album received mixed reviews and limited radio play and although it debuted at number in the UK it sold poorly elsewhere The single Gloria was U s first song to have its music video played on MTV generating excitement for the band during the October Tour of in markets where the television channel was available During the tour U met Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn who became their principal photographer and has had a major influence on their vision and public image In March the band played dates as the opening act for the J Geils Band increasing their exposure Still U were disappointed by their lack of progress by the end of the October Tour Having run out of money and feeling unsupported by their record label the group committed to improving Clayton recalled that there was a firm resolve to come out of the box fighting with the next record br br br War and Under a Blood Red Sky br After the October Tour U decamped to a rented cottage in Howth where they lived wrote new songs and rehearsed for their third album War Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August during a two week period of independent songwriting while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali From September to November the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios Lillywhite who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts For the first time Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time After completing the album U undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December br br War s lead single New Year s Day was released in January It reached number in the UK and became the group s first hit outside of Europe in the US it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number Resolving their doubts of the October period U released War in February Critically the album received favourable reviews although a few UK reviewers were critical of it Nonetheless it was the band s first commercial success debuting at number one in the UK while reaching number in the US War s sincerity and rugged guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time Described as a record on which the band turned pacifism itself into a crusade War was lyrically more political than their first two records focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare The album included the protest song Sunday Bloody Sunday in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation Seconds and the Polish Solidarity movement New Year s Day War was U s first record to feature Corbijn s photography The album cover depicted the same young child who had appeared on the cover of their debut album albeit with his previously innocent expression replaced by a fearful one br br On the subsequent War Tour of Europe the US and Japan the band began to play progressively larger venues moving from clubs to halls to arenas Bono attempted to engage the growing audiences with theatrical often dangerous antics climbing scaffoldings and lighting rigs and jumping into the audience The sight of Bono waving a white flag during performances of Sunday Bloody Sunday became the tour s iconic image The band played several dates at large European and American music festivals including a performance at the US Festival on Memorial Day weekend for an audience of people Nearly rained out the group s June concert at Red Rocks Amphitheatre was singled out by Rolling Stone as one of Moments that Changed the History of Rock and Roll The show was recorded for the concert video Live at Red Rocks and was one of several concerts from the tour captured on their live album Under a Blood Red Sky The releases received extensive play on MTV and the radio expanding the band s audience and showcasing their prowess as a live act During the tour the group established a new tradition by closing concerts with the War track during which the Edge and Clayton would switch instruments and the band members would leave the stage one by one as the crowd continued to sing the refrain How long to sing this song The War Tour was U s first profitable tour grossing about US million br br br The Unforgettable Fire and Live Aid br With their record deal with Island Records coming to an end U signed a more lucrative extension in They negotiated the return of the copyrights of their songs an increase in their royalty rate and a general improvement in terms at the expense of a larger initial payment br Following the overt rock of the War album and tour U feared that they were in danger of becoming another shrill sloganeering arena rock band While they were confident that fans would embrace them as successors to groups like the Who and Led Zeppelin according to Bono something just didn t feel right We felt we had more dimension than just the next big anything we had something unique to offer Thus they sought experimentation for their fourth studio album The Unforgettable Fire Clayton said We were looking for something that was a bit more serious more arty The Edge admired the ambient and weird works of Brian Eno who along with his engineer Daniel Lanois eventually agreed to produce the record The decision to hire them was against the initial wishes of Island Records founder Chris Blackwell who believed that just when the band were about to achieve the highest levels of success Eno would bury them under a layer of avant garde nonsense br br Partly recorded in Slane Castle The Unforgettable Fire was released in October and was at the time the band s most marked change in direction It was ambient and abstract and featured a rich orchestrated sound Under Lanois direction Mullen s drumming became looser funkier and more subtle and Clayton s bass became more subliminal Complementing the album s atmospheric sound the lyrics were left open to interpretation providing what the band called a very visual feel Due to a tight recording schedule Bono felt songs like Bad and Pride In the Name of Love were incomplete sketches The album reached number one in the UK and was successful in the US The lead single Pride In the Name of Love written about civil rights movement leader Martin Luther King Jr was the band s biggest hit to that point and was their first song to chart in the US top br br Much of the Unforgettable Fire Tour moved into indoor arenas as U began to win their long battle to build their audience The complex textures of the new studio recorded tracks such as The Unforgettable Fire and Bad posed a challenge in translating to live performances One solution was programming music sequencers which the band had previously been reluctant to use but now incorporate into the majority of their performances Songs on the album had been criticised as being unfinished fuzzy and unfocused but were better received by critics when played on stage Rolling Stone which was critical of the album version of Bad described its live performance as a show stopper br In March a Rolling Stone cover story called U the Band of the s saying that for a growing number of rock roll fans U has become the band that matters most maybe even the only band that matters On July the group performed at the Live Aid concert at Wembley Stadium for Ethiopian famine relief before a crowd of fans and a worldwide television audience of billion people During a minute performance of Bad Bono climbed down from the stage to embrace and dance with a female fan he had picked out of the crowd showing a global audience the personal connection that he could make with fans The performance was regarded as a pivotal event in the band s career The Guardian cited Live Aid as the moment that made stars of U and it included their performance on a list of key events in rock history br br br The Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum br br For their fifth album The Joshua Tree the band wanted to build on The Unforgettable Fire s textures but instead of out of focus experimentation they sought a harder hitting sound within the limitation of conventional song structures Realising that U had no tradition and that their knowledge of music from before their childhood was limited the group delved into American and Irish roots music Friendships with Bob Dylan Van Morrison and Keith Richards motivated Bono to explore blues folk and gospel music and to focus on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist U halted the album sessions in June to serve as a headline act on the Conspiracy of Hope benefit concert tour for Amnesty International Rather than distract the band the tour invigourated their new material The following month Bono travelled to Nicaragua and El Salvador and saw first hand the distress of peasants affected by political conflicts and US military intervention The experience became a central influence on their new music br br The Joshua Tree was released in March The album juxtaposes antipathy towards US foreign policy against the group s deep fascination with the country its open spaces freedom and ideals The band wanted music with a sense of location and a cinematic quality and the record s music and lyrics draw on imagery created by American writers whose works the band had been reading The Joshua Tree was critically acclaimed Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said the album confirms on record what this band has been slowly asserting for three years now on stage U is what the Rolling Stones ceased being years ago the greatest rock and roll band in the world The record went to number one in over countries including the UK where it received a platinum certification in hours and sold copies in its first week making it the fastest seller in British chart history at the time In the US it spent nine consecutive weeks at number one The album included the hit singles With or Without You I Still Haven t Found What I m Looking For and Where the Streets Have No Name the first two of which became the group s only number one hits in the US U became the fourth rock band to be featured on the cover of Time magazine which called them Rock s Hottest Ticket The album and its songs received four Grammy Award nominations winning for Album of the Year and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal Many publications including Rolling Stone have cited The Joshua Tree as one of rock s greatest albums The Joshua Tree Tour was the first tour on which the band played shows in stadiums alongside smaller arena shows It was the highest grossing North American tour of the year with million earned at the box office and globally it grossed US million from million attendees br In October the group released Rattle and Hum a double album and theatrically released documentary film that captured the band s experiences with American roots music on the Joshua Tree Tour The record featured nine studio tracks and six live U performances including recordings at Sun Studio in Memphis and collaborations with Dylan and B B King Intended as a tribute to American music the project received mixed reviews from both film and music critics one Rolling Stone editor spoke of the album s excitement another described it as misguided and bombastic The film s director Phil Joanou described it as an overly pretentious look at U The film underperformed at the box office and was pulled from theatres after three weeks having grossed only million Despite the criticism the album sold million copies and reached number one worldwide Lead single Desire became the band s first number one song in the UK while reaching number three in the US Most of the album s new material was played on s Lovetown Tour which only visited Australasia Japan and Europe In addition they had grown dissatisfied with their live performances Mullen recalled We were the biggest but we weren t the best With a sense of musical stagnation Bono hinted at changes to come during a December concert near the end of the tour before a hometown crowd in Dublin he said on stage that it was the end of something for U and that they had to go away and just dream it all up again br br br Achtung Baby Zoo TV and Zooropa br br Stung by the criticism of Rattle and Hum the band sought to transform themselves musically Seeking inspiration from German reunification they began work on their seventh studio album Achtung Baby at Berlin s Hansa Studios in October with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno The sessions were fraught with conflict as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material While Clayton and Mullen preferred a sound similar to U s previous work Bono and the Edge were inspired by European industrial music and electronic dance music and advocated a change Weeks of tension and slow progress nearly prompted the group to break up until they made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song One They returned to Dublin in where morale improved and the majority of the album was completed br br Achtung Baby was released in November The album represented a calculated change in musical and thematic direction for the group the shift was one of their most dramatic since The Unforgettable Fire Sonically the record incorporated influences from alternative rock dance and industrial music of the time and Bono referred to its musical departure as four men chopping down the Joshua Tree Thematically it was a more introspective and personal record it was darker yet at times more flippant than the band s previous work Commercially and critically it has been one of the band s most successful albums It produced five hit singles including The Fly Mysterious Ways and One and it was a crucial part of the band s early s reinvention In Achtung Baby won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal Like The Joshua Tree many publications have cited the record as one of rock s greatest br br Like Achtung Baby the Zoo TV Tour was an unequivocal break with the band s past In contrast to the austere stage setups of previous U tours Zoo TV was an elaborate multimedia event It satirised the pervasive nature of television and its blurring of news entertainment and home shopping by attempting to instill sensory overload in its audience The stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects random video clips from pop culture and flashing text phrases along with a lighting system partially made of Trabant automobiles Whereas U were known for their earnest performances in the s the group s Zoo TV performances were intentionally ironic and self deprecating On stage Bono performed as several over the top characters including the leather clad egomaniac The Fly the greedy televangelist Mirror Ball Man and the devilish MacPhisto Prank phone calls were made to US President George H W Bush the United Nations and others Live satellite link ups to war torn Sarajevo caused controversy Zoo TV was the highest grossing North American tour of earning US million br In June U signed a long term six album deal to remain with Island Records PolyGram The Los Angeles Times estimated that the deal was worth US million to the band making them the highest paid rock group ever The following month the group released a new album Zooropa Quickly recorded during a break in the Zoo TV Tour in early it expanded on many of the themes from Achtung Baby and the tour Initially intended to be an EP Zooropa ultimately evolved into a full length LP album It was an even greater musical departure for the group delving further into electronic industrial and dance music Country musician Johnny Cash sang the lead vocals on the closing track The Wanderer Most of the songs were played at least once during the legs of the tour which visited Europe Australia New Zealand and Japan half the album s tracks became permanent fixtures in the setlist Although the commercially successful Zooropa won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in the band regard it with mixed feelings as they felt it was more of an interlude br Clayton s issues with alcohol came to a head on the final leg of the Zoo TV Tour After experiencing a blackout Clayton was unable to perform for the group s November show in Sydney which served as the dress rehearsal for a worldwide television broadcast the following night Bass guitar technician Stuart Morgan filled in for him marking the first time a member of U had missed a concert since their earliest days After the incident Clayton resolved to quit drinking alcohol The tour concluded the following month in Japan Overall it tallied million in ticket sales and US million in gross revenues Q s Tom Doyle said in that Zoo TV was the most spectacular rock tour staged by any band br br br Passengers Pop and PopMart br In following a long break U contributed Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me Kill Me to the soundtrack album of the film Batman Forever The song was a hit reaching number one in Australia and Ireland number two in the UK and number in the US In November the band released an experimental album called Original Soundtracks a collaboration with Brian Eno who contributed as a full songwriting partner and performer Due to his participation and the record s highly experimental nature the band chose to release it under the moniker Passengers to distinguish it from U s conventional albums Mullen said of the release There s a thin line between interesting music and self indulgence We crossed it on the Passengers record It was commercially unnoticed by U standards and it received generally mixed reviews The single Miss Sarajevo featuring Luciano Pavarotti was among Bono s favourite U songs br U began work on their next studio album Pop in mid holding recording sessions with Nellee Hooper Flood and Howie B The band mixed the contrasting influences of each producer into their music in particular Howie B s experiences with electronica and dance music Mullen was sidelined due to back surgery in November prompting the other band members to take different approaches to songwriting such as programming drum loops and playing to samples provided by Howie B Upon Mullen s return in February the group began re working much of their material but struggled to complete songs causing them to miss their mid year deadline to complete the record Further complicating matters the band allowed manager Paul McGuinness to book their PopMart Tour with the album still in progress Bono called it the worst decision U ever made Rushed to complete the album the band delayed its release date a second time from the holiday season to March cutting into tour rehearsal time Even with the additional recording time U worked up to the last minute to complete songs br In February the group released Pop s lead single Discoth que a dance heavy song with a music video in which the band wore Village People costumes The song reached number one in the UK Japan and Canada but did not chart for long in the US despite debuting at number Within days of the single s release the group announced the PopMart Tour with a press conference in the lingerie section of a Kmart department store Tickets went on sale shortly after but Pop would not be released until March The album represented U s further exploration of nightclub culture featuring heavy funky dance rhythms The record drew favourable reviews Rolling Stone stated that U had defied the odds and made some of the greatest music of their lives Other critics though felt that the album was a major disappointment Despite debuting at number one in over countries Pop dropped off the charts quickly Bono admitted that the album didn t communicate the way it was intended to while the Edge called it a compromise project by the end br br The PopMart Tour commenced in April and was intended as a satire of consumerism The stage included a foot tall m golden yellow arch reminiscent of the McDonald s logo a foot tall m mirrorball lemon and a foot long m LED video screen at the time the world s largest U s big shtick failed to satisfy many who were seemingly confused by the band s new kitsch image and the tour s elaborate set The reduced rehearsal time for the tour affected the quality of early shows and in some US markets the band played to half empty stadiums On several occasions the mirrorball lemon from which the band emerged for the encores malfunctioned trapping them inside Despite the mixed reviews and difficulties of the tour Bono considered PopMart to be better than Zoo TV aesthetically and as an art project it is a clearer thought He later explained When that show worked it was mindblowing br The European leg of the tour featured two highlights The group s September show in Reggio Emilia was attended by over people which was reported to have set a world record for the largest paying audience for a one act show U also performed in Sarajevo on September making them the first major group to stage a concert there following the Bosnian War Mullen described the show as an experience I will never forget for the rest of my life and if I had to spend years in the band just to play that show and have done that I think it would have been worthwhile Bono called the show one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life The tour concluded in March with gross revenues of US million and million tickets sold The following month U appeared on the th episode of the animated sitcom The Simpsons in which Homer Simpson disrupts the band on stage during a PopMart concert In November U released their first compilation album The Best of which featured a re recording of a B side Sweetest Thing as its single The album broke a first week sales record in the US for a greatest hits collection by a group while Sweetest Thing topped the singles charts in Ireland and Canada br br br All That You Can t Leave Behind and Elevation Tour br Following the mixed success of their musical pursuits in the s U sought to simplify their sound the Edge said that with Pop the group had taken the deconstruction of the rock n roll band format to its absolute nth degree For their tenth album All That You Can t Leave Behind the group wanted to return to their old recording ethos of the band in a room playing together Reuniting with Eno and Lanois U began working on the album in late After their experiences with being pressured to complete Pop the band were content to work without deadlines With Bono s schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee and the other band members spending time with their families the recording sessions stretched through August br Released in October of that year All That You Can t Leave Behind was seen by critics as a back to basics album on which the group returned to a more mainstream conventional rock sound For many of those not won over by the band s forays into dance music it was considered a return to grace Rolling Stone called it U s third masterpiece alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby The album debuted at number one in countries and sold million copies Its lead single Beautiful Day was a worldwide hit reaching number one in Ireland the UK Australia and Canada while peaking at number in the US The song won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal Song of the Year and Record of the Year At the awards ceremony Bono declared that U were reapplying for the job of the best band in the world The album s other singles were worldwide hits as well Stuck in a Moment You Can t Get Out Of Elevation and Walk On reached number one in Canada while charting in the top five in the UK and top ten in Australia br br The band s Elevation Tour commenced in March visiting North America and Europe across three legs For the tour U performed on a scaled down stage returning to arenas after nearly a decade of stadium productions Mirroring the album s themes of emotional contact connection and communication the tour s set was designed to afford the group greater proximity to their fans a heart shaped catwalk around the stage encircled many audience members and festival seating was offered in the US for the first time in the group s history During the tour U headlined a pair of Slane Concerts in Ireland playing to crowds of Following the September attacks in the US All That You Can t Leave Behind found added resonance with American audiences as the album climbed in the charts and songs such as Walk On and Peace on Earth garnered radio airplay In October U performed at Madison Square Garden in New York City for the first time since the attacks Bono and the Edge said these shows were among their most memorable and emotional performances The Elevation Tour was the top earning North American tour of with a gross of US million the second highest amount ever at the time for a North American tour Globally it grossed US million from million tickets sold making it the year s highest grossing tour overall Spin named U the Band of the Year for saying they had schooled bands half their age about what a rock show could really accomplish br On February U performed during the Super Bowl XXXVI halftime show In a tribute to those who died in the September attacks the victims names were projected onto a backdrop and at the end Bono opened his jacket to reveal an American flag in the lining Sports Illustrated Rolling Stone and USA Today ranked the band s performance as the best halftime show in Super Bowl history Later that month U received four additional Grammy Awards All That You Can t Leave Behind won Best Rock Album while Walk On was named Record of the Year marking the first time an artist had won the latter award in consecutive years for songs from the same album In November the band released their second compilation The Best of which featured several remixed s songs and two new tracks including the single Electrical Storm br br br How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and Vertigo Tour br Looking for a harder hitting rock sound than that of All That You Can t Leave Behind U began recording their eleventh studio album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb in February with producer Chris Thomas After nine months of work the band had an album s worth of material ready for release but they were not satisfied with the results Mullen said that the songs had no magic The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January Lillywhite along with his assistant Jacknife Lee spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances Several other producers received credits on the album including Lanois Eno Flood Carl Glanville and Nellee Hooper Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record s sonic cohesion br br Released in November How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received favourable reviews from critics The album featured lyrics touching on life death love war faith and family It reached number one in countries including the US where first week sales of copies nearly doubled those of All That You Can t Leave Behind setting a personal best for the band Overall it sold million copies globally For the album s release U partnered with Apple for several cross promotions the first single Vertigo was featured in a television advertisement for the company s iPod music player while a U branded iPod and digital box set exclusive to the iTunes Store were released Vertigo was an international hit topping the charts in Ireland and the UK while reaching number two in Canada and number five in Australia The song won three Grammy Awards including one for Best Rock Song Other singles from the album were also hits Sometimes You Can t Make It on Your Own written as a tribute to Bono s late father went to number one in the UK and Canada while City of Blinding Lights reached number two in both regions In March U were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen in their first year of eligibility During his speech Springsteen said the band had beaten the odds by continuing to do their finest work and remaining at the top of their game and the charts for years br br U s Vertigo Tour was preceded by several complications A sudden illness afflicting the Edge s daughter nearly resulted in the tour s cancellation before the group decided to adjust the tour schedule to accommodate her treatment Additionally ticket presales on the band s website were plagued with issues as subscribing members encountered technical glitches and limited ticket availability partially due to scalpers exploiting the system Commencing in March the Vertigo Tour consisted of arena shows in North America and stadium shows internationally across five legs The indoor stage replaced the heart shaped ramp of the Elevation Tour with an elliptical one and featured retractable video curtains around the stage while the stadium stage used a massive LED video screen Setlists on tour varied more than in the group s past and included songs they had not played in decades Like its predecessor the Vertigo Tour was a commercial success ranking as the top earning tour of with US million grossed br br In February U received five additional Grammy Awards including Song of the Year for Sometimes You Can t Make It on Your Own and Best Rock Album and Album of the Year for How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb the awards made the album and its singles winners in all eight categories in which U were nominated spanning two separate Grammy ceremonies The group resumed the Vertigo Tour that month with a Latin American leg on which several shows were filmed for the concert film U D It was released in theatres nearly two years later and was the world s first live action digital D film In March the band postponed the tour s remaining shows until the end of the year due to the health of the Edge s daughter On September U and Green Day performed at the Louisiana Superdome prior to an NFL football game the New Orleans Saints first home game in the city since Hurricane Katrina The two bands covered the Skids song The Saints Are Coming during the performance and for a benefit single which reached number one in Australia and throughout Europe U issued an official autobiography U by U that month followed in November by their third compilation album U Singles The Vertigo Tour concluded in December having sold million tickets and having earned US million the second highest gross ever at the time br In August the band incorporated its publishing business in the Netherlands following the capping of Irish artists tax exemption at The Edge stated that businesses often seek to minimise their tax burdens The move was criticised in the Irish parliament The band defended themselves saying approximately of their business took place outside Ireland that they were taxed globally because of this and that they were all personal investors and employers in the country Bono later said I think U s tax business is our own business and I think it is not just to the letter of the law but to the spirit of the law br br br No Line on the Horizon and U Tour br Recording for U s twelfth album No Line on the Horizon began with producer Rick Rubin in but the sessions were short lived and the material was shelved In May the group began new sessions with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois in Fez Morocco involving the producers as full songwriting partners Intending to write future hymns songs that would be played forever the group spent two weeks recording in a riad and exploring local music The Edge called it a very freeing experience that reminded him in many ways of early on and why they got into a band in the first place Just that joy of playing As recording on the album continued in New York London and Dublin the band scaled back their experimental pursuits which Eno said sounded kind of synthetic and were not easily married with the group s sound br No Line on the Horizon was released in February more than four years after How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb marking the longest gap between albums of the band s career to that point It received generally positive reviews including their first five star Rolling Stone review but critics found it was not as experimental as originally billed The album debuted at number one in over countries but its sales of million were seen as a disappointment by U standards and it did not contain a hit single Following the album s release the band discussed tentative plans for a follow up record entitled Songs of Ascent Bono described the project as a more meditative album on the theme of pilgrimage br br The group embarked on the U Tour in June It was their first live venture for Live Nation under a year US million million contract signed the year prior As part of the deal the company assumed control over U s touring merchandising and official website The Tour concerts featured the band playing stadiums in the round on a circular stage allowing the audience to surround them on all sides To accommodate the stage configuration a large four legged structure nicknamed The Claw was built above the stage with the sound system and a cylindrical expanding video screen on top of it At feet m tall it was the largest stage ever constructed The tour visited Europe and North America in On October U set a new US record for single concert attendance for one headline act performing to people at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena In May while rehearsing for the next leg of the tour Bono suffered a herniated disk and severe compression of the sciatic nerve requiring emergency back surgery The band were forced to postpone the North American leg of the tour and a headlining performance at the Glastonbury Festival until the following year After Bono s recovery U resumed the Tour in August with legs in Europe Australia and New Zealand during which they began to play new unreleased songs live By its conclusion in July U had set records for the highest grossing concert tour US million and most tickets sold for a tour million br br br Songs of Innocence and Innocence Experience Tour br br Throughout the Tour the band worked on multiple projects including a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse a dance record produced by RedOne and will i am and Songs of Ascent However the latter was not completed to their satisfaction and by December Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U s next album and they worked with him until May before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth Ryan Tedder Declan Gaffney and Flood The band suspended work on the album late in to contribute a new song Ordinary Love to the film Mandela Long Walk to Freedom The track written in honour of Nelson Mandela won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song In November U s long time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm Principle Management McGuinness who had managed the group for over years was succeeded by Guy Oseary In February another new U song the single Invisible debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS Bono called the track a sneak preview of their pending record br On September U appeared at an Apple product launch event to make a surprise announcement of their thirteenth studio album Songs of Innocence They released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost making it available to over million people in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called the largest album release of all time Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U a lump sum for a five week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US million on a promotional campaign Songs of Innocence recalls the group members youth in Ireland touching on childhood experiences loves and losses while paying tribute to their musical inspirations Bono described it as the most personal album we ve written The record received mixed reviews and drew criticism for its digital release strategy it was automatically added to users iTunes accounts which for many triggered an unprompted download to their electronic devices Chris Richards of The Washington Post called the release rock and roll as dystopian junk mail The group s press tour for the album was interrupted after Bono was seriously injured in a bicycle accident in Central Park on November He suffered fractures of his shoulder blade humerus orbit and pinky finger leading to uncertainty that he would ever be able to play guitar again br br Following Bono s recuperation U embarked on the Innocence Experience Tour in May visiting arenas in North America and Europe from May through December The group structured their concerts around a loose autobiographical narrative of innocence passing into experience with a fixed set of songs for the first half of each show and a varying second half separated by an intermission a first for U concerts The stage spanned the length of the venue floor and comprised three sections a rectangular main stage a smaller circular B stage and a connecting walkway The centerpiece of the set was a foot long m double sided video screen that featured an interior catwalk allowing the band members to perform amidst the video projections U s sound system was moved to the venue ceilings and arranged in an oval array in hopes of improving acoustics by evenly distributing sound throughout the arena In total the tour grossed US million from million tickets sold The final date of the tour one of two Paris shows rescheduled due to the November attacks in the city was filmed for the video Innocence Experience Live in Paris and broadcast on the American television network HBO br br br The Joshua Tree anniversary tours and Songs of Experience br In U worked on their next studio album Songs of Experience which was intended to be a companion piece to Songs of Innocence The group had mostly completed the album by year s end and planned to release it in the fourth quarter but after the shift of global politics in a conservative direction highlighted by the UK s Brexit referendum and the US presidential election they chose to put the record on hold and reassess its tone The group spent the extra time rewriting lyrics rearranging and remixing songs and pursuing different production styles Further impacting the lyrical direction of the album was a brush with mortality that Bono experienced in December he underwent open heart surgery due to an aortic aneurysm that formed over time as a result of having a bicuspid aortic valve br br U toured in to commemorate the th anniversary of The Joshua Tree with each show featuring a performance of the entire album It was the first time the group toured in promotion of an album from their back catalogue rather than a new release The Edge cited the same world events that caused the group to delay Songs of Experience for what he judged to be renewed resonance of The Joshua Tree s subject matter and a reason to revisit it The tour s stage featured a K video screen measuring ft ft m m that was according to The Guardian the largest and highest resolution screen used on a concert tour The tour included a headlining appearance at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in June The tour grossed more than million from over million tickets sold making it the highest grossing tour of the year br Songs of Experience was released on December Lyrically the album reflects the political and personal apocalypse that Bono felt had occurred in his life in The first single You re the Best Thing About Me is one of several songs from the record for which Bono wrote the lyrics as letters addressed to people and places closest to his heart Songs of Experience received generally mixed reviews from critics though it was the sixth best selling album globally in with million copies sold br br In May the band embarked on the Experience Innocence Tour which consisted of arena shows across North America and Europe br It was a sequel to their Innocence Experience Tour reprising its loose narrative and the multifaceted stage comprising a rectangular main stage circular B stage connecting walkway and doubled sided LED video screen with an interior walkway Several enhancements were made to the set such as a higher resolution and more transparent video screen and the addition of LED panels to the B stage floor The band incorporated augmented reality into the shows releasing a mobile app for concertgoers to use and reviving Bono s demonic stage character MacPhisto from the Zoo TV Tour with the help of a camera filter The tour concluded in Berlin in November with total revenues of million from tickets sold according to Billboard br U s Joshua Tree anniversary concert tour visited Oceania and Asia in marking the band s first performances in Australia and New Zealand since the Tour in and their first ever performances in South Korea Singapore India and the Philippines The band released the single Ahimsa with Indian musician A R Rahman to promote their December concert in India The group s shows grossed million and sold tickets bringing the cumulative totals for their Joshua Tree anniversary tours to million grossed and million tickets sold br br br Songs of Surrender and concert residency at Sphere current br Over a two year period during lockdowns for the COVID pandemic the group worked on Songs of Surrender an album of re recorded and reinterpreted versions of songs from their back catalogue Largely the effort of the Edge and Bono the album was recorded with collaborators that included Bob Ezrin Duncan Stewart Declan Gaffney and Stjepan Hauser The reimagined songs feature stripped down and acoustic arrangements in different keys and tempos and often with re written lyrics The project was conceived as a companion to Bono s memoir Surrender Songs One Story br In October several media outlets reported that U were in discussions to sign with Irving Azoff and his son Jeffrey of Full Stop Management following the end of Guy Oseary s nine year tenure as the band s manager br After releasing his memoir in November Bono embarked on a book tour that month called Stories of Surrender initially consisting of dates across North America and Europe During the shows Bono performed U songs in stripped down arrangements mirroring those from Songs of Surrender The record was released in March to mixed reviews It was the group s first number one album in the UK since but sales quickly tapered off it charted in the UK for three weeks and in the US for one week after reaching number five The album s release coincided with a television documentary film Bono The Edge A Sort of Homecoming With Dave Letterman that premiered on Disney In April Bono resumed his Stories of Surrender book tour with an show residency at the Beacon Theatre in New York City br br From September to March U staged a date concert residency called U UV Achtung Baby Live to inaugurate Sphere in the Las Vegas Valley The residency was announced during a Super Bowl LVII television advertisement Performances were focused on the group s album Achtung Baby and leveraged the venue s immersive video and sound capabilities which include a K resolution wraparound interior LED screen and speakers with beamforming and wave field synthesis technologies Mullen did not participate in the concerts in order to recuperate from surgery marking the first time since that U performed without him Dutch drummer Bram van den Berg from the band Krezip filled in Coinciding with the beginning of the residency the group released the Las Vegas inspired single Atomic City U UV Achtung Baby Live grossed million from tickets sold making it the fourth highest grossing concert residency of all time br br br Musical style br Bono s songwriting exhibits a penchant for social political and personal subject matter while maintaining a grandiosity In addition the Edge has described U as a fundamentally live band U s early sound was punk influenced alternative rock and the group were associated with the post punk movement Their influences included acts such as Television Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division and their resulting sound was described as containing a sense of exhilaration that resulted from the Edge s radiant chords and Bono s ardent vocals However according to Bob Stanley U rejected post punk s own rejection of pop as lingua franca its hunkering down in regional particularity and its raised finger to populist communication U developed a melodic sound under the early influence of record producer Steve Lillywhite at a time when they were not known for musical proficiency Their songs began as minimalistic and uncomplicated instrumentals heard on Boy and October before evolving with War to include aspects of rock anthem funk and dance rhythms to become more versatile and aggressive Boy and War were labelled muscular and assertive by Rolling Stone influenced in large part by Lillywhite s producing The Unforgettable Fire which began with the Edge playing more keyboards than guitars as well as follow up The Joshua Tree had Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois at the production helm With their influence both albums achieved a diverse texture The songs from The Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum placed more emphasis on Lanois inspired rhythm as they mixed distinct and varied styles of gospel and blues music which stemmed from the band s burgeoning fascination with America s culture people and places br In the s U reinvented themselves as they began using synthesisers distortion and electronic beats derived from noise music dance and hip hop on Achtung Baby Zooropa and Pop According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine U was able to sustain their popularity in the s by reinventing themselves as a post modern self consciously ironic dance inflected pop rock act owing equally to the experimentalism of late s Bowie and s electronic dance and techno They have also been called a pop rock band by biographer Michael Heatley and musicologist Gerry Smyth The band s s output has been regarded as an art rock phase in commentaries by biographer John Jobling Salon journalist Nico Lang and music critic Jim DeRogatis as well as in an interview by Bono Time magazine s Josh Tyrangiel went further in saying that In the towering period that spanned The Joshua Tree to Zooropa U made stadium size art rock with huge melodies that allowed Bono to throw his arms around the world while bending its ear about social justice br In the s U returned to more stripped down rock and pop sounds with more conventional rhythms and reduced usage of synthesisers and effects reinvent ing themselves as a quality pop band according to music journalist Chris Charlesworth U s music has been regarded as pop in analyses by writers David Hawke Robert Christgau and Niall Stokes In an interview with Stokes for Hot Press Bono explained the band s struggles in the s among high brow circles who patronized them for being a successful pop group leading to their embrace of the term pop by the s Reviewing their album All That You Can t Leave Behind Christgau remarked that since they d been calling themselves pop for half of their two decade run maybe they d better sit down and write some catchy songs So they did Summing up U s stylistic evolution since Boy Guitar journalist Owen Bailey said that they have gone on to conquer the world s airwaves and arenas in a number of different incarnations ranging from earnest politically charged new wave flagbearers to wide eyed art rock musicologists to purveyors of irony laden alt rock and ever onward with the Edge remaining at the heart of their sound br br br Vocals br br Bono is known for his impassioned vocal style often delivered in a high register through open throated belting Bono has been classified as a tenor and according to him has a three octave vocal range one analysis found it to span from C to G on studio recordings over the course of his career He frequently employs whoa oh oh vocalisations in his singing Rock musician Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day said He s a physical singer like the leader of a gospel choir and he gets lost in the melodic moment He goes to a place outside himself especially in front of an audience when he hits those high notes He added that Bono is not afraid to go beyond what he s capable of br In the early days of U Bono unintentionally developed an English vocal accent as a result of him mimicking his musical influences such as Siouxsie and the Banshees He said that he found his own singing voice after attending a Ramones concert and hearing Joey Ramone sing Bono s vocal style evolved during the band s exploration of roots music for The Joshua Tree Spin said that he learned to command the full whisper to shout range of blues mannerisms Bono attributed this maturation to loosening up discover ing other voices and employing more restraint in his singing For Where the Streets Have No Name he varied the timbre of his voice extensively and used rubato to vary its timing while author Susan Fast found With or Without You to be the first track on which he extended his vocal range downward in an appreciable way br Bono continued to explore a lower range in the s using what Fast described as breathy and subdued colors for Achtung Baby One technique used on the album is octave doubling in which his vocals are sung in two different octaves either simultaneously or alternating between verses and choruses According to Fast this technique introduces a contrasting lyrical idea and vocal character to deliver it leading to both literal and ironic interpretations of Bono s vocals On tracks such as Zoo Station and The Fly his vocals were highly processed giving them a different emotional feel from his previous work Bono said that lowering his voice helped him find a new vocal vocabulary which he felt was limited to certain words and tones by his tenor voice His singing on Zooropa was an even further departure from U s previous style throughout the record Bono underplay ed his lung power according to Jon Pareles and he also used an operatic falsetto he calls the Fat Lady voice on the tracks Lemon and Numb As he has aged Bono has continued to evolve his singing relying more on the croon than the belt according to Rolling Stone s Joe Gross br br br Guitar br br The Edge s style of playing guitar is distinguished by his chiming timbres echoing notes sparse voicings and extensive use of effects units He favours the perfect fifth interval and often plays chords consisting of just two notes the fifth and the root note while eliminating the third This style is not explicitly in a minor or major key but implies both creating a musical ambiguity For these chords he often plays the same notes on multiple strings some of which are left open creating an Irish influenced drone Against this drone he changes other notes to imply a harmony Among the Edge s signature techniques are playing arpeggios sixteenth note percussive strumming and harmonics the latter of which he described as so pure and finely focused that they have the incredible ability to pierce through their environment of sound just like lightning His approach to guitar playing is relatively understated and eschews virtuosity in favour of atmospherics subtlety minimalism and clever signal processing Rather than emulate common playing styles the Edge is interested in tearing up the rule book and finding new ways to approach the instrument He cited guitarists such as Tom Verlaine of Television John McGeoch Rory Gallagher and Patti Smith as some of his strongest influences br The Edge s guitar sound is frequently modulated with a delay set to a dotted eighth note for rhythmic effect After acquiring his first delay pedal the Electro Harmonix Memory Man he became fascinated with how to use its return echo to fill in notes that he s not playing like two guitar players rather than one The effect unit became a mainstay in his guitar rig and had a significant impact on the band s creative output The Edge became known for his extensive use of effects units and for his meticulous nature in crafting specific sounds and guitar tones from his equipment choices Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page called him a sonic architect while Neil McCormick described him as an effects maestro Critics have variously referred to the Edge s guitar sounds as evoking the image of fighter planes on Bullet the Blue Sky resembling a dentist s drill on Love Is Blindness and resembling an airplane turbine on Mofo The Edge said that rather than using effects merely to modify his sound he uses them to spark ideas during his songwriting process br The Edge developed his playing style during his teenage years partially as a result of him and Mullen trying to accommodate the eccentric bass playing of Clayton by being the timekeepers of the band In their early days the Edge s only guitar was his Gibson Explorer Limited Edition which became a signature of the group However he found the sound of the Explorer s bass strings unsatisfactory and avoided them in his playing early on resulting in a trebly sound He said by focusing on one area of the fretboard he was developing a very stylized way of doing something that someone else would play in a normal way Other equipment choices contribute to the Edge s unique sound His Vox AC Top Boost amplifier housed in a s cabinet is favoured for its sparkle tone and is the basis for his sound both in the studio and live Rather than hold his plectrum with a standard grip the Edge turns it sideways or upside down to use the dimpled edge against the strings producing a rasping top end to his tone br br br Rhythm section br As a rhythm section Mullen and Clayton often play the same patterns giving U s music a driving pulsating beat that serves as a foundation for the Edge s guitar work For his drumming Mullen locks into the Edge s guitar playing while Clayton locks his bass playing into Mullen s drumming Author Bill Flanagan said that their playing styles perfectly reflected their personalities Larry is right on top of the beat a bit ahead as you d expect from a man who s so ordered and punctual in his life Adam plays a little behind the beat waiting till the last moment to slip in which fits Adam s casual don t sweat it personality br br Mullen s drumming style is influenced by his experience in marching bands during his adolescence which helped contribute to the militaristic beats of songs such as Sunday Bloody Sunday Flanagan said that he plays with a martial rigidity but uses his kit in a way a properly trained drummer would not he tends to transition from the snare drum onto tom toms positioned on either side of him contrasting with how they are traditionally used Mullen occasionally rides a tom tom the way other drummers would play a cymbal or rides the hi hat how others would play a snare He admitted his bass drum technique is not a strength as he mostly played the snare in marching bands and did not learn to properly combine the separate drumming elements together on a full kit As a result he uses a floor tom to his left to create the effect of a bass drum He said I couldn t do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song so I chose alternatives He was heavily influenced by glam rock acts of the s when first learning to play drums In the early days of U Mullen had what Bono called a florid drumming style before he eventually adopted a philosophy of simplicity and pared down his rhythms His drumming leaves open space owing to what Modern Drummer described as his understanding of when to hit and when not to hit As he matured as a timekeeper he developed a preternatural sense of rhythm Eno recounted one occasion when Mullen noticed that his click track had been set incorrectly by just six milliseconds Under the tutelage of Lanois Mullen learned more about his musical role as the drummer in filling out the band s sound while Flood helped Mullen learn to play along with electronic elements such as drum machines and samples His kit has a tambourine mounted on a cymbal stand which he uses as an accent on certain beats for songs such as With or Without You br br Clayton s style of bass guitar playing is noted for what instructor Patrick Pfeiffer called harmonic syncopation With this technique Clayton plays a consistent rhythm that stresses the eighth note of each bar but he anticipates the harmony by shifting the tonality before the guitar chords do This gives the music a feeling of forward motion In the band s early years Clayton had no formal musical training and he generally played simple bass parts in time consisting of steady eighth notes emphasising the roots of chords Over time he incorporated influences from Motown and reggae into his playing style and as he became a better timekeeper his playing became more melodic Flanagan said that he often plays with the swollen vibrating bottom sound of a Jamaican dub bassist covering the most sonic space with the smallest number of notes Clayton relies on his own instincts when developing basslines deciding whether to follow the chord progressions of the guitars or play a counter melody and when to play an octave higher or lower He cites bassists such as Paul Simonon Bruce Foxton Peter Hook Jean Jacques Burnel and James Jamerson as major influences on him Describing his role in the rhythm section Clayton said Larry s drums have always told me what to play and then the chords tell me where to go br br br Lyrics and themes br br U s lyrics are known for their social and political themes and are often embellished with Christian and spiritual imagery Songs such as Sunday Bloody Sunday Silver and Gold and Mothers of the Disappeared were motivated by current events of the time The first was written about the Troubles in Northern Ireland while the last was a tribute to COMADRES the women whose children were killed or forcibly disappeared at the hands of the Salvadoran government during the country s civil war The song Running to Stand Still from The Joshua Tree was inspired by the heroin addiction that was sweeping through Dublin the lyric I see seven towers but I only see one way out references the Ballymun Towers of Dublin s Northside and the imagery throughout the song personifies the struggles of addiction br Bono s personal conflicts and turmoil inspired songs like Mofo Tomorrow and Kite An emotional yearning or pleading frequently appears as a lyrical theme in tracks such as Yahweh Peace on Earth and Please Much of U s songwriting and music is also motivated by contemplations of loss and anguish coupled with hopefulness and resilience themes that are central to The Joshua Tree Some of these lyrical ideas have been amplified by Bono and the band s personal experiences during their youth in Ireland as well as Bono s campaigning and activism later in his life U have used tours such as Zoo TV and PopMart to caricature social trends such as media overload and consumerism respectively br While the band and its fans often affirm the political nature of their songs U s lyrics and music were criticised as apolitical by Slate in for their perceived vagueness and fuzzy imagery and a lack of any specific references to people br br br Influences br The band cites the Who the Clash Television Ramones the Beatles Joy Division Siouxsie and the Banshees Elvis Presley Patti Smith and Kraftwerk as influences In addition Van Morrison has been cited by Bono as an influence and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame mentioned his influence on U U have also worked with or had influential relationships with artists including Johnny Cash Green Day Leonard Cohen Bruce Springsteen B B King Lou Reed Bob Dylan and Luciano Pavarotti Bono said that David Bowie helped him discover the works of Bertolt Brecht William Burroughs Springsteen and Brian Eno Fellow Irish rock band The Script have also been influenced by U br br br Activism and philanthropy br br Since the early s the members of U

participated in Band Aid to raise money for the famine in Ethiopia This initiative produced the hit charity single Do They Know It s Christmas which would be the first of several collaborations between U and Bob Geldof In July U performed at Live Aid a follow up to Band Aid s efforts Bono and his wife Ali invited by World Vision visited Ethiopia that year where they witnessed the famine first hand Bono later said that this laid the groundwork for his Africa campaigning and some of his songwriting In U participated in the Self Aid benefit concert for unemployment in Ireland and the Conspiracy of Hope benefit concert tour in support of Amnesty International The same year Bono and Ali also visited Nicaragua and El Salvador at the invitation of the Sanctuary movement and saw the effects of the Salvadoran Civil War These events greatly influenced The Joshua Tree album which was being recorded at the time br During their Zoo TV Tour in U participated in the Stop Sellafield concert with Greenpeace to protest a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant Events in Sarajevo during the Bosnian War inspired their song with Brian Eno called Miss Sarajevo which they debuted at a September Pavarotti Friends concert to benefit the War Child charity U fulfilled a promise to play in Sarajevo during the PopMart Tour in In May they performed in Belfast to promote Northern Ireland s referendum over the Good Friday Agreement which would end the violence of the Troubles During the show Bono brought Northern Irish political leaders David Trimble and John Hume on stage to shake hands the referendum ultimately was passed Later that year all proceeds from the release of the Sweetest Thing single went towards supporting the Chernobyl Children s Project br br The band dedicated their song Walk On to Burma s pro democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi who had been under house arrest since In late Bono and the Edge participated in the South Africa HIV AIDS awareness series of concerts hosted by Nelson Mandela In the band played the Live concert in London which Geldof helped stage on the th anniversary of Live Aid to support the Make Poverty History campaign The band and manager Paul McGuinness were awarded Amnesty International s Ambassador of Conscience Award for their work in promoting human rights br Since Bono s campaigning has included Jubilee with Geldof Muhammad Ali and others to promote the cancellation of third world debt during the Great Jubilee In January Bono co founded the multinational NGO DATA with the aim of improving the social political and financial state of Africa He continued his campaigns for debt and HIV AIDS relief into June by making high profile visits to Africa Product Red a for profit licensed brand seeking to raise money for the Global Fund was co founded by Bono in The ONE Campaign originally the US counterpart of Make Poverty History was shaped by his efforts and vision br In November the Edge and producer Bob Ezrin helped introduce Music Rising an initiative to replace instruments for musicians in the New Orleans area impacted by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita In U collaborated with pop punk band Green Day to record a remake of the song The Saints Are Coming by the Skids to benefit Music Rising A live version of the song recorded at the Louisiana Superdome was released on the single br In Music Generation a music education programme for children was established from funds provided by U and the Ireland Funds The band initially gave million for the programme s creation followed by donations of million in and some of their earnings from their Joshua Tree Tour As of children had received tuition from the programme br At the rd iHeartRadio Music Awards in April U were honored with the Innovator Award for their impact on popular culture and commitment to social causes In April the group donated million to purchase personal protective equipment for Irish healthcare workers working during the COVID pandemic The band also donated US million to ease the impact of the pandemic on the music industry including a donation to the Songs from an Empty Room fundraiser br Bono has received a number of awards for his music and activism including the Legion of Honour from the French Government in Time s Person of the Year for along with Bill Gates and Melinda Gates and an honorary British knighthood
