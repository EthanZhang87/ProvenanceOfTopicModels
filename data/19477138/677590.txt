their manufacturing outside of the United States for the first time br In Litchfield found land in the Phoenix area suitable for growing long staple cotton which was needed to reinforce its rubber in tires The acres purchased were controlled by the Southwest Cotton Company formed with Litchfield as president This included land that would develop into the towns of Goodyear and Litchfield Park br In Litchfield forged a joint venture with the German Luftschiffbau Zeppelin Company to form the Goodyear Zeppelin Corporation From the late s to the company worked with Goodyear to build two Zeppelins in the United States The partnership continued even when Zeppelin was under Nazi control and only ended after World War II began br br br Expansion br br On August Goodyear had its initial public offering and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange br By Goodyear had pioneered what would later become known as tundra tires for smaller aircraft their so called low inflation pressure airwheel aviation wheel rim tire sets were initially available in sizes up to inches cm in diameter br Over the next few decades Goodyear grew to become a multinational corporation It acquired their rival Kelly Springfield Tire in During World War II Goodyear manufactured F U Corsair fighter planes for the U S Military Goodyear ranked th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts WWII forced the dissolution of the Goodyear Zeppelin partnership in December By they owned and operated a nuclear processing plant in Ohio br In Goodyear created a subsidiary in Mexico in a joint venture with Compa a Hulera S A de C V Compa a Hulera Goodyear Oxo S A de C V or Goodyear Oxo br br br Radial tire transition br Goodyear is the only one of the five biggest tire firms among US tire manufacturers in to remain independent into the st century Goodyear s success was partly due to the challenge posed by radial tire technology and the varied responses At the time the entire US tire industry produced the older bias ply technology Estimates to fit factories with new machinery and tools for making the new product were between million and million This was a substantial amount in a low margin business with sales revenue in the low billions The US market was slowly shifting towards the radial tire as had already been the case in Europe and Asia In Consumer Reports an influential American magazine acknowledged the superiority of radial construction which had been developed in by Michelin br When Charles J Pilliod Jr became CEO in he faced a major investment decision regarding the radial tire which today has a market share of nearly Despite heavy criticism at the time Pilliod invested heavily in new factories and tooling to build the radial tire Sam Gibara who headed Goodyear from to has noted that without the action of Pilliod Goodyear wouldn t be around today br Sales for topped billion Five years later sales topped billion and Goodyear operated in countries In the original Akron plant was converted into a Technical Center for research and design By worldwide sales exceeded billion br Goodyear Aerospace a holding that developed from the Goodyear Aircraft Company after World War II designed a supercomputer for NASA s Goddard Spaceflight Center in the MPP The subsidiary was sold in to the Loral Corporation as a result of restructuring br In Goodyear formed a business partnership with Canadian tire retailer Fountain Tire br br br Diversification and Goldsmith affair br In the s incoming Goodyear CEO Robert E Mercer argued that the tire and automobile related businesses that formed the core of Goodyear to that date were slow growing and a handicap He set a strategy to get away from the cyclical nature of the automobile business through mergers or purchase of businesses unrelated to tires or vehicles br In Goodyear acquired the natural gas company Celeron Corporation in exchange for stock valued at more than million It went on to invest heavily in gas exploration including the mile crude oil All American pipeline from California to Texas The project was initially estimated to cost million but ultimately cost almost billion br In October British financier James Goldsmith in conjunction with the investment group Hanson purchased of Goodyear s outstanding common stock This was viewed as a greenmail attack by some and as shareholder activism by Goldsmith who viewed the company s move into areas far removed from tire development production and sale as commercially ill advised and wanted the company to divest especially its oil interests which he viewed as depressing the value of the company br On November Goodyear acquired all of the stock held by Goldsmith s group shares at an above market price of per share Goodyear also made a tender offer for up to million shares of its stock from other shareholders at per share The tender offer resulted in Goodyear buying shares of stock in February br As a result of the stock buyback Goodyear took a charge of million associated with a massive restructuring plan It sold its Goodyear Aerospace business to Loral Corporation for million and its motor wheel business to Lemmerz Inc for million Two subsidiaries involved in agricultural products real estate development and a resort hotel in Arizona were sold for million The company also sold the Celeron gas and oil corporation In the All American Pipeline Celeron Gathering and Celeron Trading and Transportation were sold largely completing what Goldsmith s hostile takeover had suggested good management should do In the years following the company invested in its tire business President Tom Barrett succeeded Chairman Robert Mercer in and began a process of modernizing and expanding Goodyear plants in cities like Lawton Oklahoma Napanee Canada Point Pleasant West Virginia and Scottsboro Alabama In the s the move of business into low wage countries facilitated by GATT which Goldsmith had warned government against calling it a policy to impoverish resulted in plants across North America being shuttered for instance Cumberland Maryland New Toronto Ontario Canada and Windsor Vermont were closed br br br to present br br The last major restructuring of the company took place in Goodyear hired Stanley Gault former CEO of Rubbermaid to expand the company into new markets The moves resulted in employees being laid off br In Titan Tire purchased the farm tire business of Goodyear and manufactures Goodyear agricultural tires under license This acquisition

globally by the end of the third quarter of that year br Goodyear announced plans to sell the assets of its Latin American off road tire business to Titan Tire for million including the plant in Sao Paulo Brazil and a licensing agreement that allows Titan to continue manufacturing under the Goodyear brand This deal is similar to Titan s purchase of Goodyear s US farm tire assets br In more than

Indonesia has a fabulous potential wealth in natural resources and the New Order the fascist regime headed by pro U S General Suharto wants it exploited So they are returning the private properties expropriated by Sukarno s regime Goodyear s Sumatran rubber empire is an example It was seized by the rubber workers in retaliation for U S aggression in Vietnam in The rubber workers union was Communist run so after the coup many of them were killed or imprisoned Some of the survivors you see them here still work the rubber but this time as prisoners and at gunpoint br br br Pay discrimination lawsuits br br United States Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated br br Lilly Ledbetter was a supervisor at Goodyear Tire and Rubber s plant in Gadsden Alabama from until her retirement in For most of those years she worked as an area manager a position largely occupied by men Initially Ledbetter s salary was in line with the salaries of men performing substantially similar work Over time however her pay slipped in comparison to the pay of male area managers with equal or less seniority By the end of Ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager and the pay discrepancy between Ledbetter and her male counterparts was stark Ledbetter was paid per month the lowest paid male area manager received per month the highest paid br Lilly Ledbetter sued Goodyear claiming she was paid less than men doing the same work She won the suit and was awarded the jury deciding that Goodyear had clearly engaged in discrimination The case was appealed to the Supreme Court In Ledbetter v Goodyear Tire Rubber Co U S Justice Alito held for the five justice majority that employers are protected from lawsuits over race or gender pay discrimination if the claims are based on decisions made by the employer days ago or more The United States Congress overturned this decision by passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of which was the first bill signed into law by President Obama br This was a case of statutory rather than constitutional interpretation The plaintiff in this case Lilly Ledbetter characterized her situation as one where disparate pay is received during the statutory limitations period but is the result of intentionally discriminatory pay decisions that occurred outside the limitations period In rejecting Ledbetter s appeal the Supreme Court said that she could have and should have sued when the pay decisions were made instead of waiting beyond the day statutory charging period br Justice Ginsburg dissented from the opinion of the Court joined by Justices Stevens Souter and Breyer She argued against applying the day limit to pay discrimination because discrimination often occurs in small increments over large periods of time Furthermore the pay information of fellow workers is typically confidential and unavailable for comparison Ginsburg argued that pay discrimination is inherently different from adverse actions such as termination Adverse actions are obvious but small pay discrepancy is often difficult to recognize until more than days of the pay change Ginsburg argued that the broad remedial purpose of the statute was incompatible with the Court s cramped interpretation Her dissent asserted that the employer had been Knowingly carrying past pay discrimination forward during the day charging period and therefore could be held liable br br br Environmental record br Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Goodyear as the th largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States with roughly million lbs of toxins released into the air annually Major pollutants included sulfuric acid cobalt compounds and chlorine The Center for Public Integrity reports that Goodyear has been named as a potentially responsible party in at least of the nation s Superfund toxic waste sites br On February Goodyear announced the launch of an environmentally friendly tire produced using a cornstarch based material The Goodyear Eagle LS partially replaces the traditional carbon black and silica with filler materials derived from corn starch thanks to BioTRED compounding technology The new technology increases the tires flexibility and resistance to energy loss which extend the tires life span and lessen the impact on the environment Similarly Goodyear announced on April that it had joined the U S Environmental Protection Agency s SmartWay Transport Partnership The transport partnership is an attempt between the truck transportation industry and the EPA to reduce air pollution and greenhouse emissions as well as increase energy efficiency The SmartWay partnership s tractors and trailers will use Goodyear s Fuel Max linehaul tires that increase fuel efficiency while reducing emissions According to Goodyear and EPA officials the fuel efficient line haul tires deliver up to improved truck fuel economy and when used with other SmartWay qualified components each wheel tractor and trailer used in long haul can produce savings of up to gallons per year or more than annually br br br Foreign Corrupt Practices Act charges br On February Goodyear agreed to pay more than million to settle Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA charges that two of its African subsidiaries allegedly paid million in bribes that generated in illicit profits The U S Securities and Exchange Commission SEC FCPA charges involved Goodyear subsidiaries in Kenya and Angola for allegedly paying bribes to government and private sector workers in exchange for sales in each country According to the SEC because Goodyear did not prevent or detect these improper payments because it failed to implement adequate FCPA compliance controls at its subsidiaries and for the Kenyan subsidiary because it failed to conduct adequate due diligence prior to its acquisition It was not alleged that Goodyear had any involvement with or knowledge of its subsidiaries improper conduct br br br Internal training and discrimination br On August WIBW a local CBS affiliate television station reported that an internal PowerPoint slide on political attire from a Topeka Kansas training seminar was circulating on social media The leaked slide depicted a zero tolerance policy towards some political movements President Donald Trump called for a boycott of Goodyear tires the following day as Trump campaign attire such as MAGA hats were among the banned products Goodyear responded via Twitter stating the visual in question was not created or distributed by Goodyear corporate nor was it part of a diversity training class Following release of the audio that went with the slide Goodyear admitted the slide was used at its Topeka factory br br br Tire blowouts br Defective tires are suspected to be the cause of multiple truck accidents and fatal injuries that occurred in France Spain and other European countries in the s according to an investigation published in the French daily Le Monde in March According to the journalists although Goodyear was aware of the problems it did not recognize them While the company quietly withdrew defective tires from the market and offered indemnities to the family of victims it did not initially recognize the tires were defective and did not implement the European Union rapid alert system for unsafe consumer products
