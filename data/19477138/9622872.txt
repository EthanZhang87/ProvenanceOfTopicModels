Grand Vacations was launched in as a subsidiary of Hilton Worldwide this was the first venture into the timeshare and vacation ownership industry by the Hilton brand In HGV was spun off from Hilton Worldwide into a separate publicly traded company allowing for HGV to be able to focus solely on the timeshare and vacation ownership aspect of the Hilton brand br The purpose of the spin off of Hilton Grand Vacations and Hilton s lodging real estate investment trust now known as Park Hotels Resorts from Hilton Worldwide into separate companies was to transform Hilton Worldwide into an asset light company making it more efficient for its shareholders due to it having less capital investments This means that following the spin offs Hilton Worldwide now mainly owns the Hilton brands and not the majority of the physical properties that bear the Hilton name meaning that it is not responsible for their operation or real estate costs thus driving up their profits and shareholder value For HGV this means that Hilton Worldwide owns and licenses the Hilton timeshare brands to HGV in a very similar fashion to how it licenses its hotel brands to the independent franchisees and companies that own and operate the majority of its hotels Perhaps the largest benefit of the spin off is the fact that it allows HGV to focus solely on its particular business sector thus growing and expanding the Hilton timeshare brands at a faster rate br On March Hilton Grand Vacations announced its intention to acquire Diamond Resorts for billion The acquisition was completed on August br On November
