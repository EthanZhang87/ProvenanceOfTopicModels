id: 53339439
Criticism of Dropbox an American company specializing in cloud storage and file synchronization and their flagship service of the same name centers around various forms of security and privacy controversies Issues include a June authentication problem that let accounts be accessed for several hours without passwords a July privacy policy update with language suggesting Dropbox had ownership of users data concerns about Dropbox employee access to users information July email spam with reoccurrence in February leaked government documents in June with information that Dropbox was being considered for inclusion in the National Security Agency s PRISM surveillance program a July comment from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden criticizing Dropbox s encryption the leak of million account passwords on the Internet in August and a January accidental data restoration incident where years old supposedly deleted files reappeared in users accounts br br br April user authentication file information br Dropbox has been criticized by the independent security researcher Derek Newton who wrote in April that Dropbox stored user authentication information in a file on the computer that was completely portable and is not tied to the system in any way In explaining the issue Newton wrote This means that if you gain access to a person s config db file or just the host id you gain complete access to the person s Dropbox until such time that the person removes the host from the list of linked devices via the Dropbox web interface He updated his post in October to write that Dropbox has release version that utilizes an encrypted local database and reportedly puts in place security enhancements to prevent theft of the machine credentials A report from The Next Web featured a comment from Dropbox in which they disagreed with Newton that the topic was a security flaw explaining that The researcher is claiming that an attacker would be able to gain access to a user s Dropbox account if they are able to get physical access to the user s computer In reality at the point an attacker has physical access to a computer the security battle is already lost this flaw exists with any service that uses cookies for authentication practically every web service br br br May data deduplication and employee access br In May a complaint was filed with the U S Federal Trade Commission alleging Dropbox misled users about the privacy and security of their files At the heart of the complaint was the policy of data deduplication where the system checks if a file has been uploaded before by any other user and links to the existing copy if so and the policy of using a single AES key for every file on the system so Dropbox can and does for deduplication look at encrypted files stored on the system with the consequence that any intruder who gets the key as well as potential Dropbox employees could decrypt any file if they had access to Dropbox s backend storage infrastructure In a response on its blog Dropbox wrote that Like most major online services we have a small number of employees who must be able to access user data when legally required to do so But that s the exception not the rule We have strict policy and technical access controls that prohibit employee access except in these rare circumstances In addition we employ a number of physical and electronic security measures to protect user information from unauthorized access In response to the FTC complaint Dropbox spokeswoman Julie Supan told InformationWeek that We believe this complaint is without merit and raises issues that were addressed in our blog post on April br br br June account access without password br On June TechCrunch reported that all Dropbox accounts could be accessed without password for four hours In a blog post co founder Arash Ferdowsi wrote that Yesterday we made a code update at pm Pacific time that introduced a bug affecting our authentication mechanism We discovered this at pm and a fix was live at pm A very small number of users much less than percent logged in during that period some of whom could have logged into an account without the correct password As a precaution we ended all logged in sessions He wrote that a thorough investigation was being conducted and that This should never have happened We are scrutinizing our controls and we will be implementing additional safeguards to prevent this from happening again Julianne Pepitone writing for CNNMoney wrote that It s the security nightmare scenario A website stuffed with sensitive documents leaves all of its customer data unprotected and exposed and featured a comment from Dave Aitel president and CEO of security firm Immunity Inc saying Any trust in the cloud is too much trust in the cloud it s as simple as that It s pretty much the standard among security professionals that you should put on the cloud only what you would be willing to give away br br br July Privacy Policy update br In July Dropbox updated its Terms of Service Privacy Policy and Security Overview agreements The new Privacy Policy sparked criticism as noted by Christopher White in a Neowin post in which he wrote that They attempted to reduce some of the tedious legalese in order to make it easier for normal people to understand It appears that they have succeeded in that mission and in the process have taken ownership of every file that uses their service Citing a paragraph in the updated Privacy Policy that Dropbox needed user permission to use copy distribute prepare derivative works such as translations or format conversions of perform or publicly display user s data White wrote that This broad terminology is frightening for end users because it clearly lets Dropbox take a person s work whether it is photographs works of fiction or scientific research and gives the company the right to do whatever they want with no recourse from the original owner After users expressed concerns about the change Dropbox once again updated its policy adding This license is solely to enable us to technically administer display and operate the Services White concluded by writing that While this is a step in the right direction it still makes no sense as to why a product that is used to move files from one computer to another needs the ability to prepare derivative works of anyone s files br br br July email spam and February reoccurrence br In July Dropbox hired outside experts to figure out why some users were receiving e mail spam from Dropbox In a post on its blog Dropbox employee Aditya Agarwal wrote that usernames and passwords recently stolen from other websites were used to sign in to a small number of Dropbox accounts We ve contacted these users and have helped them protect their accounts However Agarwal also noted that A stolen password was also used to access an employee Dropbox account containing a project document with user email addresses We believe this improper access is what led to the spam We re sorry about this and have put additional controls in place to help make sure it doesn t happen again One of the additional controls implemented was the introduction of two factor authentication In February users reported additional spam with the company stating that At this time we have not seen anything to suggest this is a new issue and blamed the earlier e mail spam issue from the past July br br br June PRISM program br In June The Guardian and The Washington Post publicized confidential documents suggesting Dropbox was being considered for inclusion in the National Security Agency s classified PRISM program of Internet surveillance br br br January outage br On January Dropbox experienced an outage A hacker group called The Sec posted on Twitter that it had compromised Dropbox s site in honor of Internet activist and computer programmer Aaron Swartz who committed suicide a year ago However Dropbox itself posted on Twitter that Dropbox site is back up Claims of leaked user info are a hoax The outage was caused during internal maintenance Thanks for your patience In a blog post detailing the issue Dropbox s Akhil Gupta wrote that On Friday at PM PT we had a planned maintenance scheduled to upgrade the OS on some of our machines During this process the upgrade script checks to make sure there is no active data on the machine before installing the new OS A subtle bug in the script caused the command to reinstall a small number of active machines Unfortunately some master replica pairs were impacted which resulted in the site going down Gupta also noted that Your files were never at risk during the outage br br br April Condoleezza Rice appointment to board of directors br In April Dropbox announced that Condoleezza Rice would be joining their board of directors prompting criticism from some users who were concerned about her appointment due to her history as United States Secretary of State and revelations of widespread wiretapping on US citizens during her time in office RiceHadleyGates a consultancy firm consisting of Rice former US national security adviser Stephen Hadley and former US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had previously advised Dropbox br br br May disabled shared links br In May Dropbox temporarily disabled shared links In a blog post the company detailed a web vulnerability scenario where sharing documents containing hyperlinks would cause the original shared Dropbox link to become accessible to the website owner if a user clicked on the hyperlink found in the document Some types of shared links remained disabled over the next few weeks until Dropbox eventually made changes to the functionality br br br July Snowden comment br In a July interview former NSA contractor Edward Snowden called Dropbox hostile to privacy because its encryption model enables the company to surrender user data to government agencies and recommended using the competing service SpiderOak instead In response a Dropbox spokeswoman stated that Safeguarding our users information is a top priority at Dropbox We ve made a commitment in our privacy policy to resist broad government requests and are fighting to change laws so that fundamental privacy protections are in place for users around the world br br br October account compromise hoax br In October an anonymous user on Pastebin claimed to have compromised almost seven million Dropbox usernames and passwords gradually posting the info However in a blog post Dropbox stated Recent news articles claiming that Dropbox was hacked aren t true Your stuff is safe The usernames and passwords referenced in these articles were stolen from unrelated services not Dropbox A subsequent list of usernames and passwords has been posted online We ve checked and these are not associated with Dropbox accounts br br br December and on Dropbox share links force upgrade to paid data plan br A long discussion on Dropbox s support forum entitled Can we have plans that are smaller than TB began in December when Dropbox introduced one terabyte paid storage plans Dropbox users voice concern that they are not able to grow their plan from the two gigabyte free plan by smaller increments than one terabyte By the minimum paid data storage plan increased to two terabytes making the incremental increase from the free account to the minimum paid plan out of reach for many users br br br August password leak br In August email addresses and passwords for million Dropbox accounts were published online with the information originating from the email spam issue Independent security researcher Troy Hunt checked the database against his data leak website and verified the data by discovering that both the accounts belonging to him and his wife had been disclosed Hunt commented that There is no doubt whatsoever that the data breach contains legitimate Dropbox passwords you simply can t fabricate this sort of thing In a blog post Dropbox stated The list of email addresses with hashed and salted passwords is real however we have no indication that Dropbox user accounts have been improperly accessed We re very sorry this happened and would like to clear up what s going on The company outlined details that the information was likely obtained in with the company first hearing about the list two weeks earlier at which time they immediately started an investigation We then emailed all users we believed were affected and completed a password reset for anyone who hadn t updated their password since mid This reset ensures that even if these passwords are cracked they can t be used to access Dropbox accounts br br br January accidental data restoration br In January Dropbox restored years old supposedly deleted files and folders in user accounts In one example a user reported that folders from and returned In explaining the issue a Dropbox employee wrote on its forum that A bug was preventing some files and folders from being fully deleted off our servers even after users had deleted them from their Dropbox accounts While fixing the bug we inadvertently restored the impacted files and folders to those users accounts This was our mistake it wasn t due to a third party and you weren t hacked Typically we permanently remove files and folders from our servers within days of a user deleting them However the deleted files and folders impacted by this bug had metadata inconsistencies So we quarantined and excluded them from the permanent deletion process until the metadata could be fixed br br br July anonymized data analysis br In July researchers at Northwestern University published an article in Harvard Business Review on the analysis of the habits of tens of thousands of scientists using anonymized data provided by Dropbox The data used was over the period from May to May from all scientists using the platform across universities Personal names attached to the data was removed by Dropbox but according to Casey Fiesler researcher at Colorado University the folder titles and file structures that were provided could be used to identify individuals Dropbox later in a blog post said that the reverse identification of the data was impossible The data was provided without the express consent of the thousand people whose information was accessed br br br February allegations by former employees of gender discrimination br In February a document containing interviews with current and former Dropbox employees claimed to be victims of gender discrimination was obtained by VentureBeat The subjects of the report alleged discrimination point to examples such as changing standards for promotions unequal compensation being set back in their careers after maternity leave and experiencing retribution when they take their cases to HR The report also detailed instances of alleged harassment and demotion after employees filed a complaint with Dropbox HR or returned to work following maternity leave br br br
