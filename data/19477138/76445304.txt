August Founder and CEO of Cryptee and a privacy activist John Ozbay published their research highlighting an important shortcoming of Apple s Lockdown Mode along with a proof of concept website to demonstrate that enabling Lockdown Mode makes it possible for all websites and online ads to be able to detect if users have Lockdown Mode enabled or not br Commenting further in a call Ozbay said

actually be able to identify that the user with this IP address is using Lockdown Mode br It is also reported that Ozbay reached out to an Apple employee on Twitter and had a conversation with him about the issues he found The employee according to screenshots of their chat told him that web fonts are disabled intentionally to remove font parsing from available web attack surface and that watering hole attacks are part of our threat model so I m not sure it would make sense to have web font exceptions per site br The article further concluded that there s nothing Apple can do right now
