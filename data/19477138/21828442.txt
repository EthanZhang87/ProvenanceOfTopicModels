Allkem Limited known as Orocobre Limited until November is an Argentinian mining company that is a wholly owned subsidiary of Arcadium Lithium Headquartered in Buenos Aires Argentina Allkem s portfolio includes lithium brine operations in Argentina a hard rock lithium operation in Australia and a lithium hydroxide conversion facility in Japan Allkem is dual listed on the Australian Securities Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange In May Allkem agreed terms to merge with Livent In January Allkem and Livent merged to form the NYSE listed Arcadium Lithium br br br Projects br br br Salar de Olaroz br The Salar de Olaroz is a salt lake in the province of Jujuy in northwestern Argentina close to the Chilean border The project consists of hectares of tenements over a salar known to contain high values of lithium and potash in brine In October Orocobre and Toyota Tsusho Corporation TTC executed a definitive joint venture agreement to develop the Olaroz Lithium Project Earlier in the year in June Orocobre had entered into an agreement with Jujuy Energia y Mineria Sociedad del Estado JEMSE a mining investment company owned by the provincial Government of Jujuy whereby JEMSE will hold an equity interest in the Olaroz project and in return provide assistance during its development br Results from a definitive feasibility study DFS released May suggest that the Olaroz project has a large resource base of million tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent with a project mine life estimated at years The design capacity of the Olaroz operation has been increased to tonnes per annum tpa of battery grade lithium carbonate from tpa originally provided for in the DFS Expected potash recovery has also been increased to approximately tpa compared to tpa Potash operations are not currently included in the immediate project plans or economics at this time but are said to be considered in future development phases br br br Mt Cattlin br The open pit mine and concentrator is located approximately two kilometres north of Ravensthorpe in the Great Southern region of Western Australia Operations recommenced at Mt Cattlin in late producing high quality spodumene concentrate that is qualified in the lithium supply chain globally br Mt Cattlin is a low cost spodumene producer utilising conventional techniques to extract and process the resource br br br Naraha br The Naraha Lithium Hydroxide Plant Naraha the first of its kind to be built in Japan is designed to convert primary grade lithium carbonate feedstock into purified battery grade lithium hydroxide The lithium carbonate feedstock of tpa will be shipped from Olaroz br Allkem has a economic interest in the Toyotsu Lithium Corporation TLC joint venture with partner Toyota Tsusho Corporation TTC who retains operational control br br br Sal de Vida br The tier brine project is located in Catamarca Province on the Salar del Hombre Muerto km northwest of Buenos Aires Argentina and km from Allkem s flagship Olaroz Lithium Facility Catamarca is a proven mining jurisdiction home to several successful mining operations and development projects br Sal de Vida is a globally competitive project with superior brine chemistry that readily upgrades to battery grade lithium carbonate br br br James Bay br Located in northern Qu bec approximately km east of James Bay and the Cree Nation of Eastmain community Qu bec is a highly attractive investment destination for lithium production due to its supportive resource development sector access to skilled labour and its proximity to high growth electric vehicle markets in North America and Europe br Allkem is proposing to develop the James Bay Project as a sustainable hard rock operation maximising the usage of renewable energy and utilising spodumene expertise gained from its successful Australian operation Mt Cattlin br br br Cauchari br The Salar de Cauchari lithium potash resource owned by South American salar Minerals Pty Ltd has over ha in Jujuy province immediately south of the Olaroz Project The Cauchari project has similar geo chemical characteristics to the Olaroz resource and provides a nearby additional brine source for future expansions of the planned Olaroz production facility at relatively low incremental capital cost br br br Borax Argentina br Orocobre acquired Borax Argentina S A Borax Argentina a long established Argentine boron or borate minerals and refined chemicals producer in August from Rio Tinto Borax Argentina owns one of only a few important borate deposits globally that are in production br Borax Argentina operate three open pit mines in Tincalayu Sijes and Porvenir located within the Jujuy and Salta Province in Northern Argentina Borate mining operations have been undertaken in the area for over years with a recent announcement by Ororocbre suggesting a positive outlook for future mining operation with the presence of long life high quality ore reserves br Currently Borax Argentina s operations produce a variety of boron chemical products including boric acid borax decahydrate borax pentahydrate anhydrous borax and boroglas from concentrates and ulexite minerals carted from the mines and concentrators In addition the mine and concentrator at Sijes produce mineral concentrates for direct sale br On July Orocobre announced the relocation of the borax chemical plant from its location in Campo Quijano close to the city of Salta to the Tincalayu mine site The relocation of the borax chemical plant is said to have significant financial benefits for the company through a reduction of both operating and logistics cost The relocation project is said to be completed by the end of June within a budget cost of US m br In December Allkem Limited completed the sale of Borax Argentina S A to Golden Wattle Springs Pty Ltd and has acquired the Mar a Victoria lithium tenement from Minera Santa Rita S R L br br br
