Billion is a word for a large number and it has two distinct definitions br i e one thousand million or ten to the ninth power as defined on the short scale This is now the most common sense of the word in all varieties of English it has long been established in American English and has since become common in Britain and other English speaking countries as well br i e one million million or ten to the twelfth power as defined on the long scale This number is the historical sense of the word and remains the established sense of the word in other European languages Though displaced by the short scale definition relatively early in US English it remained the most common sense of the word in Britain until the s and still remains in occasional use there br American English adopted the short scale definition from the French it enjoyed usage in France at the time alongside the long scale definition The United Kingdom used the long scale billion until when the government officially switched to the short scale but since the s the short scale had already been increasingly used in technical writing and journalism br Other countries use the word billion or words cognate to it to denote either the long scale or short scale billion For details see Long and short scales Current usage br Milliard another term for one thousand million is extremely rare in English but words similar to it are very common in other European languages For example Bulgarian Catalan Croatian Czech Danish Dutch Finnish French Georgian German Hebrew Asia Hungarian Italian Kazakh Kyrgyz Kurdish Lithuanian Luxembourgish Norwegian Persian Polish Portuguese although the expression mil milh es a thousand million is far more common Romanian Russian Serbo Croatian Slovak Slovene Spanish although the expression mil millones a thousand million is far more common Swedish Tajik Turkish Ukrainian and Uzbek use milliard or a related word for the short scale billion and billion or a related word for the long scale billion Thus for these languages billion is a thousand times larger than the modern English billion br br br History br br According to the Oxford English Dictionary the word billion was formed in the th century from million and the prefix bi two meaning the second power of a million This long scale definition was similarly applied to trillion quadrillion and so on The words were originally Latin and entered English around the end of the th century Later French arithmeticians changed the words meanings adopting the short scale definition whereby three zeros rather than six were added at each step so a billion came to denote a thousand million a trillion became a million million and so on This new convention was adopted in the United States in the th century but Britain retained the original long scale use France in turn reverted to the long scale in br In Britain however under the influence of American usage the short scale came to be increasingly used In Prime Minister Harold Wilson confirmed that the government would use the word billion only in its short scale meaning one thousand million In a written answer to Robin Maxwell Hyslop MP who asked whether official usage would conform to the traditional British meaning of a million million Wilson stated No The word billion is now used internationally to mean million and it would be confusing if British Ministers were to use it in any other sense I accept that it could still be interpreted in this country as million million and I shall ask my colleagues to ensure that if they do use it there should be no ambiguity as to its meaning br br br See also br br Names of large numbers br br br
