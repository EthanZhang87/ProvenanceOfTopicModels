Brands date back to when Isadore M Weinstein founded the Atlanta Linen Supply company Weinstein had previously been employed in the towel supply business in Cleveland and after serving in World War I he started his own business renting towels uniforms and linens He opened several locations throughout the south changing the name to the Southern Linen Service Corporation in The company went public in as National Linen Service Corporation and continued to grow eventually expanding to markets in the southwest and west coast By the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange br Following World War II Weinstein s son Milton had taken over the company In the s National Linen faced an antitrust suit due to its dominance in the otherwise fragmented linens industry The suit was settled in and in an effort to assuage future antitrust concerns the company began to diversify National Linen s first acquisition outside of linens and uniforms was Zep Manufacturing Company an Atlanta based chemical and janitorial supply manufacturer in Zep became synonymous with NSI s chemical division acquiring Selig Chemical Industries in and several smaller acquisitions throughout the s and s To better reflect its new variety of business units National Linen became National Service Industries NSI in Zep co founder Erwin Zaban who had stayed on following the company s acquisition and was also Weinstein s neighbor took over NSI s operation in br In NSI acquired Lithonia Lighting Inc a light fixture manufacturer founded in Georgia in and established a lighting division Along with the chemical division that grew out of the Zep acquisition the lighting division that grew out of the Lithonia Lighting acquisition formed the foundation for what would eventually become Acuity Brands NSI acquired several other lighting manufacturers over the next years the largest of which occurred in when Ohio based Holophane Corporation a large outdoor and industrial lighting manufacturer was purchased Zaban continued NSI s new expansion strategy of acquiring profitable companies without much consideration for synergy among the company s increasing number of business units throughout the s and s Six business units remained at the core of NSI s operations linens chemicals lighting insulation envelopes and printing However the total number of business units ebbed and flowed throughout this period as Zaban acquired companies in a variety of other industries and divested as soon as they became unprofitable br By the s NSI s lighting and chemical divisions made up more than half of the company s revenues and operating incomes combined and both divisions were still rapidly growing In NSI added Graham Group Europe s second largest specialty chemical manufacturer at the time and Kleen Canada to its chemical division NSI added outdoor lighting company Infranor Canada in and invested in a fluorescent lighting manufacturing facility in Monterrey Mexico that would serve the entire North American market The chemical division expanded further in with the acquisition of Enforcer Products and Pure Corporation br In National Service Industries announced it would combine the lighting and chemical divisions and spin off that combined entity as a separate publicly traded company Initially incorporated as L C Spinco in June it was renamed Acuity Brands in November of the same year James S Balloun who had taken over as CEO of NSI in the mid s moved with the spinoff to serve as the president CEO and chairman of the board In part due to the weak economy that spurred NSI to spin off the new company in the first place Acuity Brands struggled in its first few years Balloun retired in September and was replaced by Vernon J Nagel who had joined the firm as executive vice president and chief financial officer in December Beginning in Nagel led a restructuring effort that resulted in splitting Acuity Brands into two distinct publicly traded brands in July The company s chemical division Acuity Specialty Products spun off as Zep Inc and included the Zep Enforcer and Selig brands The remaining Acuity Brands Inc became the holding company for Acuity Brands Lighting

rise of smart lighting and the internet of things Acuity grew with these changes in technology launching the Atrius IoT brand in after the acquisitions of Sensor Switch and organic creation of brands
