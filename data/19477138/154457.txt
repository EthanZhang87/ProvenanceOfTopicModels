title: Internet censorship in China
id: 154457
China censors both the publishing and viewing of online material Many controversial events are censored from news coverage preventing many Chinese citizens from knowing about the actions of their government and severely restricting freedom of the press China s censorship includes the complete blockage of various websites apps video games inspiring the policy s nickname the Great Firewall of China simplified Chinese traditional Chinese pinyin F nghu Ch ngch ng which blocks websites Methods used to block websites and pages include DNS spoofing blocking access to IP addresses analyzing and filtering URLs packet inspection and resetting connections br The government blocks website content and monitors Internet access As required by the government major Internet platforms in China have established elaborate self censorship mechanisms as well as implementing a real name system As of more than sixty online restrictions had been created by the Government of China and implemented by provincial branches of state owned ISPs companies and organizations Some companies hire teams and invest in powerful artificial intelligence algorithms to police and remove illegal online content Despite restrictions all websites except TikTok can still be accessible to Chinese users by using VPNs which are currently heavily restricted but not banned due to them often being used for business purposes br Amnesty International states that China has the largest recorded number of imprisoned journalists and cyber dissidents in the world and Reporters Without Borders stated in and that China is the world s biggest prison for netizens Freedom House rated China Not Free in the Freedom on the Net report br Commonly alleged user offenses include communicating with organized groups abroad signing controversial online petitions and forcibly calling for government reform The government has escalated its efforts to reduce coverage and commentary that is critical of the regime after a series of large anti pollution and anti corruption protests Many of these protests were organized or publicized using instant messaging services chat rooms and text messages China s Internet police force was reported by official state media to be million strong in br Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in and in the name of combating disinformation following the death of Liu Xuezhou several Chinese social platforms announced that they would display user locations based on internet protocol IP addresses These platforms include Quora like Zhihu the domestic version of TikTok Douyin and video streaming platform Bilibili The platforms display the province for users located in China or the country or region if the IP address of the user is located overseas Users cannot disable this feature br China s special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau are outside the Great Firewall However it was reported that the central government authorities have been closely monitoring Internet use in these regions see Internet censorship in Hong Kong br br br Background br br The political and ideological background of Internet censorship is considered to be one of Deng Xiaoping s favorite sayings in the early s If you open a window for fresh air you have to expect some flies to blow in The saying is related to a period of the Chinese economic reform that became known as thesocialist market economy Superseding the political ideologies of the Cultural Revolution the reform led China towards a market economy opening it up to foreign investors Nonetheless the Chinese Communist Party CCP wished to protect its values and political ideas by swatting flies of other ideologies with a particular emphasis on suppressing movements that could potentially threaten the stability of the country br The Internet first arrived in the country in Since its arrival and the gradual rise of availability the Internet has become a common communication platform and an important tool for sharing information Just as the Chinese government had expected the number of Internet users in China soared from less than one percent in when the Internet was introduced to percent by br In the CCP feared the China Democracy Party CDP organized in contravention of the Four Cardinal Principles would breed a powerful new network that CCP party elites might not be able to control resulting in the CDP being immediately banned That same year the Golden Shield project was created The first part of the project lasted eight years and was completed in The second part began in and ended in The Golden Shield project was a database project in which the government could access the records of each citizen and connect China s security organizations The government had the power to delete any comments online that were considered harmful br On December members in charge of the Golden Shield project came from provinces and cities across China to participate in a four day inaugural Comprehensive Exhibition on Chinese Information System At the exhibition many Western technology products including Internet security video monitoring and facial recognition systems were purchased According to Amnesty International around Internet police have been employed by the Chinese government to enforce Internet laws br The Chinese government has described censorship as the method to prevent and eliminate risks in the ideological field from the Internet br br br Legislative basis br br The government of China defends its right to censor the Internet by claiming that this right extends from the country s own rules inside its borders A white paper released in June reaffirmed the government s determination to govern the Internet within its borders under the jurisdiction of Chinese sovereignty The document states Laws and regulations prohibit the spread of information that contains content subverting state power undermining national unity or infringing upon national honor and interests It adds that foreign individuals and firms can use the Internet in China but they must abide by the country s laws br The Central Government of China started its Internet censorship with three regulations The first regulation was called the Temporary Regulation for the Management of Computer Information Network International Connection The regulation was passed in the nd Standing Convention of the State Council on January It was formally announced on February and updated again on May The content of the first regulation stated that Internet service providers be licensed and that Internet traffic goes through ChinaNet GBNet CERNET or CSTNET The second regulation was the Ordinance for Security Protection of Computer Information Systems It was issued on February by the State Council to give the responsibility of Internet security protection to the Ministry of Public Security br br br Article of the Computer Information Network and Internet Security Protection and Management Regulations br The Ordinance regulation further led to the Security Management Procedures in Internet Accessing issued by the Ministry of Public Security in December The regulation defined harmful information and harmful activities regarding Internet usage Section Five of the Computer Information Network and Internet Security Protection and Management Regulations approved by the State Council on December stated the following br br Article No unit or individual may use the Internet to create replicate retrieve or transmit the following kinds of information br Inciting to resist or breaking the Constitution or laws or the implementation of administrative regulations br Inciting to overthrow the government or the socialist system br Inciting division of the country harming national unification br Inciting hatred or discrimination among nationalities or harming the unity of the nationalities br Making falsehoods or distorting the truth spreading rumors destroying the order of society br Promoting feudal superstitions sexually suggestive material gambling violence murder br Terrorism or inciting others to criminal activity openly insulting other people or distorting the truth to slander people br Injuring the reputation of state organs br br Other activities against the Constitution laws or administrative regulations br The units stated above refer to work units Chinese pinyin D nw i or more broadly workplaces As of the regulations are still active and govern the activities of Internet users online br br br Interim Regulations of the PRC on the Management of International Networking of Computer Information br In the Ministry of Commerce created a set of regulations which prohibit connection to international networks or use of channels outside of those provided by official government service providers without prior approval or license from authorities The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has since been superseded by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology or MIIT To this date this regulation is still used to prosecute and fine users who connect to international networks or use VPN s br br Article To carry out international networking of computer information the output and input channels provided by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications in its public telecommunication network shall be used br No units or individuals shall establish or use other channels for international networking on their own accord br br Article Those that violate stipulations in articles and shall be ordered by public security departments to stop networking with a warning issued to them They may also be imposed a fine below yuan If they have earned any illegal incomes these incomes shall be confiscated br br br State Council Order No br In September State Council Order No created the first set of content restrictions for Internet content providers China based websites cannot link to overseas news websites or distribute news from overseas media without separate approval Only licensed print publishers have the authority to deliver news online These sites must obtain approval from state information offices and the State Council Information Agency Non licensed websites that wish to broadcast news may only publish information already released publicly by other news media Article of this order mentions that content providers are responsible for ensuring the legality of any information disseminated through their services Article gives Government officials full access to any kind of sensitive information they wish from providers of Internet services br br br Cybersecurity Law of the People s Republic of China br br On November the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress promulgated a cybersecurity law which among other things requires network operators to store data locally hand over information when requested by state security organs and open software and hardware used by critical information infrastructure operators to be subject to national security review potentially compromising source codes and security of encryption used by communications service providers The law is an amalgamation of all previous regulations related to Internet use and online censorship and unifies and institutionalises the legislative framework governing cyber control and content censorship within the country Article states that persons using networks shall not overturn the socialist system incite separatism or break national unity further institutionalising the suppression of dissent online br br Article Any person and organization using networks shall abide by the Constitution and laws observe public order and respect social morality they must not endanger cybersecurity and must not use the Internet to engage in activities endangering national security national honor and national interests they must not incite subversion of national sovereignty overturn the socialist system incite separatism break national unity advocate terrorism or extremism advocate ethnic hatred and ethnic discrimination disseminate violent obscene or sexual information create or disseminate false information to disrupt the economic or social order or information that infringes on the reputation privacy intellectual property or other lawful rights and interests of others and other such acts br br br Data Security Law of the People s Republic of China br br On June the Data Security Law was promulgated and took effect on September The law builds on the Cybersecurity Law and significantly extends China s extraterritorial jurisdiction of its current data regulations over new categories of data It establishes new rules for businesses interacting with Chinese citizens both inside and beyond China s borders to follow br br Article This Law shall apply to data processing activities and security supervision and regulation of such activities within the territory of the People s Republic of China br Where data processing outside the territory of People s Republic of China harms the national security public interests or the lawful rights and interests of individuals or organizations of the People s Republic of China legal liability shall be investigated in accordance with the law br br br Enforcement br In December the Ministry of Public Security released new regulations that levied fines for defaming government agencies splitting the nation and leaking state secrets Violators could face a fine of up to CNY roughly US Banning appeared to be mostly uncoordinated and ad hoc with some websites allowed in one city yet similar sites blocked in another The blocks were often lifted for special occasions For example The New York Times was unblocked when reporters in a private interview with CCP General Secretary Jiang Zemin specifically asked about the block and he replied that he would look into the matter During the APEC summit in Shanghai during normally blocked media sources such as CNN NBC and the Washington Post became accessible Since blocks on Western media sites have been further relaxed and all three of the sites previously mentioned were accessible from mainland China However access to the New York Times was denied again in December br In the middle of China purchased over routers from an American company Cisco Systems which enabled the Chinese government to use more advanced censor technology In February Google in exchange for equipment installation on Chinese soil blocked websites which the Chinese government deemed illegal Google reversed this policy in after they suspected that a Google employee passed information to the Chinese Government and inserted backdoors into their software br In May the State Council Information Office announced the transfer of its offices which regulated the Internet to a new subordinate agency the State Internet Information Office which would be responsible for regulating the Internet in China The relationship of the new agency to other Internet regulation agencies in China was unclear from the announcement br On August the State Internet Information Office SIIO was formally authorized by the state council to regulate and supervise all Internet content It later launched a website called the Cyberspace Administration of China CAC and the Office of the Central Leading Group for Cyberspace Affairs In February the Central Internet Security and Informatization and the Deep State Leading Group was created in order to oversee cybersecurity and receive information from the CAC Chairing the China Cyberspace Governance Conference on and April Xi Jinping General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party committed to fiercely crack down on criminal offenses including hacking telecom fraud and violation of citizens privacy The Conference comes on the eve of the First Digital China Summit which was held at the Fuzhou Strait International Conference and Exhibition Centre in Fuzhou the capital of Fujian Province br On January the CAC started a project to take down pornography violence bloody content horror gambling defrauding Internet rumors superstition invectives parody threats and proliferation of bad lifestyles and bad popular culture On January China Network Audiovisual Program Service Association announced a new regulation to censor short videos with controversial political or social content such as a pessimistic outlook of millennials one night stands non mainstream views of love and marriage as well as previously prohibited content deemed politically sensitive br China is planning to make deepfakes illegal which is described as the way to prevent parody and pornography br In July the CAC announced a regulation that said that Internet information providers and users in China who seriously violate related laws and regulations will be subject to Social Credit System blocklist It also announces that Internet information providers and users who are not meeting the standard but mildly violation will be recorded in the List to Focus br On August the Regulations on the Administration of Internet User Account Information were issued by the China Internet Information Office came into effect which requires Internet accounts to fill in their real occupations and user IP location will be displayed while registration of some accounts in professional fields is even required to provide verification materials br During the COVID protests in China the CAC directed companies such as Tencent and ByteDance to intensify their censorship efforts br After December the Regulations on the Administration of Internet Followers Commenting Services came into force which for the first time considered likes as a type of comment In addition the regulations state that public accounts must take the initiative to review the comments left by netizens Some experts have pointed out that this means that netizens may be punished by the platform or the authorities for the content of their likes br br br Self regulation br Internet censorship in China has been called a panopticon that encourages self censorship through the perception that users are being watched On March the Internet Society of China a self governing Chinese Internet industry body launched the Public Pledge on Self Discipline for the Chinese Internet Industry an agreement between the Chinese Internet industry regulator and companies that operate sites in China In signing the agreement web companies pledge to identify and prevent the transmission of information that Chinese authorities deem objectionable including information that breaks laws or spreads superstition or obscenity or that may jeopardize state security and disrupt social stability As of the pledge had been signed by more than entities operating websites in China br Internet platforms like Sina and QQ are not authorized to broadcast news or conduct interviews In practice such platforms do so with self constraint avoiding publicizing news which could run counter to the government br br br Use of service providers br Although the government does not have the physical resources to monitor all Internet chat rooms and forums the threat of being shut down has caused Internet content providers to employ internal staff colloquially known as big mamas who stop and remove forum comments which may be politically sensitive In Shenzhen these duties are partly taken over by a pair of police created cartoon characters Jingjing and Chacha who help extend the online police presence of the Shenzhen authorities These cartoons spread across the nation in reminding Internet users that they are being watched and should avoid posting sensitive or harmful material on the Internet br However Internet content providers have adopted some counter strategies One is to post politically sensitive stories and remove them only when the government complains In the hours or days in which the story is available online people read it and by the time the story is taken down the information is already public One notable case in which this occurred was in response to a school explosion in when local officials tried to suppress the fact the explosion resulted from children illegally producing fireworks br On July the Chinese government started granting licenses to businesses to open Internet cafe chains Business analysts and foreign Internet operators regard the licenses as intended to clamp down on information deemed harmful to the Chinese government In July the city of Xiamen announced it would ban anonymous online postings after text messages and online communications were used to rally protests against a proposed chemical plant in the city Internet users will be required to provide proof of identity when posting messages on the more than Web sites registered in Xiamen br The Chinese government issued new rules on December requiring Internet users to provide their real names to service providers while assigning Internet companies greater responsibility for deleting forbidden postings and reporting them to the authorities The new regulations issued by the Standing Committee of the National People s Congress allow Internet users to continue to adopt pseudonyms for their online postings but only if they first provide their real names to service providers a measure that could chill some of the vibrant discourse on the country s Twitter like microblogs The authorities periodically detain and even jail Internet users for politically sensitive comments such as calls for a multiparty democracy or accusations of impropriety by local officials br br br Arrests br Fines and short arrests are becoming an optional punishment to whoever spreads undesirable information through the different Internet formats as this is seen as a risk to social stability br In Wang Xiaoning and other Chinese activists were arrested and sentenced to years in prison for using a Yahoo email account to post anonymous writing to an Internet mailing list On July the family of Liu Shaokun was notified that he had been sentenced to one year re education through labor for inciting a disturbance As a teacher in Sichuan province he had taken photographs of collapsed schools and posted these photos online On July Huang Qi was formally arrested on suspicion of illegally possessing state secrets Huang had spoken with the foreign press and posted information on his website about the plight of parents who had lost children in collapsed schools Shi Tao a Chinese journalist used his Yahoo email account to send a message to a U S based pro democracy website In his email he summarized a government order directing media organizations in China to downplay the upcoming th anniversary of the crackdown on pro democracy activists Police arrested him in November charging him with illegally providing state secrets to foreign entities In April he was sentenced to years imprisonment and two years subsequent deprivation of his political rights br In mid police across China arrested hundreds of people accused of spreading false rumors online The arrest targeted microbloggers who accused CCP officials of corruption venality and sexual escapades The crackdown was intended to disrupt online networks of like minded people whose ideas could challenge the authority of the CCP Some of China s most popular microbloggers were arrested In September China s highest court and prosecution office issued guidelines that define and outline penalties for publishing online rumors and slander The rules give some protection to citizens who accuse officials of corruption but a slanderous message forwarded more than times or read more than times could result in up to three years in prison br In a Uyghur university student at Xinjiang University Mehmut Memtimin was sentenced to years in prison for using a VPN br According to the World Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders China is the world s biggest jailer of journalists holding around in detention In February China arrested two of its citizens for taking it upon themselves to cover the COVID pandemic br On May blogger Ruan Xiaohuan was arrested by the Shanghai police He was convicted of inciting subversion of state power for his blog ProgramThink which was critical of the regime His wife Bei Zhenying was apparently warned by authorities against discussing the case br br br Technical implementation br br br Current methods br br The Great Firewall has used numerous methods to block content including IP dropping DNS spoofing deep packet inspection for finding plain text signatures within the handshake to throttle protocols and more recently active probing br br br Golden shield project br The Golden Shield Project maintained and constructed by the Ministry of Public Security MPS of the People s Republic of China started in began processing in November and the first part of the project passed the national inspection on November in Beijing According to MPS its purpose is to construct a communication network and computer information system for police to improve their capability and efficiency By the preliminary work of the Golden Shield Project had cost US million equivalent to RMB million or million Greg Walton a freelance researcher said that the aim of the Golden Shield is to establish a gigantic online database that would include speech and face recognition closed circuit television and credit records as well as traditional Internet use records br A notice issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on May stated that as of July manufacturers must ship machines to be sold in mainland China with the Green Dam Youth Escort software On August Li Yizhong minister of industry and information technology announced that computer manufacturers and retailers were no longer obliged to ship the software with new computers for home or business use but that schools Internet cafes and other public use computers would still be required to run the software br A senior official of the Internet Affairs Bureau of the State Council Information Office said the software s only purpose was to filter pornography on the Internet The general manager of Jinhui which developed Green Dam said Our software is simply not capable of spying on Internet users it is only a filter Human rights advocates in China have criticized the software for being a thinly concealed attempt by the government to expand censorship Online polls conducted on Sina Netease Tencent Sohu and Southern Metropolis Daily revealed over rejection of the software by netizens However Xinhua commented that support for Green Dam largely stems from end users opposing opinions primarily come from a minority of media outlets and businesses br Political scientist Margaret Roberts contends that most Chinese censorship methods do not ban information outright but instead function as a tax on information forcing users to pay money or spend more time if they want to access the censored material br br br Targets of censorship br br br Targeted content br br According to a Harvard study at least websites were blocked from within mainland China in including out of the Top Global Websites The Chinese sponsored news agency Xinhua stated that censorship targets only superstitious pornographic violence related gambling and other harmful information This appears questionable as the e mail provider Gmail is blocked and it cannot be said to fall into any of these categories On the other hand websites centered on the following political topics are often censored Falun Gong police brutality the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre freedom of speech democracy the Tibetan independence movement and the Tuidang movement According to a report by Human Rights Watch content that criticizes racism in China will often be censored br Testing performed by Freedom House in confirmed that material written by or about activist bloggers is removed from the Chinese Internet in a practice that has been termed cyber disappearance br A study of social media sites by other Harvard researchers found that of Internet posts were blocked The blocking focused mainly on any form of collective action anything from false rumors driving riots to protest organizers to large parties for fun pornography and criticism of the censors However significant criticisms of the government were not blocked when made separately from calls for collective action Another study has shown comments on social media that criticize the state its leaders and their policies are usually published but posts with collective action potential will be more likely to be censored whether they are against the state or not br A lot of larger Japanese websites were blocked from the afternoon of June UTC to the morning of June UTC such as Google Japan Yahoo Japan Amazon Japan Excite Yomiuri News Sponichi News and Nikkei BP Japan br Chinese censors have been relatively reluctant to block websites where there might be significant economic consequences For example a block of GitHub was reversed after widespread complaints from the Chinese software developer community In November after the Chinese services of Reuters and the Wall Street Journal were blocked greatfire org mirrored the Reuters website to an Amazon com domain in such a way that it could not be shut down without shutting off domestic access to all of Amazon s cloud storage service br For one month beginning November ProPublica tested whether the homepages of international news organizations were accessible to browsers inside China and found the most consistently blocked were Bloomberg News The New York Times South China Morning Post The Wall Street Journal Facebook and Twitter Internet censorship and surveillance has been tightly implemented in China that block social websites like Gmail Google YouTube Facebook Instagram Twitter and others The excessive censorship practices of the Great Firewall of China have now engulfed the VPN service providers as well br br br Artificial intelligence training data br br In in country access was blocked to Hugging Face a company that maintains libraries containing training data sets commonly used for large language models br br br Search engines br br One part of the block is to filter the search results of certain terms on Chinese search engines such as for example Sogou Search and Baidu Attempting to search for censored keywords in these Chinese search engines will yield few or no results br In addition a connection containing intensive censored terms may also be closed by The Great Firewall and cannot be re established for several minutes This affects all network connections including HTTP and POP but the reset is more likely to occur during searching Before the search engines censored themselves many search engines had been blocked br br br Discussion forums br br Several Bulletin Board Systems in universities were closed down or restricted public access since including the SMTH BBS and the YTHT BBS br In September some data centers were shut down indiscriminately for providing interactive features such as blogs and forums CBS reports an estimate that half the interactive sites hosted in China were blocked br Coinciding with the twentieth anniversary of the government suppression of the pro democracy protests in Tiananmen Square the government ordered Internet portals forums and discussion groups to shut down their servers for maintenance between and June The day before the mass shut down Chinese users of Twitter Hotmail and Flickr among others reported a widespread inability to access these services br br br Social media br The censorship of individual social media posts in China usually occurs in two circumstances br Corporations government hire censors to read individual social media posts and manually take down posts that violate policy Although the government and media often use the microblogging service Sina Weibo to spread ideas and monitor corruption it is also supervised and self censored by Sina censors br Posts that will be primarily auto blocked based on keyword filters and decide which ones to publish later br In the second half of the social networking sites Facebook and Twitter were blocked presumably because of containing social or political commentary similar to LiveJournal in the above list An example is the commentary on the July r mqi riots Another reason suggested for the block is that activists can utilize them to organize themselves br In Chinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo became a forbidden topic in Chinese media due to his winning the Nobel Peace Prize Keywords and images relating to the activist and his life were again blocked in July shortly after his death br After the Wenzhou train collision the government started emphasizing the danger in spreading false rumours yaoyan making the permissive usage of Weibo and social networks a public debate br In First Monday published an article on political content censorship in social media i e the active deletion of messages published by individuals This academic study which received extensive media coverage accumulated a dataset of million messages sent on Sina Weibo from June through September and statistically analyzed them three months later finding deletions out of million sampled more than percent The study revealed that censors quickly deleted words with politically controversial meanings e g qingci asking someone to resign referring to calls for Railway Minister Sheng Guangzu to resign after the Wenzhou train collision on July and also that the rate of message deletion was regionally anomalous compare censorship rates of in Tibet and in Qinghai with in Beijing and in Shanghai In another study conducted by a research team led by political scientist Gary King objectionable posts created by King s team on a social networking site were almost universally removed within hours of their posting br The comment areas of popular posts which mentioned Vladimir Putin on Sina Weibo were shut down during the G Hamburg summit in Germany It is a rare example that a foreigner leader is granted the safety from a popular judgment on the Chinese Internet which usually only granted to the Chinese leaders This move by the Chinese Government may be related to their close ties with Russia and Putin himself br However a study by American researchers of billion Weibo blog posts over the period found that many sensitive topics were discussed including on ethnic conflict political scandals and protests br br br WeChat br WeChat is the dominant social media and messaging app in China and is also the most popular messaging application for most Chinese nationals staying overseas Though subject to state rules which saw individual posts removed Tech in Asia reported in that certain restricted words had been blocked on WeChat globally A crackdown in March deleted dozens of WeChat accounts some of which were independent news channels with hundreds of thousands of followers CNN reported that the blocks were related to laws banning the spread of political rumors br The state run Xinhua News Agency reported in July that the CAC would conduct an intensive three month investigation and cleanup of media platforms including WeChat br br br SSL protocols br In March China suddenly started blocking websites using the TLS Transport Layer Security and ESNI Encrypted Server Name Indicator for SSL certificates since ESNI makes it difficult if not impossible to identify the name of a website based on the server name displayed in its SSL certificate Since May Chinese Wikipedia has been blocked in mainland China This was done after Wikipedia started to use HTTPS encryption which made selective censorship more difficult see also Wikimedia blockade in mainland China br br br VPN protocols br In Apple started removing all VPN apps from Apple app stores at the behest of the Chinese government br Beginning in the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology MIIT in conjunction with the Cyberspace Administration Commission CAC began a sweeping crackdown on all VPN providers ordering all major state owned telecommunications providers including China Telecom China Mobile and China Unicom to block VPN protocols with only authorised users who have obtained permits beforehand to access VPN s provided they are operated by state owned telecommunications companies br Although China restricts VPNs they remain widely used by private individuals State owned enterprises or state institutions also use VPNs for official work The Chinese government has authorized several official licensed VPN providers who comply with Chinese censorship and backdoor access laws Those who develop or sell their own VPNs potentially face years in prison br br br Specific examples of Internet censorship br br br Tiananmen Square protests and massacre br br The Chinese government censors Internet materials related to the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre According to the government s white paper in on the subject of Internet in China the government protects the safe flow of internet information and actively guides people to manage websites under the law and use the internet in a wholesome and correct way The government therefore prevents people on the Internet from divulging state secrets subverting state power and jeopardizing national unification damaging state honor and disrupting social order and stability Law abiding Chinese websites such as Sina Weibo censors words related to the protests in its search engine Sina Weibo is one of the largest Chinese microblogging services As of October Weibo s censored words include Tank Man The government also censors words that have similar pronunciation or meaning to June the date that the government s violent crackdown occurred for example is an alternative to June The government forbids remembrances of the protests Sina Weibo s search engine for example censors Hong Kong lyricist Thomas Chow s song called or The Flower of Freedom since attendees of the Vindicate June and Relay the Torch rally at Hong Kong s Victoria Park sing this song every year to commemorate the victims of the events br The government s Internet censorship of such topics was especially strict during the th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests which occurred in According to a Reporters Without Borders article searching photos related to the protest such as June on Baidu the most popular Chinese search engine would return blank results and a message stating that the search does not comply with laws regulations and policies Moreover a large number of netizens from China claimed that they were unable to access numerous Western web services such as Twitter Hotmail and Flickr in the days leading up to and during the anniversary Netizens in China claimed that many Chinese web services were temporarily blocked days before and during the anniversary Netizens also reported that microblogging services including Fanfou and Xiaonei now known as Renren were down with similar messages that claim that their services were under maintenance for a few days around the anniversary date br In censors once again doubled down during the th anniversary of the protests and by this time had been largely automated with AI rejecting protest related posts In May and June authorities censored Tiananmen protest related posts and restricted communications of Tiananmen victims families In March censors removed social media posts containing photos of medals awarded to PLA soldiers who participated in the Tiananmen Square massacre br br br Reactions of netizens in China br In the Guardian wrote that Chinese netizens responded with subtle protests against the government s temporary blockages of large web services For instance Chinese websites made subtle grievances against the state s censorship by sarcastically calling the date June as the Chinese Internet Maintenance Day Owner of the blog Wuqing org stated I too am under maintenance The dictionary website Wordku com voluntarily took its site down with the claim that this was because of the Chinese Internet Maintenance Day In Chinese netizens used subtle and sarcastic Internet memes to criticize the government and to bypass censorship by creating and posting humorous pictures or drawings resembling the Tank Man photo on Weibo One of these pictures for example showed Florentijin Hofman s rubber ducks sculptures replacing tanks in the Tank Man photo On Twitter Hu Jia a Beijing based AIDS activist asked netizens in mainland China to wear black T shirts on June to oppose censorship and to commemorate the date Chinese web services such as Weibo eventually censored searches of both black shirt and Big Yellow Duck in br As a result the government further promoted anti western sentiment In Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping praised blogger Zhou Xiaoping for his positive energy after the latter argued in an essay titled Nine Knockout Blows in America s Cold War Against China that American culture was eroding the moral foundation and self confidence of the Chinese people br br br Debates about the significance of Internet resistance to censorship br According to Chinese studies expert Johan Lagerkvist scholars Pierre Bourdieu and Michel de Certeau argue that this culture of satire is a weapon of resistance against authority This is because criticism against authority often results in satirical parodies that presupposes and confirms emancipation of the supposedly oppressed people Academic writer Linda Hutcheon argues that some people however may view satirical language that is used to criticise the government as complicity which can reinforce rather than subvert conservative attitudes Chinese experts Perry Link and Xiao Qiang however oppose this argument They claim that when sarcastic terms develop into common vocabulary of netizens these terms would lose their sarcastic characteristic They then become normal terms that carry significant political meanings that oppose the government Xiao believes that the netizens freedom to spread information on the Internet has forced the government to listen to popular demands of netizens For example the Ministry of Information Technology s plan to preinstall mandatory censoring software called Green Dam Youth Escort on computers failed after popular online opposition against it in the year of the th anniversary of the protest br Lagerkvist states that the Chinese government however does not see subtle criticisms on the Internet as real threats that carry significant political meanings and topple the government He argues that real threats occur only when laugh mobs become organised smart mobs that directly challenge the government s power At a TED conference Michael Anti gives a similar reason for the government s lack of enforcement against these Internet memes Anti suggests that the government sometimes allows limited windows of freedom of speech such as Internet memes Anti explains that this is to guide and generate public opinions that favor the government and to criticize enemies of the party officials br br br Internet censorship of the protest in br The Chinese government has become more efficient in its Internet regulations since the th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre On June Sina Weibo quietly suspended usage of the candle icon from the comment input tool which netizens used to mourn the dead on forums Some searches related to the protest on Chinese website services no longer come up with blank results but with results that the government had carefully selected These subtle methods of government censorship may cause netizens to believe that their searched materials were not censored br br br Usage of Internet kill switch br China completely shut down Internet service in the autonomous region of Xinjiang from July to May for up to days after the July r mqi riots br br br COVID pandemic br br Reporters without Borders has accused that China s policies prevented an earlier warning about the COVID pandemic At least one doctor suspected as early as December that an outbreak was occurring but arguably may have been deterred from informing the media due to harsh punishment for whistleblowers br During the pandemic academic research concerning the origins of the virus was censored An investigation by ProPublica and The New York Times found that the Cyberspace Administration of China placed censorship restrictions on Chinese media outlets and social media to avoid mentions of the COVID outbreak mentions of Li Wenliang and activated legions of fake online commenters to flood social sites with distracting chatter br In late demonstrations erupted across China against the Zero COVID measures and various other issues The catalyst for these protests was a fire in an r mqi apartment which claimed lives in November during a persistent COVID lockdown In response authorities acted to eliminate digital discussions regarding the protests This included deleting posts imposing limits on search capabilities and erasing calls for the freeing of detained demonstrators The Cyberspace Administration of China mandated that digital platforms increase their content moderation teams to erase any mentions of tools that might allow users to bypass censorship aiming to cut off any pathways to openly discussing the protests through unfiltered internet channels Following these events the government lifted restrictions associated with COVID leading to a surge in infection rates and fatalities Sina Weibo a major social media platform blocked search results related to the pandemic in Beijing and prevented live conversations about the consequences of lifting lockdown measures In January the authorities initiated a digital clampdown to eliminate gloomy sentiments fueled by what they termed as false information concerning the pandemic and any digital content mentioning infection rates or fatalities was promptly deleted br br br Winnie the Pooh br br Since the Disney character Winnie the Pooh is systematically removed on the Chinese Internet following the spread of an Internet meme in which photographs of Xi and other individuals were compared to the bear and other characters from the works of A A Milne as re imagined by Disney The first heavily censored viral meme can be traced back to the official visit to the United States in during which Xi was photographed by a Reuters photographer walking with then US President Barack Obama in Sunnylands California A blog post where the photograph was juxtaposed with the cartoon depiction went viral but Chinese censors rapidly deleted it A year later came a meme featuring Xi and Shinzo Abe When Xi Jinping inspected troops through his limousine s sunroof a popular meme was created with Winnie the Pooh in a toy car The widely circulated image became the most censored picture of the year in In addition to not wanting any kind of online euphemism for the CCP s general secretary the Chinese government considers that the caricature undermines the authority of the party general secretarial office as well as the paramount leader himself and all works comparing Xi with Winnie the Pooh are purportedly banned in China br br br Other examples br In the government censored what it viewed as excessive anti Japanese sentiment online related to the Senkaku Islands dispute br In February Xi Jinping appeared to set in motion a process to scrap term limits allowing himself to become ruler for life To suppress criticism censors banned phrases such as Disagree Shameless Lifelong Animal Farm and at one point briefly censored the letter N Li Datong a former state newspaper editor wrote a critical letter that was censored some social media users evaded the censorship by posting an upside down screenshot of the letter br br On March China s CCTV incidentally showed Yicai s Liang Xiangyi apparently rolling her eyes in disgust at a long winded and canned media question during the widely watched National People s Congress In the aftermath Liang s name became the most censored search term on Weibo The government also blocked the search query journalist in blue and attempted to censor popular memes inspired by the eye roll br On June British born comedian John Oliver criticized China s paramount leader Xi Jinping on his U S show Last Week Tonight over Xi Jinping s apparent descent into authoritarianism including his sidelining of dissent human rights abuses against Uyghur peoples and clampdowns on Chinese Internet censorship as well as the Belt and Road Initiative As a result the English language name of John Oliver although not the Chinese version was censored on Sina Weibo and other sites on the Chinese Internet br The American television show South Park was banned from China in and any mention of it was removed from almost all sites on the Chinese Internet after criticizing China s government and censorship in season episode Band in China Series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone later issued a mock apology br On April Scratch was completely banned in China because of recognition of Macau Hong Kong and Taiwan as countries br In October in the run up to the th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party photographs and videos of the Beijing Sitong Bridge protest were censored br In January past articles concerning China s economic development from the People s Daily were censored br Discussion of doping cases involving Chinese athletes in international sports is widely censored br br br International influence br br Foreign content providers such as Yahoo AOL and Skype must abide by Chinese government wishes including having internal content monitors to be able to operate within mainland China Also per mainland Chinese laws Microsoft began to censor the content of its blog service Windows Live Spaces arguing that continuing to provide Internet services is more beneficial to the Chinese Chinese journalist Michael Anti s blog on Windows Live Spaces was censored by Microsoft In an April e mail panel discussion Rebecca MacKinnon who reported from China for nine years as a Beijing bureau chief for CNN said many bloggers said he Anti was a necessary sacrifice so that the majority of Chinese can continue to have an online space to express themselves as they choose So the point is compromises are being made at every level of society because nobody expects political freedom anyway br The Chinese version of Myspace launched in April has many censorship related differences from other international versions of the service Discussion forums on topics such as religion and politics are absent and a filtering system that prevents the posting of content about politically sensitive topics has been added Users are also given the ability to report the misconduct of other users for offenses including endangering national security leaking state secrets subverting the government undermining national unity spreading rumors or disturbing the social order br Some media have suggested that China s Internet censorship of foreign websites may also be a means of forcing mainland Chinese users to rely on China s e commerce industry thus self insulating their economy from the dominance of international corporations On November an alliance of investors and researchers representing companies in the U S Europe and Australia with over US billion in joint assets announced that they were urging businesses to protect freedom of expression and pledged to monitor technology companies that do business in countries violating human rights such as China On December the UN OSCE and OAS special mandates on freedom of expression called on Internet corporations to work together to resist official attempts to control or restrict the use of the Internet Google finally responded when attacked by hackers rumored to be hired by the Chinese government by threatening to pull out of China br In Reporters Without Borders wrote that it suspects that regimes such as Cuba Zimbabwe and Belarus have obtained surveillance technology from China br br br Chinese social media platforms br With the proliferation of Chinese social media platforms such as TikTok WeChat QQ Weibo and Xiaohongshu RED abroad concerns have been raised about data harvesting by Chinese technology firms since such companies are registered in the China and therefore fall under the jurisdiction of Chinese law requiring access to data without warrant when requested by Chinese intelligence and public security authorities Concern has also grown about the spread of Chinese language disinformation and propaganda on platforms targeted at overseas Chinese diaspora communities and the potential to sow discord and unrest towards host nation states and societies in addition to the exporting of Chinese censorship practices abroad preventing the exercise of free speech by Chinese communities even when physically outside China br br br Evasion br br br Using a VPN service br Internet censorship in China is circumvented by determined parties by using proxy servers outside the firewall Users may circumvent all of the censorship and monitoring of the Great Firewall if they have a working VPN or SSH connection method to a computer outside mainland China However disruptions of VPN services have been reported and the free or popular services especially are increasingly being blocked During the COVID protests in China the Chinese government intensified crackdowns on VPNs To avoid deep packet inspection and continue providing services in China some VPN providers implemented server obfuscation br br br Changing IP addresses br Blogs hosted on services such as Blogger and Wordpress com are frequently blocked In response some China focused services explicitly offer to change a blog s IP address within minutes if it is blocked by the authorities br br br Using a mirror website br In Chinese citizens used the Google mirror elgooG after China blocked Google This has since been blocked br br br Modifying the network stack br In July researchers at Cambridge University claimed to have defeated the firewall by ignoring the TCP reset packets br br br Using Tor and DPI resistant tools br Although many users use VPNs to circumvent the Great Firewall of China many Internet connections are now subject to deep packet inspection in which data packets are looked at in detail Many VPNs have been blocked using this method Blogger Grey One suggests users trying to disguise VPN usage forward their VPN traffic through port because this port is also heavily used by web browsers for HTTPS connections However Grey points out this method is futile against advanced inspection Obfsproxy and other pluggable transports do allow users to evade deep packet inspection br The Tor anonymity network was and is subject to partial blocking by China s Great Firewall The Tor website is blocked when accessed over HTTP but it is reachable over HTTPS so it is possible for users to download the Tor Browser Bundle The Tor project also maintains a list of website mirrors in case the main Tor website is blocked br The Tor network maintains a public list of approximately entry relays almost all of them are blocked In addition to the public relays Tor maintains bridges which are non public relays Their purpose is to help censored users reach the Tor network The Great Firewall scrapes nearly all the bridge IPs distributed through bridges torproject org and email According to Winter s research paper published in April this blocking technique can be circumvented by using packet fragmentation or the Tor obfsproxy bundle in combination with private obfsproxy bridges Tor Obfs bridges still work in China as long as the IPs are discovered through social networks or self published bridges br Tor now primarily functions in China using Snowflake and meeks which works via front end proxies hosted on Content Delivery Networks CDNs to obfuscate the information coming to and from the source and destination it is a type of pluggable transport Examples are Microsoft s Azure and Cloudflare br br br Unintended methods br It was common in the past to use Google s cache feature to view blocked websites However this feature of Google seems to be under some level of blocking as access is now erratic and does not work for blocked websites Currently the block is mostly circumvented by using proxy servers outside the firewall and is not difficult to carry out for those determined to do so br The mobile Opera Mini browser uses a proxy based approach employing encryption and compression to speed up downloads This has the side effect of allowing it to circumvent several approaches to Internet censorship In this led the government of China to ban all but a special Chinese version of the browser br br br Using an analogy to bypass keyword filters br As the Great Firewall of China gets more sophisticated users are getting increasingly creative in the ways they elude the censorship such as by using analogies to discuss topics Furthermore users are becoming increasingly open in their mockery of them by actively using homophones to avoid censorship Deleted sites have been harmonized indicating CCP general secretary Hu Jintao s Internet censorship lies under the larger idea of creating a Socialist Harmonious Society For example censors are referred to as river crabs because in Chinese that phrase forms a homophone for harmony br br br Using steganography br According to The Guardian editor Charles Arthur Internet users in China have found more technical ways to get around the Great Firewall of China including using steganography a practice of embedding useful data in what looks like something irrelevant The text of a document can be broken into its constituent bytes which are added to the pixels of an innocent picture The effect is barely visible on the picture but the recipient can extract it with the right software br br br Voices br Rupert Murdoch famously proclaimed that advances in communications technology posed an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere and Ai Weiwei argued that the Chinese leaders must understand it s not possible for them to control the Internet unless they shut it off br However Nathan Freitas a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard and technical adviser to the Tibet Action Institute says There s a growing sense within China that widely used VPN services that were once considered untouchable are now being touched In June Jaime Blasco a security researcher at AlienVault in Silicon Valley reported that hackers possibly with the assistance of the Chinese government had found ways to circumvent the most popular privacy tools on the Internet virtual private networks or VPNs and Tor This is done with the aid of a particularly serious vulnerability known as JSONP that web services in China never patched As long as the users are logged into one of China s top web services such as Baidu QQ Taobao Sina Sohu and Ctrip the hackers can identify them and access their personal information even if they are using Tor or a VPN The vulnerability is not new it was published in a Chinese security and web forum around br br br Specific examples of evasion as Internet activism br The rapid increase of access to Internet in China has also created new opportunities for Internet activism For example in terms of journalism Marina Svensson s article on Media and Civil Society in China Community building and networking among investigative journalists and beyond illustrates that although Chinese journalists are not able to create their own private companies they are using informal connections online and offline that allows them to create a community that may allow them to go around state repression Specifically with the development of microblogging an increase in new community that are formed underlines a possibility of more open expressions of solidarity and ironic resistance However one shortcoming with Internet activism is digital inequality br In the number of Internet users reached million which was about a rate of for Internet penetration According to the Information and Communications Technologies Development Index IDI China exhibits high inequality in terms of regional and wealth differences br A study analysed memes of Kim Jong un by Chinese social media users Results has shown how publics can express political opinions even in a high censorship environment br br br Economic impact br According to the BBC local Chinese businesses such as Baidu Tencent and Alibaba some of the world s largest Internet enterprises benefited from the way China has blocked international rivals from the market encouraging domestic competition br According to Financial Times China s crackdown on VPN portals has brought business to state approved telecom companies Reuters reported that China s state newspaper has expanded its online censoring business The company s net income in has risen percent
