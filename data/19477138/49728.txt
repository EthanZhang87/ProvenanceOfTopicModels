Francisco Peninsula from Monterey which would become part of the El Camino Real route By Juan Bautista de Anza had arrived to the area to select the sites for a mission and presidio The first European maritime presence in San Francisco Bay occurred on August when the Spanish ship San Carlos commanded by Juan Manuel de Ayala became the first ship to anchor in the bay br Soon after on March Anza established the Presidio of San Francisco On October Mission San Francisco de As s also known as Mission Dolores was founded by Padre Francisco Pal u In the Presidio established the Castillo de San Joaqu n a fortification on the southern side of the Golden Gate which later came to be known as Fort Point br In the province of Alta California was created which included Yerba Buena which was the former name of San Francisco At its peak in the average population at the Mission Dolores settlement was about people br br br Mexican era br br In the Californias were ceded to Mexico by Spain The extensive California mission system gradually lost its influence during the period of Mexican rule Agricultural land became largely privatized as ranchos as was occurring in other parts of California

struck San Francisco and northern California As buildings collapsed from the shaking ruptured gas lines ignited fires that spread across the city and burned out of control for several days With water mains out of service the Presidio Artillery Corps attempted to contain the inferno by dynamiting blocks of buildings to create firebreaks More than three quarters of the city lay in ruins including almost all of the downtown core Contemporary accounts reported that people died though modern estimates put the number in the several thousands More than half of the city s population of was left

had been devastated The influential San Francisco Planning and Urban Research Association or SPUR was founded in to address the quality of housing after the earthquake The earthquake hastened development of western neighborhoods that survived the fire including Pacific Heights where many of the city s wealthy rebuilt their homes In turn the destroyed mansions of Nob Hill became grand hotels City Hall rose again in the Beaux Arts style and the city celebrated its rebirth at the Panama Pacific International Exposition in br br During this period San Francisco built some of its most important infrastructure Civil Engineer Michael O Shaughnessy was hired by San Francisco Mayor James Rolph as chief engineer for the city in September to supervise the construction of the Twin Peaks

Francisco An abundant water supply enabled San Francisco to develop into the city it has become today br br In ensuing years the city solidified its standing as a financial capital in the wake of the stock market crash not a single San Francisco based bank failed Indeed it was at the height of the Great Depression that San Francisco undertook two great civil engineering projects simultaneously constructing the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge and the Golden Gate Bridge completing them in and respectively It was in this period that the island of Alcatraz a former military stockade began its service as a federal maximum security prison housing notorious inmates such as Al Capone and Robert Franklin Stroud the Birdman of Alcatraz San Francisco later celebrated its regained grandeur with a

in the city an issue that remains today despite many attempts to address it br br The Loma Prieta earthquake caused destruction and loss of life throughout the Bay Area In San Francisco the quake severely damaged structures in the Marina and South of Market districts and precipitated the demolition of the damaged Embarcadero Freeway and much of the damaged Central Freeway allowing the city to reclaim The Embarcadero as its historic downtown waterfront and revitalizing the Hayes Valley neighborhood br The two recent decades have seen booms driven by the internet industry During the dot com boom of the late s startup companies invigorated the San Francisco economy Large numbers of entrepreneurs and computer application developers moved into the city followed by marketing design and sales professionals changing the social landscape as once poorer neighborhoods became increasingly gentrified Demand for new housing and office space ignited a second wave of high rise development this time in the South of Market district By the city s population reached new highs surpassing the previous record set in When the bubble burst in and again in many of these companies folded and their employees were laid off Yet high technology and entrepreneurship remain mainstays of the San Francisco economy By the mid s decade the social media boom had begun with San Francisco becoming a popular location for tech offices and a common place to live for people employed in Silicon Valley companies such as Apple and Google br The early s featured an exodus of tech companies from Downtown San Francisco in the wake of the COVID pandemic and struggles with homelessness and public drug use Although some observers have raised the possibility that office vacancies and declining tax revenues could cause San Francisco to enter an economic doom loop other sources have refuted this broad based characterization of the city as a whole asserting that the issues of concern are restricted primarily to the urban core of San Francisco As of March Union Square was in sorry shape and had lost its traditional position as the Bay Area s regional shopping hub to Westfield Valley Fair in San

nearby San Andreas and Hayward Faults are responsible for much earthquake activity although neither physically passes through the city itself The San Andreas Fault caused the earthquakes in and Minor earthquakes occur on a regular basis The threat of major earthquakes plays a large role in the city s infrastructure development The city constructed an auxiliary water supply system and has repeatedly upgraded its building codes requiring retrofits for older buildings and higher engineering standards for new construction However there are still thousands of smaller buildings that remain vulnerable to quake damage USGS has released the California earthquake forecast which models earthquake occurrence in California br San Francisco s shoreline has grown beyond its natural limits Entire neighborhoods such as the Marina Mission Bay and Hunters Point as well as large sections of the Embarcadero sit on areas of landfill Treasure Island was constructed from material dredged from the bay as well as material resulting from the excavation of the Yerba Buena Tunnel through Yerba Buena Island during the construction of the Bay Bridge Such land tends to be unstable during earthquakes The resulting soil liquefaction causes extensive damage to property built upon it as was evidenced in the Marina district during the Loma Prieta earthquake A few natural lakes and creeks Lake Merced Mountain Lake Pine Lake Lobos Creek El Polin Spring are within parks and remain protected in what is essentially their original form but most of the city s natural watercourses such as Islais Creek

large middle class area with a predominantly Asian population br The northwestern quadrant of the city contains the Richmond a mostly middle class neighborhood north of Golden Gate Park home to immigrants from other parts of Asia as well as many Russian and Ukrainian immigrants Together these areas are known as The Avenues These two districts are each sometimes further divided into two regions the Outer Richmond and Outer Sunset can refer to the more western portions of their respective district and the Inner Richmond and Inner Sunset can refer to the more eastern portions br Many piers remained derelict for years until the demolition of the Embarcadero Freeway reopened the downtown waterfront allowing for redevelopment The centerpiece of the port the Ferry Building while still receiving commuter ferry traffic has been restored and redeveloped as a gourmet marketplace br br br Climate br br San Francisco has a warm summer Mediterranean climate K ppen Csb characteristic of California s coast with moist winters and dry summers San Francisco s weather is strongly influenced by the cool currents of the Pacific Ocean on the west side of the city and the water of San Francisco Bay to the north and east This moderates temperature swings and produces a remarkably mild year round climate with little seasonal temperature variation br Among major U S cities San Francisco has the coolest daily mean maximum and minimum temperatures for June July and August br During the summer rising hot air in California s interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate which creates the city s characteristic cool winds and fog The fog is less pronounced in eastern neighborhoods and during the late
