Du linn d i l in in the local dialect The name refers to a dark tidal pool on the site of the castle gardens at the rear of Dublin Castle where the River Poddle entered the Liffey br Historically scribes writing in Gaelic script used a b with a dot over it to represent a modern bh resulting in Du i linn Those without knowledge of Irish omitted the dot spelling the name as Dublin The Middle Irish pronunciation is preserved in the names for the city in other languages such as Old English Difelin Old Norse Dyflin modern Icelandic Dyflinn and modern Manx Divlyn as well as Welsh Dulyn and

discovered closer to the old settlement of the city of Dublin on the south quays near St James s Gate which also indicate mesolithic human activity br Ptolemy s map of Ireland of about AD provides possibly the earliest reference to a settlement near Dublin Ptolemy the Greco Roman astronomer and cartographer called it Eblana polis Greek br br Dublin celebrated its official millennium in meaning the Irish government recognised as the year in which the city was settled and that this first settlement would later become the city of Dublin br It is now thought the Viking settlement of about was preceded by a Christian ecclesiastical settlement known as Duibhlinn from which Dyflin took its name Evidence indicating that Anglo Saxons occupied Dublin before the Vikings arrived in has been found in an archaeological dig in Temple Bar br Beginning in the th and th centuries there were two settlements which later became modern Dublin The subsequent Scandinavian settlement centred on the River Poddle a tributary of the Liffey in an area now known as Wood Quay The Dubhlinn was a pool on the lowest stretch of the Poddle where ships used to moor This pool was finally fully infilled during the
