The Timken Company is a global manufacturer of bearings and power transmission products Timken operates from countries br br br Company history br br In Henry Timken obtained a patent for an improved tapered roller bearing and in incorporated as The Timken Roller Bearing Axle Company in St Louis br In the company moved to Canton Ohio as the automobile industry began to overtake the carriage industry Timken and his two sons chose this location because of its proximity to the American car manufacturing centers of Detroit and Cleveland and the American steel making centers of Pittsburgh and Cleveland br In the company began steel and tube making operations in Canton to vertically integrate and maintain better control over the steel used in its bearings World War I had created an increase in demand for steel affecting its supply and price in the market br Timken entered international markets in the early s establishing a presence initially in Great Britain France and Germany The performance of Timken tapered roller bearings in World War I military equipment made an impression on the European bearing market After the war Great Britain rose to the position of in the global automotive manufacturing market creating opportunities for Timken to expand its European manufacturing presence br Timken entered the Great Depression in a strong financial position and its performance placed it in the ranks of the most solid well managed industrial firms of the s Expanding into non automotive markets like agriculture machine tooling industrial and rail softened the impact br During World War II Timken production increased dramatically to keep up with wartime demand For instance every U S jeep was built using Timken bearings With jeeps delivered to the U S military Timken delivered more than million bearings for those vehicles over the course of the war Following the war much of the machinery shipped to Europe under the Marshall Plan was Timken bearing equipped helping Timken establish a broader presence in a bearing market where European competitors had dominated br By Timken had operations in the U S Canada Great Britain France South Africa Australia and Brazil Timken Research was created in to establish technological leadership and to help standardize research and development processes across the company br Timken expanded into new

Spain Hong Kong China and Singapore br Timken acquired its competitor The Torrington Company in for million doubling the size of the company and creating the world s third largest bearing manufacturer at that time br The company changed its corporate structure in the roller bearing producing part of the company was separated from the steel producing part of the company resulting in two separate companies The Timken Company continues to manufacture roller bearings while TimkenSteel which changed its name to Metallus in produces steel br Timken entered the linear motion space in with the acquisition of Rollon a leader in linear guides telescopic rails and linear actuators and systems used in a wide range of industrial and commercial applications To further expand and strengthen its position in the attractive linear motion space Timken acquired iMS in and added Nadella s complementary product portfolio in br In Timken expanded its Industrial Motion segment with the acquisitions of Des Case Rosa Sistemi and Lagersmit The company also bolstered its engineered bearings portfolio in with the acquisitions of American Roller Bearing and Engineered Solutions Group iMECH br br br
