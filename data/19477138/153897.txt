id: 153897
A ticker symbol or stock symbol is an abbreviation used to uniquely identify publicly traded shares of a particular stock on a particular stock market In short ticker symbols are arrangements of symbols or characters generally Latin letters or digits representing specific assets or securities listed on a stock exchange or traded publicly A stock symbol may consist of letters numbers or a combination of both Ticker symbol refers to the symbols that were printed on the ticker tape of a ticker tape machine br br br Interpreting the symbol br Stock symbols are unique identifiers assigned to each security traded on a particular market A stock symbol can consist of letters numbers or a combination of both and is a way to uniquely identify that stock The symbols were kept as short as possible to reduce the number of characters that had to be printed on the ticker tape and to make it easy to recognize by traders and investors br The allocation of symbols and formatting conventions is specific to each stock exchange In the US for example stock tickers are typically between and letters and represent the company name where possible For example US based computer company stock Apple Inc traded on the NASDAQ exchange has the symbol AAPL while the motor company Ford s stock that is traded on the New York Stock Exchange has the single letter ticker F In Europe most exchanges use three letter codes for example Dutch consumer goods company Unilever traded on the Amsterdam Euronext exchange has the symbol UNA In Asia numbers are often used as stock tickers to avoid issues for international investors when using non Latin scripts For example the bank HSBC s stock traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange has the ticker symbol br Symbols sometimes change to reflect mergers Prior to the merger with Mobil Oil Exxon used a phonetic spelling of the company XON as its ticker symbol The symbol of the firm after the merger was XOM Symbols are sometimes reused In the US the single letter symbols are particularly sought after as vanity symbols For example since March of Visa Inc has used the symbol V that had previously been used by Vivendi which had delisted and given up the symbol br To fully qualify a stock both the ticker and the exchange or country of listing needs to be known On many systems both must be specified to uniquely identify the security This is often done by appending the location or exchange code to the ticker br br br Other identifiers br Although stock tickers identify a security they are exchange dependent generally limited to stocks and can change These limitations have led to the development of other codes in financial markets to identify securities for settlement purposes The most prevalent of these is the International Securities Identifying Number ISIN An ISIN uniquely identifies a security and its structure is defined in ISO Securities for which ISINs are issued include bonds commercial paper stocks and warrants The ISIN code is a character alpha numerical code that does not contain information characterizing financial instruments but serves for uniform identification of a security at trading and settlement br The ISIN identifies the security not the exchange if any on which it trades it is therefore not a replacement for the ticker symbol For instance Daimler AG stock trades on twenty two different stock exchanges worldwide and is priced in five foreign currencies it has the same ISIN on each DE though not the same ticker symbol ISIN cannot specify a particular trade in this case and another identifier typically the three or four letter exchange code such as the Market Identifier Code will have to be specified in addition to the ISIN br br br Symbol for stock market indices br While usually a stock ticker identifies a security that can be traded stock market indices are also sometimes assigned a symbol even though they can generally not be traded Symbols for indices are usually distinguished by adding a symbol in front of the name such as a circumflex or caret or a dot For example Reuters lists the Nasdaq Composite index under the symbol IXIC br br br Symbols by country br br br Australia br In Australia the Australian Securities Exchange uses the following conventions br Three character base symbol with the first and third character being alphanumeric and the second alphabetic ETFs and ETMFs can be either or characters Exchange traded warrants and exchange traded options are six characters ETOs can have numbers in the sixth character br br br Canada br In Canada the Toronto Stock Exchange TSX and the TSXV use the following special codes after the ticker symbol br br br United Kingdom br In the United Kingdom prior to stock codes were known as EPICs named after the London Stock Exchange s Exchange Price Information Computer e g MKS for Marks and Spencer Following the introduction of the Sequence trading platform in EPICs were renamed Tradable Instrument Display Mnemonics TIDM but they are still widely referred to as EPICs Stocks can also be identified using their SEDOL Stock Exchange Daily Official List number or their ISIN International Securities Identification Number br br br United States br In the United States modern letter only ticker symbols were developed by Standard Poor s S P to bring a national standard to investing Previously a single company could have many ticker symbols as they varied between the dozens of individual stock markets The term ticker refers to the noise made by the ticker tape machines once widely used by stock exchanges br The S P system was later standardized by the securities industry and modified as the years passed Stock symbols for preferred stock have not been standardized br Some companies use a well known product as their ticker symbol Belgian brewer AB InBev the brewer of Budweiser beer uses BUD symbolizing its premier product in the United States as its three letter ticker for American Depository Receipts Its rival the Molson Coors Brewing Company uses a similarly beer related symbol TAP Likewise Southwest Airlines pays tribute to its headquarters at Love Field in Dallas through its LUV symbol Cedar Fair Entertainment Company which operates large amusement parks in the United States uses FUN as its symbol Harley Davidson uses HOG an abbreviation for the corporate sponsored Harley Owners Group Yamana Gold uses AUY because on the periodic table of elements Au is the symbol for gold Sotheby s an auction house previously used the symbol BID Petco uses the symbol WOOF br While most symbols come from the company s name sometimes it happens the other way around Tricon Global owner of KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell adopted the symbol YUM to represent its corporate mission when the company was spun out of PepsiCo in In the company changed its name to match its symbol adopting the name Yum Brands br Symbols sometimes change to reflect mergers Before the merger with Mobil Exxon used a phonetic spelling of the company XON as its ticker symbol The symbol of the firm after the merger was XOM After Hewlett Packard merged with Compaq the new firm took on the ticker symbol HPQ The former symbols were HWP and CPQ AT T s ticker symbol is T accordingly the company is referred to simply as Telephone on Wall Street the T symbol is so well known that when SBC purchased the company it took the AT T name capitalizing on its history and keeping the desired single letter symbol br Some examples of US Stock symbols include br br A Agilent Technologies br AAPL Apple br BRK A B Berkshire

Corporation br TXN Texas Instruments br XOM ExxonMobil br WOOF Petco br WMT Walmart br Formerly a glance at a U S stock symbol and its appended codes would allow an investor to determine where a stock trades however in July the SEC approved a rule change allowing companies moving from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq to retain their three letter symbols DirecTV was one of the first companies to make this move When first implemented the rule change did not apply to companies with one or two letter symbols but subsequently any stock was able to move from the NYSE to the Nasdaq without changing its symbol CA Technologies which traded under the symbol CA before it was acquired in moved from the NYSE to the Nasdaq in April and kept its two letter symbol br br br Single letter
