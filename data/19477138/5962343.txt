Amazon Simple Storage Service S is a service offered by Amazon Web Services AWS that provides object storage through a web service interface Amazon S uses the same scalable storage infrastructure that Amazon com uses to run its e commerce network Amazon S can store any type of object which allows uses like storage for Internet applications backups disaster recovery data archives data lakes for analytics and hybrid cloud storage AWS launched Amazon S in the United States on March then in Europe in November br br br Technical details br br br Design br Amazon S manages data with an object storage architecture which aims to provide scalability high availability and low latency with high durability The basic storage units of Amazon S are objects which are organized into buckets Each object is identified by a unique user assigned key Buckets can be managed using the console provided by Amazon S programmatically with the AWS SDK or the REST application programming interface Objects can be up to five terabytes in size Requests are authorized using an access control list associated with each object bucket and support versioning which is disabled by default Since buckets are typically the size of an entire file system mount in other systems this access control scheme is very coarse grained In other words unique access controls cannot be associated with individual files Amazon S can be used to replace static web hosting infrastructure with HTTP client accessible objects index document support and error document support br The Amazon AWS authentication mechanism allows the creation of authenticated URLs valid for a specified amount of time Every item in a bucket can also be served as a BitTorrent feed The Amazon S store can act as a seed host for a torrent and any BitTorrent client can retrieve the file This can drastically reduce the bandwidth cost for the download of popular objects A bucket can be configured to save HTTP log information to a sibling bucket this can be used in data mining operations There are various User Mode File System FUSE based file systems for Unix like operating systems for example Linux that can be used to mount an S bucket as a file system The semantics of the Amazon S file system are not that of a POSIX file system so the file system may not behave entirely as expected br br br Amazon S storage classes br Amazon S offers nine different storage classes with different levels of durability availability and performance requirements br br Amazon S Standard is the default It is general purpose storage for frequently accessed data br Amazon S Express One Zone is a single digit millisecond latency storage for frequently accessed data and latency sensitive applications It stores data only in one availability zone br Amazon S Standard Infrequent Access Standard IA is designed for less frequently accessed data such as backups and disaster recovery data br Amazon S One Zone Infrequent Access One Zone IA performs like the Standard IA but stores data only in one availability zone br Amazon S Intelligent Tiering moves objects automatically to a more cost efficient storage class br Amazon S on Outposts brings storage to installations not hosted by Amazon br Amazon S Glacier Instant Retrieval is a low cost storage for rarely accessed data but which still requires rapid retrieval br Amazon S Glacier Flexible Retrieval is also a low cost option for long lived data it offers retrieval speeds ranging from minutes to hours br Amazon S Glacier Deep Archive is the lowest cost storage for long lived archive data that is accessed less than once per year and is retrieved asynchronously br The Amazon S Glacier storage classes above are distinct from Amazon Glacier which is a separate product with its own APIs br br br File size limits br An object in S can be between bytes and TB If an object is larger than TB it must be divided into chunks prior to uploading When uploading Amazon S allows a maximum of GB in a single upload operation hence objects larger than GB must be uploaded via the S multipart upload API br br br Uses br br br Notable users br Photo hosting service SmugMug has used Amazon S since April They experienced a number of initial outages and slowdowns but after one year they described it as being considerably more reliable than our own internal storage and claimed to have saved almost million in storage costs br Netflix uses Amazon S as their system of record Netflix implemented a tool S mper to address the Amazon S limitations of eventual consistency S mper stores the filesystem metadata filenames directory structure and permissions in Amazon DynamoDB br Reddit is hosted on Amazon S br Bitcasa and Tahoe LAFS on S among others use Amazon S for online backup and synchronization services In Dropbox stopped using Amazon S services and developed its own cloud server br Swiftype s CEO has mentioned that the company uses Amazon S br br br S API and competing services br The broad adoption of Amazon S and related tooling has given rise to competing services based on the S API These services use the standard programming interface but are differentiated by their underlying technologies and business models A standard interface enables better competition from rival providers and allows economies of scale in implementation among other benefits br br br History br br Amazon Web Services introduced Amazon S in br br In November AWS added default encryption capabilities at bucket level br br br See also br Amazon Elastic Block Storage
