the prior year and the chain reported a US million loss in contrast to a US million for the same quarter in However with the Xbox Series X and PlayStation still planned for release in the latter part of Sherman expected to be able to recover from these losses br In mid March GameStop faced criticism for its response to the COVID pandemic in North America with employees and social media users accusing the company of placing its business ahead of the safety of its staff and customers in order to capitalize on an influx of video game purchases and related products for entertainment during the pandemic and related lockdowns GameStop stated that it would suspend in store events including midnight launches and the use of demo stations perform additional cleaning and structure lines and limit store capacity to enforce physical distancing To prevent enlarged crowds for two high profile video game releases on March Animal Crossing New Horizons and Doom Eternal GameStop announced that it would begin selling Doom Eternal in its stores a day ahead of its official release date br Polygon reported on March that several stores in the San Francisco area had remained open seemingly in

were to be provided by corporate requiring them to purchase them on their own and request reimbursement br A memo obtained by Kotaku on March indicated that GameStop saw itself as an essential business because some of its technology products are relevant to enhancing remote work required in many cases during the pandemic GameStop reiterated the safety measures that it had put in place and also announced that it would reduce store hours and suspend all trade ins until at least March and offer curbside pickup An employee of a GameStop store in Athens Georgia which was shut down on March by order of the police to comply with a similar order in Athens Clark County disputed the argument saying that the high end gaming oriented peripherals such as keyboards and mice sold at GameStop were not necessarily essential for remote work and that cheaper alternatives were readily available at stores allowed to remain open such as Walmart br California had announced a state wide stay at home order on March while GameStop had originally stated to its stores it was an essential retail business by March GameStop instead decided to close down its California branches while keeping most other nationwide stores open Following similar stay at home orders in New York and Illinois over the following days GameStop announced that it would close all locations effective March with selected locations continuing to offer contact free curbside pickup where an employee wearing either gloves or a bag over their hands would slip the customer s order through the front door remaining behind the glass and home delivery In early April a location in Dorchester Boston received a nuisance citation by local police who deemed the curbside pickup a violation of the Massachusetts stay at home order GameStop subsequently ceased offering curbside pickup in the state br br br Canadian division pandemic response br GameStop s Canadian subsidiary EB Games faced similar criticism on March as well as morning lineups for the new Animal Crossing and Doom games at a Toronto location induced large public gatherings discouraged by officials The city s public health chief Eileen de Villa stated that the gathering did not line up with what we expect from those in our community who are interested in protecting and strengthening our community Mayor John Tory accused the company of placing commerce above the public interest while Premier of Ontario Doug Ford stated that everyone in this province has a responsibility to make sure we protect each other and I am very very disappointed in the store owner that would do this EB Games later announced that it would close all Canadian stores on March br br br Australian division pandemic response br br GameStop s Australian subsidiary EB Games Australia was the only arm of the global GameStop business not to report huge COVID related losses with sales instead soaring by per cent In Australia COVID lockdowns were managed by the Australian Federal Government National Cabinet which largely permitted retail stores to remain open with capacity limits in place This meant unlike other arms of the GameStop business the Australian arms stores remained open for the substantial majority of the pandemic National Cabinet only mandated some brief regionally targeted entire store closures with stores in the Australian state of Victoria being the most heavily impacted For fiscal year the Australian arm reported net sales of US million and operating earnings of US million This was an increase of US million in operating earnings compared to the pre pandemic Fiscal Year where the company posted net sales of US million and operating earnings of US million br br br January short squeeze br br In January trading activity around a short squeeze resulted in a increase in GameStop s share price over the course of two weeks reaching an all time intraday high of over US As of January on the New York Stock Exchange This effect was mainly attributed to short sellers using illegal business practices causing the stock to be shorted over percent of the free float of the company br There is uncertainty around the size of the effect of short sellers closing their position The SEC released a report claiming While a short squeeze did not appear to be the main driver of events and a gamma squeeze less likely the episode highlights the role and potential impact of short selling and short covering br br br Other news in br In February GameStop announced that its finance chief Jim Bell appointed in June would leave the company on
