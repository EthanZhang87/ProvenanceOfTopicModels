served as CEO until br In the late s Lucien Bronicki worked in a government physics laboratory where he developed a turbine to produce electricity from a range of energy sources including solar the process is known as the organic Rankine cycle which he co developed with Harry Zvi Tabor He retired from the lab to commercialize his ideas In its early years the company focused exclusively on manufacturing power generation equipment br The s energy crisis increased interest in efficient generation technology The firm obtained financial assistance from the Israeli government and raised capital from private investors to build one of the world s first solar driven power stations However the power station was not economically viable and was abandoned in br During the s the firm developed generation systems utilizing recovered energy i e heat emitted during industrial processes It also applied its technology to generate electricity from geothermal sources br In the firm designed and supplied geothermal power systems to the Kawerau Power Station in New Zealand Since then it has built geothermal power plants in that country In the firm supplied geothermal equipment for the regional heating system at Sudurnes Iceland utilizing the abundant local geothermal resources to provide heating for people br In the s the firm decided not only to provide power generation equipment but also to own and operate alternative and renewable energy power stations br In the firm then as Ormat Industries became listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange In Ormat acquired a controlling stake of Bet Shemesh Engines a manufacturer of parts for jet engines that also overhauls maintains and assembles jet engines In Ormat sold its shares in the company br In Ormat

power plants in US Guatemala Kenya Honduras and Guadeloupe br br br Technologies br br br Thermal energy br The firm s core technology is the Ormat Energy Converter power generation unit It converts low and medium temperature heat into electrical energy with low or zero emission of CO and pollutants The main components are a vaporizer preheater turbo generator air cooled or water cooled condenser feed pump and controls The firm has installed more than MW of geothermal and recovered energy generation REG power units based on this technology br The technology is optimized for use in geothermal energy generation and the firm is the third largest geothermal producer in the United States The technology is also suitable for recovered energy power generation which converts waste heat from industrial processes into electricity that can be used on site or sold to power generation utilities The firm s recovered energy technology was deployed in projects in Germany Canada India USA New Zealand and Japan br br br Solar energy br In the s Ormat built and operated one of the world s first power stations to produce electricity from solar energy located just north of the Dead Sea in Israel The plant utilized a solar pond a large scale solar thermal energy collector with integral heat storage It was the largest operating solar pond ever built for electricity generation and operated until It had an area of m and gave an electrical output of MW br After the decommissioning of the solar pond project the firm was not active in the solar energy market until its entry into the Solar PV market br br br Oil sands br Ormat s former parent company Ormat Industries Ltd developed an energy efficient technology OrCrude for extracting crude oil from oil sands The process is claimed to be more efficient than other technologies as it includes gasification which substantially reduces the requirement for natural gas typically the largest input cost in an in situ oil sands project The technology is used in the Long Lake project a former joint venture between Nexen and OPTI Canada In Ormat Industries sold all its holdings in OPTI Canada In OPTI Canada was acquired by CNOOC Luxembourg S r l an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CNOOC Limited br br br Spin offs br Ormat has been involved in the establishment and development of several companies br Orbotech develops
