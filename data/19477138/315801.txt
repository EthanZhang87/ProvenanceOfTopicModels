United States Steel Corporation more commonly known as U S Steel is an American integrated steel producer headquartered in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania with production operations primarily in the United States of America and in Central Europe The company produces and sells steel products including flat rolled and tubular products for customers in industries across automotive construction consumer electrical industrial equipment distribution and energy Operations also include iron ore and coke production facilities br It was the eighth largest steel producer in the world in By the company was the world s th largest steel producer and the second largest in the United States behind Nucor Corporation Though renamed USX Corporation in the company was renamed United States Steel in after spinning off its energy business including Marathon Oil and other assets from its core steel concern br Pending regulatory and shareholder approval US Steel is set to be acquired by Nippon Steel Japan s largest steel producing company for US billion The deal announced in mid December retains US Steel s name and headquarters in Pittsburgh However the Biden Administration would oppose Nippon Steel s bid to acquire U S Steel by March the proposed acquisition was also opposed by the United Steelworkers br br br History br br br Formation br br J P Morgan formed U S Steel on March incorporated on February by financing the merger of Andrew Carnegie s Carnegie Steel Company with Elbert H Gary s Federal Steel Company and William Henry Judge Moore s National Steel Company for million billion today At one time U S Steel was the largest steel producer and largest corporation in the world It was capitalized at billion billion today making it the world s first billion dollar corporation The company established its headquarters in the Empire Building at Broadway in New York City it remained a major tenant in the building for years Charles M Schwab the Carnegie Steel executive who originally suggested the merger to Morgan ultimately emerged as the new corporation s first President br In U S Steel bought its largest competitor the Tennessee Coal Iron and Railroad Company which was headquartered in Birmingham Alabama Tennessee Coal was replaced in the Dow Jones Industrial Average by the General Electric Company The federal government attempted to use federal antitrust laws to break up U S Steel in the same year Standard Oil was broken up but that effort ultimately failed In its first full year of operation U S Steel made percent of all the steel produced in the United States About years later as of it produced only percent more than it did in and its shipments accounted for only about percent of domestic consumption br According to the author Douglas Blackmon in Slavery by Another Name the growth of U S Steel and its subsidiaries in the South was partly dependent on the labor of cheaply paid black workers and exploited convicts The company could obtain black labor at a fraction of the cost of white labor by taking advantage of the Black Codes and discriminatory laws passed in the late th and early th centuries by Southern states after the Reconstruction Era In addition U S Steel had agreements with more than counties in Alabama to obtain the labor of its prisoners often paying locals nine dollars a month for workers who would be forced into their mines through a system of convict leasing This practice continued until at least the late s While some individuals were guilty of a crime they did not receive payment or recognition for their work many died from abuse malnutrition and dire working and living conditions This practice of convict leasing was fairly ubiquitous as eight Southern states had similar practices and many companies as well as farmers took advantage of this br The Corporation as it was known on Wall Street was distinguished by its size rather than for its efficiency or creativity during its heyday In it controlled two thirds of steel production and through its Pittsburgh Steamship Company developed the largest commercial fleet on the Great Lakes Because of heavy debts taken on at the company s formation Carnegie insisted on being paid in gold bonds for his stake and fears of antitrust litigation U S Steel moved cautiously Competitors often innovated faster especially Bethlehem Steel run by Charles Schwab U S Steel s former president U S Steel s share of the expanding market slipped to percent by James A Farrell was named president in and served until br In March the company formed the Committee on Safety of United States Steel following chairman Elbert H Gary s meetings on safety with casualty managers of the operating companies thereby leading to the introduction of the modern Safety First movement The committee s formation was intended not only to prevent worker accidents but to safeguard the company against criticisms and legal liability br br br Mid century br U S Steel ranked th among United States corporations in the value of World War II production contracts Production peaked at more than million tons in Its employment was greatest in when it had more than employees br The federal government intervened to try to control U S Steel President Harry S Truman attempted to take over its steel mills in to resolve a crisis with its union the United Steelworkers of America The Supreme Court blocked the takeover by ruling that the president did not have the Constitutional authority to seize the mills President John F Kennedy was more successful in when he pressured the steel industry into reversing price increases that Kennedy considered dangerously inflationary br According to the author Dan Carter in The Politics Of Rage George Wallace The Origins Of The New Conservatism And The Transformation Of American Politics U S Steel strongly resisted Kennedy administration efforts to enlist Alabama businesses to support the desegregation of the University of Alabama which Gov George Wallace had promised to block by standing in the schoolhouse door Although the firm employed more than workers in Birmingham Ala company president Roger M Blough in went out of his way to announce that any attempt to use his company position in Birmingham to pressure local whites was repugnant to me personally and repugnant to my fellow officers at U S Steel br In the postwar years the steel industry and heavy manufacturing went through a restructuring that caused a decline in U S Steel s need for labor production and portfolio Many jobs moved offshore By the company employed people br br br The USX period br In the early days of the Reagan Administration steel firms won substantial tax breaks in order to compete with imported goods But instead of modernizing their mills steel companies shifted capital out of steel and into more profitable areas In March U S Steel took its concessions and paid billion in cash and billion in loans for Marathon Oil saving approximately million in taxes through the merger The architect of tax concessions to steel firms Senator Arlen Specter R PA complained that we go out on a limb in Congress and we feel they should be putting it in steel The events are the subject of The U S Steal Song by folk singer Anne Feeney br In the federal government prevented U S Steel from acquiring National Steel and political pressure from the United States Congress as well as the United Steelworkers USW forced the company to abandon plans to import British Steel Corporation slabs U S Steel finally acquired National Steel s assets in after National Steel went bankrupt As part of its diversification plan U S Steel had acquired Marathon Oil on January as well as Texas Oil and Gas several years later Recognizing its new scope it reorganized its holdings as USX Corporation in with U S Steel renamed USS Inc as a major subsidiary br About USX employees stopped work on August after the United Steelworkers of America and the company could not agree on new employee contract terms This was characterized by the company as a strike and by the union as a lockout This resulted in most USX facilities becoming idle until February seriously degrading the steel division s market share A compromise was brokered and accepted by the union membership on January On February three days after the agreement had been reached to end the work stoppage USX announced that four USX plants would remain closed permanently eliminating about union jobs br Corporate raider Carl Icahn launched a hostile takeover of the steel giant in late in the midst of the work stoppage He conducted separate negotiations with the union and with management and proceeded to have proxy battles with shareholders and management But he abandoned all efforts to buy out the company on January a few weeks before union employees returned to work br br br Recent history br br At the end of the twentieth century the corporation was deriving much of its revenue and net income from its energy operations Led by CEO Thomas Usher U S Steel spun off Marathon and other non steel assets except railroad company Transtar in October It expanded internationally for the first time by purchasing operations in Slovakia and Serbia br In the early s U S Steel began investing to upgrade software programs throughout their manufacturing facilities br In January U S Steel sold its Serbian mills outside Belgrade to the Serbian government as their operations had been running at an economic loss br On July U S Steel was removed from S P index and placed in the S P MidCap Index in light of its declining market capitalization br In October U S Steel announced a million investment in Big River Steel which became the first steel facility to be LEED certified in in exchange for a ownership interest In December U S Steel announced it would acquire the remaining ownership interest in Big River Steel for million The acquisition was completed in January br In February U S Steel began construction on a new mill in Osceola Arkansas which will be operational by In April the electric arc furnace flat rolled Big River Steel mill in Osceola became the first ResponsibleSteel site certified in North America following an independent audit by SRI Quality System Registrar SRI br On December Nippon Steel announced an agreement with U S Steel to purchase the company for billion USD or USD per share pending regulatory approval The company agreed to maintain a headquarters for US Steel in its hometown of Pittsburgh and honor all steelworker union contracts br However the deal received widespread criticism including from prominent steelworkers labor union United Steelworkers USW On March U S President Joe Biden declared that U S Steel must remain American owned stating the proposed acquisition by Nippon Steel would pose a risk to national security and also declared that he would use U S regulatory authorities to scuttle the deal After this revelation it was noted the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States CFIUS had the authority to block the acquisition based on national security matters According to USW President David McCall Biden s decision should end the debate br br br Railroad ownership br U S Steel once owned the Northampton and Bath Railroad The N B was an kilometer mi shortline railroad built in that served Atlas Cement in Northampton Pennsylvania and Keystone Cement in Bath Pennsylvania By cement shipments had dropped off such that the railroad was no longer economically viable and U S Steel abandoned the line A kilometer mi section of track was retained to serve Atlas Cement The remainder of the right of way was transformed into the Nor Bath Trail U S Steel also owned the Atlantic City Mine Railroad whose mile km line in Wyoming operated from until and served an iron ore mine north of Atlantic City Wyoming br Through its Transtar subsidiary U S Steel also owned other railroads that served its mines and mills Those properties included the Duluth Missabe Iron Range Railway in the iron mining region of northeast Minnesota the Elgin Joliet Eastern that served its Gary Works in northwest Indiana the Birmingham Southern Railroad serving the U S Steel mill in Birmingham Alabama and the Bessemer Lake Erie and Union railroads in western Pennsylvania that delivered iron ore and provided plant switching services at its mill complex in Braddock Pennsylvania and coke works in Clairton Pennsylvania br U S Steel also owned a large Great Lakes commercial freighter fleet under the Pittsburgh Steamship Company that transported its raw materials from the Duluth area to Ashtabula Ohio Gary Indiana and Conneaut Ohio The laker fleet the B LE and the DM IR were acquired by Canadian National after U S Steel sold most of Transtar to that company The ships are leased out to a different domestic operator because of the United States cabotage law br br br Inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average br U S Steel is a former Dow Jones Industrial Average component listed from April to May It was removed under its USX Corporation name with Navistar International and Primerica An original member of the S P since U S Steel was removed from that index on July due to declining market capitalization br br br Dividend history br The Board of Directors considers the declaration of dividends four times each year with checks for dividends declared on common stock mailed for receipt on March June September and December In the dividend was per share the highest in company history but on April it was reduced to per share In February the dividend was reduced to per share but was then later increased back to per share in November Dividends may be paid by mailed check direct electronic deposit into a bank account or be reinvested in additional shares of U S Steel common stock br br br Legal issues br br br Labor br U S Steel maintained the labor policies of Andrew Carnegie Carnegie believed that good wages and good workmen I know to be cheap labor The Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers union that represented workers at the Homestead Pennsylvania plant was for many years broken after a violent strike in U S Steel defeated another strike in the year it was founded U S Steel built the city of Gary Indiana in and years later it remained the location of the largest integrated steel mill in the Northern Hemisphere U S Steel reached a d tente with unions during World War I when under pressure from the Wilson Administration it relaxed its opposition to unions enough to allow some to operate in certain factories It returned to its previous policies as soon as the war ended however and in a strike defeated union organizing efforts by William Z Foster of the AFL br Heavy pressure from public opinion forced the company to give up its hour day and adopt the standard eight hour day During the s U S Steel like many other large employers coupled paternalistic employment practices with employee representation plans ERPs which were company unions sponsored by management These ERPs eventually became an important factor leading to the organization of the United Steelworkers of America The company dropped its hard line anti union stance in when Myron Taylor then president of U S Steel agreed to recognize the Steel Workers Organizing Committee an arm of the Congress of Industrial Organizations CIO led by John L Lewis Taylor was an outsider brought in during the Great Depression to rescue U S Steel Watching the upheaval caused by the United Auto Workers successful sit down strike in Flint Michigan and convinced that Lewis was someone he could deal with on a businesslike basis Taylor sought stability through collective bargaining br Still U S Steel worked hand in hand with the Birmingham Alabama Police Department as it vigorously investigated and targeted labor activities during the s and s The corporation developed and fed information to a Red Squad of detectives who used the city s vagrancy and criminal anarchy statutes liberally reinforced by backroom beatings to strike at radical labor organizers In the s those investigations shifted from labor to civil rights activists br The Steelworkers continue to have a contentious relationship with U S Steel but far less so than the relationship that other unions had with employers in other industries in the United States They launched a number of long strikes against U S Steel in and a day strike in but those strikes were over wages and benefits and not the more fundamental issue of union recognition that led to violent strikes elsewhere br The Steelworkers union attempted to mollify the problems of competitive foreign imports by entering into a so called Experimental Negotiation Agreement ENA in This was to provide for arbitration if the parties were not able to reach an agreement on any new collective bargaining agreements thereby preventing disruptive strikes The ENA failed to stop the decline of the steel industry in the U S br U S Steel and the other employers terminated the ENA in In U S Steel employees stopped work after a dispute over contract terms characterized by the company as a strike and by the union as a lockout In a letter to striking employees in Johnston warned There are not enough seats in the steel lifeboat for everybody In addition to reducing the role of unions the steel industry had sought to induce the federal government to take action to counteract the dumping of steel by foreign producers at below market prices Neither the concessions nor anti dumping laws have restored the industry to the health and prestige it once had br In December a new four year contract was ratified between members of the United Steelworkers union and U S Steel This contract covers workers at locations The new agreements were retroactive to September and included a base wage increase each year for the four years a bonus upon ratification of the deal hour increase in hourly contributions to the Steel Workers Pension Trust hour increase in k contributions and uncapped profit sharing br br br Environmental record br During the Donora smog an air inversion trapped industrial effluent air pollution from the American Steel and Wire plant and U S Steel s Donora Zinc Works in Donora Pennsylvania br br In three days people died After the inversion lifted another died including Lukasz Musial the father of baseball great Stan Musial Hundreds more lived the rest of their lives with damaged lungs and hearts But another years would pass before the whole truth about Donora s bad air made public health history br Today the Donora Smog Museum in that city tells of the influence that the hazardous Donora Smog had on the air quality standards enacted by the federal government in subsequent years br Researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute have ranked U S Steel as the th greatest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States down from their ranking as the second greatest In the company released more than one million kg million pounds of toxins chiefly ammonia hydrochloric acid ethylene zinc compounds methanol and benzene but including manganese cyanide and chromium compounds In the city of River Rouge Michigan and the residents of River Rouge and the nearby city of Ecorse filed a class action lawsuit against the company for the release and discharge of air particulate matter and other toxic and hazardous substances at its River Rouge plant br The company has also been implicated in generating water pollution and toxic waste In the Environmental Protection Agency EPA issued an order for U S Steel to clean up a site on the Delaware River in Fairless Hills Pennsylvania where the soil had been contaminated with arsenic lead and other heavy metals as well as naphthalene Groundwater at the site was found to be polluted with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and trichloroethylene TCE In the EPA United States Department of Justice and the State of Ohio reached a settlement requiring U S Steel to pay more than in penalties and in reparations in answer to allegations that the company illegally released pollutants into Ohio waters U S Steel s Gary Indiana facility has been repeatedly charged with discharging polluted wastewater into Lake Michigan and the Grand Calumet River In the company agreed to payment of a million settlement to clean up contaminated sediments from a five mile km stretch of the river br With the exception of the Fairless Hills and Gary facilities the lawsuits concern facilities acquired by U S Steel via its purchase of National Steel Corporation not its historic facilities br In U S Steel announced a goal to target net zero carbon emissions by The company previously set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity by by br br br Legacy br br br U S Steel Tower br The U S Steel Tower in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania is named after the company and since the company s corporate headquarters have been located there It is the tallest skyscraper in the downtown Pittsburgh skyline built out of the company s Corten Steel New York City s One Liberty Plaza was also built by the corporation as that city s U S Steel Tower in br br br Steelmark logo br br When the Steelmark logo was created U S Steel attached the following meaning to it Steel lightens your work brightens your leisure and widens your world The logo was used as part of a major marketing campaign to educate consumers about how important steel is in people s daily lives The Steelmark logo was used in print radio and television ads as well as on labels for all steel products from steel tanks to tricycles to filing cabinets br In the s U S Steel turned over the Steelmark program to the AISI where it came to represent the steel industry as a whole During the s the logo s meaning was extended to include the three materials used to produce steel yellow for coal orange for ore and blue for steel scrap In the late s when the AISI founded the Steel Recycling Institute SRI the logo took on a new life reminiscent of its s meaning br The Pittsburgh Steelers professional football team borrowed elements of its logo a circle containing three hypocycloids from the Steelmark logo belonging to the American Iron and Steel Institute AISI and created by U S Steel In the s when helmet logos became popular the Steelers added players numbers to either side of their gold helmets Later that decade the numbers were removed and in Cleveland s Republic Steel suggested to the Steelers that they use the Steelmark as a helmet logo br U S Steel financed and constructed the Unisphere in Flushing Meadows Corona Park Queens New York for the World s Fair It is the largest globe ever made and is one of the world s largest free standing sculptures br br br Fabrication of Chicago Picasso sculpture br The Chicago Picasso sculpture was fabricated by U S Steel in Gary Indiana before being disassembled and relocated to Chicago U S Steel donated the steel for the construction of St Michael s Catholic Church in Chicago since percent of the parishioners worked at its mills br br br United States Steel Hour television program and Walt Disney World involvement br U S Steel sponsored The United States
