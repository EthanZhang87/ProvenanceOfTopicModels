File synchronization or syncing in computing is the process of ensuring that computer files in two or more locations are updated via certain rules br In one way file synchronization also called mirroring updated files are copied from a source location to one or more target locations but no files are copied back to the source location In two way file synchronization updated files are copied in both directions usually with the purpose of keeping the two locations identical to each other In this article the term synchronization refers exclusively to two way file synchronization br File synchronization is commonly used for home backups on external hard drives or updating for transport on USB flash drives BitTorrent Sync Dropbox SKYSITE Nextcloud OneDrive Google Drive and iCloud are prominent products Some backup software also support real time file sync The automatic process prevents copying already identical files and thus can be faster and save much time versus a manual copy and is less error prone However this suffers from the limit that the synchronized files must physically fit in the portable storage device Synchronization software that only keeps a list of files and the changed files eliminates this problem e g the snapshot feature in Beyond Compare or the package feature in Synchronize It It is especially useful for mobile workers or others that work on multiple computers br It is possible to synchronize multiple locations by synchronizing them one pair at a time The Unison Manual describes how to do this br br If you need to do this the most reliable way to set things up is to organize the machines into a star topology with one machine designated as the hub and the rest as spokes and with each spoke machine synchronizing only with the hub The big advantage of the star topology is that it eliminates the possibility of confusing spurious conflicts arising from the fact that a separate archive is maintained by Unison for every pair of hosts that it synchronizes br br br Common features br Common features of file synchronization systems include br br Encryption for security especially when synchronizing across the Internet br Compressing any data sent across a network br Conflict detection where a file has been modified on both sources as opposed to where it has only been modified on one Undetected conflicts can lead to overwriting copies of the file with the most recent version causing data loss For conflict detection the synchronization software needs to keep a database of the synchronized files Distributed conflict detection can be achieved by version vectors br Open Files Support ensures data integrity when copying data or application files that are in use or database files that are exclusively locked br Specific support for using an intermediate storage device such as a removable flash disc to synchronize two machines Most synchronizing programs can be used in this way but providing specific support for this can reduce the amount of data stored on a device br The ability to preview any changes before they are made br The ability to view differences in individual files br Backup between operating systems and transfer between network computers br Ability to edit or use files on multiple computers or operating systems br br br Comparison to shared file access br br br Possible security concerns br Consumer grade file synchronization solutions are popular however for business use they create a concern of allowing corporate information to sprawl to unmanaged devices and cloud services which are uncontrolled by the organization br When using cloud services data privacy risks can be mitigated by using a file synchronization solution that features end to end encryption instead of simple transport HTTPS or at rest encryption br br br See also br Comparison of file synchronization software br Comparison of online backup services br Data synchronization br Data comparison br Mirror computing br Backup software br List of backup software br Remote backup service br Shared file access br br br
