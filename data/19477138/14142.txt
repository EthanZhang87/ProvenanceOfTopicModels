Harley Davidson Inc H D or simply Harley is an American motorcycle manufacturer headquartered in Milwaukee Wisconsin United States Founded in it is one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression along with its historical rival Indian Motorcycles The company has survived numerous ownership arrangements subsidiary arrangements periods of poor economic health and product quality and intense global competition to become one of the world s largest motorcycle manufacturers and an iconic brand widely known for its loyal following There are owner clubs and events worldwide as well as a company sponsored brand focused museum br Harley Davidson is noted for a style of customization that gave rise to the chopper motorcycle style The company traditionally marketed heavyweight air cooled cruiser motorcycles with engine displacements greater than cc but it has broadened its offerings to include more contemporary VRSC and middle weight Street platforms br Harley Davidson manufactures its motorcycles at factories in York Pennsylvania Menomonee Falls Wisconsin Tomahawk Wisconsin Manaus Brazil and Rayong Thailand The company markets its products worldwide and also licenses and markets merchandise under the Harley Davidson brand among them apparel home d cor and ornaments accessories toys scale models of its motorcycles and video games based on its motorcycle line and the community br br br History br br In year old William S Harley drew up plans for a small engine with a displacement of cubic inches cc and four inch mm flywheels designed for use in a regular pedal bicycle frame Over the next two years he and his childhood friend Arthur Davidson worked on their motor bicycle using the northside Milwaukee machine shop at the home of their friend Henry Melk It was finished in with the help of Arthur s brother Walter Davidson Upon testing their power cycle Harley and the Davidson brothers found it unable to climb the hills around Milwaukee without pedal assistance and they wrote off their first motor bicycle as a valuable learning experiment br The three began work on a new and improved machine with an engine of cubic inches cc with in cm flywheels weighing lb kg Its advanced loop frame pattern was similar to the Milwaukee Merkel motorcycle designed by Joseph Merkel later of Flying Merkel fame The bigger engine and loop frame design took it out of the motorized bicycle category and marked the path to future motorcycle designs They also received help with their bigger engine from outboard motor pioneer Ole Evinrude who was then building gas engines of his own design for automotive use on Milwaukee s Lake Street br br The prototype of the new loop frame Harley Davidson was assembled in a ft ft m m shed in the Davidson family backyard Most of the major parts however were made elsewhere including some probably fabricated at the West Milwaukee railshops where oldest brother William A Davidson was toolroom foreman This prototype machine was functional by September when it competed in a Milwaukee motorcycle race held at State Fair Park Edward Hildebrand rode it and placed fourth in the race br In January the company placed small advertisements in the Automobile and Cycle Trade Journal offering bare Harley Davidson engines to the do it yourself trade By April they were producing complete motorcycles on a very limited basis That year Harley Davidson dealer Carl H Lang of Chicago sold three bikes from the five built in the Davidson backyard shed Years later the company moved the original shed to the Juneau Avenue factory where it stood for many decades as a tribute br In Harley and the Davidson brothers built their first factory on Chestnut Street later Juneau Avenue at the current location of Harley Davidson s corporate headquarters The first Juneau Avenue plant was a ft ft m m single story wooden structure The company produced about motorcycles that year br br In William S Harley graduated from the University of Wisconsin Madison with a degree in mechanical engineering That year they expanded the factory with a second floor and later with facings and additions of Milwaukee pale yellow cream brick With the new facilities production increased to motorcycles in The company was officially incorporated that September They also began selling their motorcycles to police departments around this time a market that has been important to them ever since In William A Davidson quit his job as tool foreman for the Milwaukee Road railroad and joined the Motor Company br Production in and were all single cylinder models with cubic inch cc engines In February they displayed a prototype model at the Chicago Automobile Show with a degree V Twin engine Very few V Twin models were built between and These first V Twins displaced cubic inches cc and produced about horsepower kW This gave about double the power of the first singles and top speed was about mph km h Production jumped from motorcycles in to machines in br br In the company introduced an improved V Twin model with a displacement of cubic inches cc and mechanically operated intake valves as opposed to the automatic intake valves used on earlier V Twins that opened by engine vacuum It was smaller than earlier twins but gave better performance After the majority of bikes produced by Harley Davidson were V Twin models br In Harley Davidson introduced their patented Ful Floteing Seat which was suspended by a coil spring inside the seat tube The spring tension could be adjusted to suit the rider s weight and more than inches mm of travel was available Harley Davidson used seats of this type until br br By the yellow brick factory had been demolished and a new five story structure had been built on the site which took up two blocks along Juneau Avenue and around the corner on th Street Despite the competition Harley Davidson was already pulling ahead of Indian and dominated motorcycle racing after Production that year swelled to machines br br br World War I br In the United States entered World War I and the military demanded motorcycles for the war effort Harleys had already been used by the military in the Pancho Villa Expedition but World War I was the first time that it was adopted for military issue first with the British Model H produced by Triumph Motorcycles Ltd in The U S military purchased over motorcycles from Harley Davidson br Harley Davidson launched a line of bicycles in in hopes of recruiting more domestic customers for its motorcycles Models included the traditional diamond frame men s bicycle a step through frame Ladies Standard and a Boy Scout for youth The effort was discontinued in because of disappointing sales The bicycles were built for Harley Davidson in Dayton Ohio by the Davis Machine Company from to when Davis stopped manufacturing bicycles br br br s br br By Harley Davidson was the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world with machines produced and dealers in countries In Otto Walker set a record on a Harley Davidson as the first motorcycle to win a race at an average speed greater than mph km h br Harley Davidson put several improvements in place during the s such as a new cubic inch cc V Twin introduced in and the teardrop gas tank in They added a front brake in although only on the J JD models In the late summer of Harley Davidson introduced its cubic inch cc flathead V Twin to compete with the Indian Scout and the Excelsior Super X This was the D model produced from to Riders of Indian motorcycles derisively referred to it as the three cylinder Harley because the generator was upright and parallel to the front cylinder In Vivian Bales drove a record miles across the United States and Canada on a D model br br br Great Depression br br The Great Depression began a few months after the introduction of their cu in cm model Harley Davidson s sales fell from in to in Despite this Harley Davidson unveiled a new lineup for which included a flathead engine and Art Deco styling br In order to survive the remainder of the Depression the company manufactured industrial powerplants based on their motorcycle engines They also designed and built a three wheeled delivery vehicle called the Servi Car which remained in production until br br Alfred Rich Child opened a production line in Japan in the mid s with the cu in cm VL The Japanese license holder Sankyo Seiyaku Corporation severed its business relations with Harley Davidson in and continued manufacturing the VL under the Rikuo name br br An cubic inches cm flathead engine was added to the line in by which time the single cylinder motorcycles had been discontinued br In the E and EL models with the Knucklehead OHV engines were introduced Valvetrain problems in early Knucklehead engines required a redesign halfway through its first year of production and retrofitting of the new valvetrain on earlier engines br By all Harley Davidson flathead engines were equipped with dry sump oil recirculation systems similar to the one introduced in the Knucklehead OHV engine The revised cubic inches cm V and VL models were renamed U and UL the cu in cm VH and VLH to be renamed UH and ULH and the cu in cm R to be renamed W br In the cubic inch Knucklehead was introduced as the F and the FL The cu in cm flathead UH and ULH models were discontinued after while the cubic inchU UL flathead models were produced up to br br br World War II br br One of only two American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression the other being the Indian Motorcycle Manufacturing Company Harley Davidson again produced large numbers of motorcycles for the US Army in World War II and resumed civilian production afterwards producing a range of large V twin motorcycles that were successful both on racetracks and for private buyers br Harley Davidson on the eve of World War II was already supplying the Army with a military specific version of its cubic inches cm WL line called the WLA The A in this case stood for Army Upon the outbreak of war the company along with most other manufacturing enterprises shifted to war work More than military motorcycles mostly WLAs and WLCs the Canadian version were produced many to be provided to allies Harley Davidson received two Army Navy E Awards one in and the other in which were awarded for Excellence in Production br br Shipments to the Soviet Union under the Lend Lease program numbered at least The WLAs produced during all four years of war production generally have serial numbers Production of the WLA stopped at the end of World War II but was resumed from to for use in the Korean War br The U S Army also asked Harley Davidson to produce a new motorcycle with many of the features of BMW s side valve and shaft driven R Harley Davidson largely copied the BMW engine and drive train and produced the shaft driven cc Harley Davidson XA This shared no dimensions no parts or no design concepts except side valves with any prior Harley Davidson engine Due to the superior cooling of the flat twin engine with the cylinders across the frame Harley s XA cylinder heads ran F C cooler than its V twins The XA never entered full production the motorcycle by that time had been eclipsed by the Jeep as the Army s general purpose vehicle and the WLA already in production was sufficient for its limited police escort and courier roles Only were made and the XA never went into full production It remains the only shaft driven Harley Davidson ever made br br br Small Hummer Sportcycle and Aermacchi br br As part of war reparations Harley Davidson acquired the design of a small German motorcycle the DKW RT which they adapted manufactured and sold from to Various models were made including the Hummer from to but they are all colloquially referred to as Hummers at present BSA in the United Kingdom took the same design as the foundation of their BSA Bantam br br In Harley Davidson consolidated the Model and Hummer lines into the Super introduced the Topper scooter and bought fifty percent of Aermacchi s motorcycle division Importation of Aermacchi s cc horizontal single began the following year The bike bore Harley Davidson badges and was marketed as the Harley Davidson Sprint The engine of the Sprint was increased to cc in and would remain that size until when the four stroke Sprint was discontinued br After the Pacer and Scat models were discontinued at the end of the Bobcat became the last of Harley Davidson s American made two stroke motorcycles The Bobcat was manufactured only in the model year br Harley Davidson replaced their American made lightweight two stroke motorcycles with the Italian Aermacchi built two stroke powered M M S and Rapido The M had a semi step through frame and tank The M S was a M with a larger tank that eliminated the step through feature The Rapido was a larger bike with a cc engine The Aermacchi built Harley Davidsons became entirely two stroke powered when the cc two stroke SS replaced the four stroke cc Sprint in br Harley Davidson purchased full control of Aermacchi s motorcycle production in and continued making two stroke motorcycles there until when they sold the facility to Cagiva owned by the Castiglioni family br br br Tarnished reputation br br In following their application to the U S Tariff Commission for a percent tax on imported motorcycles Harley Davidson was charged with restrictive practices br br In American Machine and Foundry AMF bought the company streamlined production and slashed the workforce This tactic resulted in a labor strike and cost cutting produced lower quality bikes Simultaneously the Japanese big four manufacturers Honda Kawasaki Suzuki and Yamaha revolutionized the North American market by introducing what the motoring press would call the Universal Japanese Motorcycle In comparison Harley Davidson s bikes were expensive and inferior in performance handling and quality Sales and quality declined and the company almost went bankrupt The Harley Davidson name was mocked as Hardly Ableson Hardly Driveable and Hogly Ferguson br and the nickname Hog became pejorative br In following the successful manufacture of the Liberty Edition to commemorate America s bicentennial in Harley Davidson produced what has become one of its most controversial models the Harley Davidson Confederate Edition The bike was essentially a stock Harley Davidson with Confederate specific paint and details br br br Restructuring and revival br In AMF sold the company to a group of investors led by Vaughn Beals and Willie G Davidson for million The new management team improved product quality introduced new technologies and adopted just in time inventory management These operational and product improvements were matched with a strategy of seeking tariff protection for large displacement motorcycles in the face of intense competition with Japanese manufacturers These protections were granted by the Reagan administration in giving Harley Davidson time to implement their new strategies br Revising stagnated product designs was a crucial centerpiece of Harley Davidson s turnaround strategy Rather than trying to mimic popular Japanese designs the new management deliberately exploited the retro appeal of Harley motorcycles building machines that deliberately adopted the look and feel of their earlier bikes and the subsequent customizations of owners of that era Many components such as brakes forks shocks carburetors electrics and wheels were outsourced from foreign manufacturers and quality increased technical improvements were made and buyers slowly returned br Harley Davidson bought the Sub Shock cantilever swingarm rear suspension design from Missouri engineer Bill Davis and developed it into its Softail series of motorcycles introduced in with the FXST Softail br In response to possible motorcycle market loss due to the aging of baby boomers Harley Davidson bought luxury motorhome manufacturer Holiday Rambler in In the company sold Holiday Rambler to the Monaco Coach Corporation br The Sturgis model boasting a dual belt drive was introduced initially in and was made for three years This bike was then brought back as a commemorative model in br br br Fat Boy Dyna and Harley Davidson museum br br By with the introduction of the Fat Boy Harley Davidson once again became the sales leader in the heavyweight over cc market At the time of the Fat Boy model introduction a false etymology spread that Fat Boy was a combination of the names of the atomic bombs Fat Man and Little Boy This has been debunked as the name Fat Boy actually comes from the observation that the motorcycle is somewhat wider than other bikes when viewed head on br and saw the replacement of FXR models with the Dyna FXD which became the sole rubber mount FX Big Twin frame in The FXR was revived briefly from to for special limited editions FXR FXR FXR br Harley Davidson celebrated their th anniversary on September with a large event and concert featuring performances from Elton John The Doobie Brothers Kid Rock and Tim McGraw br Construction started on the million square foot m Harley Davidson Museum in the Menomonee Valley of Milwaukee Wisconsin on June It opened in and houses the company s vast collection of historic motorcycles and corporate archives along with a restaurant caf and meeting space br br br Overseas operations br Established in the oldest continuously operating Harley Davidson dealership outside of the United States is in Australia Sales in Japan started in then in Harley Davidsons were produced in Japan under license to the company Rikuo Rikuo Internal Combustion Company under the name of Harley Davidson and using the company s tooling and later under the name Rikuo Production continued until br In the first Harley Davidson factory outside the US opened in Manaus Brazil taking advantage of the free economic zone there The location was positioned to sell motorcycles in the southern hemisphere market br In August Harley Davidson launched Harley Davidson India and started selling motorcycles there in The company established the subsidiary in Gurgaon near Delhi in and created an Indian dealer network On September Harley Davidson announced that it would discontinue its sales and manufacturing operations in India due to weak demand and sales The move involves million in restructuring costs layoffs and the closure of its Bawal plant in northern India br br br Buell Motorcycle Company br br Harley Davidson s association with sportbike manufacturer Buell Motorcycle Company began in when they supplied Buell with fifty surplus XR engines Buell continued to buy engines from Harley Davidson until when Harley Davidson bought percent of the Buell Motorcycle Company Harley Davidson increased its share in Buell to ninety eight percent in and to complete ownership in br In an attempt to attract newcomers to motorcycling in general and to Harley Davidson in particular Buell developed a low cost low maintenance motorcycle The resulting single cylinder Buell Blast was introduced in and was made through which according to Buell was to be the final year of production The Buell Blast was the training vehicle for the Harley Davidson Rider s Edge New Rider Course from until May when the company re branded the training academy and started using the Harley Davidson Street motorcycles In those years more than participants in the course learned to ride on the Buell Blast br On October Harley Davidson Inc issued an official statement that it would be discontinuing the Buell line and ceasing production immediately in order to focus on the Harley Davidson brand The company refused to consider selling Buell Founder Erik Buell subsequently established Erik Buell Racing and continued to manufacture and develop the company s RR racing motorcycle br br br Claims of stock price manipulation br br During its period of peak demand during the late s and early first decade of the st century Harley Davidson embarked on a program of expanding the number of dealerships throughout the country At the same time its current dealers typically had waiting lists that extended up to a year for some of the most popular models Harley Davidson like the auto manufacturers records a sale not when a consumer buys their product but rather when it is delivered to a dealer Therefore it is possible for the manufacturer to inflate sales numbers by requiring dealers to accept more inventory than desired in a practice called channel stuffing When demand softened following the unique model year this news led to a dramatic decline in the stock price In April alone the price of HOG shares dropped from more than to less than Immediately prior to this decline retiring CEO Jeffrey Bleustein profited million on the exercise of employee stock options Harley Davidson was named as a defendant in numerous class action suits filed by investors who claimed they were intentionally defrauded by Harley Davidson s management and directors By January the price of Harley Davidson shares reached br br br Problems with Police Touring models br Starting around several police departments started reporting problems with high speed instability on the Harley Davidson Touring motorcycles A Raleigh North Carolina police officer Charles Paul was killed when his police touring motorcycle crashed after reportedly experiencing a high speed wobble The California Highway Patrol conducted testing of the Police Touring motorcycles in The CHP test riders reported experiencing wobble or weave instability while operating the motorcycles on the test track br br br strike br On February upon the expiration of their union contract about employees at Harley Davidson Inc s largest manufacturing plant in York Pennsylvania went on strike after failing to agree on wages and health benefits During the pendency of the strike the company refused to pay for any portion of the striking employees health care br The day before the strike after the union voted against the proposed contract and to authorize the strike the company shut down all production at the plant The York facility employs more than workers both union and non union br Harley Davidson announced on February that it had reached a labor agreement with union workers at its largest manufacturing plant a breakthrough in the two week old strike The strike disrupted Harley Davidson s national production and was felt in Wisconsin where employees were laid off and many Harley suppliers also laid off workers because of the strike br br br MV Agusta Group br On July Harley Davidson announced they had signed a definitive agreement to acquire the MV Agusta Group for US million M MV Agusta Group contains two lines of motorcycles the high performance MV Agusta brand and the lightweight Cagiva brand The acquisition was completed on August br On October Harley Davidson announced that it would divest its interest in MV Agusta Harley Davidson Inc sold Italian motorcycle maker MV Agusta to Claudio Castiglioni a member of the family that had purchased Aermacchi from H D in for a reported euros ending the transaction in the first week of August Castiglioni was MV Agusta s former owner and had been MV Agusta s chairman since Harley Davidson bought it in As part of the deal Harley Davidson put M into MV Agusta s accounts essentially giving Castiglioni M to take the brand br br br Financial crisis br The financial crisis and automotive industry crisis affected also the motorcycle industry According to Interbrand the value of the Harley Davidson brand fell by percent to billion in The fall in value is believed to be connected to the percent drop in the company profits in two quarters of the previous year On April Harley Davidson stated that they must cut million in manufacturing costs from its production facilities in Wisconsin and that they would explore alternative U S sites to accomplish this The announcement came in the wake of a massive company wide restructuring which began in early and involved the closing of two factories one distribution center and the planned elimination of nearly percent of its total workforce around employees The company announced on September that it would remain in Wisconsin br br br Motorcycle engines br br The classic Harley Davidson engines are V twin engines with a angle between the cylinders The crankshaft has a single pin and both pistons are connected to this pin through their connecting rods br This angle is covered under several United States patents and is an engineering tradeoff that allows a large high torque engine in a relatively small space It causes the cylinders to fire at uneven intervals and produces the choppy potato potato sound so strongly linked to the Harley Davidson brand br To simplify the engine and reduce costs the V twin ignition was designed to operate with a single set of points and no distributor This is known as a dual fire ignition system causing both spark plugs to fire regardless of which cylinder was on its compression stroke with the other spark plug firing on its cylinder s exhaust stroke effectively wasting a spark The exhaust note is basically a throaty growling sound with some popping br The design of the engine thus creates a plug firing sequencing as such The first cylinder fires the second rear cylinder fires later then there is a gap until the first cylinder fires again giving the engine its unique sound br Harley Davidson has used various ignition systems including the early points and condenser system on Big Twins and Sportsters up to a magneto ignition system used on some to Sportsters an early electronic with centrifugal mechanical advance weights on all models from mid until and a later electronic with a transistorized ignition control module more familiarly known as a black box or a brain on all models to present br Starting in the company introduced Electronic Fuel Injection EFI as an option for the th anniversary edition Electra Glide EFI became standard on all Harley Davidson motorcycles including Sportsters upon the introduction of the product line br In Harley Davidson began to participate in the Sound Quality Working Group founded by Orfield Labs Bruel and Kjaer TEAC Yamaha Sennheiser SMS and Cortex This was the nation s first group to share research on psychological acoustics Later that year Harley Davidson participated in a series of sound quality studies at Orfield Labs based on recordings taken at the Talladega Superspeedway with the objective to lower the sound level for EU standards while analytically capturing the Harley Sound This research resulted in the bikes that were introduced in compliance with EU standards for br On February the company filed a sound trademark application for the distinctive sound of the Harley Davidson motorcycle engine The mark consists of the exhaust sound of applicant s motorcycles produced by V twin common crankpin motorcycle engines when the goods are in use Nine of Harley Davidson s competitors filed comments opposing the application arguing that cruiser style motorcycles of various brands use a single crankpin V twin engine which produce a similar sound These objections were followed by litigation In June the company dropped efforts to register a sound trademark br br br Big V twins br F head also known as JD pocket

Engineering with Porsche helping to make the engine suitable for street use It is a liquid cooled dual overhead cam internally counterbalanced degree V twin engine with a displacement of cubic inch cc producing hp kW at rpm at the crank with a redline of rpm It was introduced for the new VRSC V Rod line in for the model year starting with the single VRSCA V Twin Racing Street Custom model The Revolution marks Harley s first collaboration with Porsche since the V Nova project which like the V Rod was a radical departure from Harley s traditional lineup until it was cancelled by AMF in in favor of the Evolution engine br A cc Screamin Eagle version of the Revolution engine was made available for and and was present thereafter in a single production model from to In the cc Revolution Engine became standard for the entire VRSC line Harley Davidson claims hp kW at the crank for the VRSCAW model The VRXSE Destroyer dragbike is equipped with a stroker mm crank Screamin Eagle cubic inch cc Revolution Engine producing pound feet N m and more than hp kW br cc and cc versions of the Revolution engine are used in Harley Davidson s Street line of light cruisers These motors named the Revolution X use a single overhead cam screw and locknut valve adjustment a single internal counterbalancer and vertically split crankcases all of these changes making it different from the original Revolution design br br br D sseldorf Test br An extreme endurance test of the Revolution engine was performed in a dynamometer installation at the Harley Davidson factory in Milwaukee simulating the German Autobahn highways without general speed limit between the Porsche research and development center in Weissach near Stuttgart to D sseldorf An undisclosed number of samples of engines failed until an engine successfully passed the hour nonstop run This was the benchmark for the engineers to approve the start of production for the Revolution engine which was documented in the Discovery channel special Harley Davidson Birth of the V Rod October br br br Single cylinder engines br br IOE singles br The first Harley Davidson motorcycles were powered by single cylinder IOE engines with the inlet valve operated by engine vacuum based on the DeDion Bouton pattern Singles of this type continued to be made until when a pushrod and rocker system was used to operate the overhead inlet valve on the single a similar system having been used on their V twins since Single cylinder motorcycle engines were discontinued in br br Flathead and OHV singles br Single cylinder engines were reintroduced in as models These singles were available either as flathead engines or as overhead valve engines until after which they were only available as flatheads The flathead single cylinder motorcycles were designated Model A for engines with magneto systems only and Model B for engines with battery and coil systems while overhead valve versions were designated Model AA and Model BA respectively and a magneto only racing version was designated Model S This line of single cylinder motorcycles ended production in br br Two stroke singles br br br Model families br Modern Harley branded motorcycles fall into one of seven model families Touring Softail Dyna Sportster Vrod Street and LiveWire These model families are distinguished by the frame engine suspension and other characteristics br br br Touring br br Touring models use Big Twin engines and large diameter telescopic forks All Touring designations begin with the letters FL e g FLHR Road King and FLTR Road Glide br The touring family also known as dressers or baggers includes Road King Road Glide Electra Glide and Street Glide models offered in various trims The Road Kings have a retro cruiser appearance and are equipped with a large clear windshield Road Kings are reminiscent of big twin models from the s and s Electra Glides can be identified by their full front fairings Most Electra Glides sport a fork mounted fairing referred to as the Batwing due to its unmistakable shape The Road Glide and Road Glide Ultra Classic have a frame mounted fairing referred to as the Sharknose The Sharknose includes a unique dual front headlight br Touring models are distinguishable by their large saddlebags rear coil over air suspension and are the only models to offer full fairings with radios and CBs All touring models use the same frame first introduced with a Shovelhead motor in and carried forward with only modest upgrades until when it was extensively redesigned The frame is distinguished by the location of the steering head in front of the forks and was the first H D frame to rubber mount the drivetrain to isolate the rider from the vibration of the big V twin br br The frame was modified for the model year when the oil tank went under the transmission and the battery was moved inboard from under the right saddlebag to under the seat In the frame was again modified to allow for a larger battery under the seat and to lower seat height In Harley Davidson introduced the cubic inches cubic centimetres Twin Cam engine as well the six speed transmission to give the rider better speeds on the highway br In Harley introduced the FLHX Street Glide a bike designed by Willie G Davidson to be his personal ride to its touring line br In Harley added anti lock braking systems and cruise control as a factory installed option on all touring models standard on CVO and Anniversary models Also new for is the US gallon L imp gal fuel tank for all touring models also brought throttle by wire to all touring models br For the model year Harley Davidson redesigned the entire touring range with several changes including a new frame new swingarm a completely revised engine mounting system inch mm front wheels for all but the FLHRC Road King Classic and a exhaust The changes result in greater load carrying capacity better handling a smoother engine longer range and less exhaust heat transmitted to the rider and passenger br Also released for the model year is the FLHTCUTG Tri Glide Ultra Classic the first three wheeled Harley since the Servi Car was discontinued in The model features a unique frame and a cubic inch cc engine exclusive to the trike br In Harley Davidson released a redesign for specific touring bikes and called it Project Rushmore Changes include a new CI High Output engine one handed easy open saddlebags and compartments a new Boom Box Infotainment system with either inch cm or inch cm screens featuring touchscreen functionality inch cm models only Bluetooth media and phone with approved compatible devices available GPS and SiriusXM Text to Speech functionality with approved compatible devices and USB connectivity with charging Other features include ABS with Reflex linked brakes improved styling Halogen or LED lighting and upgraded passenger comfort br br br Softail br br These big twin motorcycles capitalize on Harley s strong value on tradition With the rear wheel suspension hidden under the transmission they are visually similar to the hardtail choppers popular in the s and s as well as from their own earlier history In keeping with that tradition Harley offers Softail models with Heritage styling that incorporate design cues from throughout their history and used to offer Springer front ends on these Softail models from the factory br br Designation br Softail models utilize the big twin engine F and the Softail chassis ST br br Softail models that use inch mm Front Wheels have designations that begin with FX e g FXSTB

Springer forks with a inch mm wheel have designations that begin with FLSTS e g FLSTSC Springer Classic and FLSTSB Cross Bones br br br Dyna br br Dyna frame motorcycles were developed in the s and early s and debuted in the model year with the FXDB Sturgis offered in limited edition quantities In the line continued with the limited edition FXDB Daytona and a production model FXD Super Glide The new DYNA frame featured big twin engines and traditional styling They can be distinguished from the Softail by the traditional coil over suspension that connects the swingarm to the frame and from the Sportster by their larger engines On these models the transmission also houses the engine s oil reservoir br Prior to Dyna models typically featured a narrow XL style mm front fork and front wheel as well as footpegs which the manufacturer indicated with the letter X in the model designation This lineup traditionally included the Super Glide FXD Super Glide Custom FXDC Street Bob FXDB and Low Rider FXDL One exception was the Wide Glide FXDWG which featured thicker mm forks and a narrow front wheel but positioned the forks on wider triple trees that give a beefier appearance In the Dyna Fat Bob FXDF was introduced to the Dyna lineup featuring aggressive styling like a new exhaust twin headlamps a mm rear tire and for the first time in the Dyna lineup a mm front tire For the model year the Dyna Switchback FLD became the first Dyna to break the tradition of having an FX model designation with floorboards detachable painted hard saddlebags touring windshield headlight nacelle and a wide front tire with full fender The new front end resembled the big twin FL models from to br The Dyna family used the cubic inch cc twin cam from to In the displacement was increased to cubic inches cc as the factory increased the stroke to inches mm For the model year the manufacturer began to offer Dyna models with the cubic inch cc upgrade All Dyna models use a rubber mounted engine to isolate engine vibration Harley discontinued the Dyna platform in for the model year having been replaced by a completely redesigned Softail chassis some of the existing models previously released by the company under the Dyna nameplate have since been carried over to the new Softail line br br Designation br Dyna models utilize the big twin engine F footpegs noted as X with the exception of the FLD Switchback a Dyna model which used floorboards as featured on the Touring L models and the Dyna chassis D Therefore except for the FLD from to all Dyna models have designations that begin with FXD e g FXDWG Dyna Wide Glide and FXDL Dyna Low Rider br br br Sportster br br Introduced in the Sportster family were conceived as racing motorcycles and were popular on dirt and flat track race courses through the s and s Smaller and lighter than the other Harley models contemporary Sportsters make use of cc or cc Evolution engines and though often modified remain similar in appearance to their racing ancestors br Up until the model year the engine on the Sportster was rigidly mounted to the frame The Sportster received a new frame accommodating a rubber mounted engine This made the bike heavier and reduced the available lean angle while it reduced the amount of vibration transmitted to the frame and the rider providing a smoother ride for rider and passenger br In the model year Harley Davidson celebrated the th anniversary of the Sportster and produced a limited edition called the XL of which only were made for sale worldwide Each motorcycle was individually numbered and came in one of two colors Mirage Pearl Orange or Vivid Black Also in electronic fuel injection was introduced to the Sportster family and the Nightster model was introduced in mid year In Harley Davidson added the Iron to the Sportster line as part of the Dark Custom series br In the model year Harley Davidson released the XR Sportster in Europe Africa and the Middle East The XR had an Evolution engine tuned to produce bhp kW four piston dual front disc brakes and an aluminum swing arm Motorcyclist featured the XR on the cover of its July issue and was generally positive about it in their First Ride story in which Harley Davidson was repeatedly asked to sell it in the United States br One possible reason for the delayed availability in the United States was that Harley Davidson had to obtain the XR naming rights from Storz Performance a Harley customizing shop in Ventura Calif The XR was released in the United States in in a special color scheme including Mirage Orange highlighting its dirt tracker heritage The first XR models in were pre ordered and came with a number tag for the front of the bike autographed by Kenny Coolbeth and Scott Parker and a thank you welcome letter from the company signed by Bill Davidson The XR was discontinued in model year br In Harley Davidson launched the Sportster S model with a hp engine and Kg ready to ride weight The Sportster S was one of the first Harleys to come with cornering ABS and lean sensitive traction control The Sportster S is also the first model under the Sportster nameplate since to receive a completely new engine br br Designation br Except for the street going XR of the s and the XR most Sportsters made for street use have the prefix XL in their model designation For the Sportster Evolution engines used since the mid s there have been two engine sizes Motorcycles with the smaller engine are designated XL while those with the larger engine were initially designated XL When the size of the larger engine was increased from cc to cc the designation was changed accordingly from XL to XL Subsequent letters in the designation refer to model variations within the Sportster range e g the XL C refers to an cc Sportster Custom while the XL S designates the now discontinued Sportster Sport br br br VRSC br br Introduced in and produced until the VRSC muscle bike family bears little
