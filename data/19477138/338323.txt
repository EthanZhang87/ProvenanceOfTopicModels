and Edgar s brother Allan Hetteen were partners in Hetteen Hoist and Derrick in Roseau Minnesota Edgar had dropped out of school after the eighth grade in David Johnson and company employees Paul Knochenmus and Orlen Johnson who was the first person to ride a Polaris decided to create a vehicle that could travel through snow These vehicles primary use was to make hunting locations more accessible David Johnson and several employees created the prototype in while Edgar was on a business trip Edgar returned to Roseau to discover the snow machine and was furious the employees had used their time and company resources on the machine This first machine used a grain silo conveyor belt as a track a Briggs and Stratton motor and an old Chevy bumper for skis Edgar was skeptical of its value and the No sled was soon sold to Roseau lumberyard owner Silver Pete H F Peterson for in order to meet company payroll br However the employees continued to focus on building snowmobiles and

weighed close to lb kg and moved at a speed of about mph km h As Polaris snowmobiles gained sales traction Edgar Hetteen became an advocate of the new product line In order to promote the new snowmobile and prove its reliability and usefulness in Edgar led a three snowmobile mile trek across the Alaskan wilderness starting from Bethel Alaska The trip took three weeks and much of the time Edgar struggled to maintain mph over the snow The Fairbanks Daily News Miner put them on its front page However Edgar s absence caused problems for him with the Roseau bank s board of directors Soon
