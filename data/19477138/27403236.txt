id: 27403236
CoffeeScript is a programming language that compiles to JavaScript It adds syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby Python and Haskell in an effort to enhance JavaScript s brevity and readability Specific additional features include list comprehension and destructuring assignment br CoffeeScript support is included in Ruby on Rails version and Play Framework In Brendan Eich referenced CoffeeScript as an influence on his thoughts about the future of JavaScript br br br History br On December Jeremy Ashkenas made the first Git commit of CoffeeScript with the comment initial commit of the mystery language The compiler was written in Ruby On December he made the first tagged and documented release On February he committed version which replaced the Ruby compiler with a self hosting version in pure CoffeeScript By that time the project had attracted several other contributors on GitHub and was receiving over page hits per day br On December Ashkenas announced the release of stable to Hacker News the site where the project was announced for the first time br On September version was introduced which aims to bring CoffeeScript into the modern JavaScript era closing gaps in compatibility with JavaScript while preserving the clean syntax that is CoffeeScript s hallmark br br br Syntax br Almost everything is an expression in CoffeeScript for example if switch and for expressions which have no return value in JavaScript return a value As in Perl and Ruby these control statements also have postfix versions for example if can also be written in consequent if condition form br Many unnecessary parentheses and braces can be omitted for example blocks of code can be denoted by indentation instead of braces function calls are implicit and object literals are often detected automatically br To compute the body mass index in JavaScript one could write br br With CoffeeScript the interval is directly described br br To compute the greatest common divisor of two integers with the Euclidean algorithm in JavaScript one usually needs a while loop br br Whereas in CoffeeScript one can use until instead br br The keyword quickly checks if a variable is null or undefined br br This would alert No person if the variable is null or undefined and Have person if there is something there br A common pre es JavaScript snippet using the jQuery library is br br Or even just br br In CoffeeScript the function keyword is replaced by the symbol and indentation is used instead of curly braces as in other off side rule languages such as Python and Haskell Also parentheses can usually be omitted using indentation level instead to denote a function or block Thus the CoffeeScript equivalent of the snippet above is br br Or just br br Ruby style string interpolation is included in CoffeeScript Double quoted strings allow for interpolated values using and single quoted strings are literal br br Any for loop can be replaced by a list comprehension so that to compute the squares of the positive odd numbers smaller than ten i e numbers whose remainder modulo is one can do br br Alternatively there is br br A linear search can be implemented with a one liner using the when keyword br br The for in syntax allows looping over arrays while the for of syntax allows looping over objects br CoffeeScript has been criticized for its unusual scoping br rules In particular it completely disallows variable shadowing which makes reasoning about code more difficult and br error prone in some basic programming patterns established br by and taken for granted since procedural programming br principles were defined br For example with the following code snippet in JavaScript br one does not have to look outside the block to know for br sure that no possible foo variable in the outer scope can be br incidentally overridden br br In CoffeeScript there is no way to tell if the scope of a variable br is limited to a block or not without looking outside the block br br br Development and distribution br The CoffeeScript compiler has been self hosting since version and is available as a Node js utility however the core compiler does not rely on Node js and can be run in any JavaScript environment One alternative to the Node js utility is the Coffee Maven Plugin a plugin for the Apache Maven build system The plugin uses the Rhino JavaScript engine written in Java br The official site at CoffeeScript org has a Try CoffeeScript button in the menu bar clicking it opens a modal window in which users can enter CoffeeScript see the JavaScript output and run it directly in the browser The js coffee site provides bi directional translation br br br Latest additions br br Source maps allow users to debug their CoffeeScript code directly supporting CoffeeScript tracebacks on run time errors br CoffeeScript supports a form of Literate Programming using the coffee md or litcoffee file extension This allows CoffeeScript source code to be written in Markdown The compiler will treat any indented blocks Markdown s way of indicating source code as code and ignore the rest as comments br br br Extensions br Iced CoffeeScript is a superset of CoffeeScript which adds two new keywords await and defer These additions simplify asynchronous control flow making the code look more like a procedural programming language eliminating the call back chain It can be used on the server side and in the browser br br br Adoption br On September Dropbox announced that their browser side code base had been rewritten from JavaScript to CoffeeScript however it was migrated to TypeScript in br GitHub s internal style guide once said write new JS in CoffeeScript though it no longer does and their Atom text editor was also written in the language with configuration written in CSON CoffeeScript Object Notation a variant of JSON br Pixel Game Maker MV makes uses of CoffeeScript as part of its game development environment br br br See also br br
