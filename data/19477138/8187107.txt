the risks through a series of falsehoods and misrepresentations The school districts credit ratings were lowered and they lost their investments which were intended to fund school employees retirement benefits Stifel Nicolaus said in a statement that it was deeply disappointed by the misplaced action and that it would vigorously defend its behavior in the transactions The S E C said the firm had claimed that the investments were so safe that it would take Enrons or some other unexpected catastrophe for the investments to fail but the first increment of securities did badly and credit agencies issued a negative watch on part of the portfolio within days of its closing On March it was announced that a settlement had been reached with the school districts to jointly pursue a million lawsuit
