stock exchange trading floor In it became the first to use handheld computers for trading In Peterffy also created the first fully automated algorithmic trading system to automatically create and submit orders to a market Between and the corporate group Interactive Brokers Group was created and the subsidiary Interactive Brokers LLC was created to control its electronic brokerage and to keep it separate from Timber Hill which conducts market making In Interactive Brokers became the first online broker to offer direct access to IEX a private forum for trading securities In the company launched trading in cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum br The company is ranked rd on the Fortune br br br History br br In Thomas Peterffy left his job designing commodity trading software for Mocatta Metals and bought a seat on the American Stock Exchange AMEX as an individual market maker The following year he formed his first company named T P Co to expand trading activities to several members under badge number At the time trading used an open outcry system Peterffy developed algorithms to determine the best prices for options and used those on the trading floor and thus the firm became the first to use daily printed fair value pricing sheets In the company expanded to employ four traders three of whom were AMEX members In Peterffy renamed T P Co to Timber Hill Inc he named it after a road to a favorite retreat one of his properties on Hutchin Hill Road in Woodstock New York By Peterffy was sending orders to the floor from his upstairs office he devised a system to read the data from a Quotron machine by measuring the electric pulses in the wire and decoding them The data would be then sent through Peterffy s trading algorithms and then Peterffy would call down the trades After pressure to become a true market maker and keep constant bids and offers Peterffy knew that he would need his employees to closely pay attention to market movements and that handheld computers would help At the time the AMEX didn t permit computers on the trading floor Because of this Peterffy had an assistant deliver market information from his office in the World Trade Center In November he convinced the exchange to allow computer use on the floor br In Peterffy sought to computerize the options market and he first targeted the Chicago Board Options Exchange CBOE At the time brokers still used fair value pricing sheets which were by then updated once or twice a day In Timber Hill created the first handheld computers used for trading As Peterffy explained in a interview the battery powered units had touch screens for the user to input a stock price and it would produce the recommended option prices and it also tracked positions and continually repriced options on stocks However he immediately encountered opposition from the heads of the exchange When he first brought a inch long cm by inch wide cm device to the exchange floor a committee in the exchange told him it was too big When he made the device smaller the committee stated that no analytic devices were allowed to be used on the exchange floor Effectively blocked from using the CBOE he sought to use his devices in other exchanges br br Also in Timber Hill expanded to employees and began trading on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange In Timber Hill began coding a computerized stock index futures and options trading system and in February Timber Hill s system and network was brought online The system was designed to centrally price and manage risk on a portfolio of equity derivatives traded in multiple locations around the country In Peterffy introduced his computer system to the New York Stock Exchange NYSE which allowed it However the stock exchange only allowed it to be used at trading booths several yards away from where transactions were executed Peterffy responded by designing a code system for his traders to read colored bars emitted in patterns from the video displays of computers in the booths This caused the exchange and other members to be suspicious of insider trading which convinced Timber Hill to distribute instructions throughout the exchange describing how to read the displays In response the exchange required the company to turn the screens away from the trading floor which prompted Peterffy to hire a clerk to communicate with the traders via hand signals Eventually computers were allowed on the trading floor br br Timber Hill joined the Options Clearing Corporation in the New York Futures Exchange in and the Pacific Stock Exchange and the options division of the NYSE the following year Also in the firm joined and began trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Board Options Exchange In the company moved its headquarters to the World Trade Center to control activity at multiple exchanges Peterffy again hired workers to sprint from his offices to the exchanges with updated handheld devices which he later superseded with phone lines carrying data to computers at the exchanges Peterffy later built miniature radio transmitters into the handhelds and the exchange computers to allow data to automatically flow to them br In Timber Hill joined the National Securities Clearing Corporation and the Depository Trust Company now merged as the Depository Trust Clearing Corporation By Timber Hill had employees and had become self clearing in equities In the CBOE was about to close down its S P options market due to the options not attracting sufficient trader interest Because of this Peterffy pledged that Timber Hill would make tight markets in the product for a year if the exchange would allow the traders to use handheld computers on the trading floor The exchange agreed and more traders were attracted by the change in pricing today S P options are the most actively traded index options in the U S In Timber Hill Deutschland GmbH was incorporated in Germany and shortly thereafter began trading equity derivatives at the Deutsche Terminb rse DTB marking the first time that Timber Hill used one of its trading systems on a fully automated exchange In Timber Hill began trading at the Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange which merged with DTB in to become Eurex At that time Timber Hill had employees br While Peterffy was trading on the Nasdaq in he created the first fully automated algorithmic trading system It consisted of an IBM computer that would pull data from a Nasdaq terminal connected to it and carry out trades on a fully automated basis The machine for which Peterffy wrote the software worked faster than a trader could Upon inspection the Nasdaq banned direct interface with the terminal and required trades to be typed in manually Peterffy and his team designed a system with a camera to read the terminal a computer to decode the visual data and mechanical fingers to type in the trade orders which was then accepted by the Nasdaq br br br to br
