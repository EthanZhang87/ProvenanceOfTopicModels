Warner Music Group Corp d b a Warner Music Group commonly abbreviated as WMG is an American multinational entertainment and record label conglomerate headquartered in New York City It is one of the big three recording companies and the third largest in the global music industry after Universal Music Group UMG and Sony Music Entertainment SME Formerly part of Time Warner then WarnerMedia now Warner Bros Discovery WMG was publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange from until when it announced its privatization and sale to Access Industries It later had its second IPO on Nasdaq in once again becoming a public company With a multibillion dollar annual turnover WMG employs more than people and has operations in more than countries throughout the world br The company owns and operates some of the largest and most successful labels in the world including Elektra Records Reprise Records Warner Records Parlophone Records formerly owned by EMI and Atlantic Records WMG also owns Warner Chappell Music one of the world s largest music publishers br Since August WMG has expanded its business to digital media operations through its acquisition of Uproxx br br br History br br br s and s br The film studio Warner Bros had no record label division at the time one of its contracted actors Tab Hunter scored a No hit song in for Dot Records a division of rival Paramount Pictures In order to prevent any repetition of its actors recording for rival companies and to also capitalize on the music business Warner Bros Records was created in In Warner purchased Reprise Records which had been founded by Frank Sinatra three years earlier so that he could have more creative control over his recordings With the Reprise acquisition Warner gained the services of Mo Ostin who was mainly responsible for the success of Warner Reprise br After Warner Bros was sold to Seven Arts Productions in forming Warner Bros Seven Arts it purchased Atlantic Records founded in and WMG s oldest label until WMG completed its acquisition of Parlophone in as well as its subsidiary Atco Records This acquisition brought Neil Young into the company fold initially as a member of Buffalo Springfield Young became one of Warner s longest established artists recording both as a solo artist and with groups under the Warner owned Atlantic Atco and Reprise labels Young also recorded five albums for Geffen Records during that label s period of Warner distribution The Geffen catalogue now owned by Universal Music Group represents Young s only major recordings not under WMG ownership br Atlantic its subsidiary Atco Records and its affiliate Stax Records paved the way for Warner s rise to industry prominence The purchase brought in Atlantic s lucrative back catalogue which included classic recordings by Ray Charles the Drifters the Coasters and many more In the mid s Atlantic Stax released a string of landmark soul music recordings by artists including Booker T the MGs Sam Dave Wilson Pickett Otis Redding Ben E King and Aretha Franklin Ultimately the sale led to Stax leaving Atlantic because Seven Arts Productions insisted on keeping the rights to Stax recordings Atlantic moved decisively into rock and pop in the late s and s signing major British and American acts including Led Zeppelin Cream Crosby Stills Nash Yes Emerson Lake Palmer Genesis Average White Band Dr John King Crimson Bette Midler Roxy Music and Foreigner br In two years after being purchased by Seven Arts the Warner Bros Seven Arts company was sold to the Kinney National Company In mid Kinney Music of Canada Ltd was renamed WEA Music of Canada Ltd French WEA Musique du Canada Lt e as the Canadian branch of the WEA Warner Elektra Atlantic company a division of Warner Communications Inc Founder and president Ken Middleton ran the Canadian company until his retirement in The name remained until when in it became Warner Music Canada Ltd a subsidiary of the US based Warner Music International Warner Communications CEO Steve Ross led the group through its most successful period until his death in br An earlier attempt by Warner Bros Records to create an in house distribution arm in did not materialize So in Elektra Records boss Jac Holzman approached Atlantic s Jerry Wexler with the idea of setting up a joint distribution network for Warner Elektra and Atlantic An experimental branch was established in Southern California as a possible prototype for an expanded operation br br br Atlantic exerts autonomy br It was soon apparent in that Atlantic Atco president Ahmet Ertegun viewed Warner Reprise president Mike Maitland as a rival Maitland believed that as vice president in charge of the Warner Bros Seven Arts music division he should have final say over all recording operations and he further angered Ertegun by proposing that most of Atlantic s back office functions such as marketing and distribution be combined with the existing departments at Warner Reprise In retrospect Ertegun clearly feared that Maitland would ultimately have more power than him and so he moved rapidly to secure his own position and remove Maitland br Maitland had put off renegotiating the contracts of Joe Smith and Mo Ostin the presidents of the Warner Bros and Reprise labels and this provided Ertegun with an effective means of undermining Maitland When Wexler now a major shareholder found out about the contract issue he and Ertegun began pressuring Eliot Hyman to get Smith and Ostin under contract ostensibly because they were worried that the two executives might move to rival labels and in fact Ostin had received overtures from both the MGM and ABC labels br In the wisdom of Hyman s investments was proved when Kinney National Company purchased Warner Bros Seven Arts for million more than eight times what Hyman had paid for Warner Reprise and Atlantic combined From the base of his family s funeral parlour business Kinney president Steve Ross had rapidly built the Kinney company into a profitable conglomerate with interests that included comic publishing the Ashley Famous talent agency parking lots and cleaning services Following the takeover Warners music group briefly adopted the umbrella name Kinney Music because U S anti trust laws at the time prevented the three labels from trading as one br Ross was primarily focused on rebuilding the company s ailing movie division and was happy to defer to the advice of the managers of the company s record labels since he knew that they were generating most of the group s profits Ertegun s campaign against Maitland began in earnest that summer Atlantic had agreed to help Warner Bros in its efforts to establish its labels overseas beginning with its soon to be established Warner Bros subsidiary in Australia but when Warner executive Phil Rose arrived in Australia he discovered that just one week earlier Atlantic had signed a new four year distribution deal with a rival local label Festival Records owned by Rupert Murdoch s News Limited Mike Maitland complained bitterly to Kinney executive Ted Ashley but to no avail by this time Ertegun was poised to make his move against Maitland br As he had with Hyman Ertegun urged Steve Ross to extend Mo Ostin and Joe Smith s contracts a recommendation Ross was happy to accept Ostin however had received overtures from other companies including MGM Records and ABC Records and when he met with Ertegun in January and was offered Maitland s job he was unwilling to re sign immediately In response Ertegun broadly hinted that Maitland s days were numbered and that he Ertegun was about to take over the recording division br Unlike the Warner Reprise executives Atlantic s execs the Ertegun brothers Ahmet and Neshui and Wexler owned stock in Kinney br Ostin was understandably concerned that if he accepted the position the Warner Bros staff would feel that he had stabbed Maitland in the back but his attorney convinced him that Maitland s departure was inevitable regardless of whether or not he accepted the post succinctly advising him Don t be a schmuck On Sunday January Ted Ashley went to Maitland s house to tell him he had been dismissed and Maitland declined the offer of a job at the movie studio One week later Mo Ostin was named as the new President of Warner Bros Records with Joe Smith as his executive vice president Ertegun nominally remained the head of Atlantic but since both Ostin and Smith owed their new positions to him Ertegun was now the de facto head of the Warner music division Ertegun was given the formal title of executive vice president Music Group Maitland moved to MCA Records later that year and successfully consolidated MCA s labels which he couldn t do at Warner br br br s br During the s the Kinney group built up a commanding position in the music industry In Kinney bought Elektra Records and its sister label Nonesuch Records founded by Jac Holzman in for million bringing in leading rock acts including the Doors Tim Buckley and Love and its historically significant folk archive along with the successful budget Western classical music label Nonesuch Records br The purchase of Elektra Nonesuch brought a rich back catalogue of folk music as well as the renowned Nonesuch catalogue of classical and world music Elektra founder Jac Holzman ran the label under Warners for two years but by that time he was by his own admission burnt out after twenty years in the business Kinney president Steve Ross subsequently appointed Holzman as part of a seven person brain trust tasked with investigating opportunities presented by new technologies a role Holzman was eager to accept The same year the group established its first overseas offices in Canada and Australia By that time the Seven Arts moniker was dropped from the Warner Bros name Warner Bros also founded the Casablanca Records subsidiary headed by Neil Bogart but several years later Casablanca became independent from Warner Bros br br br Warner Elektra Atlantic and worldwide distribution br br With the Elektra acquisition the next step was forming an in house distribution arm for the co owned labels By this time Warner Reprise s frustrations with its current distributors had reached breaking point Joe Smith then executive vice president of Warner Bros recalled that the Grateful Dead were becoming a major act but the distributor was constantly out of stock of their albums These circumstances facilitated the full establishment of the group s in house distribution arm initially called By late US anti trust laws had changed and the company was renamed Warner Elektra Atlantic WEA for short which was renamed Warner Music in the word group was added after the formation of AOL Time Warner in br WEA was an early champion of heavy metal rock music Several such bands including three major British pioneers Led Zeppelin Black Sabbath and Deep Purple were all signed to WEA s labels at least in the United States Among the earliest American metal acts to be signed to WEA were Alice Cooper Montrose and Van Halen br Up to this point the Kinney owned record companies had relied on licensing deals with overseas record labels to manufacture distribute and promote its products in other countries concurrent with the establishment of its new distribution arm the company now began establishing subsidiaries in the other major markets beginning with the creation of Warner Bros Records Australia in soon followed by branch offices in the UK Europe and Japan In July the new in house distribution company was incorporated as Warner Elektra Atlantic Distributing Corp WEA and branch offices were established in eight major US cities Joel Friedman a one time Billboard writer who had been the head of Warner s advertising merchandising division in its early years was appointed to head WEA s US domestic division and Ahmet Ertegun s brother Nesuhi was appointed to oversee its international operations Neshui Ertegun originally a Turkish native like his brother displayed a global perspective and independence from its U S counterpart by successfully promoting international acts in their target markets worldwide Ertegun headed WEA International until his retirement in A de facto committee of three senior marketing executives Dave Glew from Atlantic Ed Rosenblatt from Warner Bros and Mel Posner from Elektra oversaw the integration of each label s marketing and distribution through the new division but each label continued to operate totally independently in A R matters and also applied their own expertise in marketing and advertising br On July following the pattern set by similar joint ventures in Canada and Australia the Warner labels entered into a partnership with the British arm of CBS Records to press and distribute Warner Reprise product in the United Kingdom although this was undertaken as a cooperative venture rather than a formally incorporated business partnership The Billboard article that reported the new arrangement also noted that despite their intense competition in the US market CBS continued to press Warner Reprise recordings in the US However the new UK arrangement was a major blow to Warner s previous British manufacturer Pye Records for whom Warner Reprise had been their largest account With the scheduled addition of the UK rights to the Atlantic catalogue which would revert to Kinney in early Billboard predicted that the Warner CBS partnership would have a share of the UK music market br In April thanks mainly to the influence of Ahmet Ertegun the Kinney group announced a major coup with its acquisition of the worldwide rights to the Rolling Stones new label Rolling Stones Records following the expiration of the band s contract with British Decca then separate from the American label and the acrimonious end to their business relationship with their former manager Allen Klein Under the terms of the deal Atlantic subsidiary Atco would distribute the Stones recordings in the US with other territories mainly handled by Warner Bros international divisions br One of Kinney s wisest investments was Fleetwood Mac The band signed with Reprise in the early s after relocating to the US and the label supported the group through numerous lineup changes and several lean years during which the band s records sold relatively poorly although they remained a popular concert attraction Ironically after the group s transfer to Warner Bros in and the recruitment of new members Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks the group scored a major international hit with the single Rhiannon and consolidated with the best selling albums Fleetwood Mac Rumours and Tusk br br br Warner Communications br Due to a financial scandal involving price fixing in its parking operations Kinney National spun off its non entertainment assets in as National Kinney Corporation and changed its name to Warner Communications Inc br In the Warner group acquired another rich prize David Geffen s Asylum Records The million purchase brought in several acts that proved crucial to WEA s subsequent success including Linda Ronstadt the Eagles Jackson Browne Joni Mitchell and later Warren Zevon On the downside however it was rumored that Warner was soon concerned about its possible liability under the California State Labor Code because of Geffen s questionable status as both the manager of most of the Asylum acts and the head of the record label to which they were signed The sale included the Asylum Records label and its recordings as well as Geffen s lucrative music publishing assets and the interests in the royalties of some of the artists managed by Geffen and partner Elliot Roberts Geffen accepted a five year contract with WCI and turned over his share in the Geffen Roberts management company to Roberts and Warner paid Geffen and Roberts common shares worth at the time of the sale plus in cash and a further million in promissory notes convertible to common stock br Although it seemed a lucrative deal at the time Geffen soon had reason to regret it Uncharacteristically he had greatly underestimated the value of his assets within Asylum s first year as a Warner subsidiary albums by Linda Ronstadt and the Eagles alone had earned more than the entire value of the Asylum sale Geffen s discomfort was compounded by the fact that within six months of the sale the value of his volatile Warner shares had plummeted from million to just He appealed to Steve Ross to intervene and as part of a make good deal Ross agreed to pay him the difference in the share value over five years Acting on Jac Holzman s suggestion that Kinney should take Asylum from Atlantic and merge it with Elektra Ross then appointed Geffen to run the new combined label br In Warner gained a brief early lead in digital media when it purchased the Atari computer company and in it bought The Franklin Mint company WCI also blazed the trail in visual music with MTV which it created and co owned in partnership with American Express In Warner rapidly divested many of these recent acquisitions including Atari Franklin Mint Panavision MTV Networks and a cosmetics business br In Warner Bros Music led by president Ed Silvers formed Pacific Records for their composers and distributed appropriately by Atlantic Records Alan O Day was the first artist signed to the label and the first release was Undercover Angel The song which he described as a nocturnal novelette was released in February Within a few months it had become No in the country and has sold approximately two million copies It was also a hit in Australia reaching No on the Australian Singles Chart Undercover Angel also landed O Day in an exclusive club as one of only a handful of writers performers to pen a No hit for themselves and a No for another artist br New signings in the late s placed WEA in a strong position for the s A deal with Seymour Stein s Sire Records label which Warner Bros Records later took over brought in several major punk rock and new wave acts including the Pretenders the Ramones and Talking Heads and most importantly rising star Madonna Elektra signed the Cars and Warner Bros signed Prince giving WEA several of the biggest selling acts of the decade br WEA s labels also distributed a number of otherwise independent labels For example Warner Bros distributed Straight Records DiscReet Records Bizarre Records Bearsville Records and Geffen Records the latter was sold to MCA in Atlantic Records distributed Swan Song Records In WEA scored a major coup by signing a distribution agreement with Island Records which only covered the United States and select other countries For the next years initially with Warner Bros until then with Atlantic afterward WEA would distribute such artists as Bob Marley U Robert Palmer Anthrax and Tom Waits This relationship ended when Island was sold to PolyGram in br br br s br br A name only unit appearing exclusively in the copyright WEA International Inc was created in early to handle distribution of all Warner Bros Elektra and Atlantic all these namings accounting for the initials in the title WEA releases for international countries br A proposed international merger between PolyGram and WEA was forbidden by both the US Federal Trade Commission and West Germany s cartel office so PolyGram s half owner Philips then purchased a further of the company from its partner Siemens and bought the remaining shares in The same year PolyGram divested its film and publishing operations closed PolyGram Pictures and sold Chappell Music to Warner for US million br WEA formed WEA Manufacturing in In WEA took over the German classical label Teldec and the British Magnet label br In it was announced that Warner Communications was to merge with Time Inc to form Time Warner a transaction that was completed in Following the merger WEA continued acquiring independent labels buying CGD Records Italy and MMG Records Japan in br br br s br Through the s Time Warner was the largest media company in the world with assets in excess of US billion and annual revenues in the billions of dollars by Warner s music labels were generating sales valued at more than US billion with operating profits of million and by its music division dominated the US music industry with a share of the domestic market Acquisitions and corporate changes within the Warner group of labels continued after the Time Warner merger in WEA purchased French label Carrere Records in it bought the leading French classical label Erato and in it bought the Spanish DRO Records Hungary s Magneoton label the Swedish Telegram Records Brazil s Continental Records and Finnish label Fazer Musiikki WEA was renamed Warner Music in br Atlantic launched two new subsidiary labels in the early s East West Records and Interscope Records In East West absorbed Atco Records and was eventually folded into Elektra Records In after causing much controversy Interscope was purchased by MCA Music Entertainment br During Warner Music faced one of the most serious public relations crises in its history when a major controversy erupted over the provocative Warner Bros recording Cop Killer from the self titled album by Body Count a heavy metal rap fusion band led by Ice T Unfortunately for Warner the song which mentioned the Rodney King case was issued just before the controversial acquittal of the police charged with King s beating which sparked the Los Angeles Riots and the confluence of events put the song under the national spotlight Complaints escalated over the summer conservative police associations called for a boycott of Time Warner products politicians including President George H W Bush denounced the label for releasing the song Warner executives received death threats Time Warner stockholders threatened to pull out of the company and the New Zealand police commissioner unsuccessfully tried to have the record banned there Although Ice T later voluntarily reissued Body Count without Cop Killer the furor seriously rattled Warner Music and in January the label made an undisclosed deal releasing Ice T from his contract and returning the Body Count master tapes to him br Also in the Rhino Records label signed a distribution agreement with Atlantic Records and Time Warner Entertainment bought a stake in the Rhino Records label The distribution agreement allowed Rhino to begin reissuing recordings from Atlantic s back catalogue br In Canadian beverage giant Seagram bought a stake in Time Warner and the Warner publishing division now called Warner Chappell Music acquired CPP Belwin becoming the world s largest owner of song copyrights and the world s largest publisher of printed music In Time Warner Entertainment made another dramatic expansion of its media holdings taking over the Turner Broadcasting System which by then included the Turner cable TV network CNN and the screen production houses Castle Rock Entertainment and New Line Cinema acquisitions that brought huge profits into the Warner Group thanks to content assets like Seinfeld and the highly successful The Lord of the Rings film trilogy br By the early s senior Warner staff like Ostin and Waronker had remained in their positions for several decades a highly unusual situation in the American music industry but the death of Steve Ross destabilized the Time Warner hierarchy and over the next few years the music group was increasingly disrupted by internal power struggles leading to a string of major executive upheavals in which The New York Times described as a virtual civil war br The central conflict was between Mo Ostin and Warner Music Group chairman Robert Morgado who had joined the Warner group in the late s Because of his political background he had been the chief of staff to former New York governor Hugh L Carey and his lack of music industry experience especially compared to the widely revered Ostin Morgado was viewed as an outsider at Warner Nevertheless he gained favour with Ross and Levin and was promoted in to oversee the Warner international music division after helping the company slash costs in its computer game sector br Since his appointment as head of WBR Ostin had always reported directly to Steve Ross and his successor Gerald Levin but in late when Ostin s contract came up for renewal Morgado asserted his authority insisting that Ostin should now report directly to him The tensions between them reached boiling point in July when Morgado appointed former Atlantic chief Doug Morris to head the Warner Music Group in the US a decision that many saw as a deliberate move to hasten the departure of Ostin and Elektra head Robert Krasnow Morgado s new structure was announced in August and Bob Krasnow resigned from Elektra the next day Within days after more than years with the Warner music group and more than years as president and chairman of Warner Bros Records Ostin announced he would not renew his current contract and would leave Warners when it expired on December There was more negative publicity the following month when leading Elektra act Metallica launched a lawsuit against the label seeking a release from their contract and ownership of their master tapes and claiming that Morgado had refused to honor a deal they had worked out with Krasnow before he quit br Ostin s departure marked a seismic shift in the corporate culture at WBR and the news was greeted with dismay by industry insiders and the many artists whose careers he had helped to nurture Lenny Waronker had agreed to take over as WBR chairman and CEO but in October he announced that he would not be taking up the position he initially said that he would remain as President of WBR but by this time there was already widespread speculation that he would leave and he did so soon afterwards The following year he re joined Ostin and son Michael as joint head of the newly launched DreamWorks label br Beginning in August Morgado alienated Morris by his clumsy handling of Warner s relationship with Interscope Records the successful label founded by Ted Field and Jimmy Iovine and part owned by Warner Morgado had resisted making a decision about increasing the Warner stake in Interscope which encouraged other companies to make overtures to the label in response Morgado threatened to send cease and desist notices to executives at several record companies demanding that they stop approaching Interscope with buyout offers a move that reportedly infuriated Iovine br By late Morris was gaining the upper hand over his rival and media reports claimed that Morris had moved to settle with Metallica offering a deal that was reportedly even more generous than the one they had worked out with Krasnow Morgado now faced a showdown with Morris who felt he was not being allowed to run WMG as he saw fit In October Morris and other Warner executives staged an unprecedented insurrection that nearly paralyzed the world s largest record company This led to a climactic meeting between Morris and Gerald Levin in late October at which Morris reportedly threatened to quit if he had to continue to report to Morgado br Morgado gave in to the demand that Morris be granted autonomy to run the North American operations and he was forced to upgrade Morris s position from chief operating officer to Chief Executive of Warner Music Group US Morris promptly named Danny Goldberg former president of Atlantic Records to run WBR in defiance of Morgado who had a different candidate in mind and Levin also reduced Morgado s power to oversee Warner s mail order record club division and its international operations Morris then brought in Sylvia Rhone and Seymour Stein to stabilize Elektra settled the Metallica lawsuit and persuaded Levin to purchase an additional of Interscope although this initiative proved short lived br The power struggle between Morgado and Morris reached a dramatic climax in May when Morgado was asked to resign by Gerald Levin following a welter of complaints from executives at the three major Warner Music labels who said that Morgado was undermining Morris s authority and damaging Warner s reputation among performers Morgado was immediately replaced by HBO chairman Michael J Fuchs but the corporate upheavals did not end there in late June Fuchs abruptly dismissed Doug Morris saying that Morris had been leading a campaign to destabilize Warner Music in an effort to seize control of the company As Morris s strongest ally Danny Goldberg was also under threat he was initially told that he could stay on as President of WBR as long as he refrained from office politics and concentrate on the day to day management of the label but he resigned as President of Warner Bros Records soon after to pursue other interests and was replaced by WBR vice chairman Russ Thyret br Despite early success with Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg and Morris s decision to increase Warner s stake to by the mid s Interscope Records was being seen as a liability for the Warner group Time Warner s board and investors had already been bruised by the damaging Cop Killer controversy and now they were faced with renewed criticism about the gangsta rap genre in which Interscope s associate imprint Death Row Records was a key label In mid Time Warner refused to distribute the Interscope album Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound forcing the label to seek outside distribution and late in the year TW sold its stake in Death Row back to co owners Jimmy Iovine and Ted Field and soon after it sold off its share in Interscope to MCA Music Entertainment br The upheaval at Warner was beneficial to its rivals who picked up valuable executives who had left Warner Goldberg moved over to Mercury Records Morris joined MCA Music Entertainment Group and led its reorganization into Universal Music Group now the world s largest record company In November Fuchs was himself sacked by Levin leaving the company with a reported US million golden parachute and Time Warner co chairmen Robert A Daly and Terry Semel took over the running of the music division br In Seagram boss Edgar Bronfman Jr held talks aimed at merging Seagram s Universal Music headed by Morris with the venerable British recording company EMI but the discussions came to nothing Bronfman then oversaw Universal s takeover by Vivendi WEA meanwhile continued to expand its publishing empire buying a stake in the Italian recording and music publishing group Nuova Fonit Cetra br Also in Time Warner Entertainment bought the remaining of the Rhino Records label they did not own The Rhino Records retail store in Los Angeles was not included Rhino then began reissuing the back catalogues of the Warner Reprise and Elektra Asylum labels In Rhino launched Rhino Handmade which released limited edition reissues of lesser known but still significant recordings from the WEA labels br br br s br br In Time Warner Entertainment merged with leading American internet service provider AOL to create AOL Time Warner The new conglomerate again tried and failed to acquire EMI and subsequent discussions about the takeover of BMG stalled with Bertelsmann eventually offloading BMG into a joint venture with Sony In AOLTW further consolidated its hold over the publishing industry buying of music publisher Deston Songs from Edel AG By the early s however the effects of the dot com crash had eroded AOL s profits and stock value and in the Time Warner board sidelined its under performing partner by dropping AOL from its business name br As a result of the CD price fixing issue a settlement was reached in involving the music publishers and distributors Sony Music WMG Bertelsmann Music Group EMI Music Universal Music In restitution for price fixing they agreed to pay a million fine and distribute million in CDs to public and non profit groups but admitted no wrongdoing br br Looking to reduce its debt load Time Warner the corporate successor to Warner Communications sold Warner Music Group in to a group of investors led by Edgar Bronfman Jr for US billion This spinoff was completed on February In the transition to independent ownership WMG hired record industry heavyweight Lyor Cohen from Universal Music Group the result of the merger between the PolyGram and MCA label families to attempt to reduce cost and increase performance Time Warner now Warner Bros Discovery no longer retains any ownership in WMG though it had the option to reacquire up to of WMG for three years following the closing of the transaction WMG did however have a royalty free license to use the Warner Bros shield for years as well as the old Warner Communications logo as WMG s main logo With the expiration of the royalty free license in May Warner Bros Records which became separate from the eponymous film studio after the spinoff was renamed Warner Records and a new logo was introduced to replace the WB shield br Once free of Time Warner WMG began cutting costs by offloading loss making or low earning divisions Like its rival EMI Warner reacted to the growth of the digital music market by making a historic change moving out of record production by closing or selling off disc pressing plants particularly in territories such as the US and the Netherlands where production costs are high The US manufacturing operations were sold to Cinram in before the purchase from Time Warner br In the Miami based Warner Bros Publications which printed and distributed a broad selection of sheet music books educational material orchestrations arrangements and tutorials was sold to Alfred Music Publishing although the sale excluded the print music business of WMG s Word Music church hymnals choral music and associated instrumental music br On May WMG apparently rejected a buyout offer from EMI Then WMG offered to buy EMI and it also rejected the offer In August EMI was purchased by Terra Firma Capital Partners Talk of a possible WMG acquisition of EMI was fanned once again in after WMG executed a bond offering for billion which brought to light WMG s relatively strong financial position which was contrasted with the weakened and debt laden state of EMI The same year WMG acquired Rykodisc and Roadrunner Records br In September after pulling its content from the service earlier in the year WMG entered into a new licensing deal with the video streaming service YouTube Under the deal WMG would be able to handle advertising sales for its artists music videos on the service as well as monetize user created videos that include WMG owned
