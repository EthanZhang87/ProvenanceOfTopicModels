id: 1754950
A remote online or managed backup service sometimes marketed as cloud backup or backup as a service is a service that provides users with a system for the backup storage and recovery of computer files Online backup providers are companies that provide this type of service to end users or clients Such backup services are considered a form of cloud computing br Online backup systems are typically built for a client software program that runs on a given schedule Some systems run once a day usually at night while computers aren t in use Other newer cloud backup services run continuously to capture changes to user systems nearly in real time The online backup system typically collects compresses encrypts and transfers the data to the remote backup service provider s servers or off site hardware br There are many products on the market all offering different feature sets service levels and types of encryption Providers of this type of service frequently target specific market segments High end LAN based backup systems may offer services such as Active Directory client remote control or open file backups Consumer online backup companies frequently have beta software offerings and or free trial backup services with fewer live support options br br br History br In the mid s the computer industry was in a great state of change with modems at speeds of to baud making transfers of large amounts of data slow MB in minutes While faster modems and more secure network protocols were in development tape backup systems gained in popularity During that same period the need for an affordable reliable online backup system was becoming clear especially for businesses with critical data br More online remote backup services came into existence during the heyday of the dot com boom in the late s The initial years of these large industry service providers were about capturing market share and understanding the importance and the role that these online backup providers were playing in the web services arena Today most service providers of online backup services position their services using the SaaS software as a service and PaaS Platform as a service strategy and its relevance is predicted to increase exponentially in the years to come as personal and enterprise data storage needs rise The last few years have also witnessed a healthy rise in the number of independent online backup providers br br br Characteristics br br br Service based br The assurance guarantee or validation that what was backed up is recoverable whenever it is required is critical Data stored in the service provider s cloud must undergo regular integrity validation to ensure its recoverability br Cloud BUR BackUp Restore services need to provide a variety of granularity when it comes to RTO s Recovery Time Objective One size does not fit all either for the customers or the applications within a customer s environment br The customer should never have to manage the back end storage repositories in order to back up and recover data br The interface used by the customer needs to enable the selection of data to protect or recover the establishment of retention times destruction dates as well as scheduling br Cloud backup needs to be an active process where data is collected from systems that store the original copy This means that cloud backup will not require data to be copied into a specific appliance from where data is collected before being transmitted to and stored in the service provider s data centre br br br Ubiquitous access br Cloud BUR utilizes standard networking protocols which today are primarily but not exclusively IP based to transfer data between the customer and the service provider br Vaults or repositories need to be always available to restore data to any location connected to the Service Provider s Cloud via private or public networks br br br Scalable and elastic br Cloud BUR enables flexible allocation of storage capacity to customers without limit Storage is allocated on demand and also de allocated as customers delete backup sets as they age br Cloud BUR enables a Service Provider to allocate storage capacity to a customer If that customer later deletes their data or no longer needs that capacity the Service Provider can then release and reallocate that same capacity to a different customer in an automated fashion br br br Metered by use br Cloud Backup allows customers to align the value of data with the cost of protecting it It is procured on a per gigabyte per month basis Prices tend to vary based on the age of data type of data email databases files etc volume number of backup copies and RTOs br Cloud Backup is a modern and efficient data backup solution that operates on a native cloud multitenant platform This advanced platform is specifically designed to share resources among users which makes data mobility possible for customers With this solution customers are not restricted to a single provider and can effortlessly move their data to another provider or back to a dedicated Private or Hybrid Cloud The security of customer data is of utmost importance and service providers take all necessary measures to ensure that customer data is always kept private and secure Such security measures include making sure that customer data is never accessible to other customers Service providers should also only access customer data with explicit permission By adhering to these strict security measures Cloud Backup providers can offer peace of mind to their customers and build trust in their services making it a reliable and trustworthy data backup solution for businesses of all sizes br br br Enterprise class cloud backup br An enterprise class cloud backup solution must include an on premises cache to mitigate any issues due to inconsistent Internet connectivity br Hybrid cloud backup works by storing data to local disk so that the backup can be captured at high speed and then either the backup software or a D D C Disk to Disk to Cloud appliance encrypts and transmits data to a service provider This adds protection against local br disasters Recent backups are retained locally to speed data recovery operations br There are a number of cloud storage appliances on the market that can be used as a backup target including appliances from CTERA Networks StorSimple and TwinStrata br Hybrid cloud backup is also beneficial for enterprise users who have security concerns When storing data locally before sending it to the cloud backup users can perform the necessary encryption operations incl technologies like br br Data encryption cipher AES AES AES or blowfish br Windows Encrypting File System EFS br Verification of files previously catalogued permitting a Tripwire like capability br CRAM MD password authentication between each component storage client and cloud br Configurable TLS SSL communications encryption between each component storage client and cloud br Computation of MD or SHA signatures of the file data if configured br Data encryption should additionally be applied when you choose a public cloud service provider br The same is important for the compression of backup data The local backup cache is used to compress the data before sending it to the cloud in order to lower the network bandwidth load and improve backup speed This becomes critical for enterprises which backup huge databases like Oracle or MS SQL or huge files like virtual machine images or mail server databases EDB files of Exchange br Recent improvements in CPU availability allow increased use of software agents instead of hardware appliances for enterprise cloud backup The software only approach can offer advantages including decreased complexity simple scalability significant cost savings and improved data recovery times br br br Typical features br Encryption br Data should be encrypted before it is sent across the internet and it should be stored in its encrypted state Encryption should be at least bits and the user should have the option of using his own encryption key which should never be sent to the server br Network backup br A backup service supporting network backup can back up multiple computers servers or Network Attached Storage appliances on a local area network from a single computer or device br Continuous backup Continuous Data Protection br Allows the service to back up continuously or on a predefined schedule Both methods have advantages and disadvantages Most backup services are schedule based and perform backups at a predetermined time Some services provide continuous data backups which are used by large financial institutions and large online retailers However there is typically a trade off with performance and system resources br File by File Restore br The ability for users to restore files themselves without the assistance of a Service Provider by allowing the user select files by name and or folder Some services allow users to select files by searching for filenames and folder names by dates by file type by backup set and by tags br Online access to files br Some services allow you to access backed up files via a normal web browser Many services do not provide this type of functionality br Data compression br Data will typically be compressed with a lossless compression algorithm to minimize the amount of bandwidth used br Differential data compression br A way to further minimize network traffic is to transfer only the binary data that has changed from one day to the next similar to the open source file transfer service Rsync More advanced online backup services use this method rather than transfer entire files br Bandwidth usage br User selectable option to use more or less bandwidth it may be possible to set this to change at various times of day br Off Line Backup br Off Line Backup allows along with and as part of the online backup solution to cover daily backups in time when network connection is down At this time the remote backup software must perform backup onto a local media device like a tape drive a disk or another server The minute network connection is restored remote backup software will update the remote datacenter with the changes coming out of the off line backup media br Synchronization br Many services support data synchronization allowing users to keep a consistent library of all their files across many computers The technology can help productivity and increase access to data br br br Common features for business users br Bulk restore br A way to restore data from a portable storage device when a full restore over the Internet might take too long br Centralized management console br Allows for an IT department or staff member to monitor and manage backups restores for the regular user br File retention policies br Many businesses require a flexible file retention policy that can be applied to an unlimited number of groups of files called sets br Fully managed services br Some services offer a higher level of support to businesses that might request immediate help proactive monitoring personal visits from their service provider or telephone support br Redundancy br Multiple copies of data backed up at different locations This can be achieved by having two or more mirrored data centers or by keeping a local copy of the latest version of backed up data on site with the business br Regulatory compliance br Some businesses are required to comply with government regulations that govern privacy disclosure and legal discovery A service provider that offers this type of service assists customers with proper compliance with and understanding of these laws br Seed loading br Ability to send a first backup on a portable storage device rather than over the Internet when a user has large amounts of data that they need quickly backed up br Server backup br Many businesses require backups of servers and the special applications or databases that run on them such as groupware SQL ERP or CRM systems and directory services This requires not only regular file based approach but specific point in time backups and restores for databases br Versioning br Keeps multiple past versions of files to allow for rollback to or restoration from a specific point in time br br br Cost factors br Online backup services are usually priced as a function of the following things br br The total amount of data being backed up br The total amount of data being restored br The number of machines covered by the backup service br The maximum number of versions of each file that are kept br Data retention and archiving period options br Managed backups vs Unmanaged backups br The level of service and features available br Some vendors limit the number of versions of a file that can be kept in the system Some services omit this restriction and provide an unlimited number of versions Add on features plug ins like the ability to back up currently open or locked files are usually charged as an extra but some services provide this built in br Most remote backup services reduce the amount of data to be sent over the wire by only backing up changed files This approach to backing up means that the customers total stored data is reduced Reducing the amount of data sent and also stored can be further drastically reduced by only transmitting the changed data bits by binary or block level incremental backups Solutions that transmit only these changed binary data bits do not waste bandwidth by transmitting the same file data over and over again if only small amounts change br br br Advantages br Remote backup has advantages over traditional backup methods br br Remote backup does not require user intervention The user does not have to change tapes label CDs or perform other manual steps br Unlimited data retention presuming the backup provider stays in business br Some remote backup services will work continuously backing up files as they are changed br Most remote backup services will maintain a list of versions of your files br Most remote backup services will use a bit encryption to send data over unsecured links e g internet br A few remote backup services can reduce backup by only transmitting changed data br Manage and secure digital data information br br br Disadvantages br Remote backup has some disadvantages over traditional backup methods br br Depending on the available network bandwidth the restoration of data can be slow Because data is stored offsite the data must be recovered either via the Internet or via a disk shipped from the online backup service provider br Some backup service providers have no guarantee that stored data will be kept private br It is possible that a remote backup service provider could go out of business or be purchased which may affect the accessibility of one s data or the cost to continue using the service br If the encryption password is lost data recovery will be impossible However with managed services this should not be a problem br Residential broadband services often have monthly limits that preclude large backups They are also usually asymmetric the user to network link regularly used to store backups is much slower than the network to user link used only when data is restored br In terms of price when looking at the raw cost of hard disks remote backups cost about times per GB what a local backup would br br br Managed vs unmanaged br Some services provide expert backup management services as part of the overall offering These services typically include br br Assistance configuring the initial backup br Continuous monitoring of the backup processes on the client machines to ensure that backups actually happen br Proactive alerting in the event that any backups fail br Assistance in restoring and recovering data br br br Scheduled vs manual vs event based backup br There are three distinct types of backup modes scheduled manual and event based br br Scheduled Backup data is backed up according to a fixed schedule br Manual Backup backup of data is triggered by user input br Event based Backup backup of data is triggered by some computer events e g database or application stoppage cold backup br br br See also br
