IPG Photonics Corporation is a manufacturer of fiber lasers IPG Photonics developed and commercialized optical fiber lasers which are used in a variety of applications including materials processing medical applications and telecommunications IPG has manufacturing facilities in the United States Germany Russia and Italy br IPG was founded in by Valentin P Gapontsev IPG s Executive Chairman and former chief executive officer and Igor Samartsev IPG s Chief Technology Officer br IPG also develops and manufactures fiber amplifiers diode lasers and several complementary products used with its lasers such as optical delivery cables fiber couplers and beam switches Its products are sold globally and primarily used for materials processing advanced technologies telecommunications and medical applications br The company is headquartered in Marlborough Massachusetts with more than facilities around the world br br br History br IPG was founded in in Russia by physicist Valentin Gapontsev br Building on previous demonstrations to improve the efficiencies of fiber lasers in Valentin Gapontsev and Igor Samartsev first proposed using fiber laser technology to produce a high power laser beam demonstrating W CW Er doped fiber lasers at m and a W laser in Using a side pumping technique Gapontsev and Samartsev s unique fiber laser architecture enabled many semiconductor laser diodes to pump through one single mode fiber br This created a high power infrared laser with single mode beam quality This discovery also resulted in high power optical amplifiers Optical amplifiers convert a small light signal into a powerful beam often a thousand times brighter but otherwise identical to the original signal In these amplifiers are used in telecommunications and Internet networks to transmit data over optical fiber and free space br br br NTO IRE Polus br In December Gapontsev and Alexander Shestakov founded NTO IRE Polus The company was based in Fryazino Russia Shestakov left the company in Gapontsev started using the acronym IPG to refer to his company It stood for IRE Polus Group br In IPG won a contract with Italtel a large Italian telecommunications carrier IPG developed a mW erbium doped amplifier for Italtel which became IPG s first marketable product IPG then developed erbium fiber amplifiers using a new pump design and fiber solution In order to introduce the technology to the market Italtel convinced Gapontsev to transfer component production to Italy This became IPG s first European subsidiary br In Daimler Benz Aerospace DBA a German company hired IPG to create a laser based obstacle warning system for a helicopter DBA funded IPG s development of a new fiber laser based solution IPG opened a manufacturing and research facility in Berlin to develop to transmitter A year later IPG opened a facility near Frankfurt br In IPG launched industrial quality diffraction limited single mode W fiber lasers IPG continued developing new products and selling them to customers in Japan the United States and Europe br br br US subsidiary br In IPG established the IPG Photonics Corporation headquartered in Oxford Massachusetts br By IPG was a million company Its customers included Alcatel Fujitsu Lucent Siemens and Marconi Reltec During this time IPG started developing its multi kilowatt diode pumped fiber lasers br In IPG introduced a W diffraction limited fiber laser using its multi fiber side coupling technology In comparison the conventional diode pumped solid state lasers DPSSLs on the market used diode bars as the pump source with each bar typically producing W of power br By the end of capital spending by telecommunications providers was reduced and IPG revenue from communications applications declined IPG invested much of its remaining capital in the development of high power industrial fiber lasers mass production lines and semiconductor pump laser diode technology IPG pursued raising the maximum wattage of fiber laser technology br Between and IPG developed multi kW industrial class fiber lasers This was accomplished by combining the output beams of several W fiber lasers br In IPG raised more than million net of proceeds in an initial public offering The company continued to expand opening offices near Detroit Michigan in Beijing China in and its Silicon Valley Technology Center in br Beginning in the company introduced its first quasi continuous wave QCW lasers into the market br IPG s Oxford facility was expanded to include a new production facility in br In worldwide IPG revenue grew to billion a increase over the previous year In the company was added to the S P stock market index br In late IPG acquired Genesis Systems a robotic integration company br IPG announced the release of the LightWELD a handheld laser welding system late in br In Valentin Gapontsev stepped down as chief executive officer retaining a position as Executive Chairman of the company Then Eugene Scherbakov succeeded Dr Gapontsev as IPG s CEO Mark M Gitin currently serves as chief executive officer br br br Canadian Subsidiary br In late IPG announced the acquisition of Laser Depth Dynamics a provider of in process quality monitoring and control solutions for laser based welding applications The subsidiary operates as IPG Photonics Canada Inc located in beautiful Kingston Ontario br br br br br br
