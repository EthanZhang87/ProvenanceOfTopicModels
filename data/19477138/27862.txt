Sydney is the capital city of the state of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia Located on Australia s east coast the metropolis surrounds Sydney Harbour and extends about km mi from the Pacific Ocean in the east to the Blue Mountains in the west and about km mi from the Ku ring gai Chase National Park and the Hawkesbury River in the north and north west to the Royal National Park and Macarthur in the south and south west Greater Sydney consists of suburbs spread across local government areas Residents of the city are colloquially known as Sydneysiders The estimated population in June was which is about of the state s population The city s nicknames include the Emerald City and the Harbour City br Aboriginal Australians have inhabited the Greater Sydney region for at least years and their engravings and cultural sites are common The traditional custodians of the land on which modern Sydney stands are the clans of the Darug Dharawal and Eora peoples During his first Pacific voyage in James Cook charted the eastern coast of Australia making landfall at Botany Bay In the First Fleet of convicts led by Arthur Phillip founded Sydney as a British penal colony the first European settlement in Australia After World War II Sydney experienced mass migration and by over per cent of the population was born overseas Foreign countries of birth with the greatest representation are mainland China India the United Kingdom Vietnam and the Philippines br Despite being one of the most expensive cities in the world Sydney frequently ranks in the top ten most liveable cities It is classified as an Alpha city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network indicating its influence in the region and throughout the world Ranked eleventh in the world for economic opportunity Sydney has an advanced market economy with strengths in education finance manufacturing and tourism The University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales are ranked equal th in the world br Sydney has hosted major international sporting events such as the Summer Olympics The city is among the top fifteen most visited with millions of tourists coming each

the World Heritage listed Sydney Opera House are major tourist attractions Central Station is the hub of Sydney s suburban and light rail networks and longer distance services with metro platforms under construction The main passenger airport serving the city is Kingsford Smith Airport one of the world s oldest continually operating airports br br br Toponymy br In Captain Arthur Phillip the first governor of New South Wales named the cove where the first British settlement was established Sydney Cove after Home Secretary Thomas Townshend st Viscount Sydney The cove was called Warrane by the Aboriginal inhabitants Phillip considered naming the settlement Albion but this name was never officially used By Phillip and other officials were regularly calling the township Sydney Sydney was declared a city in br The Gadigal Cadigal clan whose territory stretches along the southern shore of Port Jackson from South Head to Darling Harbour are the traditional owners of the land on which the British settlement was initially established and call their territory Gadi Cadi Aboriginal clan names within the Sydney region were often formed by adding the suffix gal to a word denoting the name for their territory a specific place in their territory a food source or totem Greater Sydney covers the traditional lands of known Aboriginal clans br br br History br br br First inhabitants of the region br The first people to inhabit the area now known as Sydney were Aboriginal Australians who had migrated from southeast Asia via northern Australia Flaked pebbles found in Western Sydney s gravel sediments might indicate human occupation from to years ago while radiocarbon dating has shown evidence of human activity in the region from around years ago Prior to the arrival of the British there were to Aboriginal people in the greater Sydney region br The inhabitants subsisted on fishing hunting and gathering plants and shellfish The diet of the coastal clans was more reliant on seafood whereas hinterland clans ate more forest animals and plants The clans had distinctive equipment and weapons mostly made of stone wood plant materials bone and shell They also differed in their body decorations hairstyles songs and dances Aboriginal clans had a rich ceremonial life part of a belief system centring on ancestral totemic and supernatural beings People from different clans and language groups came together to participate in initiation and other ceremonies These occasions fostered trade marriages and clan alliances br The earliest British settlers recorded the word Eora as an Aboriginal term meaning either people or from this place The clans of the Sydney area occupied land with traditional boundaries There is debate however about which group or nation these clans belonged to and the extent of differences in language and rites The major groups were the coastal Eora people the Dharug Darug occupying the inland area from Parramatta to the Blue Mountains and the Dharawal people south of Botany Bay Darginung and Gundungurra languages were spoken on the fringes of the Sydney area br br The first meeting between Aboriginals and British explorers occurred on April when Lieutenant James Cook landed at Botany Bay Kamay and encountered the Gweagal clan Two Gweagal men opposed the landing party and one was shot and wounded Cook and his crew stayed at Botany Bay for a week collecting water timber fodder and botanical specimens and exploring the surrounding area Cook sought to establish relations with the Aboriginal population without success br br br Convict town br Britain had been sending convicts to its American colonies for most of the eighteenth century and the loss of these colonies in was the impetus to establish a penal colony at Botany Bay Proponents of colonisation also pointed to the strategic importance of a new base in the Asia Pacific region and its potential to provide much needed timber and flax for the navy br The First Fleet of ships under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip arrived in Botany Bay in January It comprised more than a thousand settlers including convicts The fleet soon moved to the more suitable Port Jackson where a settlement was established at Sydney Cove on January The colony of New South Wales was formally proclaimed by Governor Phillip on February Sydney Cove offered a fresh water supply and a safe harbour which Philip described as the finest Harbour in the World Here a Thousand Sail of the Line may ride in the most perfect Security br The settlement was planned to be a self sufficient penal colony based on subsistence agriculture Trade and shipbuilding were banned in order to keep the convicts isolated However the soil around the settlement proved poor and the first crops failed leading to several years of hunger and strict rationing The food crisis was relieved with the arrival of the Second Fleet in mid and the Third Fleet in Former convicts received small grants of land and government and private farms spread to the more fertile lands around Parramatta Windsor and Camden on the Cumberland Plain By the colony was self sufficient in food br A smallpox epidemic in April killed about half the region s Indigenous population In November Bennelong led a group of survivors of the Sydney clans into the settlement establishing a continuous presence of Aboriginal Australians in settled Sydney br br Phillip had been given no instructions for urban development but in July submitted a plan for the new town at Sydney Cove It included a wide central avenue a permanent Government House law courts hospital and other public buildings but no provision for warehouses shops or other commercial buildings Phillip promptly ignored his own plan and unplanned development became a feature of Sydney s topography After Phillip s departure in December the colony s military officers began acquiring land and importing consumer goods from visiting ships Former convicts engaged in trade and opened small businesses Soldiers and former convicts built houses on Crown land with or without official permission in what was now commonly called Sydney town Governor William Bligh imposed restrictions on commerce and ordered the demolition of buildings erected on Crown land including some owned by past and serving military officers The resulting conflict culminated in the Rum Rebellion of in which Bligh was deposed by the New South Wales Corps br Governor Lachlan Macquarie played a leading role in the development of Sydney and New South Wales establishing a bank a currency and a hospital He employed a planner to design the street layout of Sydney and commissioned the construction of roads wharves churches and public buildings Parramatta Road linking Sydney and Parramatta was opened in and a road across the Blue Mountains was completed in opening the way for large scale farming and grazing west of the Great Dividing Range br br Following the departure of Macquarie official policy encouraged the emigration of free British settlers to New South Wales Immigration to the colony increased from free settlers in to in many of whom settled in Sydney By the s Sydney exhibited a geographic divide between poor and working class residents living west of the Tank Stream in areas such as The Rocks and the more affluent residents living to its east Free settlers free born residents and former convicts now represented the vast majority of the population of Sydney leading to increasing public agitation for responsible government and an end to transportation Transportation to New South Wales ceased in br br br Conflict on the Cumberland Plain br In Irish convicts led around rebels in the Castle Hill Rebellion an attempt to march on Sydney commandeer a ship and sail to freedom Poorly armed and with their leader Philip Cunningham captured the main body of insurgents were routed by about troops and volunteers at Rouse Hill At least convicts were killed in the uprising and subsequent executions br As the colony spread to the more fertile lands around the Hawkesbury River north west of Sydney conflict between the settlers and the Darug people intensified reaching a peak from to Bands of Darug people led by Pemulwuy and later by his son Tedbury burned crops killed livestock and raided settler stores in a pattern of resistance that was to be repeated as the colonial frontier expanded A military garrison was established on the Hawkesbury in The death toll from to was settlers and up to Darug br Conflict again erupted from to with the expansion of the colony into Dharawal country in the Nepean region south west of Sydney Following the deaths of several settlers Governor Macquarie dispatched three military detachments into Dharawal lands culminating in the Appin massacre April in which at least Aboriginal people were killed br br br Colonial city br The New South Wales Legislative Council became a semi elected body in Sydney was declared a city the same year and a governing council established elected on a restrictive property franchise The discovery of gold in New South Wales and Victoria in initially caused economic disruption as men moved to the goldfields Melbourne soon overtook Sydney as Australia s largest city leading to an enduring rivalry between the two However increased immigration from overseas and wealth from gold exports increased demand for housing consumer goods services and urban amenities The New South Wales government also stimulated growth by investing heavily in railways trams roads ports telegraph schools and urban services The population of Sydney and its suburbs grew from in to in The city developed many of its characteristic features The growing population packed into rows of terrace houses in narrow streets New public buildings of sandstone abounded including at the University of Sydney the Australian Museum the Town Hall and the General Post Office Elaborate coffee palaces and hotels were erected Daylight bathing at Sydney s beaches was banned but segregated bathing at designated ocean baths was popular br Drought the winding down of public works and a financial crisis led to economic depression in Sydney throughout most of the s Meanwhile the Sydney based premier of New South Wales George Reid became a key figure in the process of federation br br br State capital present br br When the six colonies federated on January Sydney became the capital of the State of New South Wales The spread of bubonic plague in prompted the state government to modernise the wharves and demolish inner city slums The outbreak of the First World War in saw more Sydney males volunteer for the armed forces than the Commonwealth authorities could process and helped reduce unemployment Those returning from the war in were promised homes fit for heroes in new suburbs such as Daceyville and Matraville Garden suburbs and mixed industrial and residential developments also grew along the rail and tram corridors The population reached one million in after Sydney had regained its position as the most populous city in Australia The government created jobs with massive public projects such as the electrification of the Sydney rail network and building the Sydney Harbour Bridge br br Sydney was more severely affected by the Great Depression of the s than regional New South Wales or Melbourne New building almost came to a standstill and by the unemployment rate for male workers was per cent but over per cent in working class areas such as Alexandria and Redfern Many families were evicted from their homes and shanty towns grew along coastal Sydney and Botany Bay the largest being Happy Valley at La Perouse The Depression also exacerbated political divisions In March when populist Labor premier Jack Lang attempted to open the Sydney Harbour Bridge he was upstaged by Francis de Groot of the far right New Guard who slashed the ribbon with a sabre br In January Sydney celebrated the Empire Games and the sesquicentenary of European settlement in Australia One journalist wrote Golden beaches Sun tanned men and maidens Red roofed villas terraced above the blue waters of the harbour Even Melbourne seems like some grey and stately city of Northern Europe compared with Sydney s sub tropical splendours A congress of the Aborigines of Australia declared January A Day of Mourning for the whiteman s seizure of our country br With the outbreak of Second World War in Sydney experienced a surge in industrial development Unemployment virtually disappeared and women moved into jobs previously typically reserved for males Sydney was attacked by Japanese submarines in May and June with killed Households built air raid shelters and performed drills Military establishments in response to World War II in Australia included the Garden Island Tunnel System the only tunnel warfare complex in Sydney and the heritage listed military fortification systems Bradleys Head Fortification Complex and Middle Head Fortifications which were part of a total defence system for Sydney Harbour br A post war immigration and baby boom saw a rapid increase in Sydney s population and the spread of low density housing in suburbs throughout the Cumberland Plain Immigrants mostly from Britain and continental Europe and their children accounted for over three quarters of Sydney s population growth between and The newly created Cumberland County Council oversaw low density residential developments the largest at Green Valley and Mount Druitt Older residential centres such as Parramatta Bankstown and Liverpool became suburbs of the metropolis Manufacturing protected by high tariffs employed over a third of the workforce from to the s However as the long post war economic boom progressed retail and other service industries became the main source of new jobs br An estimated one million onlookers most of the city s population watched Queen Elizabeth II land in at Farm Cove where Captain Phillip had raised the Union Jack years earlier commencing her Australian Royal Tour It was the first time a reigning monarch stepped onto Australian soil br Increasing high rise development in Sydney and the expansion of suburbs beyond the green belt envisaged by the planners of the s resulted in community protests In the early s trade unions and resident action groups imposed green bans on development projects in historic areas such as The Rocks Federal State and local governments introduced heritage and environmental legislation The Sydney Opera House was also controversial for its cost and disputes between architect J rn Utzon and government officials However soon after it opened in it became a major tourist attraction and symbol of the city The progressive reduction in tariff protection from began the transformation of Sydney from a manufacturing centre to a world city From the s overseas immigration grew rapidly with Asia the Middle East and Africa becoming major sources By the population of Sydney was over million with of the population born overseas China and India overtook England as the largest source countries for overseas born residents br br br Geography br br br Topography br br Sydney is a coastal basin with the Tasman Sea to the east the Blue Mountains to the west the Hawkesbury River to the north and the Woronora Plateau to the south br Sydney spans two geographic regions The Cumberland Plain lies to the south and west of the Harbour and is relatively flat The Hornsby Plateau is located to the north and is dissected by steep valleys The flat areas of the south were the first to be developed it was not until the construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge that the northern reaches became more heavily populated Seventy surf beaches can be found along its coastline with Bondi Beach being the most famous br The Nepean River wraps around the western edge of the city and becomes the Hawkesbury River before reaching Broken Bay Most of Sydney s water storages can be found on tributaries of the Nepean River The Parramatta River is mostly industrial and drains a large area of Sydney s western suburbs into Port Jackson The southern parts of the city are drained by the Georges River and the Cooks River into Botany Bay br There is no single definition of the boundaries of Sydney The Australian Statistical Geography Standard definition of Greater Sydney covers km sq mi and includes the local government areas of Central Coast in the north Hawkesbury in the north west Blue Mountains in the west Sutherland Shire in the south and Wollondilly in the south west The local government area of the City of Sydney covers about square kilometres from Garden island in the east to Bicentennial Park in the west and south to the suburbs of Alexandria and Rosebery br br br Geology br br Sydney is made up of mostly Triassic rock with some recent igneous dykes and volcanic necks typically found in the Prospect dolerite intrusion west of Sydney The Sydney Basin was formed in the early Triassic period The sand that was to become the sandstone of today was laid down between and million years ago The sandstone has shale lenses and fossil riverbeds br The Sydney Basin bioregion includes coastal features of cliffs beaches and estuaries Deep river valleys known as rias were carved during the Triassic period in the Hawkesbury sandstone of the coastal region The rising sea level between and years ago flooded the rias to form estuaries and deep harbours Port Jackson better known as Sydney Harbour is one such ria Sydney features two major soil types sandy soils which originate from the Hawkesbury sandstone and clay which are from shales and volcanic rocks though some soils may be a mixture of the two br Directly overlying the older Hawkesbury sandstone is the Wianamatta shale a geological feature found in western Sydney that was deposited in connection with a large river delta during the Middle Triassic The Wianamatta shale generally comprises fine grained sedimentary rocks such as shales mudstones ironstones siltstones and laminites with less common sandstone units The Wianamatta Group is made up of Bringelly Shale Minchinbury Sandstone and Ashfield Shale br br br Ecology br br The most prevalent plant communities in the Sydney region are grassy woodlands i e savannas and some pockets of dry sclerophyll forests which consist of eucalyptus trees casuarinas melaleucas corymbias and angophoras with shrubs typically wattles callistemons grevilleas and banksias and a semi continuous grass in the understory The plants in this community tend to have rough spiky leaves due to low soil fertility Sydney also features a few areas of wet sclerophyll forests in the wetter elevated areas in the north and northeast These forests are defined by straight tall tree canopies with a moist understory of soft leaved shrubs tree ferns and herbs br The predominant vegetation community in Sydney is the Cumberland Plain Woodland in Western Sydney Cumberland Plain followed by the Sydney Turpentine Ironbark Forest in the Inner West and Northern Sydney the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub in the coastline and the Blue Gum High Forest scantily present in the North Shore all of which are critically endangered The city also includes the Sydney Sandstone Ridgetop Woodland found in Ku ring gai Chase National Park on the Hornsby Plateau to the north br Sydney is home to dozens of bird species which commonly include the Australian raven Australian magpie crested pigeon noisy miner and the pied currawong Introduced bird species ubiquitously found in Sydney are the common myna common starling house sparrow and the spotted dove Reptile species are also numerous and predominantly include skinks Sydney has a few mammal and spider species such as the grey headed flying fox and the Sydney funnel web respectively and has a huge diversity of marine species inhabiting its harbour and beaches br br br Climate br br Under the K ppen Geiger classification Sydney has a humid subtropical climate Cfa with warm sometimes hot summers and generally mild to cool winters The El Ni o Southern Oscillation the Indian Ocean Dipole and the Southern Annular Mode play an important role in determining Sydney s weather patterns drought and bushfire on the one hand and storms and flooding on the other associated with the opposite phases of the oscillation in Australia The weather is moderated by proximity to the ocean and more extreme temperatures are recorded in the inland western suburbs br At Sydney s primary weather station at Observatory Hill extreme temperatures have ranged from C F on January to C F on June An average of days a year have temperatures at or above C F in the central business district CBD In contrast the metropolitan area averages between and days depending on the suburb The hottest day in the metropolitan area occurred in Penrith on January where a high of C F was recorded The average annual temperature of the sea ranges from C F in September to C F in February Sydney has an average of hours of sunshine per day and clear days annually Due to the inland location frost is recorded early in the morning in Western Sydney a few times in winter Autumn and spring are the transitional seasons with spring showing a larger temperature variation than autumn br Sydney experiences an urban heat island effect This makes certain parts of the city more vulnerable to extreme heat including coastal suburbs In late spring and summer temperatures over C F are not uncommon though hot dry conditions are usually ended by a southerly buster a powerful southerly that brings gale winds and a rapid fall in temperature Since Sydney is downwind of the Great Dividing Range it occasionally experiences dry westerly foehn winds typically in winter and early spring which are the reason for its warm maximum temperatures Westerly winds are intense when the Roaring Forties or the Southern Annular Mode shift towards southeastern Australia where they may damage homes and affect flights in addition to making the temperature seem colder than it actually is br Rainfall has a moderate to low variability and has historically been fairly uniform throughout the year although in recent years it has been more summer dominant and erratic Precipitation is usually higher in summer through to autumn and lower in late winter to early spring In late autumn and winter east coast lows may bring large amounts of rainfall especially in the CBD In the warm season black nor easters are usually the cause of heavy rain events though other forms of low pressure areas including remnants of ex cyclones may also bring heavy deluge and afternoon thunderstorms Snowfall was last reported in though a fall of graupel or soft hail in the Upper North Shore was mistaken by many for snow in July In dry conditions brought a severe dust storm towards the city br br br Regions br br The Greater Sydney Commission divides Sydney into three cities and five districts based on the LGAs in the metropolitan area The metropolis of three cities comprises Eastern Harbour City Central River City and Western Parkland City The Australian Bureau of Statistics also includes City of Central Coast the
