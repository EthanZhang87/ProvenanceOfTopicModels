title: Digital single-lens reflex camera
id: 1181109
A digital single lens reflex camera digital SLR or DSLR is a digital camera that combines the optics and mechanisms of a single lens reflex camera with a solid state image sensor and digitally records the images from the sensor br The reflex design scheme is the primary difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras In the reflex design light travels through the lens and then to a mirror that alternates to send the image to either a prism which shows the image in the optical viewfinder or the image sensor when the shutter release button is pressed The viewfinder of a DSLR presents an image that will not differ substantially from what is captured by the camera s sensor as it presents it as a direct optical view through the main camera lens rather than showing an image through a separate secondary lens br DSLRs largely replaced film based SLRs during the s Major camera manufacturers began to transition their product lines away from DSLR cameras to mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras MILCs beginning in the s br br In Willard S Boyle and George E Smith invented charge coupled semiconductor devices which can be used as analog storage registers and image sensors A CCD Charge Coupled Device imager provides a low noise analog image signal which is digitized when used in a digital camera For their contribution to digital photography Boyle and Smith were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in br In Fairchild developed a x pixel interline CCD image sensor This CCD was used in the first commercial CCD camera the Fairchild MV which was introduced in late In Kodak scientists Peter Dillon and Albert Brault used this Fairchild CCD image sensor to create the first color CCD image sensor by fabricating a red green and blue color filter array that was registered and bonded to the CCD In Kodak engineer Steven Sasson built the first portable battery operated digital still camera which used a zoom lens from a Kodak Super mm movie camera and a monochrome Fairchild pixel CCD br br The first prototype filmless SLR camera was publicly demonstrated by Sony in August The Sony Mavica a magnetic still video camera used a color striped format CCD sensor with K pixels along with analog video signal processing and recording The Mavica electronic still camera employed a TTL single lens reflex viewfinder as shown in the graphic from a June Sony press release It recorded FM modulated analog video signals on a newly developed magnetic floppy disk dubbed the Mavipak br The disk format was later standardized as the Still Video Floppy or SVF so the Sony Mavica was the first SVF SLR to be demonstrated but it was not a D SLR since it recorded analog video images rather than digital images Starting in many Japanese companies demonstrated prototype SVF cameras including Toshiba Canon Copal Hitachi Panasonic Sanyo and Mitsubishi br The Canon RC introduced in May was the first SVF camera and the first SVF SLR camera sold in the US It employed an SLR viewfinder and included a format color CCD sensor with K pixels It was sold along with removable mm and mm zoom lens br Over the next five years many other companies began selling SVF analog electronic cameras These included the monochrome Nikon QV C SVF SLR camera introduced in which had an F mount for interchangeable QV Nikkor lenses br br In the Kodak Microelectronics Technology Division developed a MP CCD image sensor the first with more than million pixels In this sensor was integrated with a Canon F film SLR body at the Kodak Federal Systems Division to create an early DSLR camera The digital back monitored the camera body battery current to sync the image sensor exposure to the film body shutter Digital images were stored on a tethered hard drive and processed for histogram feedback to the user This camera was created for the U S government and was followed by several other models intended for government use and eventually a commercial DSLR launched by Kodak in In Nikon co developed the Nikon E series with Fujifilm The E series included the Nikon E E S Nikon E N E NS and Nikon E E S with the E S released in December br In the late s Sony introduced the Digital Mavica series of consumer digital cameras Unlike the original analog Mavica the Digital Mavica cameras recorded JPEG compressed image files on standard inch magnetic floppy discettes meant to simplify camera to computer data transfer and did not have an SLR viewfinder br In Nikon announced the Nikon D The D s body was similar to Nikon s professional mm film SLRs and it had the same Nikkor lens mount allowing the D to use Nikon s existing line of AI AIS manual focus and AF lenses Although Nikon and other manufacturers had produced digital SLR cameras for several years prior the D was the first professional digital SLR that displaced Kodak s then undisputed reign over the professional market br Over the next decade other camera manufacturers entered the DSLR market including Canon Kodak Fujifilm Minolta later Konica Minolta and ultimately acquired by Sony Pentax whose camera division is now owned by Ricoh Olympus Panasonic Samsung Sigma and Sony br In January Fujifilm announced the FinePix S Pro the first consumer level DSLR br In November Canon released its megapixel EOS D the brand s first professional digital body In Canon introduced the megapixel EOS D SLR camera known in the United States and Canada as the Digital Rebel and in Japan as the Kiss Digital with an MSRP of US aimed at the consumer market Its commercial success encouraged other manufacturers to produce competing digital SLRs lowering entry costs and allowing more amateur photographers to purchase DSLRs br In Konica Minolta released the Konica Minolta Maxxum D the first DSLR with in body image stabilization which later become standard in Pentax Olympus and Sony Alpha cameras br In early Nikon released the D the first DSLR to feature video recording Since then all major companies have offered cameras with this functionality br Over time the number of megapixels in imaging sensors has increased steadily with most companies focusing on high ISO performance speed of focus higher frame rates the elimination of digital noise produced by the imaging sensor and price reductions to lure new customers br In June Canon announced the first DSLR to feature a touchscreen the EOS D Rebel T i Kiss X i Although this feature had been widely used on both compact cameras and mirrorless models it had not made an appearance on a DSLR until the D br br The DSLR market is dominated by Japanese companies and the top five manufacturers are Japanese Canon Nikon Olympus Pentax and Sony Other manufacturers of DSLRs include Mamiya Sigma Leica Germany and Hasselblad Swedish br In Canon edged out Nikon with of worldwide sales to the latter s followed by Sony and Olympus each with approximately market share In the Japanese domestic market Nikon captured to Canon s with Pentax a distant third at br In Canon s and Nikon s offerings took the majority of sales In Canon controlled of the DSLR market followed by Nikon with and Sony with br For Canon and Nikon digital SLRs are their biggest source of profit For Canon their DSLRs brought in four times the profits from compact digital cameras while Nikon earned more from DSLRs and lenses than from any other product Olympus and Panasonic have since exited the DSLR market and now focus on producing mirrorless cameras br In after a decade of double digit growth DSLR along with MILC sales were down percent This may be due to some low end DSLR users choosing to use a smartphone instead The market intelligence firm IDC predicted that Nikon would be out of business by if the trend continued although this did not come to pass Regardless the market has shifted from being driven by hardware to software and camera manufacturers have not been keeping up br br Beginning in the s major camera manufacturers began to transition their product lines away from DSLR cameras to mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras MILCs In September Olympus announced they would stop the development of DSLR cameras and focus on the development of MILCs Nikon announced they were ending production of DSLRs in Japan in followed by similar announcements from Canon and Sony br br Currently DSLRs are widely used by consumers and professional still photographers Well established DSLRs currently offer a larger variety of dedicated lenses and other equipment Mainstream DSLRs in full frame or smaller image sensor format are produced by Canon Nikon Pentax and Sigma Pentax Phase One Hasselblad and Mamiya Leaf produce expensive high end medium format DSLRs including some with removable sensor backs Contax Fujifilm Kodak Panasonic Olympus Samsung previously produced DSLRs but now either offer non DSLR systems or have left the camera market entirely Konica Minolta s line of DSLRs was purchased by Sony br br Canon s current EOS digital line includes the Canon EOS D Rebel T D SL D T i D D D Mark II D Mark II D Mark IV Ds and Ds R and the D X Mark II All Canon DSLRs with three and four digit model numbers as well as the D Mark II have APS C sensors The D D series and D X are full frame As of all current Canon DSLRs use CMOS sensors br Nikon has a broad line of DSLRs most in direct competition with Canon s offerings including the D D D and D with APS C sensors and the D D D D D X and the Df with full frame sensors br Leica produces the S a medium format DSLR br Pentax currently offers APS C full frame and medium format DSLRs The APS C cameras include the K II Pentax KP and K S The K Mark II announced in as successor to the Pentax K is the current full frame model The APS C and full frame models have extensive backward compatibility with Pentax and third party film era lenses from about those that use the Pentax K mount The Pentax Z medium format DSLR is also back compatible with Pentax system lenses from the film era br Sigma produces DSLRs using the Foveon X sensor rather than the conventional Bayer sensor This is claimed to give higher colour resolution although headline pixel counts are lower than conventional Bayer sensor cameras It currently offers the entry level SD and the professional SD Sigma is the only DSLR manufacturer that sells lenses for other brands lens mounts br Sony has modified the DSLR formula in favor of single lens translucent SLT cameras which are still technically DSLRs but feature a fixed mirror that allows most light through to the sensor while reflecting some light to the autofocus sensor Sony s SLTs feature full time phase detection autofocus during video recording as well as the continuous shooting of up to frame s The series whether traditional SLRs or SLTs offers in body sensor shift image stabilization and retains the Minolta AF lens mount As of July the lineup included the Alpha the semipro Alpha II and the professional full frame Alpha II The translucent transmissive fixed mirror allows percent of the light to pass through onto the imaging sensor meaning a rd stop loss light but the rest of this light is continuously reflected onto the camera s phase detection AF sensor for fast autofocus for both the viewfinder and live view on the rear screen even during the video and continuous shooting The reduced number of moving parts also makes for faster shooting speeds for its class This arrangement means that the SLT cameras use an electronic viewfinder as opposed to an optical viewfinder which some consider a disadvantage but does have the advantage of a live preview of the shot with current settings anything displayed on the rear screen is displayed on the viewfinder and handles bright situations well br br Like SLRs DSLRs typically use interchangeable lenses with a proprietary lens mount A movable mechanical mirror system is switched down to precisely a degree angle to direct light from the lens over a matte focusing screen via a condenser lens and a pentaprism pentamirror to an optical viewfinder eyepiece Most entry level DSLRs use a pentamirror instead of the traditional pentaprism br Focusing can be manual by twisting the focus on the lens or automatic activated by pressing half way on the shutter release or a dedicated auto focus AF button To take an image the mirror swings upwards in the direction of the arrow the focal plane shutter opens and the image is projected and captured on the image sensor After these actions the shutter closes the mirror returns to the degree angle and the built in drive mechanism re tensions the shutter for the next exposure br Compared with the newer concept of mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras this mirror prism system is the characteristic difference providing direct accurate optical preview with separate autofocus and exposure metering sensors Essential parts of all digital cameras are some electronics like amplifiers analog to digital converters image processors and other microprocessors for processing the digital image performing data storage and or driving an electronic display br br DSLRs typically use autofocus based on phase detection This method allows the optimal lens position to be calculated rather than found as would be the case with autofocus based on contrast maximization Phase detection autofocus is typically faster than other passive techniques As the phase sensor requires the same light going to the image sensor it was previously only possible with an SLR design However with the introduction of focal plane phase detect autofocusing in mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras by Sony Fuji Olympus and Panasonic cameras can now employ both phase detect and contrast detect AF points br br Digital SLR cameras along with most other digital cameras generally have a mode dial to access standard camera settings or automatic scene mode settings Sometimes called a PASM dial they typically provide modes such as program aperture priority shutter priority and full manual modes Scene modes vary from camera to camera and these modes are inherently less customizable They often include landscape portrait action macro night and silhouette among others However these different settings and shooting styles that scene mode provides can be achieved by calibrating certain settings on the camera br br A method to prevent dust from entering the chamber by using a dust cover filter right behind the lens mount was used by Sigma in its first DSLR the Sigma SD in br Olympus used a built in sensor cleaning mechanism in its first DSLR that had a sensor exposed to air the Olympus E in all previous models each had a non interchangeable lens preventing direct exposure of the sensor to outside environmental conditions br Several Canon DSLR cameras rely on dust reduction systems based on vibrating the sensor at ultrasonic frequencies to remove dust from the sensor br br The ability to exchange lenses to select the best lens for the current photographic need and to allow the attachment of specialized lenses is one of the key factors in the popularity of DSLR cameras although this feature is not unique to the DSLR design and mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras are becoming increasingly popular Interchangeable lenses for SLRs and DSLRs are built to operate correctly with a specific lens mount that is generally unique to each brand A photographer will often use lenses made by the same manufacturer as the camera body for example Canon EF lenses on a Canon body although there are also many independent lens manufacturers such as Sigma Tamron Tokina and Vivitar that make lenses for a variety of different lens mounts There are also lens adapters that allow a lens for one lens mount to be used on a camera body with a different lens mount but with often reduced functionality br Many lenses are mountable diaphragm and meter compatible on modern DSLRs and on older film SLRs that use the same lens mount However when lenses designed for mm film or equivalently sized digital image sensors are used on DSLRs with smaller sized sensors the image is effectively cropped and the lens appears to have a longer focal length than its stated focal length Most DSLR manufacturers have introduced lines of lenses with image circles optimised for the smaller sensors and focal lengths equivalent to those generally offered for existing mm mount DSLRs mostly in the wide angle range These lenses tend not to be completely compatible with full frame sensors or mm film because of the smaller imaging circle and with some Canon EF S lenses interfere with the reflex mirrors on full frame bodies br br Since manufacturers have offered DSLRs which offer a movie mode capable of recording high definition motion video A DSLR with this feature is often known as an HDSLR or DSLR video shooter The first DSLR introduced with an HD movie mode the Nikon D captures video at p x resolution at frame s Other early HDSLRs capture video using a nonstandard video resolution or frame rate For example the Pentax K uses a nonstandard resolution of which matches the imager s aspect ratio The Canon EOS D Rebel T i uses a nonstandard frame rate of frame s at p along with a more conventional p format br In general HDSLRs use the full imager area to capture HD video though not all pixels causing video artifacts to some degree Compared with the much smaller image sensors found in the typical camcorder the HDSLR s much larger sensor yields distinctly different image characteristics HDSLRs can achieve much shallower depth of field and superior low light performance However the low ratio of active pixels to total pixels is more susceptible to aliasing artifacts such as moir patterns in scenes with particular textures and CMOS rolling shutter tends to be more severe Furthermore due to the DSLR s optical construction HDSLRs typically lack one or more video functions found on standard dedicated camcorders such as autofocus while shooting powered zoom and an electronic viewfinder preview These and other handling limitations prevent the HDSLR from being operated as a simple point and shoot camcorder instead of demanding some level of planning and skill for location shooting br Video functionality has continued to improve since the introduction of the HDSLR including higher video resolution such as p and video bitrate improved automatic control autofocus and manual exposure control and support for formats compatible with high definition television broadcast Blu ray disc mastering or Digital Cinema Initiatives DCI The Canon EOS D Mark II with the release of firmware version and Panasonic Lumix GH were the first HDSLRs to offer p video at fps and since then the list of models with comparable functionality has grown considerably br The rapid maturation of HDSLR cameras has sparked a revolution in digital filmmaking referred to as DSLR revolution and the Shot On DSLR badge is a quickly growing phrase among independent filmmakers Canon s North American TV advertisements featuring the Rebel T i have been shot using the T i itself Other types of HDSLRs found their distinct application in the field of documentary and ethnographic filmmaking especially due to their affordability technical and aesthetical features and their ability to make observation highly intimate An increased number of films television shows and other productions are utilizing the quickly improving features One such project was Canon s Story Beyond the Still contest that asked filmmakers to collectively shoot a short film in chapters with each chapter being shot over a short period of time and a winner was determined for each chapter After chapters the winners collaborated to shoot the final chapter of the story Due to the affordability and convenient size of HDSLRs compared with professional movie cameras The Avengers used five Canon EOS D Mark II and two Canon D to shoot the scenes from various vantage angles throughout the set and reduced the number of reshoots of complex action scenes br Manufacturers have sold optional accessories to optimize a DSLR camera as a video camera such as a shotgun type microphone and an External EVF with million pixels br br Early DSLRs lacked the ability to show the optical viewfinder s image on the LC display a feature known as live preview Live preview is useful in situations where the camera s eye level viewfinder cannot be used such as underwater photography where the camera is enclosed in a plastic waterproof case br In Olympus introduced the Olympus E the first DSLR with live preview albeit with an atypical fixed lens design In late some DSLRs from Canon Nikon Olympus Panasonic Leica Pentax Samsung and Sony all provided continuous live preview as an option Additionally the Fujifilm FinePix S Pro offers seconds of live preview br On almost all DSLRs that offer live preview via the primary sensor the phase detection autofocus system does not work in the live preview mode and the DSLR switches to a slower contrast system commonly found in point and shoot cameras While even phase detection autofocus requires contrast in the scene strict contrast detection autofocus is limited in its ability to find focus quickly though it is somewhat more accurate br In Canon introduced hybrid autofocus technology to the DSLR in the EOS D Rebel T i and introduced a more sophisticated version which it calls Dual Pixel CMOS AF with the EOS D The technology allows certain pixels to act as both contrast detection and phase detection pixels thereby greatly improving autofocus speed in live view although it remains slower than pure phase detection While several mirrorless cameras plus Sony s fixed mirror SLTs have similar hybrid AF systems Canon is the only manufacturer that offers such technology in DSLRs br A new feature via a separate software package introduced from Breeze Systems in October features live view from a distance The software package is named DSLR Remote Pro v and enables support for the Canon EOS D and D Mark III br br Image sensors used in DSLRs come in a range of sizes The very largest are the ones used in medium format cameras typically via a digital back which can be used as an alternative to a film back Because of the manufacturing costs of these large sensors the price of these cameras is typically over and easily reaching and beyond as of February br Full frame is the same size as mm film film image format mm these sensors are used in DSLRs such as the Canon EOS D X Mark II DS DSR D Mark IV and D Mark II and the Nikon D D D D and Df Most lower cost DSLRs use a smaller sensor that is APS C sized which is approximately mm slightly smaller than the size of an APS C film frame or about of the area of a full frame sensor Other sensor sizes found in DSLRs include the Four Thirds System sensor at of full frame APS H sensors used for example in the Canon EOS D Mark III at around of full frame and the original Foveon X sensor at of full frame although Foveon sensors since have been APS C sized Leica offers an S System DSLR with a mm array containing million pixels This sensor is larger than a full frame sensor br The resolution of DSLR sensors is typically measured in megapixels More expensive cameras and cameras with larger sensors tend to have higher megapixel ratings A larger megapixel rating does not mean higher quality Low light sensitivity is a good example of this When comparing two sensors of the same size for example two APS C sensors one MP and one MP the one with the lower megapixel rating will usually perform better in low light This is because the size of the individual pixels is larger and more light is landing on each pixel compared with the sensor with more megapixels This is not always the case because newer cameras that have higher megapixels also have better noise reduction software and higher ISO settings to make up for the loss of light per pixel due to higher pixel density br br The lenses typically used on DSLRs have a wider range of apertures available to them ranging from as large as f to about f Lenses for smaller sensor cameras rarely have true available aperture sizes much larger than f or much smaller than f br To help extend the exposure range some smaller sensor cameras will also incorporate an ND filter pack into the aperture mechanism br The apertures that smaller sensor cameras have available give much more depth of field than equivalent angles of view on a DSLR For example a mm lens on a sensor digicam has a field of view similar to a mm lens on a mm camera At an aperture of f the smaller sensor camera assuming a crop factor of has a similar depth of field to that mm camera set to f br br The angle of view of a lens depends upon its focal length and the camera s image sensor size a sensor smaller than mm film format mm frame gives a narrower angle of view for a lens of a given focal length than a camera equipped with a full frame mm sensor As of only a few current DSLRs have full frame sensors including the Canon EOS D X Mark II EOS D Mark IV EOS DS DS R and EOS D Mark II Nikon s D D D D and Df and the Pentax K The scarcity of full frame DSLRs is partly a result of the cost of such large sensors Medium format size sensors such as those used in the Mamiya ZD among others are even larger than full frame mm sensors and capable of even greater resolution and are correspondingly more expensive br The impact of sensor size on the field of view is referred to as the crop factor or focal length multiplier which is a factor by which a lens focal length can be multiplied to give the full frame equivalent focal length for a lens Typical APS C sensors have crop factors of to so a lens with a focal length of mm will give a field of view equal to that of a mm to mm lens on a mm camera The smaller sensors of Four Thirds System cameras have a crop factor of br While the crop factor of APS C cameras effectively narrows the angle of view of long focus telephoto lenses making it easier to take close up images of distant objects wide angle lenses suffer a reduction in their angle of view by the same factor br DSLRs with crop sensor size have slightly more depth of field than cameras with mm sized sensors for a given angle of view The amount of added depth of field for a given focal length can be roughly calculated by multiplying the depth of field by the crop factor Shallower depth of field is often preferred by professionals for portrait work and to isolate a subject from its background br br On July FujiFilm announced the FinePix IS Pro which uses Nikon F mount lenses This camera in addition to having live preview has the ability to record in the infrared and ultraviolet spectra of light br In August Sony released series of DSLRs allowing D photography It was accomplished by sweeping the camera horizontally or vertically in Sweep Panorama D mode The picture could be saved as ultra wide panoramic image or as D photography to be viewed on BRAVIA D television set br br The reflex design scheme is the primary difference between a DSLR and other digital cameras In the reflex design scheme the image captured on the camera s sensor is also the image that is seen through the viewfinder Light travels through a single lens and a mirror is used to reflect a portion of that light through the viewfinder hence the name single lens reflex While there are variations among point and shoot cameras the typical design exposes the sensor constantly to the light projected by the lens allowing the camera s screen to be used as an electronic viewfinder However LCDs can be difficult to see in very bright sunlight br Compared with some low cost cameras that provide an optical viewfinder that uses a small auxiliary lens the DSLR design has the advantage of being parallax free it never provides an off axis view A disadvantage of the DSLR optical viewfinder system is that when it is used it prevents using the LCD for viewing and composing the picture Some people prefer to compose pictures on the display for them this has become the de facto way to use a camera Depending on the viewing position of the reflex mirror down or up the light from the scene can only reach either the viewfinder or the sensor Therefore many early DSLRs did not provide live preview i e focusing framing and depth of field preview using the display a facility that is always available on digicams Today most DSLRs can alternate between live view and viewing through an optical viewfinder br br The larger advanced digital cameras offer a non optical electronic through the lens TTL view via an eye level electronic viewfinder EVF in addition to the rear LCD The difference in view compared with a DSLR is that the EVF shows a digitally created image whereas the viewfinder in a DSLR shows an actual optical image via the reflex viewing system An EVF image has the lag time that is it reacts with a delay to view changes and has a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder but achieves parallax free viewing using less bulk and mechanical complexity than a DSLR with its reflex viewing system Optical viewfinders tend to be more comfortable and efficient especially for action photography and in low light conditions Compared with digital cameras with LCD electronic viewfinders there is no time lag in the image it is always correct as it is being updated at the speed of light This is important for action or sports photography or any other situation where the subject or the camera is moving quickly Furthermore the resolution of the viewed image is much better than that provided by an LCD or an electronic viewfinder which can be important if manual focusing is desired for precise focusing as would be the case in macro photography and micro photography with a microscope An optical viewfinder may also cause less eye strain However electronic viewfinders may provide a brighter display in low light situations as the picture can be electronically amplified br br DSLR cameras often have image sensors of much larger size and often higher quality offering lower noise which is useful in low light Although mirrorless digital cameras with APS C and full frame sensors exist most full frame and medium format sized image sensors are still seen in DSLR designs br For a long time DSLRs offered faster and more responsive performance with less shutter lag faster autofocus systems and higher frame rates Around some mirrorless camera models started offering competitive or superior specifications in these aspects The downside of these cameras being that they do not have an optical viewfinder making it difficult to focus on moving subjects or in situations where a fast burst mode would be beneficial Other digital cameras were once significantly slower in image capture time measured from pressing the shutter release to the writing of the digital image to the storage medium than DSLR cameras but this situation is changing with the introduction of faster capture memory cards and faster in camera processing chips Still compact digital cameras are not suited for action wildlife sports and other photography requiring a high burst rate frames per second br Simple point and shoot cameras rely almost exclusively on their built in automation and machine intelligence for capturing images under a variety of situations and offer no manual control over their functions a trait that makes them unsuitable for use by professionals enthusiasts and proficient consumers also known as prosumers Bridge cameras provide some degree of manual control over the camera s shooting modes and some even have hot shoes and the option to attach lens accessories such as filters and secondary converters DSLRs typically provide the photographer with full control over all the important parameters of photography and have the option to attach additional accessories using the hot shoe including hot shoe mounted flash units battery grips for additional power and hand positions external light meters and remote controls DSLRs typically also have fully automatic shooting modes br DSLRs have a larger focal length for the same field of view which allows the creative use of depth of field effects However small digital cameras can focus better on closer objects than typical DSLR lenses br The sensors used in current DSLRs full frame which is the same size as mm film APS C and Four Thirds System are much larger than most digital cameras Entry level compact cameras typically use sensors known as which is the size of a full frame sensor There are fixed lens cameras such as bridge cameras premium compact cameras or high end point and shoot cameras that offer sensors larger than but many still fall short of the larger sizes widely found in DSLRs Examples include the Sigma DP which uses a Foveon X sensor the Leica X the Canon PowerShot G X which uses a mm sensor that is slightly larger than the Four Thirds standard and is of a full frame sensor the Nikon Coolpix A which uses an APS C sensor of the same size as those found in the company s DX format DSLRs and two models from Sony the RX with a type mm sensor with about half the area of Four Thirds and the full frame Sony RX These premium compacts are often comparable to entry level DSLRs in price with a smaller sensor being a tradeoff for the size and weight savings br br Unlike DSLRs most digital cameras lack the option to change the lens Instead most compact digital cameras are manufactured with a zoom lens that covers the most commonly used fields of view Having fixed lenses they are limited to the focal lengths they are manufactured with except for what is available from attachments Manufacturers have attempted with increasing success to overcome this disadvantage by offering extreme ranges of focal length on models known as superzooms some of which offer far longer focal lengths than readily available DSLR lenses br There are now available perspective correcting PC lenses for DSLR cameras providing some of the attributes of view cameras Nikon introduced the first PC lens fully manual in Recently however some manufacturers have introduced advanced lenses that both shift and tilt and are operated with automatic aperture control br However since the introduction of the Micro Four Thirds system by Olympus and Panasonic in late mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras are now widely available so the option to change lenses is no longer unique to DSLRs Cameras for the micro four thirds system are designed with the option of a replaceable lens and accept lenses that conform to this proprietary specification Cameras for this system have the same sensor size as the Four Thirds System but do not have the mirror and pentaprism so as to reduce the distance between the lens and sensor br Panasonic released the first Micro Four Thirds camera the Lumix DMC G Several manufacturers have announced lenses for the new Micro Four Thirds mount while older Four Thirds lenses can be mounted with an adapter a mechanical spacer with front and rear electrical connectors and its own internal firmware A similar mirror less interchangeable lens camera but with an APS C sized sensor was announced in January the Samsung NX On September Nikon announced with the Nikon a series of high speed MILCs A handful of rangefinder cameras also support interchangeable lenses Six digital rangefinders exist the Epson R D APS C sized sensor the Leica M APS H sized sensor both smaller than mm film rangefinder cameras and the Leica M M P M Monochrom and M Typ all full frame cameras with the Monochrom shooting exclusively in black and white br In common with other interchangeable lens designs DSLRs must contend with potential contamination of the sensor by dust particles when the lens is changed though recent dust reduction systems alleviate this Digital cameras with fixed lenses are not usually subject to dust from outside the camera settling on the sensor br DSLRs generally have greater cost size and weight They also have louder operation due to the SLR mirror mechanism Sony s fixed mirror design manages to avoid this problem However that design has the disadvantage that some of the light received from the lens is diverted by the mirror and thus the image sensor receives about less light compared with other DSLR designs br br Box camera br Comparison of digital SLRs br Full frame DSLR br Mirrorless camera br
