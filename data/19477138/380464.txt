its existence though was briefly owned by the Houston based Enron Corporation from until almost years ago when Enron divested itself of PGE during its bankruptcy br Notably PGE does not serve all of Portland Its service territory comprises most of Portland west of the Willamette River sharing most of the city east of the river with Pacific Power br PGE holds a mix of generation and storage facilities including hydropower wind solar battery storage and thermal as well as key transmission resources The company s power plants have a combined generating capacity of more than megawatts br Following the Oregon House Bill which introduced new decarbonization goals PGE announced to reduce emissions from its retail power supply by by and by br br br History br br The utility was founded in by Parker F Morey and Edward L Eastham as Willamette Falls Electric Company On June it sent power generated by one of four brush arc light dynamos at Willamette Falls over a mile electric power transmission line to Portland the first US power plant to do so br On August Morey Frederick Van Voorhies Holman and Henry Failing formed the Portland General Electric Company It was funded by General Electric and the investment arm of Old Colony Trust with million in capital The newly formed PGE Company purchased Willamette Falls Electric and the Albina Light Water Company in br br Less than a year later in May PGE purchased the City Eastside Electric Light Plant a municipal power company E Kimbark MacColl who chronicled the history of Portland referred to it a generous gift to a private company at the expense of future taxpayers since it was constructed for a cost of and sold months later for br In Henry W Goode the president of PGE decided to make PGE a popular public utility His vision was for the company to light the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in in he traveled to the east coast to raise three thousand dollars from shareholders His plan went through and Thomas H Wright was put in charge of designing the lighting for the fair br PGE also purchased the Union Power Company in and the Vancouver Electric Light Power Company in In PGE Portland Railway Company and Oregon Water Power Railway Company merged becoming the Portland Railway Light and Power Company PRL P It was the only streetcar operator within Portland city limits and the predecessor of the modern PGE br The company name became Portland Electric Power Company PEPCO in It was reorganized in as PGE br On March PEPCO defaulted on interest bonds that had been issued in March The bonds were pledged with PGE the electric subsidiary and Portland Traction Company the streetcar subsidiary as collateral with Guaranty Trust as trustee PEPCO filed for Chapter X bankruptcy now known as Chapter on April and was assigned District Judge James Alger Fee The proceedings were later called one of the most prolonged and complicated series of legal proceedings in Portland s history br The reorganization and bond default was brought on by PGE s difficult negotiations with Bonneville Power Administration the death of Seattle City Light s visionary J D Ross and the indecision created by the possible creation of a public utility district in PGE s territory The Columbia Valley Authority project would have allowed CVA to purchase utilities such as PGE br PGE survived bankruptcy partially through cheap power purchases from BPA beginning in the fall of and by the end of they showed net profits In the meantime Ormond R Bean the Oregon Public Utility Commissioner forced PGE to lower its rates Ultimately PEPCO and PGE were saved by World War II which led to the construction of three Kaiser Shipyards and of Vanport City Oregon to support them By PGE derived nearly in revenue from the two Kaiser shipyards in Oregon In August after the war they were able to sell Portland Traction for million in cash Judge Fee ruled the bankruptcy reorganization complete on June br On July Enron Corporation bought PGE for billion in stock and billion in assumed debt Then in and again in Enron attempted to sell PGE to other investor owned utilities including Portland based NW Natural The corporate officers of PGE claimed that this utility was not involved in the financial mis dealings of its owner pointing to the fact that many of its employees suffered when Enron froze the k retirement plan and were unable to sell the rapidly declining stock However Ken Harrison and Joseph Hirko PGE s CEO and CFO respectively at the time of the Enron merger were charged on several felony level counts primarily related to financial misrepresentation regarding Enron Broadband Services which had its headquarters within the World Trade Center complex that comprises PGE s corporate offices In addition Timothy Belden head of the West Coast Trading Desk and John Forney an energy trader who invented various electricity trading strategies such as the Death Star operated from the trading floor in the PGE corporate offices and were also convicted of financial crimes related to the California Electricity Crisis br br br Early attempts to convert the company to a public utility district br Ballot measures have been filed by citizens several times since the s to convert some or all of PGE into a public utility district PUD the latest of these being in Most were unsuccessful but an exception was in when PGE announced it was selling its customer base in St Helens Scappoose and Columbia City to West Oregon Electric PUD for million The terms of this sale proposed to leave the physical assets of the distribution system the poles wires and other components owned by Enron who would then manage this system as a contractor exempt from state regulation Voter distrust of both Enron and PGE was severe enough for voters to approve the measure despite being spent in advertisements to oppose it in comparison to the spent by supporters This resulted in those three cities becoming part of the Columbia River PUD on terms far more favorable to the customers electricity rates immediately dropped in these cities and remain lower than those for current PGE customers br br br Attempted acquisition by Texas Pacific Group br Concerned by uncertainty that the Enron bankruptcy would bring several local governments began investigation into acquiring PGE by condemnation These studies ended after the announcement on November that a group called Oregon Electric Utility led by former governor Neil Goldschmidt and backed by Texas Pacific Group offered to buy PGE for billion This was the sole bid received by the bankruptcy judge who approved the bid When details that Goldschmidt had sexually assaulted a minor in the s emerged he withdrew from the negotiations and was replaced by Peter O Kohler president of the Oregon Health and Science University br Discomfort over the Texas Pacific purchase led to further voter initiatives to convert parts of PGE into PUDs PGE defeated measures in Multnomah County November Yamhill County March and Clackamas County May br Also during this time period PGE received notice of a strike by union workers effective March represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Points over which the negotiations broke down included retiree medical benefits as well as losses of the members k plan This labor dispute was resolved shortly afterward and the union agreed to a new contract br The TPG purchase offer was denied by the Oregon Public Utility Commission a three member regulatory board on March br With the rejection of the Texas Pacific Group s offer the City of Portland announced it contacted Enron to resume negotiating an offer to purchase PGE On April Portland city officials announced that they were willing to spend million in attorneys fees to buy the utility On July the City Council unanimously adopted a measure to finance the acquisition of PGE by the sale of billion in bonds br However Enron interim CEO Stephen Cooper called off negotiations on July He explained that he did not see a plausible solution under which our teams could reach an agreement that would lead to a transaction closing in a timely fashion Cooper addressed several causes for the termination including the refusal of the city to pay a million deposit on the sale The same day Governor Ted Kulongoski vetoed a bill that would create a public corporation to purchase PGE br br br Independence from Enron br In April shares in a newly independent PGE were issued as part of an Enron distribution to its
