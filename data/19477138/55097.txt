The U S Securities and Exchange Commission SEC is an independent agency of the United States federal government created in the aftermath of the Wall Street Crash of The primary purpose of the SEC is to enforce the law against market manipulation br In addition to the Securities Exchange Act of which created it the SEC enforces the Securities Act of the Trust Indenture Act of the Investment Company Act of the Investment Advisers Act of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of and other statutes The SEC was created by Section of the Securities Exchange Act of now codified as U S C d and commonly referred to as the Exchange Act or the Act br br br Overview br br The SEC has a three part mission to protect investors maintain fair orderly and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation br To achieve its mandate the SEC enforces the statutory requirement that public companies and other regulated entities submit quarterly and annual reports as well as other periodic disclosures In addition to annual financial reports company executives must provide a narrative account called the management discussion and analysis MD A that outlines the previous year of operations and explains how the company fared in that time period MD A usually addresses the upcoming year outlining future goals and approaches to new projects br Quarterly and semiannual reports from public companies are crucial for investors to make sound decisions when investing in capital markets Unlike banking investment in capital markets is not guaranteed by the federal government The potential for large gains needs to be weighed against that of sizable losses Mandatory disclosure of financial and other information about the issuer and the security itself gives private individuals as well as large institutions the same fundamental facts about the public companies they invest in thereby increasing public scrutiny while reducing insider trading and fraud br In an attempt to level the playing field for all investors the SEC maintains an online database called EDGAR the Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval system online from which investors can access information filed with the agency such as reports The same online system also accepts tips and complaints from investors to help the SEC track down violators of the securities laws as well as offering publications on investment related topics for public education The SEC maintains a strict policy of refraining from commenting on the existence or status of any ongoing investigation br br br History br br br Background br Prior to the enactment of the federal securities laws and the creation of the SEC securities trading was governed by so called blue sky laws These laws were enacted and enforced at the state level and regulated the offering and sale of securities to protect the public from fraud Though the specific provisions of these laws varied among states they all required the registration of all securities offerings and sales as well as of every U S stockbroker and brokerage firm However blue sky laws were generally considered ineffective For example as early as the Investment Bankers Association told its members that they could circumvent blue sky laws by making securities offerings across state lines through the mail br br br Founding br br The SEC s authority was established by the Securities Act of and Securities Exchange Act of both laws are considered parts of Franklin D Roosevelt s New Deal program br After the Pecora Commission hearings on abuses and frauds in securities markets Congress passed the Securities Act of U S C a which federally regulates original issues of securities across state lines primarily by requiring that issuing companies register distributions prior to sale so that investors may access basic financial information and make informed decisions For the first year of the law s enactment the enforcement of the statute rested with the Federal Trade Commission br The subsequent Securities Exchange Act of U S C d regulates secondary markets for securities The Act regulates secondary trading between individuals and companies which are often unrelated to the original issuers of securities Entities under the SEC s authority include securities exchanges with physical trading floors such as the New York Stock Exchange self regulatory organizations the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board NASDAQ alternative trading systems and any other persons engaged in transactions for the accounts of others Section of the Act transferred the FTC s enforcement authority under the Act to the newly created Securities and Exchange Commission and tasked the new Commission with enforcing both Acts br br In Roosevelt named his friend Joseph P Kennedy a self made multimillionaire financier and leader among the Irish American community as chairman of the SEC Roosevelt chose Kennedy partly based on his experience on Wall Street Two of the other five commissioners were James M Landis and Ferdinand Pecora Kennedy added a number of intelligent young lawyers to the SEC staff including William O Douglas and Abe Fortas both of whom later became Supreme Court Justices br Kennedy s team defined four missions for the new Commission to restore investor confidence in the securities market which had practically collapsed to restore integrity to securities markets by prosecuting and eliminating fraudulent and unsound practices targeting investors to end million dollar insider trading by top officials of major corporations and to establish a complex and universal system of registration for securities sold in America with a clear cut set of deadlines rules and guidelines The SEC succeeded Kennedy reassured the American business community that they would no longer be deceived and tricked and taken advantage of by Wall Street He became a cheerleader for ordinary investors to return to the market and enable the economy to grow again br Later SEC commissioners and chairmen include William O Douglas Jerome Frank and William J Casey br Since most registration statements and associated materials filed with the SEC can be accessed via the SEC s online system EDGAR br In the Securities and Exchange Commission Historical Society introduced an online gallery to illustrate changes in the US securities market structure since the s The online gallery features a narrative history supported by dozens of documents papers interviews photos and videos br br br List of chairs br br br Organizational structure br br br Commission members br br The commission has five commissioners who are appointed by the President of the United States No more than three Commissioners may belong to the same political party Their terms last five years and are staggered so that one commissioner s term ends on June of each year Service may continue up to eighteen additional months past term expiration br The president also designates one of the commissioners as chairman the SEC s top executive However the president does not possess the power to fire the appointed Commissioners a provision that was made to ensure the independence of the SEC This issue arose during the presidential election in connection with the ensuing financial crises br br br Divisions br br Within the SEC there are six divisions which is headquartered in Washington D C br The SEC s divisions are br br Corporation Finance br Trading and Markets br Investment Management br Enforcement br Economic and Risk Analysis br Examinations br

MSRB and all broker dealer firms and investment houses This division also interprets proposed changes to regulations and monitors operations of the industry In practice the SEC delegates most of its enforcement and rulemaking authority to FINRA In fact all trading firms not regulated by other SROs must register as a member of FINRA Individuals trading securities must pass exams administered by FINRA to become registered representatives br The Investment Management Division oversees registered investment companies which include mutual funds as well as registered investment advisors These

letter was addressed pleaded guilty to fraud at CA in br In June the SEC announced that it would publicly post all comment letters to give investors access to the information in them An analysis of regulatory filings in May over the prior months indicated that the SEC had not accomplished what it said it would do The analysis found companies that had reported receiving comment letters from the SEC but only letters for these companies were posted on the SEC s website John W White the head of the Division of Corporation Finance told the New York Times in We have now resolved the hurdles of posting the information We expect a significant number of new postings in the coming months br br br No action letters br No action letters are letters by the SEC staff indicating that the staff will not recommend to the Commission that the SEC undertake enforcement action against a person or company if that entity engages in a particular action These letters are sent in response to requests made

false rumors about certain financial institutions The commission has also investigated trading irregularities and abusive short selling practices Hedge fund managers broker dealers and institutional investors were also asked to disclose under oath certain information pertaining to their positions in credit default swaps The commission also negotiated the largest settlements in the history of the SEC approximately billion in all on behalf of investors who purchased auction rate securities from six different financial institutions br br br Regulatory failures br The SEC has been criticized for being too tentative and fearful in confronting wrongdoing on Wall Street and for doing an especially poor job of holding executives accountable br Christopher Cox the former SEC chairman has recognized the organization s multiple failures in relation to the Bernard Madoff fraud Starting with an investigation in into a Madoff feeder fund that only invested with Madoff and which according to the SEC promised curiously steady returns the SEC did not investigate indications that something was amiss in Madoff s investment firm The SEC has been accused of missing numerous red flags and ignoring tips on Madoff s alleged fraud br As a result Cox said that an investigation would ensue into all staff contact and relationships with the Madoff family and firm and their impact if any on decisions by staff regarding the firm SEC Assistant Director of the Office of Compliance Investigations Eric Swanson had met Madoff s niece Shana Madoff when Swanson was conducting an SEC examination of whether Bernard Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme because she was the firm s compliance attorney The investigation was closed and Swanson subsequently left the SEC and married Shana Madoff br Approximately percent of institutional investors thought that better oversight by the SEC could have prevented the Madoff fraud Harry Markopolos complained to the SEC s Boston office in telling the SEC staff they should investigate Madoff because it was impossible to legally make the profits Madoff claimed using the investment strategies that he said he used br In June the SEC settled a wrongful termination lawsuit with former SEC enforcement lawyer Gary J Aguirre who was terminated in September following his attempt to subpoena Wall Street figure John J Mack in an insider trading case involving hedge fund Pequot Capital Management Mary Jo White who later served as chair of the br SEC was at the time representing Morgan Stanley and was involved in this case While the insider case was dropped at the time a month prior to the SEC s settlement with Aguirre the SEC filed charges against Pequot The Senate released a report in August detailing the issue and calling for reform of the SEC br On September Democratic senator Mark Warner sent a letter to the SEC asking them to evaluate whether the current disclosure regime was adequate citing the low number of companies disclosures to date br br br Inspector General office failures br In the Project on Government Oversight a government watchdog group sent a letter to Congress criticizing the SEC for failing to implement more than half of the recommendations made to it by its Inspector General According to POGO in the prior two years the SEC had taken no action on out of recommended reforms suggested in Inspector General reports and still had a pending status on of the recommendations made in audit reports Some of the recommendations included imposing disciplinary action on SEC employees who receive improper gifts or other favors from financial companies and investigating and reporting the causes of the failures to detect the Madoff ponzi scheme br In a article by Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone former SEC employees were interviewed and commented negatively on the SEC s Office of the Inspector General OIG Going to the OIG was well known to be a career killer br Because of concerns raised by David P Weber former SEC Chief Investigator regarding conduct by SEC Inspector General H David Kotz Inspector General David C Williams of the U S Postal Service was brought in to conduct an independent outside review of Kotz s alleged improper conduct in Williams concluded in his page Report that Kotz violated ethics rules by overseeing probes that involved people with whom he had conflicts of interest due to personal relationships The report questioned Kotz s work on the Madoff investigation among others because Kotz was a very good friend with Markopolos It concluded that while it was unclear when Kotz and Markopolos became friends it would have violated U S ethics rules if their relationship began before or during Kotz s Madoff investigation The report also found that Kotz himself appeared to have a conflict of interest and should not have opened his Standford investigation because he was friends with a female attorney who represented victims of the fraud br br br Destruction of documents br According to former SEC employee and whistleblower Darcy Flynn also reported by Taibbi the agency routinely destroyed thousands of documents related to preliminary investigations of alleged crimes committed by Deutsche Bank Goldman Sachs Lehman Brothers SAC Capital and other financial companies involved in the Great Recession that the SEC was supposed to have been regulating The documents included those relating to Matters Under Inquiry or MUI the name the SEC gives to the first stages of the investigation process The tradition of destruction began as early as the s This SEC activity eventually caused a conflict with the National Archives and Records Administration when it was revealed to them in by Flynn Flynn also described a meeting at the SEC in which top staff discussed refusing to admit the destruction had taken place because it was possibly illegal br Iowa Republican Senator Charles Grassley among others took note of Flynn s call for protection as a whistleblower and the story of the agency s document handling procedures The SEC issued a statement defending its procedures NPR quoted University of Denver Sturm College of Law professor Jay Brown as saying My initial take on this is it s a tempest in a teapot and Jacob Frenkel a securities lawyer in the Washington D C area as saying in effect there s no allegation the SEC tossed sensitive documents from banks it got under subpoena in high profile cases that investors and lawmakers care about NPR concluded its report br br The debate boils down to this What does an investigative record mean to Congress And the courts Under the law those investigative records must be kept for years But federal officials say no judge has ruled that papers related to early stage SEC inquiries are investigative records The SEC s inspector general says he s conducting a thorough investigation into the allegations Kotz tells NPR that he ll issue a report by the end of September br br br SEC and cryptocurrency br On June the SEC also filed charges against Binance entities and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao The next day the SEC charged Coinbase for operating as an unregistered securities exchange broker and clearing agency br One major contention between the SEC and the crypto industry is based on the definition of what a security actually is At this time the SEC is relying on a U S Supreme Court case from which dealt with investors in Florida orange groves owned by the W J Howey Company In the case the court ruled that an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others making it a security called an investment contract Whereby the value of digital assets their associated blockchain systems and investor profits depended on the efforts of others br br br Whistleblower program br The SEC runs a whistleblower rewards program which rewards individuals who report violations of securities laws to the SEC The program began in with the passage of the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and allows whistleblowers to be given of the penalties collected by the SEC and other agencies as a result of the whistleblower s information As of the SEC had recovered billion in monetary remedies as a result of information obtained through the whistleblower program and had paid out over billion to whistleblowers As part of the program the SEC issues a report to Congress each year and the report is available online br br br Relationship to other agencies br In addition to working with various self regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA the Securities Investor Protection Corporation SIPC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board MSRB the SEC also works with federal agencies state securities regulators international securities agencies and law enforcement agencies br In Executive Order established the President s Working Group on Financial Markets The Working Group is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury and includes the Chairman of the SEC the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission The goal of the Working Group is to enhance the integrity efficiency orderliness and competitiveness of the financial markets while maintaining investor confidence br The Securities Act of was originally administered by the Federal Trade Commission The Securities Exchange Act of transferred this responsibility from the FTC to the SEC The Securities Exchange Act of also gave the SEC the power to regulate the solicitation of proxies though some of the rules the SEC has since proposed like the universal proxy have been controversial The main mission of the FTC is to promote consumer protection and to eradicate anti competitive business practices The FTC regulates general business practices while the SEC focuses on the securities markets br The Temporary National Economic Committee was established by joint resolution of Congress Stat on June It was in charge of reporting to Congress on abuses of monopoly power The committee was defunded in but its records are still under seal by

investors small and large funds intermediaries and other market participants br While most violations of securities laws are enforced by the SEC and the various SROs it monitors state securities regulators can also enforce statewide securities blue sky laws States may require securities to be registered in the state before they can be sold there National Securities Markets Improvement Act of NSMIA addressed this dual system of federal state regulation by amending Section of the Act to exempt nationally traded securities from state registration thereby pre empting state law in this area
