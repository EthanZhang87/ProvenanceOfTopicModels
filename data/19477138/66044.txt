States supporting the Brazilian coup d tat br br br Republican National Convention br ITT became enmeshed in scandal in connection with the Republican National Convention In May ITT president Geneen pledged to support a proposal to hold the convention in San Diego only of the contribution was publicly disclosed The Republican National Committee selected San Diego as the site in July br However on February newspaper columnist Jack Anderson disclosed an interoffice memo from ITT lobbyist Dita Beard to ITT vice president Bill Merriam dated June The memo appeared to draw a connection between ITT s contribution to the convention and the favorable settlement of a United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division lawsuit The resulting scandal including a Senate investigation and the threat of criminal charges caused ITT to withdraw its support for the San Diego convention That combined with a shortage of hotel space and problems with the proposed venue led the RNC to move the convention to Miami Special prosecutor Leon Jaworski investigated the case but ultimately concluded there was no evidence of criminal conduct by ITT br Nixon aides such as John Dean and Jeb Stuart Magruder have alleged that the Watergate break in was motivated by the Committee for the Re Election of the President s suspicion that the Democratic National Committee was making similar deals to fund its convention This theory is supported by conversations and exchanges between President Richard Nixon and his chief of staff H R Haldeman before and after the break in as well as by testimony by E Howard Hunt However this theory has also been disputed by others involved in the break in such as G Gordon Liddy br br br Involvement in Pinochet coup in Chile br In ITT owned of CTC the Chilean Telephone

s Republic of China and the United Kingdom They were fined US million although they were also given the option of spending half of that sum on research and development of new night vision technology The United States government will assume rights to the resulting intellectual property br In its investigation and subsequent ruling the United States Department of Justice found that the corporation
