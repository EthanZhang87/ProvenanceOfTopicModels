The National Security Agency NSA is an intelligence agency of the United States Department of Defense under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence DNI The NSA is responsible for global monitoring collection and processing of information and data for foreign intelligence and counterintelligence purposes specializing in a discipline known as signals intelligence SIGINT The NSA is also tasked with the protection of U S communications networks and information systems The NSA relies on a variety of measures to accomplish its mission the majority of which are clandestine The NSA has roughly employees br Originating as a unit to decipher coded communications in World War II it was officially formed as the NSA by President Harry S Truman in Between then and the end of the Cold War it became the largest of the U S intelligence organizations in terms of personnel and budget but information available as of indicates that the Central Intelligence Agency CIA pulled ahead in this regard with a budget of billion The NSA currently conducts worldwide mass data collection and has been known to physically bug electronic systems as one method to this end The NSA is also alleged to have been behind such attack software as Stuxnet which severely damaged Iran s nuclear program The NSA alongside the CIA maintains a physical presence in many countries across the globe the CIA NSA joint Special Collection Service a highly classified intelligence team inserts eavesdropping devices in high value targets such as presidential palaces or embassies SCS collection tactics allegedly encompass close surveillance burglary wiretapping and breaking and entering br Unlike the CIA and the Defense Intelligence Agency DIA both of which specialize primarily in foreign human espionage the NSA does not publicly conduct human intelligence gathering The NSA is entrusted with providing assistance to and the coordination of SIGINT elements for other government organizations which are prevented by Executive Order from engaging in such activities on their own As part of these responsibilities the agency has a co located organization called the Central Security Service CSS which facilitates cooperation between the NSA and other U S defense cryptanalysis components To further ensure streamlined communication between the signals intelligence community divisions the NSA Director simultaneously serves as the Commander of the United States Cyber Command and as Chief of the Central Security Service br The NSA s actions have been a matter of political controversy on several occasions including its spying on anti Vietnam War leaders and the agency s participation in economic espionage In the NSA had many of its secret surveillance programs revealed to the public by Edward Snowden a former NSA contractor According to the leaked documents the NSA intercepts and stores the communications of over a billion people worldwide including United States citizens The documents also revealed that the NSA tracks hundreds of millions of people s movements using cellphones metadata Internationally research has pointed to the NSA s ability to surveil the domestic Internet traffic of foreign countries through boomerang routing br br br History br br br Formation br The origins of the National Security Agency can be traced back to April three weeks after the U S Congress declared war on Germany in World War I A code and cipher decryption unit was established as the Cable and Telegraph Section which was also known as the Cipher Bureau It was headquartered in Washington D C and was part of the war effort under the executive branch without direct Congressional authorization During the course of the war it was relocated in the army s organizational chart several times On July Herbert O Yardley was assigned to head the unit At that point the unit consisted of Yardley and two civilian clerks It absorbed the Navy s cryptanalysis functions in July World War I ended on November and the army cryptographic section of Military Intelligence MI moved to New York City on May where it continued intelligence activities as the Code Compilation Company under the direction of Yardley br br br The Black Chamber br br After the disbandment of the U S Army cryptographic section of military intelligence known as MI the U S government created the Cipher Bureau also known as Black Chamber in The Black Chamber was the United States first peacetime cryptanalytic organization Jointly funded by the Army and the State Department the Cipher Bureau was disguised as a New York City commercial code company it actually produced and sold such codes for business use Its true mission however was to break the communications chiefly diplomatic of other nations At the Washington Naval Conference it aided American negotiators by providing them with the decrypted traffic of many of the conference delegations including the Japanese The Black Chamber successfully persuaded Western Union the largest U S telegram company at the time as well as several other communications companies to illegally give the Black Chamber access to cable traffic of foreign embassies and consulates Soon these companies publicly discontinued their collaboration br Despite the Chamber s initial successes it was shut down in by U S Secretary of State Henry L Stimson who defended his decision by stating Gentlemen do not read each other s mail br br br World War II and its aftermath br During World War II the Signal Intelligence Service SIS was created to intercept and decipher the communications of the Axis powers When the war ended the SIS was reorganized as the Army Security Agency ASA and it was placed under the leadership of the Director of Military Intelligence br On May all cryptologic activities were centralized under a national organization called the Armed Forces Security Agency AFSA This organization was originally established within the U S Department of Defense under the command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff The AFSA was tasked with directing the Department of Defense communications and electronic intelligence activities except those of U S military intelligence units However the AFSA was unable to centralize communications intelligence and failed to coordinate with civilian agencies that shared its interests such as the Department of State the Central Intelligence Agency CIA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI In December President Harry S Truman ordered a panel to investigate how AFSA had failed to achieve its goals The results of the investigation led to improvements and its redesignation as the National Security Agency br The National Security Council issued a memorandum of October that revised National Security Council Intelligence Directive NSCID On the same day Truman issued a second memorandum that called for the establishment of the NSA The actual establishment of the NSA was done by a November memo by Robert A Lovett the Secretary of Defense changing the name of the AFSA to the NSA and making the new agency responsible for all communications intelligence Since President Truman s memo was a classified document the existence of the NSA was not known to the public at that time Due to its ultra secrecy the U S intelligence community referred to the NSA as No Such Agency br br br Vietnam War br br In the s the NSA played a key role in expanding U S commitment to the Vietnam War by providing evidence of a North Vietnamese attack on the American destroyer USS Maddox during the Gulf of Tonkin incident br A secret operation code named MINARET was set up by the NSA to monitor the phone communications of Senators Frank Church and Howard Baker as well as key leaders of the civil rights movement including Martin Luther King Jr and prominent U S journalists and athletes who criticized the Vietnam War However the project turned out to be controversial and an internal review by the NSA concluded that its Minaret program was disreputable if not outright illegal br The NSA mounted a major effort to secure tactical communications among U S forces during the war with mixed success The NESTOR family of compatible secure voice systems it developed was widely deployed during the Vietnam War with about NESTOR sets produced However a variety of technical and operational problems limited their use allowing the North Vietnamese to exploit and intercept U S communications br Vol I p br br br Church Committee hearings br br In the aftermath of the Watergate scandal a congressional hearing in led by Senator Frank Church revealed that the NSA in collaboration with Britain s SIGINT intelligence agency Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ had routinely intercepted the international communications of prominent anti Vietnam war leaders such as Jane Fonda and Dr Benjamin Spock The NSA tracked these individuals in a secret filing system that was destroyed in Following the resignation of President Richard Nixon there were several investigations into suspected misuse of FBI CIA and NSA facilities Senator Frank Church uncovered previously unknown activity such as a CIA plot ordered by the administration of President John F Kennedy to assassinate Fidel Castro The investigation also uncovered NSA s wiretaps on targeted U S citizens br After the Church Committee hearings the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of was passed This was designed to limit the practice of mass surveillance in the United States br br br From s to s br In the NSA intercepted the communications of the Libyan government during the immediate aftermath of the Berlin discotheque bombing The White House asserted that the NSA interception had provided irrefutable evidence that Libya was behind the bombing which U S President Ronald Reagan cited as a justification for the United States bombing of Libya br In a multi year investigation by the European Parliament highlighted the NSA s role in economic espionage in a report entitled Development of Surveillance Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information That year the NSA founded the NSA Hall of Honor a memorial at the National Cryptologic Museum in Fort Meade Maryland The memorial is a tribute to the pioneers and heroes who have made significant and long lasting contributions to American cryptology NSA employees must be retired for more than fifteen years to qualify for the memorial br NSA s infrastructure deteriorated in the s as defense budget cuts resulted in maintenance deferrals On January NSA headquarters suffered a total network outage for three days caused by an overloaded network Incoming traffic was successfully stored on agency servers but it could not be directed and processed The agency carried out emergency repairs at a cost of million to get the system running again Some incoming traffic was also directed instead to Britain s GCHQ for the time being Director Michael Hayden called the outage a wake up call for the need to invest in the agency s infrastructure br In the s the defensive arm of the NSA the Information Assurance Directorate IAD started working more openly the first public technical talk by an NSA scientist at a major cryptography conference was J Solinas presentation on efficient Elliptic Curve Cryptography algorithms at Crypto The IAD s cooperative approach to academia and industry culminated in its support for a transparent process for replacing the outdated Data Encryption Standard DES by an Advanced Encryption Standard AES Cybersecurity policy expert Susan Landau attributes the NSA s harmonious collaboration with industry and academia in the selection of the AES in and the Agency s support for the choice of a strong encryption algorithm designed by Europeans rather than by Americans to Brian Snow who was the Technical Director of IAD and represented the NSA as cochairman of the Technical Working Group for the AES competition and Michael Jacobs who headed IAD at the time br After the terrorist attacks of September the NSA believed that it had public support for a dramatic expansion of its surveillance activities According to Neal Koblitz and Alfred Menezes the period when the NSA was a trusted partner with academia and industry in the development of cryptographic standards started to come to an end when as part of the change in the NSA in the post September era Snow was replaced as Technical Director Jacobs retired and IAD could no longer effectively oppose proposed actions by the offensive arm of the NSA br br br War on Terror br In the aftermath of the September attacks the NSA created new IT systems to deal with the flood of information from new technologies like the Internet and cellphones ThinThread contained advanced data mining capabilities It also had a privacy mechanism surveillance was stored encrypted decryption required a warrant The research done under this program may have contributed to the technology used in later systems ThinThread was cancelled when Michael Hayden chose Trailblazer which did not include ThinThread s privacy system br Trailblazer Project ramped up in and was worked on by Science Applications International Corporation SAIC Boeing Computer Sciences Corporation IBM and Litton Industries Some NSA whistleblowers complained internally about major problems surrounding Trailblazer This led to investigations by Congress and the NSA and DoD Inspectors General The project was cancelled in early br Turbulence started in It was developed in small inexpensive test pieces rather than one grand plan like Trailblazer It also included offensive cyber warfare capabilities like injecting malware into remote computers Congress criticized Turbulence in for having similar bureaucratic problems as Trailblazer It was to be a realization of information processing at higher speeds in cyberspace br br br Global surveillance disclosures br br The massive extent of the NSA s spying both foreign and domestic was revealed to the public in a series of detailed disclosures of internal NSA documents beginning in June Most of the disclosures were leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden On September the NSA s surveillance program was ruled unlawful by the US Court of Appeals The court also added that the US intelligence leaders who publicly defended it were not telling the truth br br br Mission br br NSA s eavesdropping mission includes radio broadcasting both from various organizations and individuals the Internet telephone calls and other intercepted forms of communication Its secure communications mission includes military diplomatic and all other sensitive confidential or secret government communications br According to a article in The Washington Post every day collection systems at the National Security Agency intercept and store billion e mails phone calls and other types of communications The NSA sorts a fraction of those into separate databases br Because of its listening task NSA CSS has been heavily involved in cryptanalytic research continuing the work of predecessor agencies which had broken many World War II codes and ciphers see for instance Purple Venona project and JN br In NSA Central Security Service and the National Cyber Security Division of the Department of Homeland Security DHS agreed to expand the NSA Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education Program br As part of the National Security Presidential Directive Homeland Security Presidential Directive NSPD signed on January by President Bush the NSA became the lead agency to monitor and protect all of the federal government s computer networks from cyber terrorism br A part of NSA s mission is to serve as a combat support agency for the Department of Defense br br br Operations br Operations by the National Security Agency can be divided into three types br br Collection overseas which falls under the responsibility of the Global Access Operations GAO division br Domestic collection which falls under the responsibility of the Special Source Operations SSO division br Hacking operations which fall under the responsibility of the Tailored Access Operations TAO division br br br Collection overseas br br br Echelon br br Echelon was created in the incubator of the Cold War Today it is a legacy system and several NSA stations are closing br NSA CSS in combination with the equivalent agencies in the United Kingdom Government Communications Headquarters Canada Communications Security Establishment Australia Australian Signals Directorate and New Zealand Government Communications Security Bureau otherwise known as the UKUSA group was reported to be in command of the operation of the so called ECHELON system Its capabilities were suspected to include the ability to monitor a large proportion of the world s transmitted civilian telephone fax and data traffic br During the early s the first of what became more than eight large satellite communications dishes were installed at Menwith Hill Investigative journalist Duncan Campbell reported in on the ECHELON surveillance program an extension of the UKUSA Agreement on global signals intelligence SIGINT and detailed how the eavesdropping operations worked On November the BBC reported that they had confirmation from the Australian Government of the existence of a powerful global spying network code named Echelon that could eavesdrop on every single phone call fax or e mail anywhere on the planet with Britain and the United States as the chief protagonists They confirmed that Menwith Hill was linked directly to the headquarters of the US National Security Agency NSA at Fort Meade in Maryland br NSA s United States Signals Intelligence Directive USSID strictly prohibited the interception or collection of information about U S persons entities corporations or organizations without explicit written legal permission from the United States Attorney General when the subject is located abroad or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court when within U S borders Alleged Echelon related activities including its use for motives other than national security including political and industrial espionage received criticism from countries outside the UKUSA alliance br br br Other SIGINT operations overseas br The NSA was also involved in planning to blackmail people with SEXINT intelligence gained about a potential target s sexual activity and preferences Those targeted had not committed any apparent crime nor were they charged with one br In order to support its facial recognition program the NSA is intercepting millions of images per day br The Real Time Regional Gateway is a data collection program introduced in in Iraq by NSA during the Iraq War that consisted of gathering all electronic communication storing it then searching and otherwise analyzing it It was effective in providing information about Iraqi insurgents who had eluded less comprehensive techniques This collect it all strategy introduced by NSA director Keith B Alexander is believed by Glenn Greenwald of The Guardian to be the model for the comprehensive worldwide mass archiving of communications which NSA is engaged in as of br A dedicated unit of the NSA locates targets for the CIA for extrajudicial assassination in the Middle East The NSA has also spied extensively on the European Union the United Nations and numerous governments including allies and trading partners in Europe South America and Asia br In June WikiLeaks published documents showing that NSA spied on French companies br In July WikiLeaks published documents showing that NSA spied on federal German ministries since the s Even Germany s Chancellor Angela Merkel s cellphones and phones of her predecessors had been intercepted br br br Boundless Informant br Edward Snowden revealed in June that between February and March the NSA collected about billion telephone data items and billion computer data items throughout the world as was displayed in charts from an internal NSA tool codenamed Boundless Informant Initially it was reported that some of these data reflected eavesdropping on citizens in countries like Germany Spain and France but later on it became clear that those data were collected by European agencies during military missions abroad and were subsequently shared with NSA br br br Bypassing encryption br In reporters uncovered a secret memo that claims the NSA created and pushed for the adoption of the Dual EC DRBG encryption standard that contained built in vulnerabilities in to the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST and the International Organization for Standardization aka ISO This memo appears to give credence to previous speculation by cryptographers at Microsoft Research Edward Snowden claims that the NSA often bypasses encryption altogether by lifting information before it is encrypted or after it is decrypted br XKeyscore rules as specified in a file xkeyscorerules txt sourced by German TV stations NDR and WDR who claim to have excerpts from its source code reveal that the NSA tracks users of privacy enhancing software tools including Tor an anonymous email service provided by the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory CSAIL in Cambridge Massachusetts and readers of the Linux Journal br br br Software backdoors br Linus Torvalds the founder of Linux kernel joked during a LinuxCon keynote on September that the NSA who are the founder of SELinux wanted a backdoor in the kernel However later Linus father a Member of the European Parliament MEP revealed that the NSA actually did this br br When my oldest son was asked the same question Has he been approached by the NSA about backdoors he said No but at the same time he nodded Then he was sort of in the legal free He had given the right answer everybody understood that the NSA had approached him br IBM Notes was the first widely adopted software product to use public key cryptography for client server and server server authentication and for encryption of data Until US laws regulating encryption were changed in IBM and Lotus were prohibited from exporting versions of Notes that supported symmetric encryption keys that were longer than bits In Lotus negotiated an agreement with the NSA that allowed the export of a version that supported stronger keys with bits but of the bits were encrypted with a special key and included in the message to provide a workload reduction factor for the NSA This strengthened the protection for users of Notes outside the US against private sector industrial espionage but not against spying by the US government br br br Boomerang routing br While it is assumed that foreign transmissions terminating in the U S such as a non U S citizen accessing a U S website subject non U S citizens to NSA surveillance recent research into boomerang routing has raised new concerns about the NSA s ability to surveil the domestic Internet traffic of foreign countries Boomerang routing occurs when an Internet transmission that originates and terminates in a single country transits another Research at the University of Toronto has suggested that approximately of Canadian domestic traffic may be subject to NSA surveillance activities as a result of the boomerang routing of Canadian Internet service providers br br br Hardware implanting br br A document included in NSA files released with Glenn Greenwald s book No Place to Hide details how the agency s Tailored Access Operations TAO and other NSA units gain access to hardware They intercept routers servers and other network hardware being shipped to organizations targeted for surveillance and install covert implant firmware onto them before they are delivered This was described by an NSA manager as some of the most productive operations in TAO because they preposition access points into hard target networks around the world br Computers seized by the NSA due to interdiction are often modified with a physical device known as Cottonmouth Cottonmouth is a device that can be inserted in the USB port of a computer in order to establish remote access to the targeted machine According to NSA s Tailored Access Operations TAO group implant catalog after implanting Cottonmouth the NSA can establish a network bridge that allows the NSA to load exploit software onto modified computers as well as allowing the NSA to relay commands and data between hardware and software implants br br br Domestic collection br br NSA s mission as set forth in Executive Order in is to collect information that constitutes foreign intelligence or counterintelligence while not acquiring information concerning the domestic activities of United States persons NSA has declared that it relies on the FBI to collect information on foreign intelligence activities within the borders of the United States while confining its own activities within the United States to the embassies and missions of foreign nations br The appearance of a Domestic Surveillance Directorate of the NSA was soon exposed as a hoax in br NSA s domestic surveillance activities are limited by the requirements imposed by the Fourth Amendment to the U S Constitution The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for example held in October citing multiple Supreme Court precedents that the Fourth Amendment prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures apply to the contents of all communications whatever the means because a person s private communications are akin to personal papers However these protections do not apply to non U S persons located outside of U S borders so the NSA s foreign surveillance efforts are subject to far fewer limitations under U S law The specific requirements for domestic surveillance operations are contained in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of FISA which does not extend protection to non U S citizens located outside of U S territory br br br President s Surveillance Program br br George W Bush president during the terrorist attacks approved the Patriot Act shortly after the attacks to take anti terrorist security measures Titles and specifically authorized measures that would be taken by the NSA These titles granted enhanced domestic security against terrorism surveillance procedures and improved intelligence respectively On March there was a debate between President Bush and White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales Attorney General John Ashcroft and Acting Attorney General James Comey The Attorneys General were unsure if the NSA s programs could be considered constitutional They threatened to resign over the matter but ultimately the NSA s programs continued On March President Bush signed a new authorization for mass surveillance of Internet records in addition to the surveillance of phone records This allowed the president to be able to override laws such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act which protected civilians from mass surveillance In addition to this President Bush also signed that the measures of mass surveillance were also retroactively in place br One such surveillance program authorized by the U S Signals Intelligence Directive of President George Bush was the Highlander Project undertaken for the National Security Agency by the U S Army th Military Intelligence Brigade NSA relayed telephone including cell phone conversations obtained from ground airborne and satellite monitoring stations to various U S Army Signal Intelligence Officers including the st Military Intelligence Battalion Conversations of citizens of the U S were intercepted along with those of other nations br Proponents of the surveillance program claim that the President has executive authority to order such action arguing that laws such as FISA are overridden by the President s Constitutional powers In addition some argued that FISA was implicitly overridden by a subsequent statute the Authorization for Use of Military Force although the Supreme Court s ruling in Hamdan v Rumsfeld deprecates this view br br br The PRISM program br br Under the PRISM program which started in NSA gathers Internet communications from foreign targets from nine major U S Internet based communication service providers Microsoft Yahoo Google Facebook PalTalk AOL Skype YouTube and Apple Data gathered include email videos photos VoIP chats such as Skype and file transfers br Former NSA director General Keith Alexander claimed that in September the NSA prevented Najibullah Zazi and his friends from carrying out a terrorist attack However no evidence has been presented demonstrating that the NSA has ever been instrumental in preventing a terrorist attack br br br Hacking operations br Besides the more traditional ways of eavesdropping in order to collect signals intelligence NSA is also engaged in hacking computers smartphones and their networks A division which conducts such operations is the Tailored Access Operations TAO division which has been active since at least circa br According to the Foreign Policy magazine the Office of Tailored Access Operations or TAO has successfully penetrated Chinese computer and telecommunications systems for almost years generating some of the best and most reliable intelligence information about what is going on inside the People s Republic of China br In an interview with Wired magazine Edward Snowden said the Tailored Access Operations division accidentally caused Syria s internet blackout in br br br Organizational structure br br The NSA is led by the Director of the National Security Agency DIRNSA who also serves as Chief of the Central Security Service CHCSS and Commander of the United States Cyber Command USCYBERCOM and is the highest ranking military official of these organizations He is assisted by a Deputy Director who is the highest ranking civilian within the NSA CSS br NSA also has an Inspector General head of the Office of the Inspector General OIG a General Counsel head of the Office of the General Counsel OGC and a Director of Compliance who is head of the Office of the Director of Compliance ODOC br Unlike other intelligence organizations such as the CIA or DIA the NSA has always been particularly reticent concerning its internal organizational structure br As of the mid s the National Security Agency was organized into five Directorates br br The Operations Directorate which was responsible for SIGINT collection and processing br The Technology and Systems Directorate which develops new technologies for SIGINT collection and processing br The Information Systems Security Directorate which was responsible for NSA s communications and information security missions br The Plans Policy and Programs Directorate which provided staff support and general direction for the Agency br The Support Services Directorate which provided logistical and administrative support activities br Each of these directorates consisted of several groups or elements designated by a letter There were for example the A Group which was responsible for all SIGINT operations against the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe and G Group which was responsible for SIGINT related to all non communist countries These groups were divided into units designated by an additional number like unit A for breaking Soviet codes and G being the office for the Middle East North Africa Cuba Central and South America br br br Directorates br As of NSA has about a dozen directorates which are designated by a letter although not all of them are publicly known br In the year a leadership team was formed consisting of the director the deputy director and the directors of the Signals Intelligence SID the Information Assurance IAD and the Technical Directorate TD The chiefs of other main NSA divisions became associate directors of the senior leadership team br After president George W Bush initiated the President s Surveillance Program PSP in the NSA created a hour Metadata Analysis Center MAC followed in by the Advanced Analysis Division AAD with the mission of analyzing content Internet metadata and telephone metadata Both units were part of the Signals Intelligence Directorate br A proposal would combine the Signals Intelligence Directorate with the Information Assurance Directorate into a Directorate of Operations br br br NSANet br br NSANet stands for National Security Agency Network and is the official NSA intranet It is a classified network for information up to the level of TS SCI to support the use and sharing of intelligence data between NSA and the signals intelligence agencies of the four other nations of the Five Eyes partnership The management of NSANet has been delegated to the Central Security Service Texas CSSTEXAS br NSANet is a highly secured computer network consisting of fiber optic and satellite communication channels which are almost completely separated from the public Internet The network allows NSA personnel and civilian and military intelligence analysts anywhere in the world to have access to the agency s systems and databases This access is tightly controlled and monitored For example every keystroke is logged activities are audited at random and downloading and printing of documents from NSANet are recorded br In NSANet along with NIPRNet and SIPRNet had significant problems with poor search capabilities unorganized data and old information In the network was reported to have used over twenty commercial off the shelf operating systems Some universities that do highly sensitive research are allowed to connect to it br The thousands of Top Secret internal NSA documents that were taken by Edward Snowden in were stored in a file sharing location on the NSA s intranet site so they could easily be read online by NSA personnel Everyone with a TS SCI clearance had access to these documents As a system administrator Snowden was responsible for moving accidentally misplaced highly sensitive documents to safer storage locations br br br Watch centers br The NSA maintains at least two watch centers br br National Security Operations Center NSOC which is the NSA s current operations center and focal point for time sensitive SIGINT reporting for the United States SIGINT System USSS This center was established in as the National SIGINT Watch Center NSWC and renamed into National SIGINT Operations Center NSOC in This nerve center of the NSA got its current name in br NSA CSS Threat Operations Center NTOC which is the primary NSA CSS partner for Department of Homeland Security response to cyber incidents The NTOC establishes real time network awareness and threat characterization capabilities to forecast alert and attribute malicious activity and enable the coordination of Computer Network Operations The NTOC was established in as a joint Information Assurance and Signals Intelligence project br br br NSA Police br The NSA has its own police force known as NSA Police and formerly as NSA Security Protective Force which provides law enforcement services emergency response and physical security to the NSA s people and property br NSA Police are armed federal officers NSA Police has a K division which generally conducts explosive detection screening of mail vehicles and cargo entering NSA grounds br NSA Police use marked vehicles to carry out patrols br br br Employees br The number of NSA employees is officially classified but there are several sources providing estimates br In NSA had military and civilian employees which grew to in of which worked at the headquarters at Fort Meade In the early s NSA had roughly military and civilian personnel By this number had grown again to of which worked at the NSA headquarters Between and the NSA s budget and workforce were cut by one third which led to a substantial loss of experience br In the NSA said more than employees worked at Fort Meade and other facilities In John C Inglis the deputy director said that the total number of NSA employees is somewhere between and one billion as a joke and stated that the agency is probably the biggest employer of introverts In Der Spiegel stated that the NSA had employees More widely it has been described as the world s largest single employer of mathematicians Some NSA employees form part of the workforce of the National Reconnaissance Office NRO the agency that provides the NSA with satellite signals intelligence br As of about system administrators work for the NSA br br br Personnel security br The NSA received criticism early on in after two agents had defected to the Soviet Union Investigations by the House Un American Activities Committee and a special subcommittee of the United States House Committee on Armed Services revealed severe cases of ignorance in personnel security regulations prompting the former personnel director and the director of security to step down and leading to the adoption of stricter security practices Nonetheless security breaches reoccurred only a year later when in an issue of Izvestia of July a former NSA employee published several cryptologic secrets br The very same day an NSA clerk messenger committed suicide as ongoing investigations disclosed that he had sold secret information to the Soviets on a regular basis The reluctance of Congressional houses to look into these affairs had prompted a journalist to write If a similar series of tragic blunders occurred in any ordinary agency of Government an aroused public would insist that those responsible be officially censured demoted or fired David Kahn criticized the NSA s tactics of concealing its doings as smug and the Congress blind faith in the agency s right doing as shortsighted and pointed out the necessity of surveillance by the Congress to prevent abuse of power br Edward Snowden s leaking of the existence of PRISM in caused the NSA to institute a two man rule where two system administrators are required to be present when one accesses certain sensitive information Snowden claims he suggested such a rule in br br br Polygraphing br br The NSA conducts polygraph tests of employees For new employees the tests are meant to discover enemy spies who are applying to the NSA and to uncover any information that could make an applicant pliant to coercion As part of the latter historically EPQs or embarrassing personal questions about sexual behavior had been included in the NSA polygraph The NSA also conducts five year periodic reinvestigation polygraphs of employees focusing on counterintelligence programs In addition the NSA conducts periodic polygraph investigations in order to find spies and leakers those who refuse to take them may receive termination of employment according to a memorandum from the director of the NSA br br There are also special access examination polygraphs for employees who wish to work in highly sensitive areas and those polygraphs cover counterintelligence questions and some questions about behavior NSA s brochure states that the average test length is between two and four hours A report of the Office of Technology Assessment stated that It appears that the NSA National Security Agency and possibly CIA use the polygraph not to determine deception or truthfulness per se but as a technique of interrogation to encourage admissions Sometimes applicants in the polygraph process confess to committing felonies such as murder rape and selling of illegal drugs Between and of the job applicants who took polygraph tests confessed to previous felony crimes almost all of those crimes had been undetected br In the NSA produced a video explaining its polygraph process The video ten minutes long is titled The Truth About the Polygraph and was posted to the Web site of the Defense Security Service Jeff Stein of The Washington Post said that the video portrays various applicants or actors playing them it s not clear describing everything bad they had heard about the test the implication being that none of it is true AntiPolygraph org argues that the NSA produced video omits some information about the polygraph process it produced a video responding to the NSA video George Maschke the founder of the Web site accused the NSA polygraph video of being Orwellian br A article indicated that after Edward Snowden revealed his identity in the NSA began requiring polygraphing of employees once per quarter br br br Arbitrary firing br The number of exemptions from legal requirements has been criticized When in Congress was hearing a bill giving the director of the NSA the power to fire at will any employee The Washington Post wrote This is the very definition of arbitrariness It means that an employee could be discharged and disgraced on the basis of anonymous allegations without the slightest opportunity to defend himself Yet the bill was accepted by an overwhelming majority Also every person hired to a job in the US after at any private organization state or federal government agency must be reported to the New Hire Registry ostensibly to look for child support evaders except that employees of an intelligence agency may be excluded from reporting if the director deems it necessary for national security reasons br br br Facilities br br br Headquarters br br br History of headquarters br br When the agency was first established its headquarters and cryptographic center were in the Naval Security Station in Washington D C The COMINT functions were located in Arlington Hall in Northern Virginia which served as the headquarters of the U S Army s cryptographic operations Because the Soviet Union had detonated a nuclear bomb and because the facilities were crowded the federal government wanted to move several agencies including the AFSA NSA A planning committee considered Fort Knox but Fort Meade Maryland was ultimately chosen as NSA headquarters because it was far enough away from Washington D C in case of a nuclear strike and was close enough so its employees would not have to move their families br Construction of additional buildings began after the agency occupied buildings at Fort Meade in the late s which they soon outgrew In the new headquarters building nine stories tall opened NSA workers referred to the building as the Headquarters Building and since the NSA management occupied the top floor workers used Ninth Floor to refer to their leaders COMSEC remained in Washington D C until its new building was completed in In September the Operations A and B buildings both copper shielded to prevent eavesdropping opened with a dedication by President Ronald Reagan The four NSA buildings became known as the Big Four The NSA director moved to B when it opened br br Headquarters for the National Security Agency is located at N W in Fort George G Meade Maryland although it is separate from other compounds and agencies that are based within this same military installation Fort Meade is about mi km southwest of Baltimore and mi km northeast of Washington D C The NSA has two dedicated exits off Baltimore Washington Parkway The Eastbound exit from the Parkway heading toward Baltimore is open to the public and provides employee access to its main campus and public access to the National Cryptology Museum The Westbound side exit heading toward Washington is labeled NSA Employees Only The exit may only be used by people with the proper clearances and security vehicles parked along the road guard the entrance br NSA is the largest employer in the state of Maryland and two thirds of its personnel work at Fort Meade Built on acres ha sq mi of Fort Meade s acres ha sq mi the site has buildings and an estimated parking spaces br br The main NSA headquarters and operations building is what James Bamford author of Body of Secrets describes as a modern boxy structure that appears similar to any stylish office building The building is covered with one way dark glass which is lined with copper shielding in order to prevent espionage by trapping in signals and sounds It contains square feet m or more than acres ha of floor space Bamford said that the U S Capitol could easily fit inside it four times over br The facility has over watchposts one of them being the visitor control center a two story area that serves as the entrance At the entrance a white pentagonal structure visitor badges are issued to visitors and security clearances of employees are checked The visitor center includes a painting of the NSA seal br The OPS A building the tallest building in the NSA complex and the location of much of the agency s operations directorate is accessible from the visitor center Bamford described it as a dark glass Rubik s Cube The facility s red corridor houses non security operations such as concessions and the drug store The name refers to the red badge which is worn by someone without a security clearance The NSA headquarters includes a cafeteria a credit union ticket counters for airlines and entertainment a barbershop and a bank NSA headquarters has its own post office fire department and police force br The employees at the NSA headquarters reside in various places in the Baltimore Washington area including Annapolis Baltimore and Columbia in Maryland and the District of Columbia including the Georgetown community The NSA maintains a shuttle service from the Odenton station of MARC to its Visitor Control Center and has done so since br br br Power consumption br br Following a major power outage in in and in follow ups through The Baltimore Sun reported that the NSA was at risk of electrical overload because of insufficient internal electrical infrastructure at Fort Meade to support the amount of equipment being installed This problem was apparently recognized in the s but not made a priority and now the agency s ability to keep its operations going is threatened br On August The Baltimore Sun reported that the NSA had completely maxed out the grid and that Baltimore Gas Electric BGE now Constellation Energy was unable to sell them any more power NSA decided to move some of its operations to a new satellite facility br BGE provided NSA with to megawatts at Fort Meade in and expected that an increase of to megawatts would be needed later that year In the NSA was Maryland s largest consumer of power In as BGE s largest customer NSA bought as much electricity as Annapolis the capital city of Maryland br One estimate put the potential for power consumption by the new Utah Data Center at US million per year br br br Computing assets br In The Baltimore Sun reported that the NSA is the owner of the single largest group of supercomputers br NSA held a

Washington metropolitan area br br br National Computer Security Center br The DoD Computer Security Center was founded in and renamed the National Computer Security Center NCSC in NCSC was responsible for computer security throughout the federal government NCSC was part of NSA and during the late s and the s NSA and NCSC published Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria in a six

Frankfurt in Germany A NSA report indicates that the ECC is responsible for the largest analysis and productivity in Europe and focuses on various priorities including Africa Europe the Middle East and counterterrorism operations br In a new Consolidated Intelligence Center also to be used by NSA is being built at the headquarters of the United States Army Europe in Wiesbaden Germany NSA s partnership with Bundesnachrichtendienst BND the German foreign intelligence service was confirmed by BND president Gerhard Schindler br br br Thailand br Thailand is a rd party partner of the NSA along with nine other nations These are non English speaking countries that have made security agreements for the exchange of SIGINT raw material and end product reports br Thailand is the site of at least two US SIGINT collection stations One is at the US Embassy in Bangkok a joint NSA CIA Special Collection Service SCS unit It presumably eavesdrops on foreign embassies governmental communications and other targets of opportunity br The second installation is a FORNSAT foreign satellite interception station in the Thai city of Khon Kaen It is codenamed INDRA but has also been referred to as LEMONWOOD The station is approximately hectares acres in size and consists of a large m ft operations building on the west side of the ops compound and four radome enclosed parabolic antennas Possibly two of the radome enclosed antennas are used for SATCOM intercept and two antennas used for relaying the intercepted material back to NSA There is also a PUSHER type circularly disposed antenna array CDAA just north of the ops compound br NSA activated Khon Kaen in October Its mission was to eavesdrop on the radio traffic of Chinese army and air force units in southern China especially in and around the city of Kunming in Yunnan Province In the late s the base consisted only of a small CDAA antenna array that was remote controlled via satellite from the NSA listening post at Kunia Hawaii and a small force of civilian contractors from Bendix Field Engineering Corp whose job it was to keep the antenna array and satellite relay facilities up and running br According to the papers of the late General William Odom the INDRA facility was upgraded in with a new British made PUSHER CDAA antenna as part of an overall upgrade of NSA and Thai SIGINT facilities whose objective was to spy on the neighboring communist nations of Vietnam Laos and Cambodia br The base apparently fell into disrepair in the s as China and Vietnam became more friendly towards the US and by archived satellite imagery showed that the PUSHER CDAA antenna had been torn down perhaps indicating that the base had been closed At some point in the period since the Khon Kaen base was reactivated and expanded to include a sizeable SATCOM intercept mission It is likely that the NSA presence at Khon Kaen is relatively small and that most of the work is done by civilian contractors br br br Research and development br NSA has been involved in debates about public policy both indirectly as a behind the scenes adviser to other departments and directly during and after Vice Admiral Bobby Ray Inman s directorship NSA was a major player in the debates of the s regarding the export of cryptography in the United States Restrictions on export were reduced but not eliminated in br Its secure government communications work has involved the NSA in numerous technology areas including the design of specialized communications hardware and software production of dedicated semiconductors at the Ft Meade chip fabrication plant and advanced cryptography research For years NSA designed and built most of its computer equipment in house but from the s until about when the U S Congress curtailed the practice the agency contracted with the private sector in the fields of research and equipment br br br Data Encryption Standard br br NSA was embroiled in some controversy concerning its involvement in the creation of the Data Encryption Standard DES a standard and public block cipher algorithm used by the U S government and banking community During the development of DES by IBM in the s NSA recommended changes to some details of the design There was suspicion that these changes had weakened the algorithm sufficiently to enable the agency to eavesdrop if required including speculation that a critical component the so called S boxes had been altered to insert a backdoor and that the reduction in key length might have made it feasible for NSA to discover DES keys using massive computing power It has since been observed that the S boxes in DES are particularly resilient against differential cryptanalysis a technique which was not publicly discovered until the late s but known to the IBM DES team br br br Advanced Encryption Standard br br The involvement of NSA in selecting a successor to Data Encryption Standard DES the Advanced Encryption Standard AES was limited to hardware performance testing see AES competition NSA has subsequently certified AES for protection of classified information when used in NSA approved systems br br br NSA encryption

Dynamics C Systems br The NSA has specified Suite A and Suite B cryptographic algorithm suites to be used in U S government systems the Suite B algorithms are a subset of those previously specified by NIST and are expected to serve for most information protection purposes while the Suite A algorithms are secret and are intended for especially high levels of protection br br br SHA br The widely used SHA and SHA hash functions were designed by NSA SHA is a slight modification of the weaker SHA algorithm also designed by NSA in This small modification was suggested by NSA two years later with no justification other than the fact that it provides additional security An attack for SHA that does not apply to the revised algorithm was indeed found between and by academic cryptographers Because of weaknesses and key length restrictions in SHA NIST deprecates its use for digital signatures and approves only the newer SHA algorithms for such applications from on br A new hash standard SHA has recently been selected through the competition concluded October with the selection of Keccak as the algorithm The process to select SHA was similar to the one held in choosing the AES but some doubts have been cast over it since fundamental modifications have been made to Keccak in order to turn it into a standard These changes potentially undermine the cryptanalysis performed during the competition and reduce the security levels of the algorithm br br br Clipper chip br br Because of concerns that widespread use of strong cryptography would hamper government use of wiretaps NSA proposed the concept of key escrow in and introduced the Clipper chip that would offer stronger protection than DES but would allow access to encrypted data by authorized law enforcement officials The proposal was strongly opposed and key escrow requirements ultimately went nowhere However NSA s Fortezza hardware based encryption cards created for the Clipper project are still used within government and NSA ultimately declassified and published the design of the Skipjack cipher used on the cards br br br Dual EC DRBG random number generator cryptotrojan br br NSA promoted the inclusion of a random number generator called Dual EC DRBG in the U S National Institute of Standards and Technology s guidelines This led to speculation of a backdoor which would allow NSA access to data encrypted by systems using that pseudorandom number generator PRNG br This is now deemed to be plausible based on the fact that output of next iterations of PRNG can provably be determined if relation between two internal Elliptic Curve points is known Both NIST and RSA are now officially recommending against the use of this PRNG br br br Perfect Citizen br br Perfect Citizen is a program to perform vulnerability assessment by the NSA on U S critical infrastructure It was originally reported to be a program to develop a system of sensors to detect cyber attacks on critical infrastructure computer networks in both the private and public sector through a network monitoring system named Einstein It is funded by the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative and thus far Raytheon has received a contract for up to million for the initial stage br br br Academic research br NSA has invested many millions of dollars in academic research under grant code prefix MDA resulting in over papers as of October NSA CSS has at times attempted to restrict the publication of academic research into cryptography for example the Khufu and Khafre block ciphers were voluntarily withheld in response to an NSA request to do so In response to a FOIA lawsuit in the NSA released the page research paper titled Untangling the Web A Guide to Internet Research written and compiled by NSA employees to assist other NSA workers in searching for information of interest to the agency on the public Internet br br br Patents br NSA has the ability to file for a patent from the U S Patent and Trademark Office under gag order Unlike normal patents these are not revealed to the public and do not expire However if the Patent Office receives an application for an identical patent from a third party they will reveal NSA s patent and officially grant it to NSA for the full term on that date br One of NSA s published patents describes a method of geographically locating an individual computer site in an Internet like network based on the latency of multiple network connections Although no public patent exists NSA is reported to have used a similar locating technology called trilateralization that allows real time tracking of an individual s location including altitude from ground level using data obtained from cellphone towers br br br Insignia and memorials br br The heraldic insignia of NSA consists of an eagle inside a circle grasping a key in its talons The eagle represents the agency s national mission Its breast features a shield with bands of red and white taken from the Great Seal of the United States and representing Congress The key is taken from the emblem of Saint Peter and represents security br When the NSA was created the agency had no emblem and used that of the Department of Defense The agency adopted its first of two emblems in The current NSA insignia has been in use since when then Director LTG Marshall S Carter USA ordered the creation of a device to represent the agency br The NSA s flag consists of the agency s seal on a light blue background br br Crews associated with NSA missions have been involved in a number of dangerous and deadly situations The USS Liberty incident in and USS Pueblo incident in are examples of the losses endured during the Cold War br The National Security Agency Central Security Service Cryptologic Memorial honors and remembers the fallen personnel both military and civilian of these intelligence missions It is made of black granite and has names carved into it as of It is located at NSA headquarters A tradition of declassifying the stories of the fallen was begun in br br br Constitutionality legality and privacy questions regarding operations br br In the United States at least since there has been legal controversy over what signal intelligence can be used for and how much freedom the National Security Agency has to use signal intelligence In the government made slight changes in how it uses and collects certain types of data specifically phone records The government was not analyzing the phone records as of early The surveillance programs were deemed unlawful in September in a court of appeals case br br br Warrantless wiretaps br br On December The New York Times reported that under White House pressure and with an executive order from President George W Bush the National Security Agency in an attempt to thwart terrorism had been tapping phone calls made to persons outside the country without obtaining warrants from the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court a secret court created for that purpose under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA br br br Edward Snowden br Edward Snowden is a former American intelligence contractor who revealed in the existence of secret wide ranging information gathering programs conducted by the National Security Agency NSA More specifically Snowden released information that demonstrated how the United States government was gathering immense amounts of personal communications emails phone locations web histories and more of American citizens without their knowledge One of Snowden s primary motivators for releasing this information was fear of a surveillance state developing as a result of the infrastructure being created by the NSA As Snowden recounts I believe that at this point in history the greatest danger to our freedom and way of life comes from the reasonable fear of omniscient State powers kept in check by nothing more than policy documents It is not that I do not value intelligence but that I oppose omniscient automatic mass surveillance That seems to me a greater threat to the institutions of free society than missed intelligence reports and unworthy of the costs br In March Army General Martin Dempsey Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the House Armed Services Committee The vast majority of the documents that Snowden exfiltrated from our highest levels of security had nothing to do with exposing government oversight of domestic activities The vast majority of those were related to our military capabilities operations tactics techniques and procedures When asked in a May interview to quantify the number of documents Snowden stole retired NSA director Keith Alexander said there was no accurate way of counting what he took but Snowden may have downloaded more than a million documents br br br Other surveillance br On January the Center for Constitutional Rights filed a lawsuit CCR v Bush against the George W Bush Presidency The lawsuit challenged the National Security Agency s NSA s surveillance of people within the U S including the interception of CCR emails without securing a warrant first br In the August case ACLU v NSA U S District Court Judge Anna Diggs Taylor concluded that NSA s warrantless surveillance program was both illegal and unconstitutional On July the th Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the decision on the grounds that the ACLU lacked standing to bring the suit br In September the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF filed a class action lawsuit against the NSA and several high ranking officials of the Bush administration charging an illegal and unconstitutional program of dragnet communications surveillance based on documentation provided by former AT T technician Mark Klein br As a result of the USA Freedom Act passed by Congress in June the NSA had to shut down its bulk phone surveillance program on November of the same year The USA Freedom Act forbids the NSA to collect metadata and content of phone calls unless it has a warrant for terrorism investigation In that case the agency must ask the telecom companies for the record which will only be kept for six months The NSA s use of large telecom companies to assist it with its surveillance efforts has caused several privacy concerns br br br AT T Internet monitoring br br In May Mark Klein a former AT T employee alleged that his company had cooperated with NSA in installing Narus hardware to replace the FBI Carnivore program to monitor network communications including traffic between U S citizens br br br Data mining br NSA was reported in to use its computing capability to analyze transactional data that it regularly acquires from other government agencies which gather it under their own jurisdictional authorities br A advisory group for the Obama administration seeking to reform NSA spying programs following the revelations of documents released by Edward J Snowden mentioned in Recommendation on page that the National Security Council staff should manage an interagency process to review on a regular basis the activities of the US Government regarding attacks that exploit a previously unknown vulnerability in a computer application Retired cybersecurity expert Richard A Clarke was a group member and stated on April that NSA had no advance knowledge of Heartbleed br br br Illegally obtained evidence br br In August it was revealed that a IRS training document showed that NSA intelligence intercepts and wiretaps both foreign and domestic were being supplied to the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA and Internal Revenue Service IRS and were illegally used to launch criminal investigations of US citizens Law enforcement agents were directed to conceal how the investigations began and recreate an apparently legal investigative trail by re obtaining the same evidence by other means br br br Barack Obama administration br In the months leading to April the NSA intercepted the communications of U S citizens including a Congressman although the Justice Department believed that the interception was unintentional The Justice Department then took action to correct the issues and bring the program into compliance with existing laws United States Attorney General Eric Holder resumed the program according to his understanding of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act amendment of without explaining what had occurred br Polls conducted in June found divided results among Americans regarding NSA s secret data collection Rasmussen Reports found that of Americans disapprove Gallup found that disapprove and Pew found that are in favor of NSA data collection br br br Section metadata collection br On April the NSA obtained a court order requiring Verizon s Business Network Services to provide metadata on all calls in its system to the NSA on an ongoing daily basis for a three month period as reported by The Guardian on June This information includes the numbers of both parties on a call location data call duration unique identifiers and the time and duration of all calls but not t he contents of the conversation itself The order relies on the so called business records provision of the Patriot Act br In August following the Snowden leaks new details about the NSA s data mining activity were revealed Reportedly the majority of emails into or out of the United States are captured at selected communications links and automatically analyzed for keywords or other selectors Emails that do not match are deleted br The utility of such a massive metadata collection in preventing terrorist attacks is disputed Many studies reveal the dragnet like system to be ineffective One such report released by the New America Foundation concluded that after an analysis of terrorism cases the NSA had no discernible impact on preventing acts of terrorism br Defenders of the program said that while metadata alone cannot provide all the information necessary to prevent an attack it assures the ability to connect the dots between suspect foreign numbers and domestic numbers with a speed only the NSA s software is capable of One benefit of this is quickly being able to determine the difference between suspicious activity and real threats As an example NSA director General Keith B Alexander mentioned at the annual Cybersecurity Summit in that metadata analysis of domestic phone call records after the Boston Marathon bombing helped determine that rumors of a follow up attack in New York were baseless br In addition to doubts about its effectiveness many people argue that the collection of metadata is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy As of the collection process remained legal and grounded in the ruling from Smith v Maryland A prominent opponent of the data collection and its legality is U S District Judge Richard J Leon who issued a report in in which he stated I cannot imagine a more indiscriminate and arbitrary invasion than this systematic and high tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval Surely such a program infringes on that degree of privacy that the founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment br As of May the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the interpretation of Section of the Patriot Act was wrong and that the NSA program that has been collecting Americans phone records in bulk is illegal It stated that Section cannot be clearly interpreted to allow government to collect national phone data and as a result expired on June This ruling is the first time a higher level court in the regular judicial system has reviewed the NSA phone records program The replacement law known as the USA Freedom Act which will enable the NSA to continue to have bulk access to citizens metadata but with the stipulation that the data will now be stored by the companies themselves This change will not have any effect on other Agency procedures outside of metadata collection which have purportedly challenged Americans Fourth Amendment rights including Upstream collection a mass of techniques used by the Agency to collect and store American s data communications directly from the Internet backbone br Under the Upstream collection program the NSA paid telecommunications companies hundreds of millions of dollars in order to collect data from them While companies such as Google and Yahoo claim that they do not provide direct access from their servers to the NSA unless under a court order the NSA had access to emails phone calls and cellular data users Under this new ruling telecommunications companies maintain bulk user metadata on their servers for at least months to be provided upon request to the NSA This ruling made the mass storage of specific phone records at NSA datacenters illegal but it did not rule on Section s constitutionality br br br Fourth Amendment encroachment br In a declassified document it was revealed that phone lines were on an improperly permitted alert list from to in breach of compliance which tagged these phone lines for daily monitoring Eleven percent of these monitored phone lines met the agency s legal standard for reasonably articulable suspicion RAS br The NSA tracks the locations of hundreds of millions of cellphones per day allowing it to map people s movements and relationships in detail The NSA has been reported to have access to all communications made via Google Microsoft Facebook Yahoo YouTube AOL Skype Apple and Paltalk and collects hundreds of millions of contact lists from personal email and instant messaging accounts each year It has also managed to weaken much of the encryption used on the Internet by collaborating with coercing or otherwise infiltrating numerous technology companies to leave backdoors into their systems so that the majority of encryption is inadvertently vulnerable to different forms of attack br Domestically the NSA has been proven to collect and store metadata records of phone calls including over million US Verizon subscribers as well as intercept vast amounts of communications via the internet Upstream The government s legal standing had been to rely on a secret interpretation of the Patriot Act whereby the entirety of US communications may be considered relevant to a terrorism investigation if it is expected that even a tiny minority may relate to terrorism The NSA also supplies foreign intercepts to the DEA IRS and other law enforcement agencies who use these to initiate criminal investigations Federal agents are then instructed to recreate the investigative trail via parallel construction br The NSA also spies on influential Muslims to obtain information that could be used to discredit them such as their use of pornography The targets both domestic and abroad are not suspected of any crime but hold religious or political views deemed radical by the NSA br According to a report in The Washington Post in July relying on information provided by Snowden of those placed under surveillance in the U S are ordinary Americans and are not the intended targets The newspaper said it had examined documents including emails text messages and online accounts that support the claim br br br Congressional oversight br The Intelligence Committees of US House and Senate exercise primary oversight over the NSA other members of congress have been denied access to materials and information regarding the agency and its activities The United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court the secret court charged with regulating the NSA s activities is according to its chief judge incapable of investigating or verifying how often the NSA breaks even its own secret rules It has since been reported that the NSA violated its own rules on data access thousands of times a year many of these violations involving large scale data interceptions NSA officers have even used data intercepts to spy on love interests most of the NSA violations were self reported and each instance resulted in administrative action of termination br The NSA has generally disregarded the special rules for disseminating United States person information by illegally sharing its intercepts with other law enforcement agencies A March FISA Court opinion which the court released states that protocols restricting data queries had been so frequently and systemically violated that it can be fairly said that this critical element of the overall regime has never functioned effectively In the same court noted that the volume and nature of the NSA s bulk foreign Internet intercepts was fundamentally different from what the court had been led to believe Email contact lists including those of US citizens are collected at numerous foreign locations to work around the illegality of doing so on US soil br Legal opinions on the NSA s bulk collection program have differed In mid December U S District Judge Richard Leon ruled that the almost Orwellian program likely violates the Constitution and wrote I cannot imagine a more indiscriminate and arbitrary invasion than this systematic and high tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval Surely such a program infringes on that degree of privacy that the Founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment Indeed I have little doubt that the author of our Constitution James Madison who cautioned us to beware the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power would be aghast br Later that month U S District Judge William Pauley ruled that the NSA s collection of telephone records is legal and valuable in the fight against terrorism In his opinion he wrote a bulk telephony metadata collection program is a wide net that could find and isolate gossamer contacts among suspected terrorists in an ocean of seemingly disconnected data and noted that a similar collection of data prior to might have prevented the attack br br br Official responses br At a March Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Senator Ron Wyden asked Director of National Intelligence James Clapper does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans Clapper replied No sir Not wittingly There are cases where they could inadvertently perhaps collect but not wittingly This statement came under scrutiny months later in June when details of the PRISM surveillance program were published showing that the NSA apparently can gain access to the servers of nine Internet companies for a wide range of digital data Wyden said that Clapper had failed to give a straight answer in his testimony Clapper in response to criticism said I responded in what I thought was the most truthful or least untruthful manner Clapper added There are honest differences on the semantics of what when someone says collection to me that has a specific meaning which may have a different meaning to him br NSA whistle blower Edward Snowden additionally revealed the existence of XKeyscore a top secret NSA program that allows the agency to search vast databases of the metadata as well as the content of emails and other internet activity such as browser history with capability to search by name telephone number IP address keywords the language in which the internet activity was conducted or the type of browser used XKeyscore provides the technological capability if not the legal authority to target even US persons for extensive electronic surveillance without a warrant provided that some identifying information such as their email or IP address is known to the analyst br Regarding the necessity of these NSA programs Alexander stated on June that the NSA s bulk phone and Internet intercepts had been instrumental in preventing terrorist events including in the US and in all but one of these cases had provided the initial tip to unravel the threat stream On July NSA Deputy Director John Inglis conceded to the Senate that these intercepts had not been vital in stopping any terrorist attacks but were close to vital in identifying and convicting four San Diego men for sending US to Al Shabaab a militia that conducts terrorism in Somalia br The U S government has aggressively sought to dismiss and challenge Fourth Amendment cases raised against it and has granted retroactive immunity to ISPs and telecoms participating in domestic surveillance br The U S military has acknowledged blocking access to parts of The Guardian website for thousands of defense personnel across the country and blocking the entire Guardian website for personnel stationed throughout Afghanistan the Middle East and South Asia br An October United Nations report condemned mass surveillance by the United States and other countries as violating multiple international treaties and conventions that guarantee core privacy rights br br br Responsibility for international ransomware attack br An exploit dubbed EternalBlue created by the NSA was used in the unprecedented worldwide WannaCry ransomware attack in May The exploit had been leaked online by a hacking group The Shadow Brokers nearly a month prior to the attack A number of experts have pointed the finger at the NSA s non disclosure of the underlying vulnerability and their loss of control over the EternalBlue attack tool that exploited it Edward Snowden said that if the NSA had privately disclosed the flaw used to attack hospitals when they found it not when they lost it the attack might not have happened Wikipedia co founder Jimmy Wales stated that he joined with Microsoft and the other leaders of the industry in saying this is a huge screw up by the government the moment the NSA found it they should have notified Microsoft so they could quietly issue a patch and really chivvy people along long before it became a huge problem br br br Activities of previous employees br Former employee David Evenden who had left the NSA to work for US defense contractor Cyperpoint at a position in the United Arab Emirates was tasked with hacking UAE neighbor Qatar in to determine if they were funding terrorist group Muslim Brotherhood He quit the company after learning his team had hacked Qatari Sheikha Moza bint Nasser s email exchanges with Michelle Obama just prior to her visit to Doha Upon Evenden s return to the US he reported his experiences to the FBI The incident highlights a growing trend of former NSA employees and contractors leaving the agency to start up their own firms and then hiring out to countries like Turkey Sudan and even Russia a country involved in numerous cyberattacks against the US br br br Denmark NSA collaborative surveillance br br In
