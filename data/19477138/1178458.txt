Flickr FLI k r is an image hosting and video hosting service as well as an online community founded in Canada and headquartered in the United States It was created by Ludicorp in and was previously a common way for amateur and professional photographers to host high resolution photos It has changed ownership several times and has been owned by SmugMug since April br As of June Flickr had a total of million registered members and more than million new images uploaded daily On August the site reported that it was hosting more than billion images Photos and videos can be accessed from Flickr without the need to register an account but an account must be made to upload content to the site Registering an account also allows users to create a profile page containing photos and videos that the user has uploaded and also grants the ability to add another Flickr user as a contact For mobile users Flickr has official mobile apps for iOS Android and an optimized mobile site br br br History br Flickr was launched on February by Ludicorp a Vancouver based company founded by Stewart Butterfield and Caterina Fake The service emerged from tools originally created for Ludicorp s Game Neverending a web based massively multiplayer online game Flickr proved a more feasible project and ultimately Game Neverending was shelved Butterfield later launched a similar online game Glitch which was shut down on November br Early versions of Flickr focused on a chat room called FlickrLive with real time photo exchange capabilities The successive evolutions focused more on the uploading and filing back end for individual users and the chat room was buried in the site map It was eventually dropped as Flickr s back end systems evolved away from Game Neverending s codebase Key features of Flickr not initially present are tags marking photos as favorites group photo pools and interestingness for which a patent was granted br In addition to being a popular website for users to share and embed personal photographs and an online community in the service was widely used by photo researchers and by bloggers to host images that they embed in blogs and social media br Yahoo acquired Ludicorp and Flickr on March The acquisition reportedly cost between million and million During the week of June to July all content was migrated from servers in Canada to servers in the United States and all resulting data became subject to United States federal law On May Yahoo announced that Yahoo Photos would close down on September after which all photos would be deleted users were encouraged to migrate to Flickr On January Flickr announced that to continue using the service Old Skool members those who had joined before the Yahoo acquisition would be required to associate their account with a Yahoo identity by March That move was criticized by some users br Flickr upgraded its services from beta to gamma status on May the changes attracted positive attention from Lifehacker On December upload limits on free accounts were increased to MB a month from MB and were removed from Flickr Pro accounts which originally had a GB per month limit On April Flickr began allowing paid subscribers to upload videos limited to seconds in length and MB in size On March Flickr added the facility to upload and view HD videos and began allowing free users to upload normal resolution video At the same time the set limit for free accounts was lifted In Flickr announced a partnership with Getty Images in which selected users could submit photographs for stock photography usage and receive payment On June this was changed so that users could label images as suitable for stock use themselves br br On May Flickr launched the first stage of a major site redesign introducing a Justified View close spaced photo layout browsed via infinite scrolling and adding new features including one terabyte of free storage for all users a scrolling home page mainly of contacts photos and comments and updated Android app The Justified View is paginated between and photos per page but unpaginated in search result presentation Tech Radar described the new style Flickr as representing a sea change in its purpose Many users criticized the changes and the site s help forum received thousands of negative comments On March Flickr s New Photo Experience a user interface redesign left beta br On May Yahoo overhauled the site adding a revamped Camera Roll a new way to upload photos and upgraded the site s apps The new Uploadr application was made available for Macs Windows and mobile devices br In Yahoo owned by Verizon at that point sold Flickr to SmugMug br In early May SmugMug announced the migration of Flickr data involving million accounts and billions of photos and videos from the servers of former owner Yahoo to Amazon Web Services AWS in a planned hour transition to occur on May br In May Flickr announced the development of the Print Shop feature that was being tested with a list of approved sellers The Print shop feature allows photographers to sell prints via a storefront and allows purchases from consumers The feature was to allow only approved members access to it but the criteria for that were yet to be announced br br br Corporate changes br On June Flickr co founder Stewart Butterfield announced his resignation on July which followed that of his wife and co founder Caterina Fake who left the company on the same day Butterfield wrote a humorous resignation letter to Brad Garlinghouse br On December The Guardian reported that three employees had been laid off as Yahoo continued to reduce its workforce and on November CNET reported Yahoo was on the verge of a major layoff affecting to of its workforce Flickr was specifically named as a target for these layoffs br On June Verizon Communications acquired Yahoo including Flickr Verizon reorganized Yahoo along with AOL into a new umbrella company Oath which was renamed as Verizon Media on January br On April SmugMug acquired Flickr from Verizon s Oath and put an end to Flickr TB storage plan for free users Those users had until February to convert to Pro accounts or their photo streams would be reduced to a maximum of pictures The deadline was later extended to March The reasons cited were that the existing model was unsustainable by a medium sized company which could not get revenues by selling profiles of the users The sentiment was generally agreed on among the professionals This policy however was never implemented and was abandoned in March in favor of a policy that restricted content unless the user upgraded and paid for a Pro account br br br Features br br br Accounts br Flickr has always offered two types of accounts free and paid Until January free accounts had up to TB of storage On January the account offerings changed The free option is limited to photos or videos stored with videos limited to three minutes After January members over the limit could no longer upload new photos to Flickr On February a free account s older content would be deleted automatically if it contains more than photos and they do not subscribe to the paid service tier with the exception of content that was already uploaded with a Creative Commons copyright license before November br The paid option features unlimited storage advanced statistics advertising free browsing videos up to minutes in length premier customer service and promotional offers with other partners br In May Flickr added an option to easily reverse an account termination motivated by the accidental deletion of a Flickr user s account and public reporting of its protracted restoration Flickr may delete accounts without giving any reason or warning to the account s owner br As a result of the SmugMug buyout Flickr added the ability for users to download all of their account data such as photo albums contacts and comments br br br Organization br The images a photographer uploads to Flickr go into their sequential photostream the basis of a Flickr account All photostreams can be displayed as a justified view a slide show a detail view or a date stamped archive Clicking on a photostream image opens it in the interactive photopage alongside data comments and facilities for embedding images on external sites br Users may label their uploaded images with titles and descriptions and images may be tagged either by the uploader or by other users if the uploader permits it These text components enable computer searching of Flickr Flickr was an early website to implement tag clouds which were used until providing access to images tagged with the most popular keywords Tagging was further revised in the photopage redesign of March Flickr has been cited as a prime example of effective use of folksonomy br Users can organize their Flickr photos into albums formerly sets which are more flexible than the traditional folder based method of organizing files as one photo can belong to one album many albums or none at all Flickr provides code to embed albums into blogs websites and forums Flickr albums represent a form of categorical metadata rather than a physical hierarchy Geotagging can be applied to photos in albums and any albums with geotagging can be related to a map using imapflickr The resulting map can be embedded in a website Flickr albums may be organized into collections which can themselves be further organized into higher order collections br Organizr is a Web application for organizing photos within a Flickr account that can be accessed through the Flickr interface It allows users to modify tags descriptions and set groupings and to place photos on a world map a feature provided in conjunction with Yahoo Maps It uses Ajax to emulate the look feel and quick functionality of desktop based photo management applications such as Google s Picasa and F Spot Users can select and apply changes to multiple photos at a time as an alternative to the standard Flickr interface for editing br br br Access control br Flickr provides both private and public image storage A user uploading an image can set privacy controls that determine who can view the image A photo can be flagged as either public or private Private images are visible by default only to the uploader but they can also be marked as viewable by friends or family Privacy settings also can be decided by adding photographs from a user s photostream to a group pool If a group is private all the members of that group can see the photo If a group is public the photo becomes public as well Flickr also provides a contact list which can be used to control image access for a specific set of users in a way similar to that of LiveJournal In November Flickr created a guest pass system that allows private photos to be shared with non Flickr members This setting allows sets or all photos under a certain privacy category friends or family to be shared Many members allow their photos to be viewed by anyone forming a large collaborative database of categorized photos By default other members can leave comments about any image they have permission to view and in many cases can add to the list of tags associated with an image br br br Interaction and compatibility br The core functionality of the site relies on standard HTML and HTTP features allowing for wide compatibility among platforms and browsers Flickr s functionality includes RSS and Atom feeds and an API that enables independent programmers to expand its services This includes a large number of third party Greasemonkey scripts that enhance and extend the functionality of Flickr In Flickr was the second most extended site on userscripts org Organizr and most of Flickr s other text editing and tagging interfaces use Ajax with which most modern browsers are compliant Images can be posted to the user s photostream via email attachments which enables direct uploads from many smartphones and applications Flickr uses the Geo microformat on over three million geotagged images br According to the company as of August Flickr is hosted on databases across servers with about user accounts per pair of servers Based on information compiled by highscalability com as of November the MySQL databases are hosted on servers that are Linux based from Red Hat with a software platform that includes Apache PHP with PEAR and Smarty shards Memcached Squid Perl ImageMagick and Java the system administration tools include Ganglia SystemImager Subcon and CVSup br Signed in Flickr users can Follow the Photostreams of other Flickr photographers Reciprocating this process is optional A user s homepage contains a stream of their Contacts photos at screen size br Groups are another major means of interaction with fellow members of Flickr around common photography interests A Flickr Group can be started by any Flickr user who becomes its administrator and can appoint moderators Groups may either be open access or invitation only and most have an associated pool of photos The administrator of the Flickr group can monitor and set restrictions for the group assign awards to members and may curate and organize the photo content Recent uploads to a group will sometimes appear on its members homepages Group photo pools may be displayed in the Justified View or as a slideshow br Galleries of photos from other photostreams may be curated by any signed up Flickr user provided the feature is not disabled by the photo s uploader these are then publicly viewable br Any Flickr user can post comments to a Flickr photo on its photopage unless this has been disabled by the uploader and users can favorite a photo A user s favorites can be viewed in a justified or slideshow display br Users of Windows Photo Gallery Apple s iPhoto version Adobe s Lightroom Apple s Aperture version darktable and digiKam have the ability to upload their photos directly to Flickr They can also automatically update their status on other social networking services when they upload their images to Flickr Flickr provides a desktop client for Mac OS X and Windows that allows users to upload photos without using the web interface Uploadr allows drag and drop batch uploading of photos the setting of tags and descriptions for each batch and the editing of privacy settings br Flickr has entered into partnerships with many third parties Flickr had a partnership with the Picnik online photo editing application that included a reduced feature version of Picnik built into Flickr as a default photo editor On April Flickr replaced Picnik with Aviary as its default photo editor In addition to using commercial mapping data Flickr now uses OpenStreetMap mapping for various cities this began with Beijing during the run up to the Olympic games As of October this is used for Baghdad Beijing Kabul Sydney and Tokyo OpenStreetMap data is collected by volunteers and is available under the Open Database License Flickr offers printing of various forms of merchandise including business cards photo books stationery personalized credit cards and large size prints from companies such as Moo Blurb Tiny Prints Capital One Imagekind and QOOP The Flickr partnership with Getty Images to sell stock photos from users is under review as of early br br br Filtering br In March Flickr added new content filtering controls that let members specify by default what types of images they generally upload photo art illustration or screenshot and how safe i e unlikely to offend others their images are as well as specify that information for specific images individually Individual images are assigned to one of three categories safe moderate and restricted Users can specify the same criteria when searching for images There are some restrictions on searches for certain types of users non members must always use SafeSearch which omits images noted as potentially offensive while members whose Yahoo accounts indicate that they are underage may use SafeSearch or moderate SafeSearch but cannot turn SafeSearch off completely The system achieves a fairly good separation of family friendly photos and adult content generic image searches normally produce no pornographic results with the visibility of adult content restricted to users and dedicated Flickr communities who have opted into viewing it br Flickr has used this filtering system to change the level of accessibility to unsafe content for entire nations including South Korea Hong Kong and Germany In summer German users staged a revolt over being assigned the user rights of a minor See Censorship below br br br Licensing br br Flickr offers users the ability to either release their images under certain common usage licenses or label them as all rights reserved The licensing options primarily include the Creative Commons attribution based and minor content control licenses although jurisdiction and version specific licenses cannot be selected As with tags the site allows easy searching of only those images that fall under a specific license br On January Flickr launched a program called The Commons on Flickr Several international cultural institutions share images using a no known copyright restrictions through the program According to Flickr the goal of the program is to firstly show you hidden treasures in the world s public photography archives and secondly to show how your input and knowledge can help make these collections even richer Participants include the National Museum of Denmark Powerhouse Museum George Eastman Museum Library of Congress Nationaal Archief National Archives and Records Administration National Library of Scotland State Library of New South Wales and Smithsonian Institution br In May White House official photographer Pete Souza began using Flickr as a conduit for releasing White House photos The photos were initially posted with a Creative Commons Attribution license requiring that the original photographers be credited Flickr later created a new license which identified them as United States Government Work which does not carry any copyright restrictions br In March Flickr added the Creative Commons Public Domain Mark and Creative Commons Zero CC to its licensing options The Public Domain Mark is meant for images that are no longer protected by copyright CC is used for works that are still protected by copyright or neighbouring rights but where the rightsholders choose to waive all those rights br br br Reception br Flickr became an immediate success and was seen as a successful example of Web and a year later was purchased by Yahoo Initially the site was most popular with professional photographers and graphic designers as well as bloggers who used it as an image repository In Flickr was the th most popular website on the Internet according to its Alexa Rank However since then its popularity has declined relative to social media platforms with photo sharing capabilities such as Facebook and Instagram as well as cloud file storage services such as Dropbox By Flickr s Alexa Rank had declined significantly yet indicated that the website was still among the top most popular websites globally br br br Controversies br br br Censorship br On June in the wake of the rollout of localized language versions of the site Flickr implemented a user side rating system for filtering out potentially controversial photos Simultaneously users with accounts registered with Yahoo subsidiaries in Germany Singapore Hong Kong and Korea were prevented from viewing photos rated moderate or restricted on the three part scale used Many Flickr users particularly in Germany protested against the new restrictions claiming unwanted censorship from Flickr and Yahoo br Flickr management unwilling to go into legal details implied that the reason for the stringent filtering was some particularly strict age verification laws in Germany The issue received attention in the German national media especially in online publications Initial reports indicated that Flickr s action was a sensible if unattractive precaution against prosecution although later coverage implied that Flickr s action may have been unnecessarily strict On June Flickr reacted by granting German users access to moderate but not restricted images and hinted at a future solution for Germany involving advanced age verification procedures br Since June Flickr has been blocked in China in advance of the th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of br br br Copyright enforcement br Michael Arrington of TechCrunch and the Electronic Frontier Foundation have criticised Flickr for its heavy handed implementation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA and Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act OCILLA Under OCILLA a service provider such as Flickr is obliged to delete or disable access to content as soon as they receive an official notice of infringement to maintain protection from liability After having one of his own pictures taken down following an incorrect DMCA claim British comedian Dave Gorman researched the issue and concluded that if the Flickr user was not based in the United States or they were but the person filing the notice of infringement was not Flickr deleted the disputed content immediately Even if the user could successfully demonstrate that the content did not infringe upon any copyright Flickr did not according to Gorman replace the deleted content He argued that this was contrary to its obligations in responding to a counter notice Shortly afterward Flickr changed its policy br In Flickr added new theft detection tool options to certain users Some subscribers will be provided copy protection tools that can detect if their images have been used without permission the BBC reported in noting Flickr Pro subscribers will be able to monitor up to images and send automated copyright claims to people or companies that use their photos br br br Sale of Creative Commons licensed photos br In November Flickr announced that it would sell wall sized prints of photos from the service that are licensed under Creative Commons licenses allowing commercial use Although its use of the photos in this manner is legal and allowed under the licenses Flickr was criticized by users for what they perceived to be unfair exploitation of artists works as all the profits from these offerings go to Yahoo and are not shared with their respective photographers and users were not given a means of opting out from the program without placing their photos under a more restrictive non commercial license By contrast a similar opt in program for licensed photos does give photographers a share of sales On December Flickr General Manager Bernardo Hernandez announced they would pull all Creative Commons licensed images from the program and issue refunds stating that Subsequently we ll work closely with Creative Commons to come back with programs that align better with our community values br br br Deletion of files of non paying users br On November Flickr announced new restrictions for its users br br On January non paying users would only able to upload up to files free of charge br Deletion of the oldest files determined by the upload date was scheduled to begin on March until the limit of files was met The size of the individual files would not be relevant Alternatively users could upgrade to Pro subscription for US per year br On March Flickr revealed that it had not in fact deleted any photos for exceeding storage limits However it announced that it would soon implement a policy limiting the sharing of moderate or restricted content to Pro users and limiting free users to non public images Images beyond these limits would be at risk for deletion br br br See also br Image hosting service br Image sharing br List of online image archives br List of image sharing websites br List of
