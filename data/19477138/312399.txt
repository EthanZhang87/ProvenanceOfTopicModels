title: Autonomous system (Internet)
id: 312399
An autonomous system AS is a collection of connected Internet Protocol IP routing prefixes under the control of one or more network operators on behalf of a single administrative entity or domain that presents a common and clearly defined routing policy to the Internet Each AS is assigned an autonomous system number ASN for use in Border Gateway Protocol BGP routing Autonomous System Numbers are assigned to Local Internet Registries LIRs and end user organizations by their respective Regional Internet Registries RIRs which in turn receive blocks of ASNs for reassignment from the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority IANA The IANA also maintains a registry of ASNs which are reserved for private use and should therefore not be announced to the global Internet br Originally the definition required control by a single entity typically an Internet service provider ISP or a very large organization with independent connections to multiple networks that adhered to a single and clearly defined routing policy In March the newer definition came into use because multiple organizations can run BGP using private AS numbers to an ISP that connects all those organizations to the Internet Even though there may be multiple autonomous systems supported by the ISP the Internet only sees the routing policy of the ISP That ISP must have an officially registered ASN br Until AS numbers were defined as bit integers which allowed for a maximum of assignments Since then the IANA has begun to also assign bit AS numbers to regional Internet registries RIRs These numbers are written preferably as simple integers in a notation referred to as asplain ranging from to hexadecimal xFFFF FFFF Or alternatively in the form called asdot which looks like x y where x and y are bit numbers Numbers of the form y are exactly the old bit AS numbers The special bit ASN AS TRANS was assigned by IANA as a placeholder for bit ASN values for the case when bit ASN capable routers new BGP speakers send BGP messages to routers with older BGP software old BGP speakers which do not understand the new bit ASNs br The first and last ASNs of the original bit integers and and the last ASN of the bit numbers are reserved and should not be used by operators AS is used by all five RIRs to invalidate unallocated space ASNs to of the original bit range and to of the bit range are reserved for use in documentation ASNs to of the original bit AS range and to of the bit range are reserved for Private Use br The number of unique autonomous networks in the routing system of the Internet exceeded in in late in mid in late in mid and in early br The number of allocated ASNs exceeded as of March br br AS numbers are assigned in blocks by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority IANA to regional Internet registries RIRs The appropriate RIR then assigns ASNs to entities within its designated area from the block assigned by IANA Entities wishing to receive an ASN must complete the application process of their RIR LIR or upstream service provider and be approved before being assigned an ASN Current IANA ASN assignments to RIRs can be found on the IANA website RIRs as part of NRO can revoke AS numbers as part of their Internet governance abilities br There are other sources for more specific data br br APNIC https ftp apnic net stats apnic br RIPE NCC https ftp ripe net ripe stats br AFRINIC https

AS can be grouped into four categories depending on their connectivity and operating policy br br multihomed An AS that maintains connections to more than one other AS This allows the AS to remain connected to the Internet in the event of a complete failure of one of their connections However unlike a transit AS this type of AS would not allow traffic from one AS to pass through on its way to another AS br stub An AS that is connected to only one other AS This may be an apparent waste of an AS number if the network s routing policy is the same as its upstream AS s However the stub AS may have peering with other autonomous systems that is not reflected in public route view servers Specific examples include private interconnections in the financial and transportation sectors br transit An AS that acts as a router between two ASes is called a transit Since not all ASes are directly connected with every other AS a transit AS carries data traffic between one AS to another AS to which it has links br Internet Exchange Point IX or IXP A physical infrastructure through which ISPs or content delivery networks CDNs exchange Internet traffic between their networks autonomous systems These are often groups of local ISPs that band together to exchange data by splitting the costs of a local networking hub avoiding the higher costs and bandwidth charges of a Transit AS IXP ASNs are usually transparent By having presence in an IXP ASes shorten the transit path to other participating ASes thereby reducing network latency and improving round trip delay br br Autonomous systems can be included in one or more AS SETs for example AS SET of RIPE NCC AS has AS AS and AS as its members but AS is also included in other sets in ARIN AS INCAPSULA and APNIC AS IMCL Another AS SET sources can be RADB LEVEL tier network now called Lumen Technologies and also ARIN has ARIN NONAUTH source of AS SETs AS SETs are created by network operators in an Internet Routing Registry IRR like other route objects and can be included in other AS SETs and even form cycles br AS SET names usually start with AS but can also have a hierarchical name For example the administrator of AS may create an AS SET called AS AS UPSTREAMS to avoid conflict with other similarly named AS SETs br AS SETs are often used to simplify management of published routing policies A routing policy is published in the IRR using import and export or the newer mp import and mp export attributes which each contain the source or destination AS number and the AS number imported or exported Instead of single AS numbers AS SETs can be referenced in these attributes which simplifies management of complex routing policies br br Administrative distance br INOC DBA a hotline communications system between the network
