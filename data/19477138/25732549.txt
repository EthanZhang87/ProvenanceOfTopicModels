MACOM Technology Solutions Inc is a developer and producer of radio microwave and millimeter wave semiconductor devices and components The company is headquartered in Lowell Massachusetts and in was Lowell s largest private employer MACOM is certified to the ISO international quality standard and ISO environmental standard The company has design centers and sales offices in North America Europe Asia and Australia br br br History br br br Early history br MACOM was founded in the s as Microwave Associates by the engineers Vessarios Chigas Louis Roberts Hugh Wainwright and Richard M Walker The company was initially a small supplier of magnetrons to the U S Army Signal Corps The name was changed to M A COM in to reflect the company s growing involvement in the telecommunication industry and the merger with DCC Digital Communications Corporation During this timeframe the company produced low power wideband RF amplifier modules for use in test measurement In May MACOM acquired Ohio Scientific In the s MACOM was acquired by AMP Inc which was in turn acquired by Tyco Electronics br br br br In Tyco acquired Com Net Ericsson and placed the company under the administration of MACOM as part of the deal the company acquired the EDACS radio systems team and products and merged them with its own OpenSky resources The deal also allowed MACOM to become the second largest two way radio communications manufacturer in the United States The combined company subsequently developed a P radio offering and has grown its critical communications systems business to be a large player in the modern wireless two way communications market In June XMA Corporation located in Manchester New Hampshire purchased from MACOM the Omni Spectra line of coaxial attenuators and terminations br On May Tyco Electronics announced that it would sell its RF Components and Subsystem Business to Cobham plc for million Tyco Electronics retained the wireless communications part of MACOM but renamed it Tyco Electronics Wireless Systems On September Tyco Electronics and Cobham announced the completion of the sale of Tyco Electronics M A COM Radio Frequency Components and Subsystems business to Cobham plc

semiconductor products MACOM has Design and Operational centers worldwide including in the United States two in Ireland and one in Australia Japan and Taiwan MACOM produces an array of chip technologies including gallium arsenide GaAs gallium nitride GaN silicon photonics SiPh aluminum gallium arsenide AlGaAs indium phosphide InP silicon Si heterolithic microwave integrated circuit HMIC and silicon germanium SiGe The company s acquisition of BinOptics in allows them to use self aligning etched facet technology to ensure an efficient manufacturing and testing process Much of MACOM s current sub microwave RF product line are generic substitutes for the Motorola SPS MRF series Beryllium Oxide devices produced in the mid s rebranded with revised device datasheets br br br Markets br MACOM creates semiconductors for a variety of industries while the company does provide some semiconductors for consumer electronics its products are primarily used in commercial and industrial applications In the aerospace and defense industries MACOM supplies contractors like Northrop Grumman with components that are designed to be integrated into surveillance devices such as radar MACOM components are also used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA and the Federal Aviation Administration br The company s networking and communications products are used in satellite applications and they re consumed by clients like Cisco for wired and wireless networking applications MACOM also creates high speed optical networking components in high margin specialized spaces such as data centers long haul communications and metro core networks br MACOM received a Technology Engineering Emmy Award for its development of technology that enables high density video switching and routing solutions in The technology is important in broadcast video infrastructure br The company also provides power transistors to clients in a variety of industries For instance their MOSFET product line has been used in medical instruments such as MRI systems and CAT scanners and automotive ignition systems br br br Litigation br On January the State of New York terminated its contract with Tyco Electronics Wireless Systems often referred to as M A COM due to ongoing and unresolved deficiencies with the OpenSky system br On February Tyco Electronics filed a complaint against the New York State Office for Technology NY OFT in the New York State Court of Claims disputing the claims made by the OFT In the complaint Tyco Electronics disputed many of the NY OFT s public criticisms of both the company and the system maintaining that SWN which included OpenSky worked as contracted The complaint also claimed the state hindered the company s ability to build the system in a timely manner defamed the company by stating that its technology did not work and that the state inappropriately drew million from the standby letter of credit the company established for the project br In June a Judge ruled that Laird Technologies Inc was no longer allowed to supply Ford Motor Company with GPS Modules after MACOM sued for patent infringement br In April MACOM filed a suit against the German technology company Infineon Technologies after alleging that the Infineon was in breach of contract covenant of good faith and fair dealing and interference with contract br br
