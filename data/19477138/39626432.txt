Edward Joseph Snowden born June is a former American NSA intelligence contractor and a whistleblower who leaked classified documents revealing the existence of global surveillance programs He became a naturalized Russian citizen in br In while working as a government contractor Snowden leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency NSA He is currently under indictment for espionage His disclosures revealed numerous global surveillance programs many run by the NSA and the Five Eyes intelligence alliance with the cooperation of telecommunication companies and European governments and prompted a cultural discussion about national security and individual privacy br In Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor Booz Allen Hamilton after previous employment with Dell and the CIA Snowden says he gradually became disillusioned with the programs with which he was involved and that he tried to raise his ethical concerns through internal channels but was ignored On May Snowden flew to Hong Kong after taking medical leave from his job at an NSA facility in Hawaii and in early June he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald Laura Poitras Barton Gellman and Ewen MacAskill Snowden came to international attention after stories based on the material appeared in The Guardian The Washington Post and other publications br On June the United States Department of Justice unsealed charges against Snowden of two counts of violating the Espionage Act of and theft of government property following which the Department of State revoked his passport Two days later he flew into Moscow s Sheremetyevo International Airport where Russian authorities observed the canceled passport and he was restricted to the airport terminal for over one month Russia later granted Snowden the right of asylum with an initial visa for residence for one year which was subsequently repeatedly extended In October he was granted permanent residency in Russia In September Snowden was granted Russian citizenship by President Vladimir Putin br A subject of controversy Snowden has been variously praised and condemned for his leaks Snowden has defended his actions as an effort to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them His disclosures have fueled debates over mass surveillance government secrecy and the balance between national security and information privacy something that he has said he intended to do in retrospective interviews br In early Snowden became the president of the Freedom of the Press Foundation a San Francisco based nonprofit organization that aims to protect journalists from hacking and government surveillance He also has a job at an unnamed Russian IT company In he married Lindsay Mills I have to lay my head down in Moscow on a pillow at night he told an Israeli audience in November but I live on the internet and every other city in the world On September his memoir Permanent Record was published On September a U S federal court ruled in United States v Moalin that the U S intelligence s mass surveillance program exposed by Snowden was illegal and possibly unconstitutional br br br Personal life br Edward Joseph Snowden was born on June in Elizabeth City North Carolina Snowden s father Lonnie was a warrant officer in the U S Coast Guard and his mother Elizabeth was a clerk at the U S District Court for the District of Maryland His older sister Jessica was a lawyer at the Federal Judicial Center in Washington D C His maternal grandfather Edward J Barrett a rear admiral in the Coast Guard became a senior official with the FBI and was at the Pentagon in during the September attacks Edward Snowden said that he had expected to work for the federal government as had the rest of his family His parents divorced in and his father remarried br In the early s while still in grade school Snowden moved with his family to the area of Fort Meade Maryland Mononucleosis caused him to miss high school for almost nine months Rather than returning to school he claims to have passed the GED test He took classes at Anne Arundel Community College Although Snowden had no undergraduate college degree he worked online toward a master s degree at the University of Liverpool England in He was interested in Japanese popular culture had studied the Japanese language and worked for an anime company that had a resident office in the U S He also said he had a basic understanding of Mandarin Chinese and was deeply interested in martial arts At age he listed his religion as Buddhism after working at a U S military base in Japan br In September as part of interviews relating to the release of his memoir Permanent Record Snowden revealed to The Guardian that he married Lindsay Mills in a courthouse in Moscow The couple s first son was born in December and their second son was born sometime before September br br br Career br Feeling a duty to fight in the Iraq War Snowden enlisted in the United States Army on May and became a Special Forces candidate through its X enlistment option He did not complete the training due to shin splints and was given an administrative discharge on September br Snowden was then employed for less than a year in as a security guard at the University of Maryland s Center for Advanced Study of Language a research center sponsored by the National Security Agency NSA According to the University this is not a classified facility though it is heavily guarded In June Snowden told Wired that his job as a security guard required a high level security clearance for which he passed a polygraph exam and underwent a stringent background investigation br br br Employment at the CIA br After attending a job fair focused on intelligence agencies Snowden accepted an offer for a position at the CIA The Agency assigned him to the global communications division at CIA headquarters in Langley Virginia br In May Snowden wrote in Ars Technica that he had no trouble getting work because he was a computer wizard Snowden was sent to the CIA s secret school for technology specialists where he lived in a hotel for six months while studying and training full time br In March the CIA stationed Snowden with diplomatic cover in Geneva Switzerland where he was responsible for maintaining computer network security Assigned to the U S Permanent Mission to the United Nations a diplomatic mission representing U S interests before the UN and other international organizations Snowden received a diplomatic passport and a four bedroom apartment near Lake Geneva br According to Greenwald while there Snowden said he was considered the top technical and cybersecurity expert in that country and was hand picked by the CIA to support the president at the NATO summit in Romania A report from the US House of Representatives Select Committee on Intelligence said that Snowden s official position at CIA was an entry level technical services officer br Snowden described his CIA experience in Geneva as formative stating that the CIA deliberately got a Swiss banker drunk and encouraged him to drive home Snowden said that when the latter was arrested for drunk driving a CIA operative offered to help in exchange for the banker becoming an informant Ueli Maurer President of the Swiss Confederation for the year publicly disputed Snowden s claims in June of that year This would mean that the CIA successfully bribed the Geneva police and judiciary With all due respect I just can t imagine it said Maurer In February following six counseling sessions from his supervisors regarding poor performance Snowden resigned from the CIA br br br NSA sub contractor as an employee at Dell br In Snowden began work as a contractor for Dell which manages computer systems for multiple government agencies Assigned to an NSA facility at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo Snowden instructed top officials and military officers on how to defend their networks from Chinese hackers Snowden looked into mass surveillance in China which prompted him to investigate and then expose Washington s mass surveillance program after he was asked in to brief a conference in Tokyo br During his four years with Dell he rose from supervising NSA computer system upgrades to working as what his r sum termed a cyber strategist and an expert in cyber counterintelligence at several U S locations In he had a brief stint in New Delhi India where he enrolled himself in a local IT institute to learn core Java programming and advanced ethical hacking br In he returned to Maryland where he spent a year as system administrator and pre sales technical engineer on Dell s CIA account In that capacity he was consulted by the chiefs of the CIA s technical branches including the agency s chief information officer and its chief technology officer U S officials and other sources familiar with the investigation said Snowden began downloading documents describing the government s electronic spying programs while working for Dell in April Investigators estimated that of the to documents Snowden gave to Greenwald and Poitras most were copied by Snowden while working at Dell br In March Dell reassigned Snowden to Hawaii as lead technologist for the NSA s information sharing office br br br NSA sub contractor as an employee at Booz Allen Hamilton br On March three days after what he later called his breaking point of seeing the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper directly lie under oath to Congress Snowden quit his job at Dell Although he has said his career high annual salary was Snowden said he took a pay cut to work at consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton where he sought employment in order to gather data and then release details of the NSA s worldwide surveillance activity br At the time of his departure from the U S in May he had been employed for months inside the NSA s Hawaii regional operations center which focuses on the electronic monitoring of China and North Korea first for Dell and then for two months with Booz Allen Hamilton While intelligence officials have described his position there as a system administrator Snowden has said he was an infrastructure analyst which meant that his job was to look for new ways to break into Internet and telephone traffic around the world An anonymous source told Reuters that while in Hawaii Snowden may have persuaded co workers to give him their login credentials by telling them he needed them to do his job The NSA sent a memo to Congress saying that Snowden had tricked a fellow employee into sharing his personal private key to gain greater access to the NSA s computer system Snowden disputed the memo saying in January I never stole any passwords nor did I trick an army of co workers Booz Allen terminated Snowden s employment on June the day after he went public with his story and weeks after he had left Hawaii on a leave of absence br The former colleague said Snowden was given full administrator privileges with virtually unlimited access to NSA data Snowden was offered a position on the NSA s elite team of hackers Tailored Access Operations but turned it down to join Booz Allen An anonymous source later said that Booz Allen s hiring screeners found possible discrepancies in Snowden s r sum but still decided to hire him Snowden s r sum stated that he attended computer related classes at Johns Hopkins University A spokeswoman for Johns Hopkins said that the university did not find records to show that Snowden attended the university and suggested that he may instead have attended Advanced Career Technologies a private for profit organization that operated as the Computer Career Institute at Johns Hopkins University The University of Maryland University College acknowledged that Snowden had attended a summer session at a UM campus in Asia Snowden s r sum stated that he estimated he would receive a University of Liverpool computer security master s degree in The university said that Snowden registered for an online master s degree program in computer security in but was inactive as a student and had not completed the program br In his May interview with NBC News Snowden accused the U S government of trying to use one position here or there in his career to distract from the totality of his experience downplaying him as a low level analyst In his words he was trained as a spy in the traditional sense of the word in that I lived and worked undercover overseas pretending to work in a job that I m not and even being assigned a name that was not mine He said he d worked for the NSA undercover overseas and for the DIA had developed sources and methods to keep information and people secure in the most hostile and dangerous environments around the world So when they say I m a low level systems administrator that I don t know what I m talking about I d say it s somewhat misleading In a June interview with Globo TV Snowden reiterated that he was actually functioning at a very senior level In a July interview with The Guardian Snowden explained that during his NSA career I began to move from merely overseeing these systems to actively directing their use Many people don t understand that I was actually an analyst and I designated individuals and groups for targeting Snowden subsequently told Wired that while at Dell in I would sit down with the CIO of the CIA the CTO of the CIA the chiefs of all the technical branches They would tell me their hardest technology problems and it was my job to come up with a way to fix them br br During his time as an NSA analyst directing the work of others Snowden recalled a moment when he and his colleagues began to have severe ethical doubts Snowden said to year old analysts were suddenly thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility where they now have access to all your private records In the course of their daily work they stumble across something that is completely unrelated in any sort of necessary sense for example an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation But they re extremely attractive So what do they do They turn around in their chair and they show a co worker and sooner or later this person s whole life has been seen by all of these other people Snowden observed that this behavior happened routinely every two months but was never reported being considered one of the fringe benefits of the work br br br Whistleblower status br Snowden has described himself as a whistleblower a description used by many sources including CNBC The New Yorker Reuters and The Guardian among others The term has both informal and legal meanings br Snowden said that he had told multiple employees and two supervisors about his concerns but the NSA disputes his claim Snowden elaborated in January saying I made tremendous efforts to report these programs to co workers supervisors and anyone with the proper clearance who would listen The reactions of those I told about the scale of the constitutional violations ranged from deeply concerned to appalled but no one was willing to risk their jobs families and possibly even freedom to go to sic through what Thomas Andrews Drake did In March during testimony to the European Parliament Snowden wrote that before revealing classified information he had reported clearly problematic programs to ten officials who he said did nothing in response In a May interview Snowden told NBC News that after bringing his concerns about the legality of the NSA spying programs to officials he was told to stay silent on the matter He said that the NSA had copies of emails he sent to their Office of General Counsel oversight and compliance personnel broaching concerns about the NSA s interpretations of its legal authorities I had raised these complaints not just officially in writing through email but to my supervisors to my colleagues in more than one office br In May U S officials released a single email that Snowden had written in April inquiring about legal authorities but said that they had found no other evidence that Snowden had expressed his concerns to someone in an oversight position In June the NSA said it had not been able to find any records of Snowden raising internal complaints about the agency s operations That same month Snowden explained that he had not produced the communiqu s in question because of the ongoing nature of the dispute disclosing for the first time that I am working with the NSA in regard to these records and we re going back and forth so I don t want to reveal everything that will come out br Self description as a whistleblower and attribution as such in news reports does not determine whether he qualifies as a whistleblower within the meaning of the Whistleblower Protection Act of USC b Pub Law However Snowden s potential status as a whistleblower under the Act is not directly addressed in the criminal complaint against him in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia see below Case No CR MH These and similar and related issues are discussed in an essay by David Pozen in a chapter of the book Whistleblowing Nation published in March an adaptation of which also appeared on Lawfare Blog in March The unclassified portion of a September report by the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence HPSCI initiated by the chairman and Ranking Member in August and posted on the website of the Federation of American Scientists concluded that Snowden was not a whistleblower in the sense required by the Whistleblower Protection Act The bulk of the report is classified br br br Surveillance disclosures br br br Size and scope of disclosures br The exact size of Snowden s disclosure is unknown but Australian officials have estimated or more Australian intelligence files and British officials estimate at least British intelligence files were included NSA Director Keith Alexander initially estimated that Snowden had copied anywhere from to NSA documents Later estimates provided by U S officials were in the order of million a number that originally came from Department of Defense talking points In July The Washington Post reported on a cache previously provided by Snowden from domestic NSA operations consisting of roughly intercepted e mail and instant message conversations some of them hundreds of pages long and documents taken from more than online accounts A DIA report declassified in June said that Snowden took Department of Defense files more than he downloaded from the NSA br br br Potential impact on U S national security br In March Army General Martin Dempsey Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told the House Armed Services Committee The vast majority of the documents that Snowden exfiltrated from our highest levels of security had nothing to do with exposing government oversight of domestic activities The vast majority of those were related to our military capabilities operations tactics techniques and procedures When asked in a May interview to quantify the number of documents Snowden stole retired NSA director Keith Alexander said there was no accurate way of counting what he took but Snowden may have downloaded more than a million documents The September HPSCI report estimated the number of downloaded documents at million br br In a Associated Press interview Glenn Greenwald stated In order to take documents with him that proved that what he was saying was true he had to take ones that included very sensitive detailed blueprints of how the NSA does what they do Thus the Snowden documents allegedly contained sensitive NSA blueprints detailing how the NSA operates which would allow someone who read them to evade or even duplicate NSA surveillance Further a New York Times article reported that the Islamic State group had studied Snowden s revelations about how the United States gathered information on militants As a result the group s top leaders used couriers or encrypted channels to avoid being tracked or monitored by Western analysts br According to Snowden he did not indiscriminately turn over documents to journalists stating that I carefully evaluated every single document I disclosed to ensure that each was legitimately in the public interest There are all sorts of documents that would have made a big impact that I didn t turn over and that I have to screen everything before releasing it to journalists If I have time to go through this information I would like to make it available to journalists in each country Despite these measures the improper redaction of a document by The New York Times resulted in the exposure of intelligence activity against al Qaeda br In June the NSA s recently installed director U S Navy Admiral Michael S Rogers said that while some terrorist groups had altered their communications to avoid surveillance techniques revealed by Snowden the damage done was not significant enough to conclude that the sky is falling Nevertheless in February Rogers said that Snowden s disclosures had a material impact on the NSA s detection and evaluation of terrorist activities worldwide br On June the London Sunday Times reported that Russian and Chinese intelligence services had decrypted more than million classified files in the Snowden cache forcing the UK s MI intelligence agency to move agents out of live operations in hostile countries Sir David Omand a former director of the UK s GCHQ intelligence gathering agency described it as a huge strategic setback that was harming Britain America and their NATO allies The Sunday Times said it was not clear whether Russia and China stole Snowden s data or whether Snowden voluntarily handed it over to remain at liberty in Hong Kong and Moscow In April the Henry Jackson Society a British neoconservative think tank published a report claiming that Snowden s intelligence leaks negatively impacted Britain s ability to fight terrorism and organized crime Gus Hosein executive director of Privacy International criticized the report for in his opinion presuming that the public became concerned about privacy only after Snowden s disclosures br br br Release of NSA documents br Snowden s decision to leak NSA documents developed gradually following his March posting as a technician to the Geneva CIA station Snowden later made contact with Glenn Greenwald a journalist working at The Guardian He contacted Greenwald anonymously as Cincinnatus and said he had sensitive documents that he would like to share Greenwald found the measures that the source asked him to take to secure their communications such as encrypting email too annoying to employ Snowden then contacted documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras in January According to Poitras Snowden chose to contact her after seeing her New York Times article about NSA whistleblower William Binney What originally attracted Snowden to Greenwald and Poitras was a Salon article written by Greenwald detailing how Poitras s controversial films had made her a target of the government br Greenwald began working with Snowden in either February or April after Poitras asked Greenwald to meet her in New York City at which point Snowden began providing documents to them Barton Gellman writing for The Washington Post says his first direct contact was on May According to Gellman Snowden approached Greenwald after the Post declined to guarantee publication within hours of all PowerPoint slides that Snowden had leaked exposing the PRISM electronic data mining program and to publish online an encrypted code allowing Snowden to later prove that he was the source br Snowden communicated using encrypted email and going by the codename Verax He asked not to be quoted at length for fear of identification by stylometry br According to Gellman before their first meeting in person Snowden wrote I understand that I will be made to suffer for my actions and that the return of this information to the public marks my end Snowden also told Gellman that until the articles were published the journalists working with him would also be at mortal risk from the United States Intelligence Community if they think you are the single point of failure that could stop this disclosure and make them the sole owner of this information br In May Snowden was permitted temporary leave from his position at the NSA in Hawaii on the pretext of receiving treatment for his epilepsy In mid May Snowden gave an electronic interview to Poitras and Jacob Appelbaum which was published weeks later by Der Spiegel br After disclosing the copied documents Snowden promised that nothing would stop subsequent disclosures In June he said All I can say right now is the US government is not going to be able to cover this up by jailing or murdering me Truth is coming and it cannot be stopped br br br Publication br On May Snowden flew to Hong Kong where he was staying when the initial articles based on the leaked documents were published beginning with The Guardian on June Greenwald later said Snowden disclosed to documents br Within months documents had been obtained and published by media outlets worldwide most notably The Guardian Britain Der Spiegel Germany The Washington Post and The New York Times U S O Globo Brazil Le Monde France and similar outlets in Sweden Canada Italy Netherlands Norway Spain and Australia In NBC broke its first story based on the leaked documents In February for reporting based on Snowden s leaks journalists Glenn Greenwald Laura Poitras Barton Gellman and The Guardian s Ewen MacAskill were honored as co recipients of the George Polk Award which they dedicated to Snowden The NSA reporting by these journalists also earned The Guardian and The Washington Post the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for exposing the widespread surveillance and for helping to spark a huge public debate about the extent of the government s spying The Guardian s chief editor Alan Rusbridger credited Snowden for having performed a public service br br br Revelations br br The ongoing publication of leaked documents has revealed previously unknown details of a global surveillance apparatus run by the NSA in close cooperation with three of its four Five Eyes partners Australia s ASD the UK s GCHQ and Canada s CSEC br br On June media reports documenting the existence and functions of classified surveillance programs and their scope began and continued throughout the entire year The first program to be revealed was PRISM which allows for direct access to data on the servers of Microsoft Yahoo Google Facebook PalTalk AOL Skype YouTube and Apple Barton Gellman of The Washington Post was the first journalist to report on Snowden s documents He said the U S government urged him not to specify by name which companies were involved but Gellman decided that to name them would make it real to Americans Reports also revealed details of Tempora a secret British surveillance program run by the NSA s British partner GCHQ The initial reports included details about NSA call database Boundless Informant and a secret court order requiring Verizon to hand the NSA millions of Americans phone records daily as well as the surveillance of phone and Internet records of French citizens with specific targets of French people either suspected of association with terrorist activities or in the worlds of business politics or French state administration XKeyscore an analytical tool that allows for collection of almost anything done on the internet was described by The Guardian as a program that shed light on one of Snowden s most controversial statements I sitting at my desk could wiretap anyone from you or your accountant to a federal judge or even the president if I had a personal email br The NSA s top secret black budget obtained from Snowden by The Washington Post exposed the successes and failures of the spy agencies comprising the U S intelligence community and revealed that the NSA was paying U S private tech companies for clandestine access to their communications networks The agencies were allotted billion for the fiscal year br It was revealed that the NSA was harvesting millions of email and instant messaging contact lists searching email content tracking and mapping the location of cell phones undermining attempts at encryption via Bullrun and that the agency was using cookies to piggyback on the same tools used by Internet advertisers to pinpoint targets for government hacking and to bolster surveillance The NSA was shown to be secretly accessing Yahoo and Google data centers to collect information from hundreds of millions of account holders worldwide by tapping undersea cables using the MUSCULAR surveillance program br The NSA the CIA and GCHQ spied on users of Second Life Xbox Live and World of Warcraft and attempted to recruit would be informants from the sites according to documents revealed in December Leaked documents showed NSA agents also spied on their own love interests a practice NSA employees termed LOVEINT The NSA was shown to be tracking the online sexual activity of people they termed radicalizers in order to discredit them Following the revelation of Blackpearl a program targeting private networks the NSA was accused of extending beyond its primary mission of national security The agency s intelligence gathering operations had targeted among others oil giant Petrobras Brazil s largest company The NSA and the GCHQ were also shown to be surveilling charities including UNICEF and M decins du Monde as well as allies such as European Commissioner Joaqu n Almunia and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu br In October Glenn Greenwald said the most shocking and significant stories are the ones we are still working on and have yet to publish In November The Guardian s editor in chief Alan Rusbridger said that only one percent of the documents had been published In December Australia s Minister for Defence David Johnston said his government assumed the worst was yet to come br By October Snowden s disclosures had created tensions between the U S and some of its close allies after they revealed that the U S had spied on Brazil France Mexico Britain China Germany and Spain as well as world leaders most notably German Chancellor Angela Merkel who said spying among friends was unacceptable and compared the NSA with the Stasi Leaked documents published by Der Spiegel in appeared to show that the NSA had targeted high ranking leaders br An NSA mission statement titled SIGINT Strategy affirmed that the NSA had plans for the continued expansion of surveillance activities Their stated goal was to dramatically increase mastery of the global network and to acquire adversaries data from anyone anytime anywhere Leaked slides revealed in Greenwald s book No Place to Hide released in May showed that the NSA s stated objective was to Collect it All Process it All Exploit it All Partner it All Sniff it All and Know it All br Snowden said in a January interview with German television that the NSA does not limit its data collection to national security issues accusing the agency of conducting industrial espionage Using the example of German company Siemens he said If there s information at Siemens that s beneficial to US national interests even if it doesn t have anything to do with national security then they ll take that information nevertheless In the wake of Snowden s revelations and in response to an inquiry from the Left Party Germany s domestic security agency Bundesamt f r Verfassungsschutz BfV investigated and found no concrete evidence that the U S conducted economic or industrial espionage in Germany br In February during testimony to the European Union Snowden said of the remaining undisclosed programs I will leave the public interest determinations as to which of these may be safely disclosed to responsible journalists in coordination with government stakeholders br In March documents disclosed by Glenn Greenwald writing for The Intercept showed the NSA in cooperation with the GCHQ has plans to infect millions of computers with malware using a program called TURBINE Revelations included information about QUANTUMHAND a program through which the NSA set up a fake Facebook server to intercept connections br According to a report in The Washington Post in July relying on information furnished by Snowden of those placed under surveillance in the U S are ordinary Americans and are not the intended targets The newspaper said it had examined documents including emails message texts and online accounts that support the claim br In an August interview Snowden for the first time disclosed a cyberwarfare program in the works codenamed MonsterMind that would automate the detection of a foreign cyberattack as it began and automatically fire back These attacks can be spoofed said Snowden You could have someone sitting in China for example making it appear that one of these attacks is originating in Russia And then we end up shooting back at a Russian hospital What happens next br br br Motivations br br Snowden first contemplated leaking confidential documents around but held back partly because he believed the newly elected Barack Obama might introduce reforms After the disclosures his identity was made public by The Guardian at his request on June I do not want to live in a world where everything I do and say is recorded he said My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them br Snowden said he wanted to embolden others to step forward by demonstrating that they can win He also said that the system for reporting problems did not work You have to report wrongdoing to those most responsible for it He cited a lack of whistleblower protection for government contractors the use of the Espionage Act of to prosecute leakers and the belief that had he used internal mechanisms to sound the alarm his revelations would have been buried forever br In December upon learning that a U S federal judge had ruled the collection of U S phone metadata conducted by the NSA as likely unconstitutional Snowden said I acted on my belief that the NSA s mass surveillance programs would not withstand a constitutional challenge and that the American public deserved a chance to see these issues determined by open courts today a secret program authorized by a secret court was when exposed to the light of day found to violate Americans rights br In January Snowden said his breaking point was seeing the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper directly lie under oath to Congress This referred to testimony on March three months after Snowden first sought to share thousands of NSA documents with Greenwald and nine months after the NSA says Snowden made his first illegal downloads during the summer of in which Clapper denied to the U S Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the NSA wittingly collects data on millions of Americans Snowden said There s no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who need to be able to trust it and regulate its actions Seeing that really meant for me there was no going back Beyond that it was the creeping realization that no one else was going to do this The public had a right to know about these programs In March Snowden said he had reported policy or legal issues related to spying programs to more than ten officials but as a contractor had no legal avenue to pursue further whistleblowing br br br Similarities to previous espionage incidents br br Snowden s disclosure association with foreign intelligence services and subsequent public relations campaign and flight to avoid prosecution is similar in nature to the case of Philip Agee a former CIA case officer and alleged spy for Russian and Cuban Intelligence during the s and Kim Philby a former British intelligence officer br Philip Agee was a former CIA officer who exposed CIA operations and personnel particularly in Latin America during the s after his involvement with the KGB became known to the FBI He published a book titled Inside the Company CIA Diary which revealed classified information about CIA activities and named agents Agee s actions led to controversy and condemnation from the U S government which accused him of endangering national security and the lives of intelligence operatives Richard Welch was a CIA station chief in Athens Greece whose identity was exposed in Agee s book which led to him being targeted by a Marxist terrorist group called November Welch was assassinated outside his residence in Athens in December br Kim Philby worked for MI and later became one of the most notorious double agents in history spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War Philby rose through the ranks of British intelligence and held positions of trust within MI all while secretly passing sensitive information to the Soviets His espionage activities resulted in significant damage to Western intelligence operations and led to the betrayal of numerous agents Philby s defection to the Soviet Union in after his exposure as a Soviet spy shocked the intelligence community and remains one of the most infamous cases of espionage in the th century br Philby made his denials through various means including public statements interviews and interactions with colleagues and superiors within the intelligence community He also authored articles and gave interviews to defend himself against accusations of espionage portraying himself as a loyal and dedicated intelligence officer Additionally Philby s autobiography My Silent War published in served as a platform for him to present his version of events and deny involvement in spying for the Soviet Union Despite his denials Philby s true allegiance was eventually exposed leading to his defection to the Soviet Union br Snowden Agee and Philby all engaged in flight to avoid prosecution after unauthorized disclosure of classified information and accusations of espionage Agee died in Germany after also living in Cuba Philby like Snowden fled to Russia where he died in exile br br br New Zealand br Snowden made a number of claims about the Government Communications Security Bureau GCSB of New Zealand He accused the agency of conducting surveillance on New Zealand citizens and engaging in espionage between and when John Key served as the Prime Minister of New Zealand br br br Flight from the United States br br br Hong Kong br In May Snowden quit his job telling his supervisors he required epilepsy treatment but instead fled the United States for Hong Kong on May He chose Hong Kong for its spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent at the time Snowden remained in his room at the Mira Hotel after his arrival in the city rarely going out br br Snowden vowed to challenge any extradition attempt by the U S government and engaged Hong Kong based Canadian human rights lawyer Robert Tibbo as a legal adviser Snowden told the South China Morning Post that he planned to remain in Hong Kong for as long as its government would permit Snowden also told the Post that the United States government has committed a tremendous number of crimes against Hong Kong and the PRC as well going on to identify Chinese Internet Protocol addresses that the NSA monitored and stating that the NSA collected text message data for Hong Kong residents Glenn Greenwald said Snowden was motivated by a need to ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China br After leaving the Mira Hotel Snowden was housed for two weeks in several apartments by other refugees seeking asylum in Hong Kong an arrangement set up by Tibbo to hide from the US authorities br The Russian newspaper Kommersant nevertheless reported that Snowden was living at the Russian consulate shortly before his departure from Hong Kong to Moscow Ben Wizner a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU and legal adviser to Snowden said in January Every news organization in the world has been trying to confirm that story They haven t been able to because it s false Likewise rejecting the Kommersant story was Anatoly Kucherena who became Snowden s lawyer in July when Snowden asked him for help in seeking temporary asylum in Russia Kucherena said Snowden did not communicate with Russian diplomats while he was in Hong Kong In early September however Russian president Vladimir Putin said that a few days before boarding a plane to Moscow Snowden met in Hong Kong with Russian diplomatic representatives br On June days after the publication of Snowden s NSA documents began officials revoked his U S passport On June Snowden boarded a commercial Aeroflot flight SU to Moscow accompanied by Sarah Harrison of WikiLeaks with an intended final destination of Ecuador due to an Ecuadorian emergency travel document that Snowden had acquired However Snowden became initially stranded in Russia upon his landing in Moscow when his U S passport was revoked Hong Kong authorities said that Snowden had not been detained for the U S because the request had not fully complied with Hong Kong law and there was no legal basis to prevent Snowden from leaving On June a U S State Department spokesman rejected the explanation of technical noncompliance accusing the Hong Kong government of deliberately releasing a fugitive despite a valid arrest warrant and after having sufficient time to prohibit his travel That same day Julian Assange said that WikiLeaks had paid for Snowden s lodging in Hong Kong and his flight out Assange also asked Fidel Narv ez consul at the Ecuadorian embassy in London to sign an emergency travel document for Snowden Snowden said that having the document gave him the confidence the courage to get on that plane to begin the journey br In October Snowden said that before flying to Moscow he gave all the classified documents he had obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong and kept no copies for himself In January he told a German TV interviewer that he gave all of his information to American journalists reporting on American issues During his first American TV interview in May Snowden said he had protected himself from Russian leverage by destroying the material he had been holding before landing in Moscow br In January Vanessa Rodel one of the refugees who had housed Snowden in Hong Kong and her year old daughter were granted asylum by Canada In Supun Thilina Kellapatha Nadeeka Dilrukshi Nonis and their children found refuge in Canada leaving only one of Snowden s Hong Kong helpers waiting for asylum br br br Russia br br On June Snowden landed at Moscow s Sheremetyevo Airport WikiLeaks said he was on a circuitous but safe route to asylum in Ecuador Snowden had a seat reserved to continue to Cuba but did not board that onward flight saying in a January interview that he intended to transit through Russia but was stopped en route He said a planeload of reporters documented the seat I was supposed to be in when he was ticketed for Havana but the U S canceled his passport He said the U S wanted him to stay in Moscow so they could say He s a Russian spy Greenwald s account differed on the point of Snowden being already ticketed According to Greenwald Snowden s passport was valid when he departed Hong Kong but was revoked during the hours he was in transit to Moscow preventing him from obtaining a ticket to leave Russia Greenwald said Snowden was thus forced to stay in Moscow and seek asylum br According to one Russian report Snowden planned to fly from Moscow through Havana to Latin America however Cuba told Moscow it would not allow the Aeroflot plane carrying Snowden to land The Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that Cuba had a change of heart after receiving pressure from U S officials leaving him stuck in the transit zone because at the last minute Havana told officials in Moscow not to allow him on the flight The Washington Post contrasted this version with what it called widespread speculation that Russia never intended to let Snowden proceed Fidel Castro called claims that Cuba would have blocked

official in a country or airline could order subordinates to overlook the withdrawn passport U S Secretary of State John Kerry said that Snowden s passport was canceled within two hours of the charges against Snowden being made public which was Friday June In a July statement Snowden said Although I am convicted of nothing the U S government has unilaterally revoked my passport leaving me a stateless person Without any judicial order the administration now seeks to stop me exercising a basic right A right that belongs to everybody The right to seek asylum br Four countries offered Snowden permanent asylum Ecuador Nicaragua Bolivia and Venezuela No direct flights between Moscow and Venezuela Bolivia or Nicaragua existed however and the U S pressured countries along his route to hand him over Snowden said in July that he decided to bid for asylum in Russia because he felt there was no safe way to reach Latin America Snowden said he remained in Russia because when we were talking about possibilities for asylum in Latin America the United States forced down the Bolivian president s plane citing the Morales plane incident According to Snowden the CIA has a very powerful presence in Latin America and the governments and the security services there are relatively much less capable than say Russia they could have basically snatched me On the issue he said some governments in Western European and North American states have demonstrated a willingness to act outside the law and this behavior persists today This unlawful threat makes it impossible for me to travel to Latin America and enjoy the asylum granted there in accordance with our shared rights Snowden said that he would travel from Russia if there was no interference from the U S government br Four months after Snowden received asylum in Russia Julian Assange commented While Venezuela and Ecuador could protect him in the short term over the long term there could be a change in government In

Snowden reiterated that he had originally intended to travel to Latin America A lot of people are still unaware that I never intended to end up in Russia According to Snowden the U S government waited until I departed Hong Kong to cancel my passport in order to trap me in Russia Snowden added If they really wanted to capture me they would ve allowed me to travel to Latin America because the CIA can operate with impunity down there They did not want that they chose to keep me in Russia br br br Morales plane incident br br On July president Evo Morales of Bolivia who had been attending a conference in Russia suggested during an interview with RT formerly Russia Today that he would consider a request by Snowden for asylum The following day Morales s plane en route to La Paz was rerouted to Austria and landed there after France Spain and Italy denied access to their airspace While the plane was parked in Vienna the Spanish ambassador to Austria arrived with two embassy personnel and asked to search the plane but they were denied permission by Morales himself U S officials had raised suspicions that Snowden may have been on board Morales blamed the U S for putting pressure on European countries and said that the grounding of his plane was a violation of international law br In April Bolivia s ambassador to Russia Mar a Luisa Ramos Urzagaste accused Julian Assange of inadvertently putting Morales s life at risk by intentionally providing to the U S false rumors that Snowden was on Morales s plane Assange responded that we weren t expecting this outcome The result was caused by the United States intervention We can only regret what happened br br br Asylum applications br Snowden applied for political asylum to countries A statement attributed to him contended that the U S administration and specifically then Vice President Joe Biden had pressured the governments to refuse his asylum petitions Biden had telephoned Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa days prior to Snowden s remarks asking the Ecuadorian leader not to grant Snowden asylum Ecuador had initially offered Snowden a temporary travel document but later withdrew it and Correa later called the offer a mistake br On July Snowden accused the U S government of using citizenship as a weapon and using what he described as old bad tools of political aggression Citing Obama s promise to not allow wheeling and dealing over the case Snowden commented This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile Several days later WikiLeaks announced that Snowden had applied for asylum in six additional countries but declined to name them alleging attempted U S interference br After evaluating the law and Snowden s situation the French interior ministry rejected his request for asylum Poland refused to process his application because it did not conform to legal procedure Brazil s Foreign Ministry said the government planned no

application upon learning of the conditions br In a July meeting at Sheremetyevo Airport with representatives of human rights organizations and lawyers organized in part by the Russian government Snowden said he was accepting all offers of asylum that he had already received or would receive He added that Venezuela s grant of asylum formalized his asylee status removing any basis for state interference with his right to asylum He also said he would request asylum in Russia until he resolved his travel problems Slovenian correspondent Polonca Frelih the only journalist who presented at the July meeting with Snowden and photographed him reported that he looked like someone without daylight for long time but strong enough psychologically while expressing worries about his medical condition Russian Federal Migration Service officials confirmed on July that Snowden had submitted an application for temporary asylum On July Kucherena said his client wanted to find work in Russia travel and create a life for himself and had already begun learning Russian br Amid media reports in early July attributed to U S administration sources that Obama s one on one meeting with Putin ahead of a G meeting in St Petersburg scheduled for September was in doubt due to Snowden s protracted sojourn in Russia top U S officials repeatedly made it clear to Moscow that Snowden should immediately be returned to the United States to face charges for the unauthorized leaking of classified information His Russian lawyer said Snowden needed asylum because he faced persecution by the U S government and feared that he could be subjected to torture and capital punishment br On April CNN reported that Edward Snowden had requested a three year extension of his Russian residency permit

The criminal complaint was initially secret but was unsealed a week later br br br Analysis of Criminal Complaint br Stephen P Mulligan and Jennifer K Elsea Legislative attorneys for the Congressional Research Service provide a analysis of the uses of the Espionage Act to prosecute unauthorized disclosures of classified information based on what was disclosed to whom and how the burden of proof requirements e g degrees of Mens Rea guilty mind and the relationship of such considerations to the First Amendment framework of protections of free speech are also analyzed The analysis includes the charges against Snowden among several other cases The discussion also covers gaps in the legal framework used to prosecute such cases br br br Snowden response to Criminal Complaint br Snowden was asked in a January interview about returning to the U S to face the charges in court as Obama had suggested a few days prior Snowden explained why he rejected the request What he doesn t say are that the crimes that he s charged me with are crimes that don t allow me to make my case They don t allow me to defend myself in an open court to the public and convince a jury that what I did was to their benefit So it s I would say illustrative that the president would choose to say someone should face the music when he knows the music is a show trial Snowden s legal representative Jesselyn Radack wrote that the Espionage Act effectively hinders a person from defending himself before a jury in an open court She said that the arcane World War I law was never meant to prosecute whistleblowers but rather spies who betrayed their trust by selling secrets to enemies for profit Non profit betrayals were not considered br br br Civil lawsuit br On September the United States filed a lawsuit Civil

defendants br The Hon Liam O Grady a judge in the Alexandria Division of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia found for the United States Plaintiff by summary judgment on both counts of the action The judgment also found that Snowden had been paid speaker honorariums totaling million for a series of speeches delivered by video link The effect of the ruling was that the US government can collect the proceeds from his book and speeches and means that Snowden has to relinquish more than million earned to a constructive trust created to transfer the money to the government br br br Asylum in Russia br br On June Snowden landed at Moscow s Sheremetyevo Airport aboard a commercial Aeroflot flight from Hong Kong After days in the transit section he left the airport on August and was granted temporary asylum in Russia for one year by the Federal Migration Service br Snowden had the choice to apply for renewal of his temporary refugee status for months or

arrangements locally and over the internet br Snowden s memoir Permanent Record was released internationally on September and while U S royalties were expected to be seized he was able to receive an advance of million The memoir reached the top position on Amazon s bestseller list that day Snowden said his work for the NSA and CIA showed him that the United States Intelligence Community IC had hacked the Constitution and that he had concluded there was no option for him but to expose his revelations via the press In the memoir he wrote I realized that I was crazy to have imagined that the Supreme Court or Congress or President Obama seeking to distance his administration from President George W Bush s would ever hold the IC legally responsible for anything Of Russia he said One of the things that is lost in all the problematic politics of the Russian government is the fact this is one of the most beautiful countries in the world with friendly and warm people br Snowden has also used the pseudonym John Dobbertin after cryptographer Hans Dobbertin In from Russia Snowden participated in the creation ceremony of the zcash cryptocurrency as John Dobbertin by briefly holding a

nation s secrets If any individual who objects to government policy can take it into their own hands to publicly disclose classified information then we will not be able to keep our people safe or conduct foreign policy He objected to the sensational way the leaks were reported saying the reporting often shed more heat than light He said that the disclosures had revealed methods to our adversaries that could impact our operations br During a November interview with the German broadcaster ARD and the German paper Der Spiegel then outgoing President Obama said he can t pardon Edward Snowden unless he is physically submitted to US authorities on US soil br br br Donald Trump br In Donald Trump made a series of tweets in which he referred to Snowden as a traitor saying he gave serious information to China and Russia and should be executed Later that year he added a caveat tweeting if it and he could reveal Obama s birth records I might become a major fan br In August Trump said during a press conference that he would take a look at pardoning Snowden and added that he was not that aware of the Snowden situation He stated There are many many people it seems to be a split decision that many people think that he should be somehow treated differently and other people think he did very bad things and I m going to take a very good look at it br Forbes described Trump s willingness to consider a pardon as leagues away from his views Snowden responded to the announcement saying the last time we heard a White House considering a pardon was when the very same Attorney General who once charged me conceded that on balance my work in exposing the NSA s unconstitutional system of mass surveillance had been a public service Top members of the House Armed Services Committee immediately voiced strong opposition to a pardon saying Snowden s actions resulted in tremendous harm to national security and that he needed to stand trial Liz Cheney called the idea of a pardon unconscionable A week prior to the announcement Trump also said he had been thinking of letting Snowden return to the U S without facing any time in jail br Days later Attorney General William Barr told the Associated Press he was vehemently opposed to the idea of a pardon saying Snowden was a traitor and the information he provided our adversaries greatly hurt the safety of the American people he was peddling it around like a commercial merchant We can t tolerate that br br br Public figures br Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg called Snowden s release of NSA material the most significant leak in U S history Shortly before the September release of his biographical thriller film Snowden a semi fictionalized drama based on the life of Edward Snowden with a short appearance by

whistleblower J Kirk Wiebe known for his involvement in the NSA s Trailblazer Project noted that a federal judge for the District of Columbia the Hon Richard J Leon had ruled in a contemporaneous case before him that the NSA warrantless surveillance program was likely unconstitutional Wiebe then proposed that Snowden should be granted amnesty and allowed to return to the United States br br br Government officials br Numerous high ranking current or former U S government officials reacted publicly to Snowden s disclosures br br br Director of National Intelligence James Clapper condemned

by revenge when the NSA did not offer him the job he wanted At this point said McConnell he being narcissistic and having failed at most everything he did he decides now I m going to turn on them br

of State Hillary Clinton said W e have all these protections for whistleblowers If Snowden were concerned and wanted to be part of the American debate it struck me as sort of odd that he would flee to China because Hong Kong is controlled by China and that he would then go to Russia two countries with which we have very difficult cyberrelationships As Clinton saw it turning over a lot of that material intentionally or unintentionally drained gave all kinds of information not only to big countries but to networks and terrorist groups and the like So I have a hard time thinking that somebody who is a champion of privacy and liberty has taken refuge in Russia under Putin s authority Clinton later said that if Snowden wished to return to the U S knowing he would be held accountable he would have the right to launch both a legal defense and a public defense which can of course affect the legal defense br Secretary of State John Kerry said Snowden had damaged his country very significantly and hurt operational security by telling terrorists how to evade detection The bottom line Kerry added is this man has betrayed his country sitting in Russia where he has taken refuge You know he should man up and come back to the United States br Former Vice President Al Gore said Snowden clearly violated the law so you can t say OK what he did is all right It s not But what he revealed in the course of violating important laws included violations of the U S Constitution that were way more serious than the crimes he committed In the course of violating important law he also provided an important service Because we did need to know how far this has gone br In deputy defense secretary and later defense secretary Ashton Carter said We had a cyber Pearl Harbor His name was Edward Snowden Carter charged that U S security officials screwed up spectacularly in the case of Snowden And this knucklehead had access to destructive power that was much more than any individual person

Snowden saying I m not going to be scrambling jets to get a year old hacker In August Obama rejected the suggestion that Snowden was a patriot and in November said that the benefit of the debate he generated was not worth the damage done because there was another way of doing it br In June U S Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont shared a must read news story on his blog by Ron Fournier stating Love him or hate him we all owe Snowden our thanks for forcing upon the nation an important debate But the debate shouldn t be about him It should be about the gnawing questions his actions raised from the shadows In Sanders stated that Snowden played a very important role in educating the American public and that although Snowden should not go unpunished for breaking the law that education should be taken into consideration before the sentencing br Snowden said in December that he was inspired by the global debate ignited by the leaks and that NSA s culture of indiscriminate global espionage is collapsing br At the end of The Washington Post said that the public debate and its offshoots had produced no meaningful change in policy with the status quo continuing br In on The Axe

to be likely unconstitutional br Leon s ruling was stayed pending an appeal by the government br Snowden later described Judge Leon s decision as vindication br On June the ACLU filed a lawsuit against James Clapper Director of National Intelligence alleging that the NSA s phone records program was unconstitutional In December ten days after Judge Leon s ruling Judge William H Pauley III

confusion over the constitutionality of the NSA s data collection program a kind of judicial he said she said standoff br On May in the case of ACLU v Clapper the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said that Section of the Patriot Act did not authorize the NSA to collect Americans calling records in bulk as exposed by Snowden in The decision voided U S District Judge William Pauley s December finding that the NSA program was lawful and remanded the case to him for further review The appeals court did not rule on the constitutionality of the bulk surveillance and declined to enjoin the program noting the pending expiration of relevant parts of the Patriot Act Circuit Judge Gerard E Lynch wrote that given the national security interests at stake it was prudent to give Congress an opportunity to debate and decide the matter br On September a US federal court ruled that the US intelligence s mass surveillance program exposed by Edward Snowden was illegal and possibly
