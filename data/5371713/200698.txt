title: Apache Tomcat
id: 200698
Apache Tomcat called Tomcat for short is a free and open source implementation of the Jakarta Servlet Jakarta Expression Language and WebSocket technologies It provides a pure Java HTTP web server environment in which Java code can also run Thus it is a Java web application server although not a full JEE application server br Tomcat is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the auspices of the Apache Software Foundation released under the Apache License license br br br Components br Tomcat x was released with Catalina a servlet container Coyote an HTTP connector and Jasper a JSP engine br br br Catalina br Catalina is Tomcat s servlet container Catalina implements Sun Microsystems specifications for servlet and JavaServer Pages JSP In Tomcat a Realm element represents a database of usernames passwords and roles similar to Unix groups assigned to those users Different implementations of Realm allow Catalina to be integrated into environments where such authentication information is already being created and maintained and then use that information to implement Container Managed Security as described in the Servlet Specification br br br Coyote br Coyote is a Connector component for Tomcat that supports the HTTP and protocol as a web server This allows Catalina nominally a Java Servlet or JSP container to also act as a plain web server that serves local files as HTTP documents Coyote listens for incoming connections to the server on a specific TCP port and forwards the request to the Tomcat Engine to process the request and send back a response to the requesting client Another Coyote Connector Coyote JK listens similarly but instead forwards its requests to another web server such as Apache using the JK Protocol This usually offers better performance br br br Jasper br Jasper is Tomcat s JSP Engine Jasper parses JSP files to compile them into Java code as servlets that can be handled by Catalina At runtime Jasper detects changes to JSP files and recompiles them br As of version Tomcat uses Jasper which is an implementation of the Sun Microsystems JSP specification From Jasper to Jasper important features were added br br JSP Tag library pooling Each tag markup in JSP file is handled by a tag handler class Tag handler class objects can be pooled and reused in the whole JSP servlet br Background JSP compilation While recompiling modified JSP Java code the older version is still available for server requests The older JSP servlet is deleted once the new JSP servlet has finished being recompiled br Recompile JSP when included page changes pages can be inserted and included into a JSP at runtime The JSP will not only be recompiled with JSP file changes but also with included page changes br JDT Java compiler Jasper can use the Eclipse JDT Java Development Tools Java compiler instead of Ant and javac br Three new components were added with the release of Tomcat br br br Cluster br This component has been added to manage large applications It is used for load balancing that can be achieved through many techniques Clustering support currently requires the JDK version or higher br br br High availability br A high availability feature has been added to facilitate the scheduling of system upgrades e g new releases change requests without affecting the live environment This is done by dispatching live traffic requests to a temporary server on a different port while the main server is upgraded on the main port It is very useful in handling user requests on high traffic web applications br br br Features br Tomcat x implements the Servlet and JSP Specifications br Tomcat x implements the Servlet and JSP Specifications br Tomcat x implements the Servlet and JSP Specifications br br br History br Tomcat started off as a servlet reference implementation by James Duncan Davidson a software architect at Sun Microsystems He later helped make the project open source and played a key role in its donation by Sun Microsystems to the Apache Software Foundation The Apache Ant software build automation tool was developed as a side effect of the creation of Tomcat as an open source project br Davidson had initially hoped that the project would become open sourced and since many open source projects had O Reilly books associated with them featuring an animal on the cover he wanted to name the project after an animal He came up with Tomcat since he reasoned the animal represented something that could fend for itself Although the tomcat was already in use for another O Reilly title his wish to see an animal cover eventually came true when O Reilly published their Tomcat book with a snow leopard on the cover in br br br Releases br br br Apache TomEE br Apache TomEE pronounced Tommy is the Enterprise Edition of Apache Tomcat Tomcat Java Jakarta EE TomEE that combines several Java enterprise projects including Apache OpenEJB Apache OpenWebBeans Apache OpenJPA Apache MyFaces and others In October the project obtained certification by Oracle Corporation as a compatible implementation of the Java EE Web Profile br br br See also br br WildFly formerly known as JBoss Application
