title: Comma-separated values
id: 501906
Comma separated values CSV is a text file format that uses commas to separate values and newlines to separate records A CSV file stores tabular data numbers and text in plain text where each line of the file typically represents one data record Each record consists of the same number of fields and these are separated by commas in the CSV file If the field delimiter itself may appear within a field fields can be surrounded with quotation marks br The CSV file format is one type of delimiter separated file format Delimiters frequently used include the comma tab space and semicolon Delimiter separated files are often given a csv extension even when the field separator is not a comma Many applications or libraries that consume or produce CSV files have options to specify an alternative delimiter br The lack of adherence to the CSV standard RFC necessitates the support for a variety of CSV formats in data input software Despite this drawback CSV remains widespread in data applications and is widely supported by a variety of software including common spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel Benefits cited in favor of CSV include human readability and the simplicity of the format br br br Applications br CSV is a common data exchange format that is widely supported by consumer business and scientific applications Among its most common uses is moving tabular data between programs that natively operate on incompatible often proprietary or undocumented formats For example a user may need to transfer information from a database program that stores data in a proprietary format to a spreadsheet that uses a completely different format Most database programs can export data as CSV Most spreadsheet programs can read CSV data allowing CSV to be used as an intermediate format when transferring data from a database to a spreadsheet br CSV is also used for storing data Common data science tools such as Pandas include the option to export data to CSV for long term storage Benefits of CSV for data storage include the simplicity of CSV makes parsing and creating CSV files easy to implement and fast compared to other data formats human readability making editing or fixing data simpler and high compressibility leading to smaller data files Alternatively CSV does not support more complex data relations and makes no distinction between null and empty values and in applications where these features are needed other formats are preferred br br br Specification br RFC proposes a specification for the CSV format however actual practice often does not follow the RFC and the term CSV might refer to any file that br br is plain text using a character encoding such as ASCII various Unicode character encodings e g UTF EBCDIC or Shift JIS br consists of records typically one record per line br with the records divided into fields separated by delimiters typically a single reserved character such as comma semicolon or tab sometimes the delimiter may include optional spaces br where every record has the same sequence of fields br Within these general constraints many variations are in use Therefore without additional information such as whether RFC is honored a file claimed simply to be in CSV format is not fully specified As a result some applications supporting CSV files have text import wizards that allow users to preview the first few lines of the file and then specify the delimiter character s quoting rules and field trimming br br br History br Comma separated values is a data format that predates personal computers by more than a decade the IBM Fortran level H extended compiler under OS supported CSV in List directed free form input output was defined in FORTRAN approved in List directed input used commas or spaces for delimiters so unquoted character strings could not contain commas or spaces br The term comma separated value and the CSV abbreviation were in use by The manual for the Osborne Executive computer which bundled the SuperCalc spreadsheet documents the CSV quoting convention that allows strings to contain embedded commas but the manual does not specify a convention for embedding quotation marks within quoted strings br Comma separated value lists are easier to type for example into punched cards than fixed column aligned data and they were less prone to producing incorrect results if a value was punched one column off from its intended location br Comma separated files are used for the interchange of database information between machines of two different architectures The plain text character of CSV files largely avoids incompatibilities such as byte order and word size The files are largely human readable so it is easier to deal with them in the absence of perfect documentation or communication br The main standardization initiative transforming de facto fuzzy definition into a more precise and de jure one was in with RFC defining CSV as a MIME Content Type Later in some of RFC s deficiencies were tackled by a W C recommendation br In IETF published RFC describing the application of URI fragments to CSV documents RFC specifies how row column and cell ranges can be selected from a CSV document using position indexes br In W C in an attempt to enhance CSV with formal semantics publicized the first drafts of recommendations for CSV metadata standards which began as recommendations in December of the same year br br br General functionality br CSV formats are best used to represent sets or sequences of records in which each record has an identical list of fields This corresponds to a single relation in a relational database or to data though not calculations in a typical spreadsheet br The format dates back to the early days of business computing and is widely used to pass data between computers with different internal word sizes data formatting needs and so forth For this reason CSV files are common on all computer platforms br CSV is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values many implementations of CSV import export tools allow other separators to be used for example the use of a Sep row as the first row in the csv file will cause Excel to open the file expecting caret to be the separator instead of comma Simple CSV implementations may prohibit field values that contain a comma or other special characters such as newlines More sophisticated CSV implementations permit them often by requiring double quote characters around values that contain reserved characters such as commas double quotes or less commonly newlines Embedded double quote characters may then be represented by a pair of consecutive double quotes or by prefixing a double quote with an escape character such as a backslash for example in Sybase Central br CSV formats are not limited to a particular character set They work just as well with Unicode character sets such as UTF or UTF as with ASCII although particular programs that support CSV may have their own limitations CSV files normally will even survive na ve translation from one character set to another unlike nearly all proprietary data formats CSV does not however provide any way to indicate what character set is in use so that must be communicated separately or determined at the receiving end if possible br Databases that include multiple relations cannot be exported as a single CSV file Similarly CSV cannot naturally represent hierarchical or object oriented data This is because every CSV record is expected to have the same structure CSV is therefore rarely appropriate for documents created with HTML XML or other markup or word processing technologies br Statistical databases in various fields often have a generally relation like structure but with some repeatable groups of fields For example health databases such as the Demographic and Health Survey typically repeat some questions for each child of a given parent perhaps up to a fixed maximum number of children Statistical analysis systems often include utilities that can rotate such data for example a parent record that includes information about five children can be split into five separate records each containing a the information on one child and b a copy of all the non child specific information CSV can represent either the vertical or horizontal form of such data br In a relational database similar issues are readily handled by creating a separate relation for each such group and connecting child records to the related parent records using a foreign key such as an ID number or name for the parent In markup languages such as XML such groups are typically enclosed within a parent element and repeated as necessary for example multiple child nodes within a single parent node With CSV there is no widely accepted single file solution br br br Standardization br The name CSV indicates the use of the comma to separate data fields Nevertheless the term CSV is widely used to refer to a large family of formats that differ in many ways Some implementations allow or require single or double quotation marks around some or all fields and some reserve the first record as a header containing a list of field names The character set being used is undefined some applications require a Unicode byte order mark BOM to enforce Unicode interpretation sometimes even a UTF BOM Files that use the tab character instead of comma can be more precisely referred to as TSV for tab separated values br Other implementation differences include the handling of more commonplace field separators such as space or semicolon and newline characters inside text fields One more subtlety is the interpretation of a blank line it can equally be the result of writing a record of zero fields or a record of one field of zero length thus decoding it is ambiguous br br br RFC and MIME standards br The technical standard RFC formalizes the CSV file format and defines the MIME type text csv for the handling of text based fields However the interpretation of the text of each field is still application specific Files that follow the RFC standard can simplify CSV exchange and should be widely portable Among its requirements br br MS DOS style lines that end with CR LF characters optional for the last line br An optional header record there is no sure way to detect whether it is present so care is required when importing br Each record should contain the same number of comma separated fields br Any field may be quoted with double quotes br Fields containing a line break double quote or commas should be quoted If they are not the file will likely be impossible to process correctly br If double quotes are used to enclose fields then a double quote in a field must be represented by two double quote characters br The format can be processed by most programs that claim to read CSV files The exceptions are a programs may not support line breaks within quoted fields b programs may confuse the optional header with data or interpret the first data line as an optional header and c double quotes in a field may not be parsed correctly automatically br br br OKF frictionless tabular data package br In Open Knowledge Foundation OKF and various partners created a data protocols working group which later evolved into the Frictionless Data initiative One of the main formats they released was the Tabular Data Package Tabular Data package was heavily based on CSV using it as the main data transport format and adding basic type and schema metadata CSV lacks any type information to distinguish the string from the number br The Frictionless Data Initiative has also provided a standard CSV Dialect Description Format for describing different dialects of CSV for example specifying the field separator or quoting rules br br br W C tabular data standard br In the W C CSV on the Web working group began to specify technologies providing higher interoperability for web applications using CSV or similar formats The working group completed its work in February and is officially closed in March with the release of a set of documents and W C recommendations br for modeling Tabular Data and enhancing CSV with metadata and semantics br br br Basic rules br Many informal documents exist that describe CSV formats br IETF RFC summarized above defines the format for the text csv MIME type registered with the IANA br Rules typical of these and other CSV specifications and implementations are as follows br br br Example br br The above table of data may be represented in CSV format as follows br br Year Make Model Description Price br Ford E ac abs moon br Chevy Venture Extended Edition br Chevy Venture Extended Edition Very Large br Jeep Grand Cherokee MUST SELL br air moon roof loaded br br Example of a USA UK CSV file where the decimal separator is a period full stop and the value separator is a comma br br Year Make Model Length br Ford E br Mercury Cougar br br Example of an analogous European CSV DSV file where the decimal separator is a comma and the value separator is a semicolon br br Year Make Model Length br Ford E br Mercury Cougar br br The latter format is not RFC compliant Compliance could be achieved by the use of a comma instead of a semicolon as a separator and by quoting all numbers that have a decimal mark br br br Application support br Some applications use CSV as a data interchange format to enhance its interoperability exporting and importing CSV Others use CSV as an internal format br As a data interchange format the CSV file format is supported by almost all spreadsheets and database management systems br br Spreadsheets including Apple Numbers LibreOffice Calc and Apache OpenOffice Calc Microsoft Excel also supports a dialect of CSV with restrictions in comparison to other spreadsheet software e g as of Excel still cannot export CSV files in the commonly used UTF character encoding and separator is not enforced to be the comma LibreOffice Calc CSV importer is actually a more generic delimited text importer supporting multiple separators at the same time as well as field trimming br Various Relational databases support saving query results to a CSV file PostgreSQL provides COPY command which allows for both saving and loading data to and from a file COPY SELECT FROM articles TO home wikipedia file csv FORMAT csv saves the content of a table articles to a file called home wikipedia file csv br Many utility programs on Unix style systems such as cut paste join sort uniq awk can split files on a comma delimiter and can therefore process simple CSV files However this method does not correctly handle commas or new lines within quoted strings br As main or optional internal representation Can be native or foreign but differ from interchange format export import only because it is not necessary to create a copy in another format br br Some Spreadsheets including LibreOffice Calc offers this option without enforcing user to adopt another format br Some relational databases when using standard SQL offer foreign data wrapper FDW For example PostgreSQL offers the CREATE FOREIGN TABLE and CREATE EXTENSION file fdw to configure any variant of CSV br Databases like Apache Hive offer the option to express CSV or csv gz as an internal table format br The emacs editor can operate on CSV files using csv nav mode br CSV format is supported by libraries available for many programming languages Most provide some way to specify the field delimiter decimal separator character encoding quoting conventions date format etc br br br Software and row limits br Programs that work with CSV may have limits on the maximum number of rows CSV files can have br Below is a list of common software and its limitations br br Microsoft Excel row limit br Apple Numbers row limit br Google Sheets cell limit the product of columns and rows br OpenOffice and LibreOffice row limit br Text Editors such as WordPad TextEdit Vim etc no row or cell limit br Databases COPY command and FDW no row or cell limit br br br See also br Tab separated values br
