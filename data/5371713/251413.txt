In computer programming an application framework consists of a software framework used by software developers to implement the standard structure of application software br Application frameworks became popular with the rise of graphical user interfaces GUIs since these tended to promote a standard structure for applications Programmers find it much simpler to create automatic GUI creation tools when using a standard framework since this defines the underlying code structure of the application in advance Developers usually use object oriented programming OOP techniques to implement frameworks such that the unique parts of an application can simply inherit from classes extant in the framework br br br Examples br Apple Computer developed one of the first commercial application frameworks MacApp first release for the Macintosh Originally written in an extended object oriented version of Pascal termed Object Pascal it was later rewritten in C Another notable framework for the Mac is Metrowerks PowerPlant based on Carbon Cocoa for macOS offers a different approach to an application framework based on the OpenStep framework developed at NeXT br Since the s many apps have been created with the frameworks based on Google s Chromium project The two prominent ones are Electron and the Chromium Embedded Framework br Free and open source software frameworks exist as part of the Mozilla LibreOffice GNOME KDE NetBeans and Eclipse projects br Microsoft markets a framework for developing Windows applications in C called the Microsoft Foundation Class Library and a similar framework for developing applications with Visual Basic or C named NET Framework br Several frameworks can build cross platform applications for Linux Macintosh and Windows from common source code such as Qt wxWidgets Juce Fox toolkit or Eclipse Rich Client Platform RCP br Oracle Application Development Framework Oracle ADF aids in producing Java oriented systems br Silicon Laboratories offers an embedded application framework for developing wireless applications on its series of wireless chips br MARTHA is a proprietary software Java framework that all of the RealObjects software is built on br br br
