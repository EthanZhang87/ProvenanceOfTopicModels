at US br On July after disappointing financial performance the board of directors fired VMware co founder president and CEO Diane Greene who was replaced by Paul Maritz a year Microsoft veteran who was heading EMC s cloud computing business unit Greene had been CEO since the company s founding ten years earlier On September Mendel Rosenblum the company s co founder chief scientist and the husband of Diane Greene resigned br On September VMware announced a collaboration with Cisco Systems One result was the Cisco Nexus V a distributed virtual software switch an integrated option in the VMware infrastructure br In April EMC transferred control of the Mozy backup service to VMware br On April VMware released an open source platform as a service system called Cloud Foundry as well as a hosted version of the service This supported application deployment for Java Ruby on Rails Sinatra Node js and Scala as well as database support for MySQL MongoDB Redis PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ br In August Pat Gelsinger was appointed as the new CEO of VMware coming over from EMC Paul Maritz went over to EMC as Head of Strategy before moving on to lead the Pivotal spin off br In March VMware

Foundry RabbitMQ GemFire and SQLFire were transferred to this organization br In May VMware launched its own IaaS service vCloud Hybrid Service at its new Palo Alto headquarters vCloud Hybrid Service was rebranded vCloud Air and later sold to cloud provider OVH announcing an early access program in a Las Vegas data center The service is designed to function as an extension of its customer s existing vSphere installations with full compatibility with existing virtual machines virtualized with VMware software and tightly integrated networking The service is based on vCloud Director vSphere br In September at VMworld San Francisco VMware announced the general availability of vCloud Hybrid Service and expansion to Sterling Virginia Santa Clara California Dallas Texas and a service beta in the UK It announced the acquisition of Desktone in October br br br Dell acquisition br In January in anticipation of Dell s acquisition of EMC VMware announced a restructuring to reduce about positions and some executives resigned The entire development team behind VMware Workstation and Fusion was disbanded and all US developers were immediately fired On April maintenance release was released On September VMware announced the release of Workstation and Fusion as a free upgrade supporting Windows and Windows Server br In April VMware president and COO Carl Eschenbach left VMware to join Sequoia Capital and Martin Casado VMware s general manager for its Networking and Security business left to join Andreessen Horowitz Analysts commented that the cultures at Dell and EMC and at

Shell vulnerability at organizations who failed to implement available patches released by VMware according to PCMag ZDNET reported in March that hackers utilized Log Shell on some customers VMware servers to install backdoors and for cryptocurrency mining In May Bleeping Computer reported that the Lazarus Group cybercrime group which is possibly linked to North Korea was actively using Log Shell to inject backdoors that fetch information stealing payloads on VMware Horizon servers including VMware Horizon br br br Acquisition by Broadcom br On May Broadcom announced its intention to acquire VMware for approximately billion in cash and stock in addition to assuming billion of VMware s net debt and that Broadcom Software Group would rebrand and operate as VMware br In November the UK s Competition and Markets Authority regulator announced it would investigate whether the acquisition would result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets in the United Kingdom for goods or services br The transaction closed on November after a prolonged delay in getting approval from the Chinese regulator on an additional condition that VMware s server software should maintain compatibility with third party hardware and not require the use of Broadcom s hardware products On completion Broadcom reorganized the company into four divisions VMware Cloud Foundation Tanzu Software Defined Edge and Application Networking and Security and subsequently laid off over employees Broadcom also relocated its headquarters from North San Jose to VMWare s headquarters campus in Palo Alto br On December VMware ended availability for perpetually licensed products such as vSphere and Cloud Foundation moving exclusively to subscription based offerings The company stated that this had been planned as an eventuality prior to the Broadcom acquisition br In February private equity firm KKR and Broadcom agreed for KKR to acquire Broadcom s End User Computing EUC Division formerly a division of VMware for about billion This includes the VDI product Horizon and the device management suite Workspace ONE formerly AirWatch br On May it was announced that VMware Workstation Pro and VMware Fusion Pro would be made free for personal use with commercial use still requiring payment br br br Acquisitions br br br Litigation br In March the Software Freedom Conservancy announced it was funding litigation by Christoph Hellwig in Hamburg Germany against VMware for alleged violation of his copyrights in its ESXi product br Hellwig s core claim is that ESXi is a derivative work of the GPLv licensed Linux kernel and therefore VMware is not in compliance br with GPLv because it does not publish the source code to ESXi VMware publicly stated that ESXi is not a derivative of the Linux kernel denying Hellwig s br core claim VMware said it offered a way to use Linux device drivers with ESXi and that code does use some Linux GPLv licensed code and so it had published the source meeting GPLv requirements br The lawsuit was dismissed by the court in July and Hellwig announced he would file an appeal The appeal was decided February and again dismissed by German court on the basis of not meeting procedural requirements for the burden of proof of the plaintiff br In May VMware was ordered to pay million for patent infringement on two patents belonging to Densify a Canadian software company br br br Current products br VMware s most notable products are its hypervisors VMware became well known for its first type hypervisor known as VMware Workstation This product has since evolved into two additional hypervisor product lines VMware s type hypervisors running directly on hardware ESX ESXi and their discontinued hosted type hypervisors GSX br VMware software provides a completely virtualized set of hardware to the guest operating system VMware software virtualizes the hardware for a video adapter a network adapter and hard disk adapters The host provides pass through drivers for guest USB serial and parallel devices In this way VMware virtual machines become highly portable between computers because every host looks nearly identical to the guest In practice a system administrator can pause operations on a virtual machine guest move or copy that guest to another physical computer and there resume execution exactly at the point of suspension Alternatively for enterprise servers a feature called vMotion allows the migration of operational guest virtual machines between similar but separate hardware hosts sharing the same storage or with vMotion Storage separate storage can be used too Each of these transitions is completely transparent to any users on the virtual machine at the time it is being migrated br VMware s products predate the virtualization extensions to the x instruction set and do not require virtualization enabled processors On newer processors the hypervisor is now designed to take advantage of the extensions However unlike many other hypervisors VMware still supports older processors In such cases it uses the CPU to run code directly whenever possible as for example when running user mode and virtual mode code on x When direct execution cannot operate such as with kernel level and real mode code VMware products use binary translation BT to re write the code dynamically The translated code gets stored in spare memory typically at the end of the address space which segmentation mechanisms can protect and make invisible For these reasons VMware operates dramatically faster than emulators running at more than of the speed that the virtual guest operating system would run directly on the same hardware In one study VMware claims a slowdown over native ranging from percent for the VMware ESX Server br br br Desktop software br VMware Fusion provides similar functionality for users of the Intel Mac platform along with full compatibility with virtual machines created by other VMware products br VMware Workstation introduced in was the first product launched by VMware This software suite allows users to run multiple instances of x or x compatible operating systems on a single physical personal computer Version was released on November br VMware Workstation Player is freeware for non commercial use without requiring a license and available for commercial use with permission It is similar to VMware Workstation with some features not available including support for UEFI Secure Boot snapshots encrypted virtual machines and some advanced features br br br Server software br VMware ESXi an enterprise software product can deliver greater performance than the freeware VMware Server due to lower system computational overhead VMware ESXi as a bare metal product runs directly on the server hardware allowing virtual servers to also use hardware more or less directly In addition VMware ESXi integrates into VMware vCenter which offers extra services br br br Cloud management software br VMware vRealize Suite a cloud management platform purpose built for a hybrid cloud VMware vRealize Hyperic was acquired from SpringSource and subsequently discontinued in br VMware Go is a web based service to guide users of any expertise level through the installation and configuration of VMware vSphere Hypervisor br VMware Cloud Foundation Cloud Foundation provides an easy way to deploy and operate a private cloud on an integrated SDDC system br VMware Horizon View is a virtual desktop infrastructure VDI product br vSphere and vSAN activates add on hybrid cloud services for business critical applications running on premises including disaster recovery and ransomware protection br br br Application management br VMware Workspace Portal was a self service app store for workspace management br br br PlateSpin br br br Storage and availability br VMware s storage and availability products are composed of two primary offerings br br VMware vSAN previously called VMware Virtual SAN is software defined storage that is embedded in VMware s ESXi hypervisor The vSphere and vSAN software runs on industry standard x servers to form a hyper converged infrastructure or HCI However network operators need to have servers from HCL Hardware Compatibility List to put one into production The first release version was released in March The th generation version was released in April New features available in VMware vSAN include native data at rest encryption local protection for stretched clusters analytics and optimized solid state drive performance The VMWare version was released in April br VMware Site Recovery Manager SRM automates the failover and failback of virtual machines to and from a secondary site using policy based management br br br Networking and security products br VMware NSX is VMware s network virtualization product marketed using the term software defined data center SDDC The technology included some acquired from the purchase of Nicira Software Defined Networking SDN allows the same policies that govern Identity and Access Management IAM to dictate levels of access to applications and data through a totally converged infrastructure not possible with legacy network and system access methods br br br Other products br Workspace ONE allows mobile users to access apps and data br The VIX Virtual Infrastructure eXtension API allows automated or scripted management of a computer virtualized using either VMware s vSphere Workstation Player or Fusion products VIX provides bindings for the programming languages C Perl Visual Basic VBScript and C br Herald is a communications protocol from VMware for more reliable Bluetooth communication and range finding for mobile devices Herald code is available under an open source license and was implemented in the Australian Government s COVIDSafe app for contact tracing on December br br br See also br Comparison of
