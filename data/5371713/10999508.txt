title: Logging (computing)
id: 10999508
In computing logging is the act of keeping a log of events that occur in a computer system such as problems errors or just information on current operations These events may occur in the operating system or in other software A message or log entry is recorded for each such event These log messages can then be used to monitor and understand the operation of the system to debug problems or during an audit Logging is particularly important in multi user software to have a central overview of the operation of the system br In the simplest case messages are written to a file called a log file Alternatively the messages may be written to a dedicated logging system or to a log management software where it is stored in a database or on a different computer system br Specifically a transaction log is a log of the communications between a system and the users of that system or a data collection method that automatically captures the type content or time of transactions made by a person from a terminal with that system For Web searching a transaction log is an electronic record of interactions that have occurred during a searching episode between a Web search engine and users searching for information on that Web search engine br Many operating systems software frameworks and programs include a logging system A widely used logging standard is Syslog defined in Internet Engineering Task Force IETF RFC The Syslog standard enables a dedicated standardized subsystem to generate filter record and analyze log messages This relieves software developers of having to design and code their ad hoc logging systems br br br Types br br br Event logs br Event logs record events taking place in the execution of a system in order to provide br That can be used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems br They are essential to understand particularly in the case of applications with little user interaction br It can also be useful to combine log file entries from multiple sources It is a different combination that may yield between with related events on different servers Other solutions employ network wide querying and reporting br br br Transaction logs br br Most database systems maintain some kind of transaction log which are not mainly intended as an audit trail for later analysis and are not intended to be human readable These logs record changes to the stored data to allow the database to recover from crashes or other data errors and maintain the stored data in a consistent state Thus database systems usually have both general event logs and transaction logs br The use of data stored in transaction logs of Web search engines Intranets and Web sites can provide valuable insight into understanding the information searching process of online searchers This understanding can enlighten information system design interface development and devising the information architecture for content collections br br br Message logs br Internet Relay Chat IRC instant messaging IM programs peer to peer file sharing clients with chat functions and multiplayer games especially MMORPGs commonly have the ability to automatically save textual communication both public IRC channel IM conference MMO public party chat messages and private chat between users as message logs br Message logs are almost universally plain text files but IM and VoIP clients which support textual chat e g Skype might save them in HTML files or in a custom format to ease reading or enable encryption br In the case of IRC software message logs often include system server messages and entries related to channel and user changes e g topic change user joins exits kicks bans nickname changes the user status changes making them more like a combined message event log of the channel in question but such a log is not comparable to a true IRC server event log because it only records user visible events for the time frame the user spent being connected to a certain channel br Instant messaging and VoIP clients often offer the chance to store encrypted logs to enhance the user s privacy These logs require a password to be decrypted and viewed and they are often handled by their respective writing application Some privacy focused messaging services such as Signal record minimal logs about users limiting their information to connection times br br br Server logs br br A server log is a log file or several files automatically created and maintained by a server consisting of a list of activities it performed br A typical example is a web server log which maintains a history of page requests The W C maintains a standard format the Common Log Format for web server log files but other proprietary formats exist Some servers can log information to computer readable formats such as JSON versus the human readable standard More recent entries are typically appended to the end of the file Information about the request including client IP address request date time page requested HTTP code bytes served user agent and referrer are typically added This data can be combined into a single file or separated into distinct logs such as an access log error log or referrer log However server logs typically do not collect user specific information br These files are usually not accessible to general Internet users only to the webmaster or other administrative person of an Internet service A statistical analysis of the server log may be used to examine traffic patterns by time of day day of week referrer or user agent Efficient web site administration adequate hosting resources and the fine tuning of sales efforts can be aided by analysis of the web server logs br br br See also br Digital traces One s unique set of traceable digital
