Spring Boot is an open source Java framework used for programming standalone production grade Spring based applications with minimal effort Spring Boot is a convention over configuration extension for the Spring Java platform intended to help minimize configuration concerns while creating Spring based applications Most of the application can be preconfigured using Spring team s opinionated view of the best configuration and use of the Spring platform and third party libraries br It is widely used for building microservices web applications and other Java based projects due to its ease of use and robustness br br br Features br Embedded Tomcat Jetty or Undertow web application server br Provide opinionated starter Project Object Models POMs for the build tool The only build tools supported are Maven and Gradle br Automatic configuration of the Spring Application br Provide production ready functionality such as metrics health checks and externalized configuration br No code generation is required br No XML configuration is required br Optional support for Kotlin and Apache Groovy in addition to Java br br br Bootstrapping DispatcherServlet br br Spring Boot does not require manual configuration of the DispatcherServlet since it automatically configures the application based on the configuration it detects br br br SpringBootServletInitializer br Spring Boot has a class SpringBootServletInitializer which is a specialization of the WebApplicationInitializer This SpringBootServletInitializer is an out of the box implementation of WebApplicationInitializer which eliminates the need for the developer to construct their own implementation of the WebApplicationInitializer class br br br Configuration properties br The configuration properties for the Spring Boot application can be specified in the application properties or application yml file br Examples of properties that can be included in this file include the server port and spring application name properties br br br Autoconfiguration br br br SpringBootApplication br Spring boot has an annotation SpringBootApplication which allows the Spring Boot application to autoconfigure third party libraries and detected features found on the classpath As an example the class that has the SpringBootApplication annotation can extend the SpringBootServerInitializer class if the application is packaged and deployed as a WAR file br The SpringBootApplication annotation combines three Spring specific annotations SpringBootConfiguration EnableAutoConfiguration and ComponentScan br br br SpringBootConfiguration br The SpringBootConfiguration annotation is a specialization of the Spring specific Configuration annotation The class with the SpringBootConfiguration is marked as the configuration class for the Spring Boot application br br br EnableAutoConfiguration br The EnableAutoConfiguration annotation is Spring specific annotation that enables the Spring Boot automatic configuration br br br Actuator br The Spring Boot Actuator allows for monitoring and management capabilities for the Spring Boot Application A major advantage of using the Spring Boot Actuator is that it implements a number of production ready features without requiring the developer to construct their own implementations br If Maven is used as the build tool then the spring boot starter actuator dependency can be specified in the pom xml configuration file br br br Integration with Spring Framework Modules br Spring Boot has a number of existing Spring Framework Modules br br br Spring Security br br Spring Boot has integration with the Spring Security Module The simplest way for integrating Spring Boot with Spring Security is to declare the starter dependency in the build configuration file br If Maven is used as the build tool then the dependency with artifact ID spring boot starter security dependency can be specified in the pom xml configuration file br br br Application Servers br By default Spring boot provides embedded web servers such as TomCat out of the box However Spring Boot can also be deployed as a WAR file on a standalone WildFly application server br If Maven is used as the build tool there is a wildfly maven plugin Maven plugin that allows for automatic deployment of the generated WAR file br br br br br Deinum Marten Cosmina Iuliana Pro Spring MVC with WebFlux Berkeley CA Apress doi ISBN S CID br Musib Somnath July Spring Boot in Practice Simon and Schuster ISBN br Walls Craig Jan Spring Boot in Action Manning ISBN br Walls Craig Spring in Action Manning ISBN br br br External links br br Official website
