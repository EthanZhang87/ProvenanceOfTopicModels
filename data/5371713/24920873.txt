id: 24920873
The Java Development Kit JDK is a distribution of Java technology by Oracle Corporation It implements the Java Language Specification JLS and the Java Virtual Machine Specification JVMS and provides the Standard Edition SE of the Java Application Programming Interface API It is derivative of the community driven OpenJDK which Oracle stewards It provides software for working with Java applications Examples of included software are the Java virtual machine a compiler performance monitoring tools a debugger and other utilities that Oracle considers useful for Java programmers br Oracle releases the current version of the software under the Oracle No Fee Terms and Conditions NFTC license Oracle releases binaries for the x architecture for Windows macOS and Linux based operating systems and for the aarch architecture for macOS and Linux Previous versions supported the Oracle Solaris operating system and SPARC architecture br Oracle s primary implementation of the JVMS is known as the HotSpot virtual machine br br br JDK contents br The JDK has as its primary components a collection of programming tools including br br appletviewer this tool can be used to run and debug Java applets without a web browser br apt the annotation processing tool br extcheck a utility that detects JAR file conflicts br idlj the IDL to Java compiler This utility generates Java bindings from a given Java IDL file br jabswitch the Java Access Bridge Exposes assistive technologies on Microsoft Windows systems br java the loader for Java applications This tool is an interpreter and can interpret the class files generated by the javac compiler Now a single launcher is used for both development and deployment The old deployment launcher jre no longer comes with Sun JDK and instead it has been replaced by this new java loader br javac the Java compiler which converts source code into Java bytecode br javadoc the documentation generator which automatically generates documentation from source code comments br jar the archiver which packages related class libraries into a single JAR file This tool also helps manage JAR files br javafxpackager tool to package and sign JavaFX applications br jarsigner the jar signing and verification tool br javah the C header and stub generator used to write native methods br javap the class file disassembler br javaws the Java Web Start launcher for JNLP applications br JConsole Java Monitoring and Management Console br jdb the debugger br jhat Java Heap Analysis Tool experimental br jinfo This utility gets configuration information from a running Java process or crash dump experimental br jmap Oracle jmap Memory Map This utility outputs the memory map for Java and can print shared object memory maps or heap memory details of a given process or core dump experimental br jmc Java Mission Control br jpackage a tool for generating self contained application bundles experimental br jps Java Virtual Machine Process Status Tool lists the instrumented HotSpot Java Virtual Machines JVMs on the target system experimental br jrunscript Java command line script shell br jshell a read eval print loop introduced in Java br jstack utility that prints Java stack traces of Java threads experimental br jstat Java Virtual Machine statistics monitoring tool experimental br jstatd jstat daemon experimental br keytool tool for manipulating the keystore br pack JAR compression tool br policytool the policy creation and management tool which can determine policy for a Java runtime specifying which permissions are available for code from various sources br VisualVM visual tool integrating several command line JDK tools and lightweight performance and memory profiling capabilities no longer included in JDK br wsimport generates portable JAX WS artifacts for invoking a web service br xjc Part of the Java API for XML Binding JAXB API It accepts an XML schema and generates Java classes br Experimental tools may not be available in future versions of the JDK br The JDK also comes with a complete Java Runtime Environment JRE usually called a private runtime due to the fact that it is separated from the regular JRE and has extra contents It consists of a Java virtual machine and all of the class libraries present in the production environment as well as additional libraries only useful to developers such as the internationalization libraries and the IDL libraries br Copies of the JDK also include a wide selection of example programs demonstrating the use of almost all portions of the Java API br br br Other JDKs br In addition to the most widely used JDK discussed in this article there are other JDKs commonly available for a variety of platforms some of which started from the Sun JDK source and some that did not All adhere to the basic Java specifications but often differ in explicitly unspecified areas such as garbage collection compilation strategies and optimization techniques They include br In development or in maintenance mode br br Azul Systems Zing low latency JDK for Linux br Azul Systems OpenJDK based Zulu for Linux Windows Mac OS X embedded and the cloud br OpenJDK IcedTea br Aicas JamaicaVM br IBM J JDK for AIX Linux Windows MVS OS Pocket PC z OS br Not being maintained or discontinued br br Apache Harmony br Apple s Mac OS Runtime for Java JVM JDK for Classic Mac OS br Blackdown Java Port of Sun s JDK for Linux br GNU s Classpath and GCJ The GNU Compiler for Java br Oracle Corporation s JRockit JDK for Windows Linux and Solaris br br br See also br br Classpath br
