title: Front controller
id: 15574400
The front controller software design pattern is listed in several pattern catalogs and is related to the design of web applications It is a controller that handles all requests for a website which is a useful structure for web application developers to achieve flexibility and reuse without code redundancy br br br Instruction br br Front controllers are often used in web applications to implement workflows While not strictly required it is much easier to control navigation across a set of related pages for instance multiple pages used in an online purchase from a front controller than it is to assign individual pages responsibility for navigation br The front controller may be implemented as a Java object or as a script in a scripting language such as PHP Raku Python or Ruby that is called for every request of a web session This script would handle all tasks that are common to the application or the framework such as session handling caching and input filtering Based on the specific request it would then instantiate further objects and call methods to handle the required tasks br The alternative to a front controller is the usage of page controllers mapped to each site page or path Although this may cause each individual controller to contain duplicate code the page controller approach delivers a high degree of specialization br br br Examples br Several web tier application frameworks implement the front controller pattern br br Apache Struts br ASP NET MVC br Cairngorm framework in Adobe Flex br Cro or Bailador frameworks in Raku br Drupal br MVC frameworks written in PHP such as Yii CakePHP Laravel Symfony CodeIgniter and Laminas br Spring Framework br Yesod written in Haskell br br br Implementation br Front controllers may divided into three components br br XML mapping files that map requests to the class that will handle the request processing br Request processor used for request processing and modifying or retrieving the appropriate model br Flow manager determines what will be shown on the next page br br br Participants and responsibilities br br br Java implementation example br The front controller implemented in Java code br br br Benefits and liabilities br There are three primary benefits associated with the front controller pattern br br Centralized control The front controller handles all the requests to the web application This implementation of centralized control that avoids using multiple controllers is desirable for enforcing application wide policies such as user tracking and security br Thread safety A new command object arises when receiving a new request and the command objects are not meant to be thread safe Thus it will be safe in the command classes Though safety is not guaranteed when threading issues are gathered code that interacts with commands is still thread safe br Configurability As only one front controller is employed in a web application the application configuration may be greatly simplified Because the handler shares the responsibility of dispatching new commands may be added without changes needed to the code br The front controller pattern may incur performance issues because the single controller is performing a great deal of work and handlers may introduce bottlenecks if they involve database or document queries The front controller approach is also more complex than that of page controllers br br br Relationship with MVC br In order to improve system reliability and maintainability duplicate code should be avoided and centralized when it involves common logic used throughout the system br The data for the application is best handled in a single location obviating the need for duplicate data retrieval code br Different roles in the model view controller MVC pattern should be separated to increase testability which is also true for the controller part in the MVC pattern br br br Comparison br The page controller pattern is an alternative to the front controller approach in the MVC model br br br See also br Design pattern computer science br Mediator pattern note the front controller pattern is a specialized kind of mediator pattern br br br br br br Notes br Alur Deepak John Crup Dan Malks Core J EE Patterns Best Practices and Design Strategies nd Ed Sun Microsystems Press pp pp ISBN br Fowler Martin Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture Addison Wesley Professional pp pp ISBN br br br External links br Bear Bibeault s Front Man a lightweight Java implementation
