id: 11677929
IcedTea is a build and integration project for OpenJDK launched by Red Hat in June IcedTea also includes some addon libraries IcedTea Web is a free software implementation of Java Web Start and the Java web browser applet plugin IcedTea Sound is a collection of plugins for the Java sound subsystem including the PulseAudio provider which used to be included with IcedTea The Free Software Foundation recommends that all Java programmers use IcedTea as their development environment br Historically the initial goal of the IcedTea project was to make the OpenJDK software which Sun Microsystems released as free software in usable without requiring any proprietary software and hence make it possible to add OpenJDK to Fedora and other Linux distributions that insist on free software This goal was met and a version of IcedTea based on OpenJDK was packaged with Fedora in November April saw the first release of a new variant IcedTea which is based on Sun s build drops of OpenJDK a fork of the OpenJDK with the goal of being compatible with the existing JDK This was released in Ubuntu and Fedora in May The IcedTea package in these distributions has been renamed to OpenJDK using the OpenJDK trademark notice In June the Fedora build passed Sun s rigorous TCK testing on x and x IcedTea the first version based on OpenJDK was released in October IcedTea the first version based on OpenJDK was released in April Support for IcedTea was dropped in January br br br History br This project was created following Sun s release under open source licenses of its HotSpot Virtual Machine and Java compiler in November and most of the source code of the class library in May However parts of the class library such as font rendering colour management and sound support were only provided as proprietary binary plugins This was because the source code for these plugins was copyrighted to third parties rather than Sun Microsystems The released parts were published under the terms of the GNU General Public License a free software license br Due to these missing components it was not possible to build OpenJDK only with free software components Sun aimed to negotiate with the license holders to allow this code to be released under a free software license or failing that to replace these proprietary elements with alternative implementations With the plugins replaced the class library would then be completely free Sun has continued to use the proprietary code in their certified binary releases br Following the announcement the IcedTea project was started and was formally announced on June with a build repository provided by the GNU Classpath team The team could not call their software product OpenJDK because this is a trademark which was owned by Sun Microsystems They instead decided to use the temporary name IcedTea br On November Red Hat signed both the Sun Contributor Agreement and the OpenJDK Community Technology Compatibility Kit TCK License The press release suggested that this would benefit the IcedTea project Simon Phipps suggested the possibility of IcedTea being hosted on openjdk java net and Mark Reinhold noted that signing the copyright assignment could allow Red Hat to contribute parts of IcedTea to Sun for inclusion in the mainstream JDK br Since then a number of patches from IcedTea have made their way into OpenJDK br In June it was announced that IcedTea as the packaged version of OpenJDK on Fedora has passed the TCK tests and can claim to be a fully compatible Java implementation The project continues to track OpenJDK OpenJDK and OpenJDK development in separate repositories and contribute patches back upstream br where possible the current state of each IcedTea patch is maintained on the IcedTea wiki br br br Aims br The IcedTea project started with two aims br br to make it possible for the GNU Compiler for Java to compile the OpenJDK code OpenJDK presented a bootstrapping question of itself being written in Java Hence developers needed an already working Java compiler and runtime in order to build OpenJDK Originally only the existing proprietary Sun JDK met that requirement Free distributions like Fedora can t depend on proprietary tools in order to build packages so the IcedTea project had to make it possible to compile the code using free software When this was done the resulting IcedTea version of OpenJDK could be used to compile itself thus escaping the need to use non Free software for future compiling br to provide free equivalents of the binary plugins that existed in OpenJDK because Sun was unable to release all the source code As of March this is no longer necessary for IcedTea as the OpenJDK build drops can be built with no binary plugins With the release of b which replaces the proprietary sound support with that from the Gervill project a full implementation of Java can be built without binary plugins The only remaining binary plug is for SNMP support which is an optional provider for the JMX architecture and not part of the specification As of b in April the same is true for OpenJDK Outside the core of OpenJDK binary plugins are still required for utilizing Java Web Start applets that run using the browser plugin distinct from the core plugins discussed earlier as of the only source code available that accomplishes this goal is the IcedTea Web project br br br Other benefits br IcedTea also provides a more familiar build system by providing a wrapper around the OpenJDK makefiles using the GNU Autotools This removes the need to remember numerous environment variables for configuring the build The current IcedTea builds set roughly forty such variables for the underlying OpenJDK build It has also provided a place for early work on features which will eventually appear in the main OpenJDK builds such as Gervill and for work on ports to other platforms br br br IcedTea Web br br IcedTea web provides a free software Java Web browser plugin It was the first to work in bit browsers under bit Linux a feature Sun s proprietary JRE later addressed This makes it suitable to enable support for Java applets in bit Mozilla Firefox among others IcedTea web also provides a free Java Web Start Java Network Launching Protocol JNLP implementation Sun had promised to release their plugin and Web Start implementation as part of OpenJDK Despite pressure from the community Sun Microsystems did not succeed in doing so before the company was acquired by Oracle Development on the IcedTea web plugin continues with the latest version of the next generation plugin supporting Google s Chromium in addition to Firefox br Since development takes place in the separate IcedTea Web project As of April Oracle has kept the codebase of the Java plugin fully proprietary in contrast to the remainder of OpenJDK As of December IcedTea Web adds support for jdk br As of October Oracle has announced that public Java Web Start support will end with Java SE In March the icedtea web source code was donated to the AdoptOpenJDK project Based on this the sources and issue management of IcedTea Web were migrated to GitHub br One goal of the migration is to provide an integration for the Java releases of AdoptOpenJDK and provide JDK vendor independent installers for IcedTea Web The integration project is a cooperation between the AdoptOpenJDK community Red Hat and Karakun AG The project for the installers is named OpenWebStart and first information can be found here br br br Progress and availability br From June IcedTea was able to build itself and pass a significant portion of Mauve the GNU Classpath test suite In May support was added to IcedTea for running the Sun jtreg regression tests br IcedTea has become popular among package maintainers for the following Linux distributions br Currently as of April br br IcedTea is the default JVM in Ark Linux and Arch Linux br It can be built and run under Debian Packages entered unstable on July As of May packages icedtea netx and icedtea netx common are available in official Debian repositories for at least Debian through br IcedTea was available in Fedora and IcedTea appeared in Fedora through to as java openjdk A java openjdk package using the IcedTea x OpenJDK forest but not its build system first appeared in Fedora br Binary and source packages for IcedTea x are available in Gentoo s official repository A source package for IcedTea x continues to be maintaining in the Java overlay repository Installing a Java application by default pulls in IcedTea instead of oracle jdk because it can be installed without extra work from the user as users have to manually agree to Oracle s EULA to download the oracle jdk br IcedTea is available in Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon from the universe repository and IcedTea in Hardy Heron Starting with Ubuntu only IcedTea is available br br br Architecture br OpenJDK contained approximately on release in May encumbered code which was only packaged as binary plugins These were required to build and use the JDK OpenJDK was released with only encumbered code and the encumbered sound support has also since been replaced IcedTea is based on this release IcedTea still provides its own web browser plugin and Web Start support as Sun s implementation remains proprietary br IcedTea x and x can compile OpenJDK using GNU Classpath based solutions such as GCJ and optionally bootstraps itself using the HotSpot Java Virtual Machine and the javac Java compiler it just built For now building IcedTea x requires using IcedTea x or x or an OpenJDK or build from another source br br br Platform support br Cross architecture ports of HotSpot OpenJDK s Virtual Machine are difficult because the code contains much assembly language in addition to the C core The IcedTea project has developed a generic port of the HotSpot interpreter called zero assembler Hotspot or zero with almost no assembly code This port is intended to allow the interpreter part of HotSpot to be very easily adapted to any Linux processor architecture The code of zero assembler Hotspot was used for all the non x ports of HotSpot PPC IA S and ARM from version of IcedTea br The IcedTea project has also developed a platform independent just in time compiler called Shark for HotSpot using LLVM to complement Zero This was included in upstream OpenJDK in August A JIT for ARM was first included in and A native port to AArch from Red Hat appeared in and a native PPC port from SAP IBM will be included in The PPC AIX port is included upstream in OpenJDK from version u and the AArch port will be included from version br br br See also br br Free Java implementations br Apache Harmony br br br br br br External links br
