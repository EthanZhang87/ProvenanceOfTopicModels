id: 173768
Dr Dobb s Journal often shortened to Dr Dobb s or DDJ was a monthly magazine published in the United States by UBM Technology Group part of UBM It covered topics aimed at computer programmers When launched in DDJ was the first regular periodical focused on microcomputer software rather than hardware In its last years of publication it was distributed as a PDF monthly although the principal delivery of Dr Dobb s content was through the magazine s website Publication ceased at the end br of with the archived website continuing to be available online br br br History br Bob Albrecht edited an eccentric newspaper about computer games programmed in BASIC with the same name as the tiny nonprofit educational corporation that he had founded People s Computer Company PCC Dennis Allison was a longtime computer consultant on the San Francisco Peninsula and sometime instructor at Stanford University The Dobbs title was based on a mashup of the first letters of their names Dennis and Bob br br br First issues br In the first three quarterly issues of the PCC newspaper published in Albrecht had published articles written by Allison describing how to design and implement a stripped down version of an interpreter for the BASIC language with limited features to be easier to implement He called it Tiny BASIC At the end of the final part Allison asked computer hobbyists who implemented it to send their implementations to PCC and they would circulate copies of any implementations to anyone who sent a self addressed stamped envelope Allison said Let us stand on each others shoulders not each others toes br The journal was originally intended to be a three issue xerographed publication Titled dr dobb s journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics Orthodontia with the subtitle Running Light Without Overbyte it was created to distribute the implementations of Tiny BASIC The original title was created by Eric Bakalinsky who did occasional paste up work for PCC Dobb s was a contraction of Dennis and Bob It was at a time when computer memory was very expensive so compact coding was important Microcomputer hobbyists needed to avoid using too many bytes of memory br After the first photocopies were mailed to those who had sent stamped addressed envelopes PCC was flooded with requests that the publication become an ongoing periodical devoted to general microcomputer software br PCC agreed and hired Jim Warren as its first editor He immediately changed the title to Dr Dobb s Journal of Computer Calisthenics Orthodontia prior to publishing the first issue in January The title refers to jumping through hoops calisthenics and pulling teeth orthodontia br br br Early years br Jim Warren was DDJ s editor for about a year and a half While he went on to make a splash with his series of West Coast Computer Faires subsequent DDJ editors like Marlin Ouverson Hank Harrison Michael Swaine and Jonathan Erickson appear to have focused on the journalistic and social aspects of the young but growing microcomputer industry Eventually PCC the non profit corporation sold DDJ to a commercial publisher br The newsletter s content was originally pure enthusiast material Initial interest circled around the Tiny BASIC interpreter but Warren broadened that to include a variety of other programming topics as well as a strong consumer bias especially needed in the chaotic early days of microcomputing All of the content came from volunteer contributors with Steve Wozniak as one of the better known of them Other contributors included Jef Raskin later credited as a leader in the Macintosh development Hal Hardenberg the originator of DTACK Grounded an early newsletter for Motorola based software and hardware and Gary Kildall who had created CP M the first disk operating system for microcomputers which was not married to proprietary hardware br Computer program source code published during the early years include br br Tiny BASIC interpreter br Palo Alto Tiny BASIC by Li Chen Wang br Small C compiler by Ron Cain br Music programs br There were also projects for computer speech synthesis and computer music systems The March issue printed Richard Stallman s GNU Manifesto a call for participation in the then new free software movement br br br Discontinuation of printed edition br br In later years the magazine received contributions from developers all over the world working in application development and embedded systems across most programming languages and platforms The magazine s focus became more professional Columnists included Michael Swaine Allen Holub and Verity Stob the pseudonymous British programmer br The title was later shortened to Dr Dobb s Journal then changed to Dr Dobb s Journal of Software Tools as it became more popular The magazine later reverted to Dr Dobb s Journal with the selling line The World of Software Development with the abbreviation DDJ also used for the corresponding website In January Jonathan Erickson the editor in chief announced the magazine would cease monthly print publication become a section of InformationWeek called Dr Dobb s Report a website and monthly digital PDF edition br br br Later history br The primary Dr Dobb s content streams at the end were the Dr Dobb s website Dr Dobb s Journal the monthly PDF magazine which had different content from the website and a weekly newsletter Dr Dobb s Update In addition Dr Dobb s continued to run the Jolt Awards and since the Dr Dobb s Excellence in Programming Award Regular bloggers include Scott Ambler Walter Bright Andrew Koenig and Al Williams Adrian Bridgwater edited the news section beginning in br br br End br On December an article by editor in chief Andrew Binstock announced that Dr Dobb s would cease publication of new articles at the end of Archived articles are still available online While no longer distributed Dr Dobb s is widely considered an important and influential source for the history of the personal
