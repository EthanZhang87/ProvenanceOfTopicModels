Android software development is the process by which applications are created for devices running the Android operating system Google states that Android apps can be written using Kotlin Java and C languages using the Android software development kit SDK while using other languages is also possible All non Java virtual machine JVM languages such as Go JavaScript C C or assembly need the help of JVM language code that may be supplied by tools likely with restricted API support Some programming languages and tools allow cross platform app support i e for both Android and iOS Third party tools development environments and language support have also continued to evolve and expand since the initial SDK was released in The official Android app distribution mechanism to end users is Google Play it also allows staged gradual app release as well as distribution of pre release app versions to testers br br br Official development tools br The Android software development kit SDK includes a comprehensive set of development tools The Android SDK Platform Tools are a separately downloadable subset of the full SDK consisting of command line tools such as adb and fastboot The Android Debug Bridge ADB is a tool to run commands on a connected Android device Fastboot is a protocol used for flashing filesystems Code written in C C can be compiled to ARM or x native code or their bit variants using the Android Native Development Kit NDK br br br Android Open Accessory Development Kit br The Android platform also backported to Android introduces Android Open Accessory support which allows external USB hardware an Android USB accessory to interact with an Android powered device in a special accessory mode When an Android powered device is in accessory mode the connected accessory acts as the USB host powers the bus and enumerates devices and the Android powered device acts as the USB device Android USB accessories are specifically designed to attach to Android powered devices and adhere to a simple protocol Android accessory protocol that allows them to detect Android powered devices that support accessory mode br br br External hardware development br Development tools intended to help an Android device interact with external electronics include IOIO Android Open Accessory Development Kit Microbridge Triggertrap etc br br br Android Emulators br BlueStacks br Genymotion br LeapDroid br MIT App Inventor br Android Studio br Android x br Windows Subsystem for Android br br br Android Developer Challenge br br The Android Developer Challenge was a competition to find the most innovative application for Android Google offered prizes totaling million US dollars distributed between ADC I and ADC II ADC I accepted submissions from January to April The most promising entries announced on May each received a award to further development It ended in early September with the announcement of ten teams that received each and ten teams that received each br ADC II was announced on May The first round of the ADC II closed on October The first round winners of ADC II comprising the top applications were announced on November Voting for the second round also opened on the same day and ended on November Google announced the top winners of ADC II on November with SweetDreams What the Doodle and WaveSecure being nominated the overall winners of the challenge br br br Community based distributions br br There is a community of open source enthusiasts that build and share Android based distributions i e firmware with a number of customizations and additional features such as FLAC lossless audio support and the ability to store downloaded applications on the microSD card This usually involves rooting the device Rooting allows users root access to the operating system enabling full control of the phone Rooting has several disadvantages as well including increased risk of hacking high chances of bricking losing warranty increased virus attack risks etc It is also possible to install custom firmware although the device s boot loader must also be unlocked Custom firmware allows users of older phones to use applications available only on newer releases br Those firmware packages are updated frequently incorporate elements of Android functionality that haven t yet been officially released within a carrier sanctioned firmware and tend to have fewer limitations CyanogenMod and OMFGB are examples of such firmware br On September Google issued a cease and desist letter to the modder Cyanogen citing issues with the re distribution of Google s closed source applications within the custom firmware Even though most of Android OS is open source phones come packaged with closed source Google applications for functionality such as the Google Play and GPS navigation Google has asserted that these applications can only be provided through approved distribution channels by licensed distributors Cyanogen complied with Google s license and continued to distribute its mod without the proprietary software It provided a method to backup licensed Google applications during the mod s install process and restore them when the process is complete br br br Java standards br br Obstacles to development include the fact that Android does not use established Java standards that is Java SE and ME This prevents compatibility between Java applications written for those platforms and those written for the Android platform Android reuses the Java language syntax and semantics but it does not provide the full class libraries and APIs bundled with Java SE or ME However there are multiple tools in the market from companies such as Myriad Group and UpOnTek that provide Java ME to Android conversion services br Android provides its own GUI classes and does not provide Java AWT Swing or JavaFX It does not support the full Java Beans API br br br History and market share br Android was created by the Open Handset Alliance which is led by Google The early feedback on developing applications for the Android platform was mixed Issues cited include bugs lack of documentation inadequate QA infrastructure and no public issue tracking system Google announced an issue tracker on January In December MergeLab mobile startup founder Adam MacBeth stated Functionality is not there is poorly documented or just doesn t work It s clearly not ready for prime time Despite this Android targeted applications began to appear the week after the platform was announced The first publicly available application was the Snake game br A preview release of the Android SDK was released on November On July the Android Developer Challenge Team accidentally sent an email to all entrants in the Android Developer Challenge announcing that a new release of the SDK was available in a private download area The email was intended for winners of the first round of the Android Developer Challenge The revelation that Google was supplying new SDK releases to some developers and not others and keeping this arrangement private led to widely reported frustration within the Android developer community at the time br On August the Android SDK beta was released This release provided an updated and extended API improved development tools and an updated design for the home screen Detailed instructions for upgrading are available to those already working with an earlier release On September the Android SDK Release was released According to the release notes it included mainly bug fixes although some smaller features were added It also included several API changes from the version Multiple versions have been released since it was developed br On December Google announced the first Android Dev Phone a SIM unlocked and hardware unlocked device that is designed for advanced developers It was a modified version of HTC s Dream phone While developers can use regular consumer devices to test and use their applications some developers may choose a dedicated unlocked or no contract device br As of July more than one million applications have been developed for Android with over billion downloads A June research indicated that over of mobile developers used the platform at the time of publication Android smartphone shipments are forecast to exceed billion units in with an market share br br br See also br br Android Studio br List of free
