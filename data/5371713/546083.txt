id: 546083
Processing is a free graphics library and integrated development environment IDE built for the electronic arts new media art and visual design communities with the purpose of teaching non programmers the fundamentals of computer programming in a visual context br Processing uses the Java language with additional simplifications such as additional classes and aliased mathematical functions and operations It also provides a graphical user interface for simplifying the compilation and execution stage br The Processing language and IDE have been the precursor to other projects including Arduino and Wiring br br br History br The project was initiated in by Casey Reas and Ben Fry both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media Lab In they started the Processing Foundation along with Daniel Shiffman who joined as a third project lead Johanna Hedva joined the Foundation in as Director of Advocacy br Originally Processing had used the domain proce ing net because the processing domain was taken Reas and Fry eventually acquired the domain processing org and moved the project to it in While the original name had a combination of letters and numbers it was always officially referred to as processing but the abbreviated term p is still occasionally used e g in p js in reference to the old domain name br In the Processing Foundation was established and received c nonprofit status supporting the community around the tools and ideas that started with the Processing Project The foundation encourages people around the world to meet annually in local events called Processing Community Day br br br Features br br Processing includes a sketchbook a minimal alternative to an integrated development environment IDE for organizing projects br Every Processing sketch is actually a subclass of the PApplet Java class formerly a subclass of Java s built in Applet which implements most of the Processing language s features br When programming in Processing all additional classes defined will be treated as inner classes when the code is translated into pure Java before compiling This means that the use of static variables and methods in classes is prohibited unless Processing is explicitly told to code in pure Java mode br Processing also allows for users to create their own classes within the PApplet sketch This allows for complex data types that can include any number of arguments and avoids the limitations of solely using standard data types such as int integer char character float real number and color RGB RGBA hex br br br Examples br The simplest possible version of a Hello World program in Processing is br br However due to the more visually oriented nature of Processing the following code is a better example of the look and feel of the language br br br Awards br In Reas and Fry won the Golden Nica award from Ars Electronica in its Net Vision category for their work on Processing br Ben Fry won the National Design Award given by the Smithsonian Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum in the category of Interaction Design The award statement says br br Drawing on a background in graphic design and computer science Ben Fry pursues a long held fascination with visualizing data As Principal of Fathom Information Design in Boston Fry develops software printed works installations and books that depict and explain topics from the human genome to baseball salaries to the evolution of text documents With Casey Reas he founded the Processing Project an open source programming environment for teaching computational design and sketching interactive media software It provides artists and designers with accessible means of working with code while encouraging engineers and computer scientists to think about design concepts br br br License br Processing s core libraries the code included in exported applications and applets is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License allowing users to release their original code with a choice of license br The IDE is licensed under the GNU General Public License br br br Related projects br br br Design By Numbers br Processing was based on the original work done on Design By Numbers project at MIT It shares many of the same ideas and is a direct child of that experiment br br br p js br In Lauren McCarthy created p js a native JavaScript alternative to Processing js that has the official support of the Processing Foundation p js gained over million users br Since April p js has been led by Qianqian Ye an Adjunct Associate Professor of Media Arts at USC br br br ml js br ml js is a p js library developed by NYU s ITP IMA with funding and support provided by a Google Education grant br Daniel Shiffman has made videos demonstrating ml and is a notable code contributor br br br p play br p play is JavaScript game engine that uses p js for graphics and Box D for physics br Paolo Pedercini initiated p play version in Quinton Ashley became the project lead in and created p play version to bridge the gap between Scratch and Unity for young game developers br p play has been primarily adopted by middle and high school educators as a tool for introducing object oriented programming concepts It has more than monthly users br br br Processing js br Processing js is a discontinued JavaScript port that enabled existing Processing Java code to run on web br It was initially released in by John Resig The project was later run through a partnership between the Mozilla Foundation and Seneca College led by David Humphrey Al MacDonald and Corban Brook Processing js was kept at parity with Processing up to its API version release br The project was discontinued in December two years after its active development had stopped br br br P Py br p is a Python library that provides high level drawing functionality to help you quickly create simulations and interactive art using Python It combines the core ideas of Processing learning to code in a visual context with Python s readability to make programming more accessible to beginners educators and artists br br br Processing py br Python Mode for Processing or Processing py is a Python interface to the underlying Java toolkit It was chiefly developed by Jonathan Feinberg starting in with contributions from James Gilles and Ben Alkov br br br py br py is a version of Processing for Python It makes the Java Processing jars available to the CPython interpreter using JPype It can do just about everything Processing can do except with Python instead of Java code br br br Wiring Arduino and Fritzing br Processing has spawned another project Wiring which uses the Processing IDE with a collection of libraries written in the C language as a way to teach artists how to program microcontrollers There are now two separate hardware projects Wiring and Arduino using the Wiring environment and language br Fritzing is another software environment of the same sort which helps designers and artists to document their interactive prototypes and to take the step from physical prototyping to actual product br br br Mobile Processing br Another spin off project now defunct is Mobile Processing by Francis Li which allowed software written using the Processing language and environment to run on Java powered mobile devices Today some of the same functionality is provided by Processing itself br br br iProcessing br iProcessing was built to help people develop native iPhone applications using the Processing language It is an integration of the Processing js library and a Javascript application framework for iPhone br br br Spde br Spde Scala Processing Development Environment replaces Processing s reduced Java syntax and custom preprocessor with the off the shelf Scala programming language which also runs on the Java platform and enforces some of the same restrictions such as disallowing static methods while also allowing more concise code and supporting functional programming br br br JRubyArt br JRubyArt formerly named ruby processing is a wrapper for Processing in the Ruby language that runs on the Java platform using JRuby br br br Quil br Quil is an interactive animation library for Clojure and ClojureScript based on Processing br br br Media br The music video for House of Cards by Radiohead was created using Processing combined with data from lidar technology along with using acrylic glass and mirrors to create scenes in which the image appears distorted partially disappears or disintegrate as if being carried by wind Processing has also been used to create illustrations for publications such as Nature and The New York Times to output sculptures for gallery exhibitions to control huge video walls and to knit sweaters br br br See
