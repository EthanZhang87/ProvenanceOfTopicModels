title: Cross-cutting concern
id: 827182
In aspect oriented software development cross cutting concerns are aspects of a program that affect several modules without the possibility of being encapsulated in any of them br These concerns often cannot be cleanly decomposed from the rest of the system in both the design and implementation and can result in either scattering code duplication tangling significant dependencies between systems or both br For instance if writing an application for handling medical records the indexing of such records is a core concern while logging a history of changes to the record database or user database or an authentication system would be cross cutting concerns since they interact with more parts of the program br br br Background br Cross cutting concerns are parts of a program that rely on or must affect many other parts of the system They form the basis for the development of aspects Such cross cutting concerns do not fit cleanly into object oriented programming or procedural programming br Cross cutting concerns can be directly responsible for tangling or system inter dependencies within a program Because procedural and functional language constructs consist entirely of procedure calling there is no semantic through which two goals the capability to be implemented and the related cross cutting concern can be addressed simultaneously As a result the code addressing the cross cutting concern must be scattered or duplicated across the various related locations resulting in a loss of modularity br Aspect oriented programming aims to encapsulate cross cutting concerns into aspects to retain modularity This allows for the clean isolation and reuse of code addressing the cross cutting concern By basing designs on cross cutting concerns software engineering benefits can include modularity and simplified maintenance br br br Examples br Examples of concerns that tend to be cross cutting include br br Business rules br Caching br Code mobility br Data validation br Domain specific optimizations br Environment variables and other global configuration settings br Error detection and correction br Internationalization and localization which includes Language localisation br Information security br Logging br Memory management br Monitoring br Persistence br Product features br Real time constraints br Synchronization br Transaction processing br Context sensitive help br Privacy br Computer security br br br See also br Separation of concerns br Aspect oriented programming br Code refactoring restructuring software br Database normalization minimize needlessly replicated data br Multiple inheritance br Microservices br Orthogonalization mathematical normalization br br br br br br Bibliography br Kiczales Gregor Lamping John Mendhekar Anurag Maeda John Lopes Cristina Longtier Jean Marc Irwin Aspect Oriented Programming Proceedings of the th European Conference on Object Oriented Programming ECOOP br US patent Kiczales et al Aspect oriented programming issued br Li Harry Krishnamurthi Shriram Fisler Kathi Verifying Cross Cutting Features as Open Systems ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes CiteSeerX doi S CID br Parnas David L December On the Criteria To Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules Communications of the ACM CiteSeerX doi S CID br Tarr Peri Ossher Harold Harrison William Sutton Stanley M Jr N degrees of separation Multi dimensional separation of concerns Proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering IEEE Cat No CB Los Angeles California USA IEEE Computer Society Press pp CiteSeerX doi ICSE ISBN br br br Further reading br Laddad R AspectJ in Action Practical Aspect Oriented Programming Manning Publications Co br br br External links br AOSD net s glossary of aspect oriented terms via Internet Archive Wayback Machine AOSD net has become Modularity br AspectJ an Aspect Oriented extension to the Java programming language br Bergmans L M Aksit Composing Multiple Concerns Using Composition Filters https web archive org web http trese cs utwente nl July br Berg K van den Conejero J and Chitchyan R AOSD Ontology Public Ontology of Aspect Orientation AOSD Europe Network of Excellence http eprints eemcs utwente nl BergConChi pdf br Here is an example of handling a cross cutting concern https web archive org web https www captechconsulting com blogs a persistence pattern using threadlocal and ejb interceptors
