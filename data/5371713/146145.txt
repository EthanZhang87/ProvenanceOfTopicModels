title: Transport layer
id: 146145
In computer networking the transport layer is a conceptual division of methods in the layered architecture of protocols in the network stack in the Internet protocol suite and the OSI model The protocols of this layer provide end to end communication services for applications It provides services such as connection oriented communication reliability flow control and multiplexing br The details of implementation and semantics of the transport layer of the Internet protocol suite which is the foundation of the Internet and the OSI model of general networking are different The protocols in use today in this layer for the Internet all originated in the development of TCP IP In the OSI model the transport layer is often referred to as Layer or L while numbered layers are not used in TCP IP br The best known transport protocol of the Internet protocol suite is the Transmission Control Protocol TCP It is used for connection oriented transmissions whereas the connectionless User Datagram Protocol UDP is used for simpler messaging transmissions TCP is the more complex protocol due to its stateful design incorporating reliable transmission and data stream services Together TCP and UDP comprise essentially all traffic on the Internet and are the only protocols implemented in every major operating system Additional transport layer protocols that have been defined and implemented include the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol DCCP and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol SCTP br br br Services br Transport layer services are conveyed to an application via a programming interface to the transport layer protocols The services may include the following features br br Connection oriented communication It is normally easier for an application to interpret a connection as a data stream rather than having to deal with the underlying connection less models such as the datagram model of the User Datagram Protocol UDP and of the Internet Protocol IP br Same order delivery The network layer doesn t generally guarantee that packets of data will arrive in the same order that they were sent but often this is a desirable feature This is usually done through the use of segment numbering with the receiver passing them to the application in order This can cause head of line blocking br Reliability Packets may be lost during transport due to network congestion and errors By means of an error detection code such as a checksum the transport protocol may check that the data is not corrupted and verify correct receipt by sending an ACK or NACK message to the sender Automatic repeat request schemes may be used to retransmit lost or corrupted data br Flow control The rate of data transmission between two nodes must sometimes be managed to prevent a fast sender from transmitting more data than can be supported by the receiving data buffer causing a buffer overrun This can also be used to improve efficiency by reducing buffer underrun br Congestion avoidance Congestion control can control traffic entry into a telecommunications network so as to avoid congestive collapse by attempting to avoid oversubscription of any of the processing or link capabilities of the intermediate nodes and networks and taking resource reducing steps such as reducing the rate of sending packets For example automatic repeat requests may keep the network in a congested state this situation can be avoided by adding congestion avoidance to the flow control including slow start This keeps the bandwidth consumption at a low level in the beginning of the transmission or after packet retransmission br Multiplexing Ports can provide multiple endpoints on a single node For example the name on a postal address is a kind of multiplexing and distinguishes between different recipients of the same location Computer applications will each listen for information on their own ports which enables the use of more than one network service at the same time It is part of the transport layer in the TCP IP model but of the session layer in the OSI model br br br Analysis br The transport layer is responsible for delivering data to the appropriate application process on the host computers This involves statistical multiplexing of data from different application processes i e forming data segments and adding source and destination port numbers in the header of each transport layer data segment Together with the source and destination IP address the port numbers constitute a network socket i e an identification address of the process to process communication In the OSI model this function is supported by the session layer br Some transport layer protocols for example TCP but not UDP support virtual circuits i e provide connection oriented communication over an underlying packet oriented datagram network A byte stream is delivered while hiding the packet mode communication for the application processes This involves connection establishment dividing of the data stream into packets called segments segment numbering and reordering of out of order data br Finally some transport layer protocols for example TCP but not UDP provide end to end reliable communication i e error recovery by means of error detecting code and automatic repeat request ARQ protocol The ARQ protocol also provides flow control which may be combined with congestion avoidance br UDP is a very simple protocol and does not provide virtual circuits nor reliable communication delegating these functions to the application program UDP packets are called datagrams rather than segments br TCP is used for many protocols including HTTP web browsing and email transfer UDP may be used for multicasting and broadcasting since retransmissions are not possible to a large amount of hosts UDP typically gives higher throughput and shorter latency and is therefore often used for real time multimedia communication where packet loss occasionally can be accepted for example IP TV and IP telephony and for online computer games br Many non IP based networks such as X Frame Relay and ATM implement the connection oriented communication at the network or data link layer rather than the transport layer In X in telephone network modems and in wireless communication systems reliable node to node communication is implemented at lower protocol layers br The OSI connection mode transport layer protocol specification defines five classes of transport protocols TP providing the least error recovery to TP which is designed for less reliable networks br Due to protocol ossification TCP and UDP are the only widely used transport protocols on the Internet To avoid middlebox intolerance new transport protocols may mimic the wire image of a tolerated protocol or be encapsulated in UDP accepting some overhead e g due to outer checksums made redundant by inner integrity checks QUIC takes the latter approach rebuilding reliable stream transport on top of UDP br br br Protocols br This list shows some protocols that are commonly placed in the transport layers of the Internet protocol suite the OSI protocol suite NetWare s IPX SPX AppleTalk and

Interconnection Protocol for providing the connection mode transport service defines five classes of connection mode transport protocols designated class TP to class TP Class contains no error recovery and was designed for use on network layers that provide error free connections Class is closest to TCP although TCP contains functions such as the graceful close which OSI assigns to the session layer All OSI connection mode protocol classes provide expedited data and preservation of record boundaries Detailed characteristics of the classes are shown in the following table br br There
