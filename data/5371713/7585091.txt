id: 7585091
Squawk is a Java micro edition virtual machine for embedded system and small devices Most virtual machines for the Java platform are written in low level native languages such as C C and assembler what makes Squawk different is that Squawk s core is mostly written in Java this is called a meta circular interpreter A Java implementation provides ease of portability and integration of virtual machine and application resources such as objects threads and operating system interfaces br The Squawk Virtual Machine figure can be simplified as br br Write as much of the VM in Java as possible br Targeting small resource constrained devices br Enable Java for micro embedded development br The research project was inspired by Squeak Squawk has a Java ME heritage and features a small memory footprint It was developed to be simple with minimal external dependencies Its simplicity made it portable and easy to debug and maintain Squawk also provides an isolated mechanism by which an application is represented as an object In Squawk one or more applications can run in the single JVM Conceptually each application is completely isolated from all other applications br br br See also br br Sun SPOT br Jikes RVM another JVM written mostly in Java br Rubinius a VM for Ruby written in Ruby br MicroEJ VEE another JVM written mostly in an extended version of Java br List of Java virtual machines br br br br br br External links br SunSPOTs and Squawk technology Podcast br A Java Virtual Machine Architecture for Very Small Devices br The Squawk Virtual Machine Java TM on the Bare Metal br Javaone Squawk for Wireless Sensor Networks br Application Driven Customization of an Embedded Java Virtual Machine br Ahead of time deployment in ROM of a Java OS br Project Sun Spot br Squawk Poster
