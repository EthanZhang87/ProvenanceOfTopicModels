An application server is a server that hosts applications or software that delivers a business application through a communication protocol For a typical web application the application server sits behind the web servers br An application server framework is a service layer model It includes software components available to a software developer through an application programming interface An application server may have features such as clustering fail over and load balancing The goal is for developers to focus on the business logic br br br Java application servers br Jakarta EE formerly Java EE or J EE defines the core set of API and features of Java application servers br The Jakarta EE infrastructure is partitioned into logical containers br br EJB container Enterprise Beans are used to manage transactions According to the Java BluePrints the business logic of an application resides in Enterprise Beans a modular server component providing many features including declarative transaction management and improving application scalability br Web container the web modules include Jakarta Servlets and Jakarta Server Pages JSP br JCA container Jakarta Connectors br JMS provider Jakarta Messaging br Commercial Java application servers have been dominated by WebLogic Application Server by Oracle WebSphere Application Server from IBM and the open source JBoss Enterprise Application Platform JBoss EAP by Red Hat Another example of web server which can be used as an application server for the Java EE ecosystem is Apache Tomcat br br br Microsoft br Microsoft s NET positions their middle tier applications and services infrastructure in the Windows Server operating system and the NET Framework technologies in the role of an application server The Windows Application Server role includes Internet Information Services IIS to provide web server support the NET Framework to provide application support ASP NET to provide server side scripting COM for application component communication Message Queuing for multithreaded processing and the Windows Communication Foundation WCF for application communication br br br PHP application servers br PHP application servers run and manage PHP applications br br Zend Server built by Zend provides application server functionality for the PHP based applications br RoadRunner built by Spiral Scout is a high performance PHP application server load balancer and process manager written in Go br br br Third party br Mono a cross platform open source implementation of NET supporting nearly all its features with the exception of Windows OS specific features sponsored by Microsoft and released under the MIT License br br br Mobile application servers br Mobile application servers provide data delivery to mobile devices br br br Mobile features br Core capabilities of mobile application services include br br Data routing data is packaged in smaller REST objects with some business logic to minimize demands on bandwidth and battery br Orchestration transactions and data integration across multiple sources br Authentication service secure connectivity to back end systems is managed by the mobile middleware br Off line support allows users to access and use data even though the device is not connected br Security data encryption device control SSL call logging br br br Mobile challenges br Although most standards based infrastructure including SOAs are designed to connect to any independent of any vendor product or technology most enterprises have trouble connecting back end systems to mobile applications because mobile devices add the following technological challenges br br Limited resources mobile devices have limited power and bandwidth br Intermittent connectivity cellular service and wifi coverage is often not continuous br Difficult to secure mobility and BYOD practices make it hard to secure mobile devices br br br Deployment models br An application server can be deployed br br On premises br Cloud br Private cloud br Platform as a service PaaS br br br See also br Application service provider br List of application servers br br br
