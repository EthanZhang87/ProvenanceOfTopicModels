Jakarta XML Binding JAXB formerly Java Architecture for XML Binding is a software framework that allows Java EE developers to map Java classes to XML representations JAXB provides two main features the ability to marshal Java objects into XML and the inverse i e to unmarshal XML back into Java objects In other words JAXB allows storing and retrieving data in memory in any XML format without the need to implement a specific set of XML loading and saving routines for the program s class structure It is similar to xsd exe and XmlSerializer in the NET Framework br JAXB is particularly useful when the specification is complex and changing In such a case regularly changing the XML Schema definitions to keep them synchronised with the Java definitions can be time consuming and error prone br JAXB is one of the APIs in the Jakarta EE platform formerly Java EE part of the Java Web Services Development Pack JWSDP and one of the foundations for WSIT It was also part of the Java SE platform in version Java SE As of Java SE JAXB was removed For details see JEP br JAXB was released in having been developed under the Java Community Process as JSR In JAXB was released under JSR and Maintenance Release released in December Reference implementations for these specifications were available under the CDDL open source license at java net br br br Usage br The tool xjc can be used to convert XML Schema and other schema file types as of Java RELAX NG XML DTD and WSDL are supported experimentally to class representations Classes are marked up using annotations from javax xml bind annotation namespace for example XmlRootElement and XmlElement XML list sequences are represented by attributes of type java util List Marshallers and Unmarshallers are created through an instance of JAXBContext br In addition JAXB includes a schemagen tool that can essentially perform the inverse of xjc creating an XML Schema from a set of annotated classes br br br Default data type bindings br The table below lists the mappings of XML Schema XSD data types to Java data types in JAXB br br br Versions br Java SE JAXB in module java xml bind this module is marked as deprecated br Java SE JAXB br Java SE JAXB JSR maintenance release br Java SE JAXB JSR br br br See also br XML data binding br JiBX br XMLBeans a similar and complementary technology to JAXB from Apache Software Foundation br TopLink an object to relational and object to XML mapper from Oracle that supports JAXB br EclipseLink MOXy open source implementation of JAXB and object XML mapping services under the Eclipse Foundation br Liquid XML Studio Commercial tool for XML data binding code generation br br br br br br External links br Official website Reference Implementation on Project GlassFish br Previous JAXB home page br Original JAXB home page Archived at the Wayback Machine br A JAXB Tutorial by Wolfgang Laun br JSR JAXB br JSR JAXB br The Java EE Tutorial Binding between XML Schema and Java Classes JAXB chapter of the Java EE Tutorial br JAXB Wizard Archived at the Wayback Machine br JAXB Tutorials br br br Articles br JAXB offers improved XML binding in Java br XML and Java technologies Data binding Part Performance
