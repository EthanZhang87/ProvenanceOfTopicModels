title: Distributed transaction
id: 619053
A distributed transaction is a database transaction in which two or more network hosts are involved Usually hosts provide transactional resources while a transaction manager creates and manages a global transaction that encompasses all operations against such resources Distributed transactions as any other transactions must have all four ACID atomicity consistency isolation durability properties where atomicity guarantees all or nothing outcomes for the unit of work operations bundle br The Open Group a vendor consortium proposed the X Open Distributed Transaction Processing Model X Open XA which became a de facto standard for the behavior of transaction model components br Databases are common transactional resources and often transactions span a couple of such databases In this case a distributed transaction can be seen as a database transaction that must be synchronized or provide ACID properties among multiple participating databases which are distributed among different physical locations The isolation property the I of ACID poses a special challenge for multi database transactions since the global serializability property could be violated even if each database provides it see also global serializability In practice most commercial database systems use strong strict two phase locking SS PL for concurrency control which ensures global serializability if all the participating databases employ it br A common algorithm for ensuring correct completion of a distributed transaction is the two phase commit PC This algorithm is usually applied for updates able to commit in a short period of time ranging from couple of milliseconds to couple of minutes br There are also long lived distributed transactions for example a transaction to book a trip which consists of booking a flight a rental car and a hotel Since booking the flight might take up to a day to get a confirmation two phase commit is not applicable here it will lock the resources for this long In this case more sophisticated techniques that involve multiple undo levels are used The way you can undo the hotel booking by calling a desk and cancelling the reservation a system can be designed to undo certain operations unless they are irreversibly finished br In practice long lived distributed transactions are implemented in systems based on web services Usually these transactions utilize principles of compensating transactions Optimism and Isolation Without Locking The X Open standard does not cover long lived distributed transactions br Several technologies including Jakarta Enterprise Beans and Microsoft Transaction Server fully support distributed transaction standards br br br See also br Java Transaction API br Enduro X open source X Open XA and XATMI implementation br br br br br Web Services Transactions Archived from the original on May Retrieved May br Nuts And Bolts Of Transaction Processing Article about Transaction Management Archived from the original on July Retrieved May br A Detailed Comparison of Enterprise JavaBeans EJB The Microsoft Transaction Server MTS Models br br br Further reading br Gerhard Weikum Gottfried Vossen Transactional information systems theory algorithms and the practice of concurrency control and recovery Morgan Kaufmann ISBN
