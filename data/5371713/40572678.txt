id: 40572678
Object storage also known as object based storage or blob storage is a computer data storage approach that manages data as blobs or objects as opposed to other storage architectures like file systems which manage data as a file hierarchy and block storage which manages data as blocks within sectors and tracks Each object is typically associated with a variable amount of metadata and a globally unique identifier Object storage can be implemented at multiple levels including the device level object storage device the system level and the interface level In each case object storage seeks to enable capabilities not addressed by other storage architectures like interfaces that are directly programmable by the application a namespace that can span multiple instances of physical hardware and data management functions like data replication and data distribution at object level granularity br Object storage systems allow retention of massive amounts of unstructured data in which data is written once and read once or many times Object storage is used for purposes such as storing objects like videos and photos on Facebook songs on Spotify or files in online collaboration services such as Dropbox One of the limitations with object storage is that it is not intended for transactional data as object storage was not designed to replace NAS file access and sharing it does not support the locking and sharing mechanisms needed to maintain a single accurately updated version of a file br br Jim Starkey coined the term blob working at Digital Equipment Corporation to refer to opaque data entities The terminology was adopted for Rdb VMS Blob is often humorously explained to be an abbreviation for binary large object According to Starkey this backronym arose when Terry McKiever working in marketing at Apollo Computer felt that the term needed to be an abbreviation McKiever began using the expansion Basic Large Object This was later eclipsed by the retroactive explanation of blobs as Binary Large Objects According to Starkey Blob don t stand for nothin Rejecting the acronym he explained his motivation behind the coinage saying A blob is the thing that ate Cincinnatti sic Cleveland or whatever referring to the science fiction film The Blob br In research led by Garth Gibson on Network Attached Secure Disks first promoted the concept of splitting less common operations like namespace manipulations from common operations like reads and writes to optimize the performance and scale of both In the same year a Belgian company FilePool was established to build the basis for archiving functions Object storage was proposed at Gibson s Carnegie Mellon University lab as a research project in Another key concept was abstracting the writes and reads of data to more flexible data containers objects Fine grained access control through object storage architecture was further described by one of the NASD team Howard Gobioff who later was one of the inventors of the Google File System br Other related work includes the Coda filesystem project at Carnegie Mellon which started in and spawned the Lustre file system There is also the OceanStore project at UC Berkeley which started in and the Logistical Networking project at the University of Tennessee Knoxville which started in In Gibson founded Panasas to commercialize the concepts developed by the NASD team br br Seagate Technology played a central role in the development of object storage According to the Storage Networking Industry Association SNIA Object storage originated in the late s Seagate specifications from Introduced some of the first commands and how operating system effectively removed from consumption of the storage br A preliminary version of the OBJECT BASED STORAGE DEVICES Command Set Proposal dated was submitted by Seagate as edited by Seagate s Dave Anderson and was the product of work by the National Storage Industry Consortium NSIC including contributions by Carnegie Mellon University Seagate IBM Quantum and StorageTek This paper was proposed to INCITS T International Committee for Information Technology Standards with a goal to form a committee and design a specification based on the SCSI interface protocol This defined objects as abstracted data with unique identifiers and metadata how objects related to file systems along with many other innovative concepts Anderson presented many of these ideas at the SNIA conference in October The presentation revealed an IP Agreement that had been signed in February between the original collaborators with Seagate represented by Anderson and Chris Malakapalli and covered the benefits of object storage scalable computing platform independence and storage management br br One of the design principles of object storage is to abstract some of the lower layers of storage away from the administrators and applications Thus data is exposed and managed as objects instead of blocks or exclusively files Objects contain additional descriptive properties which can be used for better indexing or management Administrators do not have to perform lower level storage functions like constructing and managing logical volumes to utilize disk capacity or setting RAID levels to deal with disk failure br Object storage also allows the addressing and identification of individual objects by more than just file name and file path Object storage adds a unique identifier within a bucket or across the entire system to support much larger namespaces and eliminate name collisions br br Object storage explicitly separates file metadata from data to support additional capabilities br As opposed to fixed metadata in file systems filename creation date type etc object storage provides for full function custom object level metadata in order to br br Capture application specific or user specific information for better indexing purposes br Support data management policies e g a policy to drive object movement from one storage tier to another br Centralize management of storage across many individual nodes and clusters br Optimize metadata storage e g encapsulated database or key value storage and caching indexing when authoritative metadata is encapsulated with the metadata inside the object independently from the data storage e g unstructured binary storage br Additionally in some object based file system implementations br br The file system clients only contact metadata servers once when the file is opened and then get content directly via object storage servers vs block based file systems which would require constant metadata access br Data objects can be configured on a per file basis to allow adaptive stripe width even across multiple object storage servers supporting optimizations in bandwidth and I O br Object based storage devices OSD as well as some software implementations e g DataCore Swarm manage metadata and data at the storage device level br br Instead of providing a block oriented interface that reads and writes fixed sized blocks of data data is organized into flexible sized data containers called objects br Each object has both data an uninterpreted sequence of bytes and metadata an extensible set of attributes describing the object physically encapsulating both together benefits recoverability br The command interface includes commands to create and delete objects write bytes and read bytes to and from individual objects and to set and get attributes on objects br Security mechanisms provide per object and per command access control br br Object storage provides programmatic interfaces to allow applications to manipulate data At the base level this includes Create read update and delete CRUD functions for basic read write and delete operations Some object storage implementations go further supporting additional functionality like object file versioning object replication life cycle management and movement of objects between different tiers and types of storage Most API implementations are REST based allowing the use of many standard HTTP calls br br The vast majority of cloud storage available in the market leverages an object storage architecture Some notable examples are Amazon Web Services S which debuted in March Microsoft Azure Blob Storage Rackspace Cloud Files whose code was donated in to Openstack project and released as OpenStack Swift and Google Cloud Storage released in May br br Some distributed file systems use an object based architecture where file metadata is stored in metadata servers and file data is stored in object storage servers File system client software interacts with the distinct servers and abstracts them to present a full file system to users and applications br br Some early incarnations of object storage were used for archiving as implementations were optimized for data services like immutability not performance EMC Centera and Hitachi HCP formerly known as HCAP are two commonly cited object storage products for archiving Another example is Quantum ActiveScale Object Storage Platform br More general purpose object storage systems came to market around Lured by the incredible growth of captive storage systems within web applications like Yahoo Mail and the early success of cloud storage object storage systems promised the scale and capabilities of cloud storage with the ability to deploy the system within an enterprise or at an aspiring cloud storage service provider br br A few object storage systems support Unified File and Object storage allowing clients to store objects on a storage system while simultaneously other clients store files on the same storage system Other vendors in the area of Hybrid cloud storage are using Cloud storage gateways to provide a file access layer over object storage implementing file access protocols such as SMB and NFS br br Some large Internet companies developed their own software when object storage products were not commercially available or use cases were very specific Facebook famously invented their own object storage software code named Haystack to address their particular massive scale photo management needs efficiently br br Object storage at the protocol and device layer was proposed years ago and approved for the SCSI command set nearly years ago as Object based Storage Device Commands OSD however it had not been put into production until the development of the Seagate Kinetic Open Storage platform The SCSI command set for Object Storage Devices was developed by a working group of the SNIA for the T committee of the International Committee for Information Technology Standards INCITS T is responsible for all SCSI standards br br One of the first object storage products Lustre is used in of the Top supercomputers and of the Top As of June this includes of the top including the current fourth fastest system on the list China s Tianhe and the seventh fastest the Titan supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory br Object storage systems had good adoption in the early s as an archive platform particularly in the wake of compliance laws like Sarbanes Oxley After five years in the market EMC s Centera product claimed over customers and petabytes shipped by Hitachi s HCP product also claims many petabyte scale customers Newer object storage systems have also gotten some traction particularly around very large custom applications like eBay s auction site where EMC Atmos is used to manage over million objects a day As of March EMC claims to have sold over exabytes of Atmos storage On July Los Alamos National Lab chose the Scality RING as the basis for a petabyte storage environment which would be among the largest ever br Captive object storage systems like Facebook s Haystack have scaled impressively In April Haystack was managing billion photos and petabytes of storage adding million photos and terabytes a week Facebook more recently stated that they were adding million photos a day and were storing billion photos This could equal as much as petabytes br Cloud storage has become pervasive as many new web and mobile applications choose it as a common way to store binary data As the storage back end to many popular applications like Smugmug and Dropbox Amazon S has grown to massive scale citing over trillion objects stored in April Two months later Microsoft claimed that they stored even more objects in Azure at trillion By April Azure claimed over trillion objects stored Windows Azure Storage manages Blobs user files Tables structured storage and Queues message delivery and counts them all as objects br br IDC has begun to assess the object based storage market annually using its MarketScape methodology IDC describes the MarketScape as a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the characteristics that assess a vendor s current and future success in the said market or market segment and provide a measure of their ascendancy to become a Leader or maintain a leadership IDC MarketScape assessments are particularly helpful in emerging markets that are often fragmented have several players and lack clear leaders br In IDC rated Dell EMC Hitachi Data Systems IBM NetApp and Scality as leaders br br In the first version of the OSD standard objects are specified with a bit partition ID and a bit object ID Partitions are created and deleted within an OSD and objects are created and deleted within partitions There are no fixed sizes associated with partitions or objects they are allowed to grow subject to physical size limitations of the device or logical quota constraints on a partition br An extensible set of attributes describe objects Some attributes are implemented directly by the OSD such as the number of bytes in an object and the modification time of an object There is a special policy tag attribute that is part of the security mechanism Other attributes are uninterpreted by the OSD These are set on objects by the higher level storage systems that use the OSD for persistent storage For example attributes might be used to classify objects or to capture relationships among different objects stored on different OSDs br A list command returns a list of identifiers for objects within a partition optionally filtered by matches against their attribute values A list command can also return selected attributes of the listed objects br Read and write commands can be combined or piggy backed with commands to get and set attributes This ability reduces the number of times a high level storage system has to cross the interface to the OSD which can improve overall efficiency br br A second generation of the SCSI command set Object Based Storage Devices OSD added support for snapshots collections of objects and improved error handling br A snapshot is a point in time copy of all the objects in a partition into a new partition The OSD can implement a space efficient copy using copy on write techniques so that the two partitions share objects that are unchanged between the snapshots or the OSD might physically copy the data to the new partition The standard defines clones which are writeable and snapshots which are read only br A collection is a special kind of object that contains the identifiers of other objects There are operations to add and delete from collections and there are operations to get or set attributes for all the objects in a collection Collections are also used for error reporting If an object becomes damaged by the occurrence of a media defect i e a bad spot on the disk or by a software error within the OSD implementation its identifier is put into a special error collection The higher level storage system that uses the OSD can query this collection and take corrective action as necessary br br The border between an object store and a key value store is blurred with key value stores being sometimes loosely referred to as object stores br A traditional block storage interface uses a series of fixed size blocks which are numbered starting at Data must be that exact fixed size and can be stored in a particular block which is identified by its logical block number LBN Later one can retrieve that block of data by specifying its unique LBN br With a key value store data is identified by a key rather than a LBN A key might be cat or olive or It can be an arbitrary sequence of bytes of arbitrary length Data called a value in this parlance does not need to be a fixed size and also can be an arbitrary sequence of bytes of arbitrary length One stores data by presenting the key and data value to the data store and can later retrieve the data by presenting the key This concept is seen in programming languages Python calls them dictionaries Perl calls them hashes Java and C call them maps etc Several data stores also implement key value stores such as Memcached Redis and CouchDB br Object stores are similar to key value stores in two respects First the object identifier or URL the equivalent of the key can be an arbitrary string Second data may be of an arbitrary size br There are however a few key differences between key value stores and object stores First object stores also allow one to associate a limited set of attributes metadata with each piece of data The combination of a key value and set of attributes is referred to as an object Second object stores are optimized for large amounts of data hundreds of megabytes or even gigabytes whereas for key value stores the value is expected to be relatively small kilobytes Finally object stores usually offer weaker consistency guarantees such as eventual consistency whereas key value stores offer strong consistency br br Block storage br File storage br Cloud storage br Clustered file system br Object access method
