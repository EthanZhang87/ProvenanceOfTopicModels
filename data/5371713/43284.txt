title: Java remote method invocation
id: 43284
The Java Remote Method Invocation Java RMI is a Java API that performs remote method invocation the object oriented equivalent of remote procedure calls RPC with support for direct transfer of serialized Java classes and distributed garbage collection br The original implementation depends on Java Virtual Machine JVM class representation mechanisms and it thus only supports making calls from one JVM to another The protocol underlying this Java only implementation is known as Java Remote Method Protocol JRMP In order to support code running in a non JVM context programmers later developed a CORBA version br Usage of the term RMI may denote solely the programming interface or may signify both the API and JRMP IIOP or another implementation whereas the term RMI IIOP read RMI over IIOP specifically denotes the RMI interface delegating most of the functionality to the supporting CORBA implementation br The basic idea of Java RMI the distributed garbage collection DGC protocol and much of the architecture underlying the original Sun implementation come from the network objects feature of Modula br br br Generalized code br The programmers of the original RMI API generalized the code somewhat to support different implementations such as a HTTP transport Additionally the ability to pass arguments by value was added to CORBA in order to be compatible with the RMI interface Still the RMI IIOP and JRMP implementations do not have fully identical interfaces br RMI functionality comes in the package java rmi while most of Sun s implementation is located in the sun rmi package Note that with Java versions before Java developers had to compile RMI stubs in a separate compilation step using rmic Version of Java and beyond no longer require this step br br br Jini version br Jini offers a more advanced version of RMI in Java It functions similarly but provides more advanced security object discovery capabilities and other mechanisms for distributed object applications br br br Example br The following classes implement a simple client server program using RMI that displays a message br br RmiServerIntf interface br defines the interface that is used by the client and implemented by the server br br RmiServer class br listens to RMI requests and implements the interface which is used by the client to invoke remote methods br br RmiClient class br this is the client which gets the reference a proxy to the remote object living on the server and invokes its method to get a message If the server object implemented java io Serializable instead of java rmi Remote it would be serialized and passed to the client as a value br br Before running this example we need to make a stub file for the interface we used For this task we have the RMI compiler rmic br br Note we make a stub file from the class file with the implementation of the remote interface not from the java file br rmic RmiServer br br Note that since version of J SE support for dynamically generated stub files has been added and rmic is only provided for backwards compatibility with earlier runtimes or for programs that don t provide an explicit port number or zero when exporting remote objects which is required for generated stubs to be possible as described in the Javadoc for UnicastRemoteObject See the comment in the constructor above br br br br br br External links br Remote Method Invocation Home Oracle Technology Network for Java Developers Redwood Shores CA USA Oracle Corporation Retrieved br The Java RMI tutorial a good starting point to learn RMI Also check the Hello World in RMI br the Java RMI online training Very good for training JavaRMI and as reference br The RMI page in the JDK docs br java rmi Sun s Java API Reference for the RMI package br Ann Wollrath Roger Riggs Jim Waldo A Distributed Object Model for the Java System PDF Archived PDF from the original on Retrieved br Programming WebLogic RMI an introduction to RMI in Oracle Weblogic br General Remote Method Invocation
