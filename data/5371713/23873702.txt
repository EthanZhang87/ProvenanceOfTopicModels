Self publishing is the publication of media by its author at their own cost without the involvement of a publisher The term usually refers to written media such as books and magazines either as an ebook or as a physical copy using print on demand technology It may also apply to albums pamphlets brochures games video content artwork and zines Web fiction is also a major medium for self publishing br br br Definitions br Although self publishing is not a new phenomenon dating back to the th century it has transformed during the internet age with new technologies and services providing increasing alternatives to traditional publishing becoming a billion market However with the increased ease of publishing and the range of services available confusion has arisen as to what constitutes self publishing In the Society of Authors and the Writers Guild of Great Britain produced a free downloadable guide to the various distinct types of publishing currently available br br br Self publishing vs hybrid publishing and vanity publishing br In self publishing authors publish their own book It is possible for an author to single handedly carry out the whole process However increasingly authors are recognizing that to compete effectively they need to produce a high quality product and they are engaging professionals for specific services as needed such as editors or cover designers A growing number of companies offer a one stop shop where an author can source a whole range of services required to self publish a book sometimes called Assisted Self publishing Providers or Self publishing Service Providers br Not to be confused with br br hybrid publishing where the publisher and author collaborate and share costs and risks In return the author may be required to surrender some control and or rights in return for the publisher s financial and other contribution OR br vanity publishing where the author pays for the cost of all services but also signs a restrictive contract which usually involves surrendering significant rights br It has been suggested that the best test for whether a company offers Assisted Self publishing Services or Hybrid vanity publishing is to apply a variant of Yog s Law which states the following br br Yog s Law Money flows toward the writer br Self Publishing Corollary to Yog s Law While in the process of self publishing money and rights are controlled by the writer br Therefore if a company offers services to the author without claiming any rights and allows the author to control the entire process they are assisting the author to self publish Whereas if the company takes some rights and or takes control of artistic decisions they are a hybrid publisher or a vanity publisher depending on the degree of involvement br br br History br br br Early examples br br Historically some authors have chosen to self publish Successful examples are John Locke Jane Austen Emily Dickinson Nathaniel Hawthorne Martin Luther Marcel Proust Derek Walcott and Walt Whitman In British satirist Laurence Sterne self published the first two volumes of Tristram Shandy In Ezra Pound sold A Lume Spento for six pence each Franklin Hiram King s book Farmers of Forty Centuries was self published in and was subsequently published commercially In Irma S Rombauer the author of The Joy of Cooking paid a local printing company to print copies the Bobbs Merrill Company acquired the rights and since then the book has sold over million copies In writer Virginia Woolf chose to self publish her final novel Between the Acts on her Hogarth Press in effect starting her own press Self publication was also known in music Joseph Haydn self published his oratorio The Creation in br br br Stigma br Five years ago self publishing was a scar Now it s a tattoo br Traditional publishers are extremely selective in what they publish and reject most of the manuscripts submitted to them In spite of that rigorous selection they then assign an editor to polish the work even further a proof reader to check for errors and a designer to produce the cover It can be challenging for a self publishing author to produce a book to traditional professional standards br Before the advent of the internet and POD Print on Demand most self publishing authors had to resort to a vanity press which was very costly and acted as a barrier to publication Now ebooks can be published at virtually no cost and the market has been flooded with poorly produced books Some estimate that as much as of published ebooks are so bad they are unreadable br However some self published authors are now taking a professional approach using services like critique groups beta readers professional editors and designers to polish their work to a professional standard equivalent to traditional publishing Such authors are achieving success equivalent to traditionally published writers lending respectability to self publishing br Self publishing is also common among editors of academic journals The study showed that a quarter of them publish of their own articles in the same journals they edit which is problematic for ethical reasons br br br Technological changes br br A huge impetus to self publishing has been rapid advances in technology Print On Demand or POD technology which became available in the mid s makes it possible for a book to be printed after an order has been placed so there are no costs for storing inventory Further the Internet provides access to global distribution channels via online retailers so a self published book can be instantly available to book buyers worldwide Advances in e book readers and tablet computers have improved readability making ebooks more popular br Amazon s introduction of the Kindle and its self publishing platform Kindle Direct Publishing or KDP in has been described as a tipping point in self publishing which opened the floodgates for self publishing authors br br The Espresso Book Machine a POD device was first demonstrated at the New York Public Library in This machine prints collates covers and binds a single book It is in libraries and bookstores throughout the world and it can make copies of out of print editions Small bookstores sometimes use it to compete with large bookstore chains It works by taking two pdf files one for the text and one for the cover and then prints an entire paperback book in a matter of minutes which then drops down a chute br The Library Journal and Biblioboard worked together to create a self publishing platform called Self e in which authors submitted books online which were made available to readers These books are reviewed by Library Journal and the best ones are published nationwide authors do not make money this way but it serves as a marketing tool br br br Advantages of self publishing br Speed In traditional publishing an author must first find an agent then the agent must find a publisher then it may take a year or more for the book to go through editing and be allocated a slot in the publisher s calendar With self publishing it is possible to release a book within a few weeks after it is finished br No start up costs It costs nothing to upload a book to most publishing platforms and print copies do not have to be paid for until a customer orders br Artistic control A traditional publisher may demand changes to meet market demands br Control on pricing The author decides the price and can change it at any point of time br A greater share of royalties Self published authors may earn four to five times more per unit than if an author works with a traditional publisher sometimes percent of the sale price br Pitch books straight to the readers There is no intermediary censoring what might be shown to the public The route to readers is more direct br br br Disadvantages of self publishing br Stigma Self published books still have to combat prejudice due to the lack of gatekeepers to ensure quality br No physical presence Traditional publishers distribute their books to high street bookstores on a sale or return basis which is unaffordable for a self published author and libraries routinely order from the publisher s catalogues br No advance Traditional publishers will usually pay an advance so the author receives some payment for the book even if it is unsuccessful br No free support Traditional publishers pay all the costs associated with producing the book and will provide an editor and cover designer at their expense br Cost The obvious corollary of the above is that the self published author must pay all their own expenses Though it is possible to publish a book free of charge marketing and promotion are expensive br Marketing and promotion are time consuming and costly Marketing is a task that many authors are not skilled at UK author Rachel Abbott was working hour days promoting her book Only the Innocent while she eventually made it to the UK Kindle bestseller chart she still had difficulty getting the publishing world to take her book seriously Another writer Ros Barber thinks self publishing is a terrible idea for serious novelists since the requirements of marketing and promoting a book will prevent one from writing and he continues to recommend the traditional approach br br br Publishing platforms br In order to be purchased by a customer the
