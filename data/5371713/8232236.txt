OpenJDK Open Java Development Kit is a free and open source implementation of the Java Platform Standard Edition Java SE It is the result of an effort Sun Microsystems began in The implementation is licensed under the GPL only with a linking exception Were it not for the GPL linking exception components that linked to the Java Class Library would be subject to the terms of the GPL license OpenJDK is the official reference implementation of Java SE since version br br br Components br The OpenJDK project produces a number of components most importantly the virtual machine HotSpot the Java Class Library and the Java compiler javac br The web browser plugin and Web Start which form part of Oracle Java are not included in OpenJDK Sun previously indicated that they would try to open source these components but neither Sun nor Oracle have done so br The only currently available free plugin and Web Start implementations as of are those provided by IcedTea br OpenJDK supports AOT compilation jaotc using GraalVM JEP The experimental XX EnableJVMCIProduct flag enables the use of Graal JIT JEP br br br OpenJDK versions br OpenJDK was initially based only on the JDK version of the Java platform br Since JDK the effort to produce an open source reference implementation of the Java SE Platform was moved over to the JDK Project Unlike past JDK Release Projects which produced just one feature release and then terminated this long running project will produce all future JDK feature releases and will ship a feature release every six months according to a strict time based model br br br OpenJDK builds br br Due to Oracle no longer releasing updates for long term support LTS releases under a permissive license others have begun offering builds Linux distributions have always offered their own builds and Windows also offers one now which can be installed with the Windows Package Manager For example to install OpenJDK br winget install Microsoft OpenJDK br br br IcedTea and inclusion in software distributions br br In order to bundle OpenJDK in Fedora and other free Linux distributions OpenJDK needed to be buildable using only free software components Due to the encumbered components in the class library and implicit assumptions within the build system that the JDK being used to build OpenJDK was a Sun JDK this was not possible To achieve openness Red Hat started the IcedTea project in June br It began life as an OpenJDK GNU Classpath hybrid that could be used to bootstrap OpenJDK replacing the encumbrances with code from GNU Classpath br On November Red Hat signed both the Sun Contributor Agreement and the OpenJDK Community TCK License One of the first benefits of this agreement is tighter alignment with the IcedTea project which brings together Fedora the Linux distribution and JBoss the application server technologies in a Linux environment IcedTea provided free software alternatives for the few remaining proprietary sections in the OpenJDK project br In May the Fedora and Ubuntu br distributions included IcedTea based completely on free and open source code Fedora was the first version to be shipped with IcedTea based on the OpenJDK sources from Sun rather than OpenJDK It was also the first to use OpenJDK for the package name via the OpenJDK trademark agreement instead of IcedTea Ubuntu also first packaged IcedTea before later moving to IcedTea Packages for IcedTea were also created for Debian and included in Lenny On July Debian accepted OpenJDK in unstable and it later was included in stable OpenJDK is also available on openSUSE Red Hat Enterprise Linux and RHEL derivatives such as CentOS br In June Red Hat announced that the packaged binaries for OpenJDK on Fedora built using IcedTea had passed the Technology Compatibility Kit tests and could claim to be a fully compatible Java implementation In July an IcedTea binary build for Ubuntu passed all of the compatibility tests in the Java SE TCK br Since August OpenJDK is usable on macOS and other BSD variants br On Android Nougat OpenJDK replaced the now discontinued Apache Harmony as the Java libraries in the source code of the mobile operating system Google was in a legal dispute with Oracle over claims of copyright and patent infringement through its use of re implementations of copyrighted Java APIs via Harmony While also stating that this change was to create a more consistent platform between Java on Android and other platforms the company admitted that the switch was motivated by the lawsuit arguing that Oracle had authorized its use of the OpenJDK code by licensing it under the GPL br br br History br br br Sun s promise and initial release br Sun announced in JavaOne that Java would become open source software and on October at the Oracle OpenWorld conference Jonathan Schwartz said that the company intended to announce the open sourcing of the core Java Platform within to days br Sun released the Java HotSpot virtual machine and compiler as free software under the GNU General Public License on November with a promise that the rest of the JDK which includes the Java Runtime Environment would be placed under the GPL by March except for a few components that Sun does not have the right to publish in source form under the GPL According to free software advocate Richard Stallman this would end the Java trap the vendor lock in that he argues applied to Java and programs written in Java br br br Release of the class library br Following their promise to release a Java Development Kit JDK based almost completely on free and open source code in the first half of Sun released the complete source code of the Java Class Library under the GPL on May except for some limited parts that had been licensed to Sun by third parties and Sun was unable to re license under the GPL Included in the list of encumbered parts were several major components of the Java graphical user interface GUI Sun stated that it planned to replace the remaining proprietary components with alternative implementations and to make the class library completely free br When initially released in May of the OpenJDK class library remained proprietary By the appearance of OpenJDK in May less than the SNMP implementation which is not part of the Java specification remained making it possible to build OpenJDK without any binary plugs The binary plug requirement was later dropped from OpenJDK as part of b in April br This was made possible over the course of the first year by the work of Sun Microsystems and the OpenJDK community Each encumbrance was either released as free and open source software or replaced with an alternative Beginning in December all the so called binary plugs were replaced by open source replacements making the whole JDK open sourced and the binary plugs not necessary anymore br br br Community improvements br On November Red Hat announced an agreement with Sun signing Sun s broad contributor agreement which covers participation in all Sun led free and open source software projects by all Red Hat engineers and Sun s OpenJDK Community Technology Compatibility Kit TCK License Agreement which gives the company access to the test suite that determines whether a project based on OpenJDK complies with the Java SE specification br Also in November the Porters Group was created on OpenJDK to aid in efforts to port OpenJDK to different processor architectures and operating systems The BSD porting project led by Kurt Miller and Greg Lewis and the Mac OS X porting project based on the BSD one led by Landon Fuller have expressed interest in joining OpenJDK via the Porters Group As of January both are part of the mailing list discussions Another project pending formalization on the Porters Group is the Haiku Java Team led by Bryan Varner br In December Sun moved the revision control of OpenJDK from TeamWare to Mercurial and later to Git and GitHub as part of the process of releasing it to open source communities br OpenJDK has comparatively strict procedures of accepting code contributions every proposed contribution must be reviewed by another OpenJDK committer and the contributor must have signed the Sun Oracle Contributor Agreement SCA OCA Preferably there should also be a jtreg test demonstrating the bug has been fixed Initially the external patch submission process was slow and until September commits to the codebase were only made by Sun engineers The process has improved and as of simple patches and backports from OpenJDK to OpenJDK can take place within hours rather than days br In an unofficial port of OpenJDK to OS was first released This port is included in the OS derivative ArcaOS br On September Microsoft and Azul Systems collaborated to create Zulu a build of OpenJDK for users of the Windows Azure cloud Zulu is available as a free download from the community site Zulu org It is also possible to get Zulu on Amazon Web Services via Canonical s Juju Charm Store the Docker Hub and Azul Systems repositories Azul contributes bug fixes and enhancements back to the OpenJDK project and has several project committers on staff Red Hat resigned leadership of OpenJDK at the beginning of and this was then taken up by Azul Systems br Since April there are unsupported community builds of OpenJDK for Microsoft Windows on GitHub in the project ojdkbuild which are released in pace with updates for Oracle JDK From build u on the MSI installer offers an optional component for using Java Web Start based on the IcedTea Web project br In a port of OpenJDK to OpenVMS on the Itanium platform was released br The number of external contributions to OpenJDK is growing since project inception OpenJDK released in September received of external fixes and brought new JEPs features out of which were contributed by the community Namely JEP Improve Aarch Intrinsics contributed by BellSoft JEP Epsilon A No Op Garbage Collector by Red Hat and JEP Low Overhead Heap Profiling contributed by Google br br br Collaboration with IBM Apple and SAP br On October IBM by far the biggest participant in the Apache Harmony project decided to join Oracle on the OpenJDK project effectively shifting its efforts from Harmony to OpenJDK Bob Sutor IBM s head of Linux and open source blogged that IBM will be shifting its development effort from the Apache Project Harmony to OpenJDK br On November Apple Inc just three weeks after deprecating its own Java runtime port and Oracle Corporation announced the OpenJDK project for Mac OS X Apple will contribute most of the key components tools and technology required for a Java SE implementation on Mac OS X including a bit and bit HotSpot based Java virtual machine class libraries a networking stack and the foundation for a new graphical client br On January the Mac OS X Port Project was created on OpenJDK and Apple made the first public contribution of code to the project The initial Apple contribution built on the OpenJDK BSD port br In July SAP AG announced that SAP officially joined the OpenJDK project br br br See also br Free Java implementations br br br br br br External links br Main site br OpenJDK
