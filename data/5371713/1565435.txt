BeanShell is a small free embeddable Java source interpreter with object scripting language features written in Java It runs in the Java Runtime Environment JRE dynamically executes standard Java syntax and extends it with common scripting conveniences such as loose types commands and method closures like those in Perl and JavaScript br br br Features br While BeanShell allows its users to define functions that can be called from within a script its underpinning philosophy has been to not pollute its syntax with too many extensions and syntactic sugar thereby ensuring that code written for a Java compiler can usually be executed interpretively by BeanShell without any changes and almost just as much vice versa This makes BeanShell a popular testing and debugging tool for the Java virtual machine JVM platform br BeanShell supports scripted objects as simple method closures like those in Perl and JavaScript br BeanShell is an open source project and has been incorporated into many applications such as Apache OpenOffice Apache Ant WebLogic Server Application Server Apache JMeter jEdit ImageJ JUMP GIS Apache Taverna and many others BeanShell provides an easy to integrate application programming interface API It can also be run in command line mode or within its own graphical environment br br br History br The first versions of BeanShell were released by Patrick Niemeyer in followed by a series of versions BeanShell was released in August Version b was released in September culminating with version b in May which as of January is the newest release posted on the official webpage br BeanShell has been included in the Linux distribution Debian since br BeanShell was undergoing standardization through the Java Community Process JCP under JSR br Following the JCP approval of the BeanShell JSR Review Ballot in June no visible activity was taking place around BeanShell The JSR status is Dormant br Since Java Java instead includes JShell a different read eval print loop REPL shell based on Java syntax indicating that BeanShell will not be continued br A fork of BeanShell BeanShell was created in May on the now defunct Google Code Web site The beanshell project has made a number of fixes and enhancements to BeanShell and multiple releases As of January the latest version of BeanShell is v released March This fork was merged back into the original tree in retaining all the independent changes from both and the official project has been hosted at GitHub br In December following a proposal to accept BeanShell as an Apache Incubator project BeanShell was licensed to The Apache Software Foundation and migrated to the Apache Extras changing the license to Apache License The project was not accepted but instead projected to become part of the Apache Commons at a future time br Due to changes in the developers personal circumstances the BeanShell community did not however complete the move to Apache but remained at Apache Extras The project has since released BeanShell b which is used by Apache OpenOffice and Apache Taverna br A Windows automated installer BeanShell Double Click was created in It includes desktop integration features br br br See also br br List of JVM languages br Comparison of programming languages br Comparison of command shells br br br Notes br br br br br br External links br br BeanShell at Apache Extras
