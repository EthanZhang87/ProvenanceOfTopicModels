Sun Microsystems Inc Sun for short was an American technology company that sold computers computer components software and information technology services and created the Java programming language the Solaris operating system ZFS the Network File System NFS and SPARC microprocessors Sun contributed significantly to the evolution of several key computing technologies among them Unix RISC processors thin client computing and virtualized computing Notable Sun acquisitions include Cray Business Systems Division Storagetek and Innotek GmbH creators of VirtualBox Sun was founded on February At its height the Sun headquarters were in Santa Clara California part of Silicon Valley on the former west campus of the Agnews Developmental Center br Sun products included computer servers and workstations built on its own RISC based SPARC processor architecture as well as on x based AMD Opteron and Intel Xeon processors Sun also developed its own storage systems and a suite of software products including the Solaris operating system developer tools Web infrastructure software and identity management applications Technologies included the Java platform and NFS br In general Sun was a proponent of open systems particularly Unix It was also a major contributor to open source software as evidenced by its billion purchase in of MySQL an open source relational database management system br At various times Sun had manufacturing facilities in several locations worldwide including Newark California Hillsboro Oregon and Linlithgow Scotland However by the time the company was acquired by Oracle Corporation it had outsourced most manufacturing responsibilities br On April it was announced that Oracle would acquire Sun for US billion The deal was completed on January br br br History br br The initial design for what became Sun s first Unix workstation the Sun was conceived by Andy Bechtolsheim when he was a graduate student at Stanford University in Palo Alto California Bechtolsheim originally designed the SUN workstation for the Stanford University Network communications project as a personal CAD workstation It was designed around the Motorola processor with an advanced memory management unit MMU to support the Unix operating system with virtual memory support He built the first examples from spare parts obtained from Stanford s Department of Computer Science and Silicon Valley supply houses br On February Scott McNealy Andy Bechtolsheim and Vinod Khosla all Stanford graduate students founded Sun Microsystems Bill Joy of Berkeley a primary developer of the Berkeley Software Distribution BSD joined soon after and is counted as one of the original founders The name Sun is derived from the initials of the Stanford University Network SUN Sun was profitable from its first quarter in July br By Sun was known for producing k based systems with high quality graphics that were the only computers other than DEC s VAX to run BSD It licensed the computer design to other manufacturers which typically used it to build Multibus based systems running Unix from UniSoft Sun s initial public offering was in under the stock symbol SUNW for Sun Workstations later Sun Worldwide The symbol was changed in to JAVA Sun stated that the brand awareness associated with its Java platform better represented the company s current strategy br Sun s logo which features four interleaved copies of the word sun in the form of a rotationally symmetric ambigram was designed by professor Vaughan Pratt also of Stanford The initial version of the logo was orange and had the sides oriented horizontally and vertically but it was subsequently rotated to stand on one corner and re colored purple and later blue br br br Dot com bubble and aftermath br During the dot com bubble Sun began making more money with its stock rising as high as per share It also began spending much more hiring workers and building itself out Some of this was because of genuine demand but much was from web start up companies anticipating business that would never happen In the bubble burst Sales in Sun s important hardware division went into free fall as customers closed shop and auctioned high end servers br Several quarters of steep losses led to executive departures rounds of layoffs and other cost cutting In December the stock fell to the pre bubble level of about It continued to fall faster than many other technology companies A year later it had reached below a tenth of what it was in but it eventually bounced back to In mid Sun closed their Newark California factory and consolidated all manufacturing to Hillsboro Oregon and Linlithgow Scotland In the rest of the Newark campus was put on the market br br br Post crash focus br br In Sun canceled two major processor projects which emphasized high instruction level parallelism and operating frequency Instead the company chose to concentrate on processors optimized for multi threading and multiprocessing such as the UltraSPARC T processor codenamed Niagara The company also announced a collaboration with Fujitsu to use the Japanese company s processor chips in mid range and high end Sun servers These servers were announced on April as the M Series part of the SPARC Enterprise series br In February Sun announced the Sun Grid a grid computing deployment on which it offered utility computing services priced at US per CPU hour for processing and per GB month for storage This offering built upon an existing CPU server farm used for internal R D for over years which Sun marketed as being able to achieve utilization In August the first commercial use of this grid was announced for financial risk simulations which were later launched as its first software as a service product br In January Sun reported a net profit of million for fiscal second quarter for the first time in three years This was followed by net loss of million on GAAP basis for the third quarter as reported on April In January Sun reported a net GAAP profit of million on revenue of billion for its fiscal second quarter Shortly following that news it was announced that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR would invest million in the company br Sun had engineering groups in Bangalore Beijing Dublin Grenoble Hamburg Prague St Petersburg Tel Aviv Tokyo Canberra and Trondheim br In Sun posted revenue of billion and had billion in cash First quarter losses were billion revenue fell to billion Sun s stock lost of its value November to November reducing the company s market value to billion With falling sales to large corporate clients Sun announced plans to lay off to workers or of its work force It expected to save million to million a year as a result of the moves while also taking up to million in

br As of May the following shareholders held over common shares of Sun and at per share offered by Oracle they received the amounts indicated when the acquisition closed br br br Hardware br For the first decade of Sun s history the company positioned its products as technical workstations competing successfully as a low cost vendor during the Workstation Wars of the s It then shifted its hardware product line to emphasize servers and storage High level telecom control systems such as Operational Support Systems service predominantly used Sun equipment br br br Motorola based systems br Sun originally used Motorola family central processing units for the Sun through Sun computer series The Sun employed a CPU the Sun series a The Sun series was based on the with the later Sun x using the br br br SPARC based systems br br In the company began using SPARC a RISC processor architecture of its own design in its computer systems starting with the Sun line SPARC was initially a bit architecture SPARC V until the introduction of the SPARC V architecture in which added bit extensions br Sun developed several generations of SPARC based computer systems including the SPARCstation Ultra and Sun Blade series of workstations and the SPARCserver Netra Enterprise and Sun Fire line of servers br In the early s the company began to extend its product line to include large scale symmetric multiprocessing servers starting with the four processor SPARCserver MP This was followed by the processor SPARCserver and processor SPARCcenter which were based on work done in conjunction with Xerox PARC In the company introduced Sun Ultra series machines that were equipped with the first bit implementation of SPARC processors UltraSPARC In the late s the transformation of product line in favor of large bit SMP systems was accelerated by the acquisition of Cray Business Systems Division from Silicon Graphics Their bit processor Cray Superserver related to the SPARCcenter led to the bit Sun Enterprise high end server otherwise known as Starfire or E K br In September Sun made available systems with UltraSPARC IV which was the first multi core SPARC processor It was followed by UltraSPARC IV in September and its revisions with higher clock speeds in These CPUs were used in the most powerful enterprise class high end CC NUMA servers developed by Sun such as the Sun Fire E K and the Sun Fire E K br In November Sun launched the UltraSPARC T notable for its ability to concurrently run threads of execution on processor cores Its intent was to drive more efficient use of CPU resources which is of particular importance in data centers where there is an increasing need to reduce power and air conditioning demands much of which comes from the heat generated by CPUs The T was followed in by the UltraSPARC T which extended the number of threads per core from to Sun has open sourced the design specifications of both the T and T processors via the OpenSPARC project br In Sun ventured into the blade server high density rack mounted systems market with the Sun Blade distinct from the Sun Blade workstation br In April Sun released the SPARC Enterprise server products jointly designed by Sun and Fujitsu and based on Fujitsu SPARC VI and later processors The M class SPARC Enterprise systems include high end reliability and availability features Later T series servers have also been badged SPARC Enterprise rather than Sun Fire br In April Sun released servers with UltraSPARC T Plus which is an SMP capable version of UltraSPARC T available in or processor configurations It was the first CoolThreads CPU with multi processor capability and it made possible to build standard rack mounted servers that could simultaneously process up to massive CPU threads in hardware Sun SPARC Enterprise T which is considered a record in the industry br Since all further development of Sun machines based on SPARC architecture including new SPARC T Series servers SPARC T and T chips is done as a part of Oracle Corporation hardware division br br br x based systems br In the late s Sun also marketed an Intel based machine the Sun i this was designed to be a hybrid system running SunOS but at the same time supporting DOS applications This only remained on the market for a brief time A follow up i upgrade was announced but only a few prototype units were ever manufactured br Sun s brief first foray into x systems ended in the early s as it decided to concentrate on SPARC and retire the last Motorola systems and i products a move dubbed by McNealy as all the wood behind one arrowhead Even so Sun kept its hand in the x world as a release of Solaris for PC compatibles began shipping in br In Sun acquired Diba Inc followed later by the acquisition of Cobalt Networks in with the aim of building network appliances single function computers meant for consumers Sun also marketed a Network Computer a term popularized and eventually trademarked by Oracle the JavaStation was a diskless system designed to run Java applications br Although none of these business initiatives were particularly successful the Cobalt purchase gave Sun a toehold for its return to the x hardware market In Sun introduced its first general purpose x system the LX based in part on previous Cobalt system expertise This was also Sun s first system announced to support Linux as well as Solaris br In Sun announced a strategic alliance with AMD to produce x x servers based on AMD s Opteron processor this was followed shortly by Sun s acquisition of Kealia a startup founded by original Sun founder Andy Bechtolsheim which had been focusing on high performance AMD based servers br The following year Sun launched the Opteron based Sun Fire V z and V z servers and the Sun Java Workstation W z and W z workstations br In September Sun unveiled a new range of Opteron based servers the Sun Fire X X and X servers These were designed from scratch by a team led by Bechtolsheim to address heat and power consumption issues commonly faced in data centers In July the Sun Fire X and X systems were introduced extending a line of x systems that support not only Solaris but also Linux and Microsoft Windows br In January Sun announced a broad strategic alliance with Intel Intel endorsed Solaris as a mainstream operating system and as its mission critical Unix for its Xeon processor based systems and contributed engineering resources to OpenSolaris Sun began using the Intel Xeon processor in its x server line starting with the Sun Blade X server module introduced in June br In May AMD announced its Operating System Research Center OSRC was expanding its focus to include optimization to Sun s OpenSolaris and xVM virtualization products for AMD processors br br br Software br br br Although Sun was initially known as a hardware company its software history began with its founding in co founder Bill Joy was one of the leading Unix developers of the time having contributed the vi editor the C shell and significant work developing TCP IP and the BSD Unix OS Sun later developed software such as the Java programming language and acquired software such as StarOffice VirtualBox and MySQL In February the company established SunSoft Inc a wholly owned division of Sun dedicated to the development of operating systems and application software br Sun used community based and open source licensing of its major technologies and for its support of its products with other open source technologies GNOME based desktop software called Java Desktop System originally code named Madhatter was distributed for the Solaris operating system and at one point for Linux Sun supported its Java Enterprise System a middleware stack on Linux It released the source code for Solaris under the open source Common Development and Distribution License via the OpenSolaris community Sun s positioning includes a commitment to indemnify users of some software from intellectual property disputes concerning that software It offers support services on a variety of pricing bases including per employee and per socket br A report prepared for the EU by UNU MERIT stated that Sun was the largest corporate contributor to open source movements in the world According to this report Sun s open source contributions exceed the combined total of the next five largest commercial contributors br br br Operating systems br br Sun is best known for its Unix systems which have a reputation for system stability and a consistent design philosophy br Sun s first workstation shipped with UniSoft V Unix Later in Sun began providing SunOS a customized BSD Unix as the operating system for its workstations br SunOS included suntools an early GUI window system br In the late s AT T tapped Sun to help them develop the next release of their branded UNIX and in announced they would purchase up to a stake in Sun UNIX System V Release SVR was jointly developed by AT T and Sun Sun used SVR as the foundation for Solaris x which became the successor to SunOS x later retroactively named Solaris x By the mid s the ensuing Unix wars had largely subsided AT T had sold off their Unix interests and the relationship between the two companies was significantly reduced br In the early s Brian P Dougherty founder of Berkeley Softworks which would go on to be re incorporated as the GeoWorks Corporation accused br the Java development team at Sun for studying GeoWorks s PC GEOS operating system and incorporating features of PC GEOS into their Unix based operating system Brian claimed that the object oriented and flexible UI of PC GEOS was to this day the most sophisticated UI technology ever built into an OS br From Sun also sold Interactive Unix an operating system it acquired when it bought Interactive Systems Corporation from Eastman Kodak Company This was a popular Unix variant for the PC platform and a major competitor to market leader SCO UNIX Sun s focus on Interactive Unix diminished in favor of Solaris on both SPARC and x systems it was dropped as a product in br Sun dropped the Solaris x version numbering scheme after the Solaris release the following version was branded Solaris This was the first bit release intended for the new UltraSPARC CPUs based on the SPARC V architecture Within the next four years the successors Solaris and Solaris were released in and respectively br Following several years of difficult competition and loss of server market share to competitors Linux based systems Sun began to include Linux as part of its strategy in Sun supported both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server on its x systems companies such as Canonical Ltd Wind River Systems and MontaVista also supported their versions of Linux on Sun s SPARC based systems br In after having cultivated a reputation as one of Microsoft s most vocal antagonists Sun entered into a joint relationship with them resolving various legal entanglements between the two companies and receiving US billion in settlement payments from them Sun supported Microsoft Windows on its x systems and announced other collaborative agreements with Microsoft including plans to support each other s virtualization environments br In the company released Solaris The new version included a large number of enhancements to the operating system as well as very novel features previously unseen in the industry Solaris update releases continued through the next years the last release from Sun Microsystems being Solaris The following updates were released by Oracle under the new license agreement the final release is Solaris br Previously Sun offered a separate variant of Solaris called Trusted Solaris which included augmented security features such as multilevel security and a least privilege access model Solaris included many of the same capabilities as Trusted Solaris at the time of its initial release Solaris included Solaris Trusted Extensions which give it the remaining capabilities needed to make it the functional successor to Trusted Solaris br After the release of Solaris the Solaris source code was opened under the CDDL free software license and developed in open with contributing Opensolaris community through SXCE that used SVR pkg packaging and supported OpenSolaris releases that used IPS br Following the acquisition of Sun by Oracle OpenSolaris continued to develop in open under illumos with illumos distributions br Oracle Corporation continued to develop Solaris reverting new development back to the proprietary licensing its next release was Oracle Solaris in November br br br Java platform br br The Java platform was developed at Sun by James Gosling in the early s with the objective of allowing programs to function regardless of the device they were used on sparking the slogan Write once run anywhere WORA While this objective was not entirely achieved prompting the riposte Write once debug everywhere Java is regarded as being largely hardware and operating system independent br Java was initially promoted as a platform for client side applets running inside web browsers Early examples of Java applications were the HotJava web browser and the HotJava Views suite However since then Java has been more successful on the server side of the Internet br The platform consists of three major parts the Java programming language the Java Virtual Machine JVM and several Java Application Programming Interfaces APIs The design of the Java platform is controlled by the vendor and user community through the Java Community Process JCP br Java is an object oriented programming language Since its introduction in late it became one of the world s most popular programming languages br Java programs are compiled to byte code which can be executed by any JVM regardless of the environment br The Java APIs provide an extensive set of library routines These APIs evolved into the Standard Edition Java SE which provides basic infrastructure and GUI functionality the Enterprise Edition Java EE aimed at large software companies implementing enterprise class application servers and the Micro Edition Java ME used to build software for devices with limited resources such as mobile devices br On November Sun announced it would be licensing its Java implementation under the GNU General Public License it released its Java compiler and JVM at that time br In February Sun entered a battle with Microsoft and Adobe Systems which promoted rival platforms to build software applications for the Internet JavaFX was a development platform for music video and other applications that builds on the Java programming language br br br Office suite br In Sun acquired the German software company Star Division and with it the office suite StarOffice which Sun later released as OpenOffice org under both GNU LGPL and the SISSL Sun Industry Standards Source License OpenOffice org supported Microsoft Office file formats though not perfectly was available on many platforms primarily Linux Microsoft Windows Mac OS X and Solaris and was used in the open source community br The principal differences between StarOffice and OpenOffice org were that StarOffice was supported by Sun was available as either a single user retail box kit or as per user blocks of licensing for the enterprise and included a wider range of fonts and document templates and a commercial quality spellchecker StarOffice also contained commercially licensed functions and add ons in OpenOffice org these were either replaced by open source or free variants or are not present at all Both packages had native support for the OpenDocument format br Derivatives of OpenOffice org continue to be developed these are LibreOffice Collabora Online and Apache OpenOffice br br br Virtualization and datacenter automation software br br In Sun announced the Sun xVM virtualization and datacenter automation product suite for commodity hardware Sun also acquired VirtualBox in Earlier virtualization technologies from Sun like Dynamic System Domains and Dynamic Reconfiguration were specifically designed for high end SPARC servers and Logical Domains only supports the UltraSPARC T T T Plus server platforms Sun marketed Sun Ops Center provisioning software for datacenter automation br On the client side Sun offered virtual desktop solutions Desktop environments and applications could be hosted in a datacenter with users accessing these environments from a wide range of client devices including Microsoft Windows PCs Sun Ray virtual display clients Apple Macintoshes PDAs or any combination of supported devices A variety of networks were supported from LAN to WAN or the public Internet Virtual desktop products included Sun Ray Server Software Sun Secure Global Desktop and Sun Virtual Desktop Infrastructure br br br Database management systems br Sun acquired MySQL AB the developer of the MySQL database in for US billion CEO Jonathan Schwartz mentioned in his blog that optimizing the performance of MySQL was one of the priorities of the acquisition In February Sun began to publish results of the MySQL performance optimization work Sun contributed to the PostgreSQL project On the Java platform Sun contributed to and supported Java DB br br br Other software br Sun offered other software products for software development and infrastructure services Many were developed in house others came from acquisitions including Tarantella Waveset Technologies SeeBeyond and Vaau Sun acquired many of the Netscape non browser software products as part a deal involving Netscape s merger with AOL These software products were initially offered under the iPlanet brand once the Sun Netscape alliance ended they were re branded as Sun ONE Sun Open Network Environment and then the Sun Java System br Sun s middleware product was branded as the Java Enterprise System or JES and marketed for web and application serving communication calendaring directory identity management and service oriented architecture Sun s Open ESB and other software suites were available free of charge on systems running Solaris Red Hat Enterprise Linux HP UX and Windows with support available optionally br Sun developed data center management software products which included the Solaris Cluster high availability software and a grid management package called Sun Grid Engine and firewall software such as SunScreen br For Network Equipment Providers and telecommunications customers Sun developed the Sun Netra High Availability Suite br Sun produced compilers and development tools under the Sun Studio brand for building and developing Solaris and Linux applications br Sun entered the software as a service SaaS market with zembly a social cloud based computing platform and Project Kenai an open source project hosting service br br br Storage br Sun sold its own storage systems to complement its system offerings it has also made several storage related acquisitions br On June Sun announced it would purchase Storage Technology Corporation StorageTek for US billion in cash or per share a deal completed in August br In Sun introduced the Sun StorageTek System the first application aware programmable storage solution In Sun contributed the source code of the StorageTek System under the BSD license br Sun announced the Sun Open Storage platform in built with open source technologies br In late Sun announced the Sun Storage Unified Storage systems codenamed Amber Road Transparent placement of data in the systems solid state drives SSD and conventional hard drives was managed by ZFS to take advantage of the speed of SSDs and the economy of conventional hard disks br Other storage products included Sun Fire X storage server and SAM QFS filesystem and storage management software br br br High performance computing br Sun marketed the Sun Constellation System for high performance computing HPC Even before the introduction of the Sun Constellation System in Sun s products were in use in many of the TOP systems and supercomputing centers br br Lustre was used by seven of the top supercomputers in as well as other industries that need high performance storage six major oil companies including BP Shell and ExxonMobil chip design including Synopsys and Sony and the movie industry including Harry Potter and Spider Man br Sun Fire X was used by high energy physics supercomputers to run dCache br Sun Grid Engine was a popular workload scheduler for clusters and computer farms br Sun Visualization System allowed users of the TeraGrid to remotely access the D rendering capabilities of the Maverick system at the University of Texas at Austin br Sun Modular Datacenter Project Blackbox was two Sun MD S units used by the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center br The Sun HPC ClusterTools product was a set of Message Passing Interface MPI libraries and tools for running parallel jobs on Solaris HPC clusters Beginning with version Sun switched from its own implementation of MPI to Open MPI and donated engineering resources to the Open MPI project br Sun was a participant in the OpenMP language committee Sun Studio compilers and tools implemented the OpenMP specification for shared memory parallelization br In Sun built the TSUBAME supercomputer which was until June the fastest supercomputer in Asia Sun built Ranger at the Texas Advanced Computing Center TACC in Ranger had a peak performance of over TFLOPS and was the sixth most powerful supercomputer on the TOP list in November br Sun announced an OpenSolaris distribution that integrated Sun s HPC products with others br br br Staff br br Notable Sun employees included John Gilmore Whitfield Diffie Radia Perlman Ivan Sutherland and Marc Tremblay Sun was an early advocate of Unix based networked computing promoting TCP IP and especially NFS as reflected in the company s motto The Network is the Computer coined by John Gage James Gosling led the team which developed the Java programming language Jon Bosak led the creation of the XML specification at W C br In Sun Microsystems was one of the first Fortune companies that instituted a formal social media program Sun staff published articles on the company s blog site Staff were encouraged to use the site to blog on any aspect of their work or personal life with few restrictions placed on staff other than commercially confidential material Jonathan I Schwartz was one of the first CEOs of large companies to regularly blog his postings were frequently quoted and analyzed in the press br br br Acquisition by Oracle br br On September the European Commission opened an in depth investigation into the proposed takeover of Sun Microsystems by Oracle On November the Commission issued a statement of objections relating to the acquisition of Sun by Oracle Finally on January the European Commission approved Oracle s acquisition of Sun The Commission s investigation showed that another open database PostgreSQL was considered by many users of this type of software as a credible alternative to MySQL and could to some extent replace the competitive strength that the latter currently represents in the database market br Sun was sold to Oracle Corporation in for billion br Sun s staff were asked to share anecdotes about their experiences at Sun A website containing videos stories and photographs from years at Sun was made available on September br In October Sun announced a second round of thousands of employees to be laid off blamed partially on delays in approval of the merger br The transaction was completed in early br In January Oracle agreed to pay million to settle charges that it submitted false claims to US federal government agencies and paid kickbacks to systems integrators br In February Sun s former Menlo Park California campus of about square feet m was sold and it was announced that it would become headquarters for Facebook br The sprawling facility built around an enclosed courtyard had been nicknamed Sun Quentin The campus
