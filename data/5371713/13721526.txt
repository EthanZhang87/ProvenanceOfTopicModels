A standalone program also known as a freestanding program is a computer program that does not load any external module library function or program and that is designed to boot with the bootstrap procedure of the target processor it runs on bare metal In early computers like the ENIAC without the concept of an operating system standalone programs were the only way to run a computer Standalone programs are usually written in assembly language for a specific hardware br Later standalone programs typically were provided for utility functions such as disk formatting Also computers with very limited memory may use standalone programs i e most computers until the mid s and later still embedded processors br Standalone programs are now mainly limited to SoC s or microcontrollers where battery life price and data space are at premiums and critical systems In extreme cases every possible set of inputs and errors must be tested and thus every potential output known fully independent separate physical suppliers and programing teams yet fully parallel system state monitoring or where the attack surface must be minimized an operating system would add unacceptable complexity and uncertainty examples include industrial operator safety interrupts commercial airlines medical devices ballistic missile launch controls and lithium battery charge controllers in consumer devices fire hazard and chip cost of approximately cents Resource limited microcontrollers can also be made more tolerant of varied environmental conditions than the more powerful hardware needed for an operating system this is possible because of the much lower clock frequency pin spacing lack of large data buses e g DDR RAM modules and limited transistor count allowance for wider design margins and thus the potential for more robust electrical and physical properties both in circuit layout and material choices br br br See also br Bare machine br br br
