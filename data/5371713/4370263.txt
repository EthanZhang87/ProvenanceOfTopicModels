Urs H lzle German pronunciation rs h ltsl born is a Swiss software engineer and technology executive As Google s eighth employee and its first VP of Engineering he has shaped much of Google s development processes and infrastructure as well as its engineering culture His most notable contributions include leading the development of fundamental cloud infrastructure such as energy efficient data centers distributed compute and storage systems and software defined networking Until July he was the Senior Vice President of Technical Infrastructure and Google Fellow at Google In July he transitioned to being a Google Fellow only br br br Career br Before joining Google H lzle was an associate professor of computer science at University of California Santa Barbara He received a master s degree in computer science from ETH Zurich in and was awarded a Fulbright scholarship that same year In he earned a Ph D from Stanford University where his research focused on programming languages and their efficient implementation Via a startup founded by H lzle David Griswold and Lars Bak see Strongtalk that work then evolved into a high performance Java VM named HotSpot acquired by Sun s JavaSoft unit in and from there became Sun s premier JVM implementation br In he joined Google and became its first Vice President of Engineering later that year and influenced Google s corporate and engineering culture While he led various areas during the early years of the company including operations search and Gmail he is best known for his work leading the infrastructure systems underpinning Google s applications and for their focus on both efficiency and scalability With Jeff Dean and Luiz Barroso he designed the initial distributed architecture for Google This work was recognized by the Association for Computing Machinery who named him a Fellow for the design engineering and operation of energy efficient large scale cloud computing systems He is also credited for creating Google Gulp for April Fool s Day in br br br Data centers and servers br He led the design of Google s efficient data centers which are said to use less than half the power of a conventional data center In he received The Economist s Innovation Award for his datacenter efficiency work With Luiz Barroso he wrote The Datacenter as a Computer An Introduction to the Design of Warehouse Scale Machines Now in its third edition the book is the most downloaded textbook at Morgan Claypool and is widely used in undergraduate and graduate Computer Science education For his contributions to the design operation and energy efficiency of large scale data centers H lzle was elected into the National Academy of Engineering in br In June he introduced the Climate Savers Computing Initiative together with Pat Gelsinger which aimed to halve the power consumption of desktop computers and servers In after mobile computing and enhanced awareness of datacenter energy costs had contributed to significant improvements in energy efficiency CSCI merged with the Green Grid consortium br Also in he and Luiz Barroso wrote The Case for Energy Proportional Computing which argued that servers should be designed to use power in proportion to their current load because they spend much of their time being only partially loaded This paper is often credited for spurring CPU manufacturers to make their designs much more energy efficient Today energy proportional computing has become a standard goal for both server and mobile uses br br br Networking br Starting in H lzle s team began to develop datacenter networking hardware because off the shelf network equipment could not scale to the demands of large data centers Using Clos network topologies based on commodity switch chips these datacenter networks scaled from an initial Tbit s to Tbit s a decade later Initially esoteric and kept a secret today this approach is standard for large datacenter networks virtually all hyperscale datacenter operators use similar approaches br In H lzle introduced the G Scale Network on which Google had begun managing its petabyte scale internal data flow via OpenFlow an open source software system jointly devised by scientists at Stanford and the UC Berkeley and promoted by the Open Networking Foundation In this work was recognized by the ACM SIGCOMM Networking Systems Award The internal data flow or network is distinct from the one that connects users to Google services Search Gmail YouTube etc In the process of describing the new network H lzle also confirmed more about Google s making of its own networking equipment like routers and switches for G Scale and said the company wanted by being open about the changes to encourage the industry hardware software and ISP s to look down this path and say I can benefit from this He said network utilization was nearing of capacity a dramatic efficiency improvement br Google s teams also heavily contributed to software defined networking creating or contributing to key building blocks used in many networks today including OpenConfig for vendor neutral model driven network management gRPC for fast RPCs protobuf for data interchange OpenTelemetry for tracing and the Istio service mesh br br br Cloud computing br H lzle is credited with leading the creation of Google s internal cloud including architecting clusters based on commodity servers distributed file systems cluster scheduling software defined networking hardware reliability processor design custom ASICs for AI TPUs and vide processing and many more One of the most notable events from this period was the emergence of Kubernetes a project funded by H lzle br Google s internal cloud doesn t use virtualization but product development on an external cloud platform started in leading to the launch of the Google Cloud Platform in H lzle is also credited with changing Google Cloud s engineering culture to to make the transition from niche cloud to enterprise class cloud br br br Environmental work br In H lzle announced that Google would be carbon neutral starting that year using individually selected and monitored carbon offset projects In the same year Google started the RE C initiative Renewable Energy less than cheaper than coal to develop cheaper forms of renewable energy but four years later H lzle announced the end of that strategy dropping development of solar thermal electricity for example with BrightSource Energy because it was not keeping pace with the rapid price decline of another solar technology photovoltaics br Starting in Google began buying renewable energy from new wind and solar farms to cover the energy needs for all its datacenters In H lzle received the CK Prahalad Award for bringing about innovations and radical efficiencies in data center technology and increasing corporate purchasing of renewable energy and for not only accelerating Google s sustainability but also cutting a path for other companies to follow suit While purchases initially were small they created a market for corporate renewable energy purchases that has become very influential in driving the overall growth of renewable energy purchases For example SP Global reports that the top hyperscalers Amazon Google Meta Microsoft accounted for over of contracted capacity during br In Google reached enough renewable energy to offset of its usage and now is the world s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy After reaching renewables at an annual average level Google has pursued an additional focus on carbon free energy i e actually running on renewable energy every hour of every day As of seven Google datacenter regions reached or more carbon free energy and thirteen reached more than H lzle has widely been credited for favoring market based approaches discouraging proprietary paths that would only benefit Google As a result organizations like the Clean Energy Buyers Alliance the European CFE Hub and the United Nations Carbon Free Energy Compact now focus on enabling any company to pursue their own carbon free energy goals br In H lzle was revealed as the primary investor behind the New Zealand based solar developer Helios which aims to build about grid connected solar farms across New Zealand br He is a board member of the US World Wildlife Fund br br br Academic honors br H lzle became a Fulbright scholar in and was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in for contributions to the design operation and energy efficiency of large scale data centers He also is a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery the AAAS and the Swiss Academies of Arts and Sciences br br br Google culture br As Google s eighth employee and its first VP of Engineering H lzle shaped much of Google s development processes and infrastructure In a book about the early days of Google Doug Edwards credits him with defining much of Google s engineering and corporate culture For example he is said to have instituted Google s practice of code reviews for every change the culture of using blameless postmortems to learn from mistakes rather than find out whose fault it was and a focus on using technical interviews to identify the best candidates He recruited many of Google s early engineers including Jeff Dean br He was known for his self deprecating humor for example his initial job title was Search Engine Mechanic because everything was broken br H lzle also influenced Google s office culture by bringing his dog Yoshka to work In Yoshka even authored a blog post and today Google declares itself a dog company The cafe in Building of the Googleplex is named Yoshka s Cafe in honor of Google s first dog br In July he was criticised for a perceived hypocritical approach to remote working opposing it strongly for others while relocating to New Zealand However shortly after H lzle s transfer was announced Google approved the large majority of employee applications permitting other employees to work remotely as well br br br br br br External links br Urs H lzle Biography at Google Research br Peeking into Google br GoogleGulp br Google s Datacenters br Renewable in br
