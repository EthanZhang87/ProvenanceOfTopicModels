title: Software metric
id: 187442
In software engineering and development a software metric is a standard of measure of a degree to which a software system or process possesses some property Even if a metric is not a measurement metrics are functions while measurements are the numbers obtained by the application of metrics often the two terms are used as synonyms Since quantitative measurements are essential in all sciences there is a continuous effort by computer science practitioners and theoreticians to bring similar approaches to software development The goal is obtaining objective reproducible and quantifiable measurements which may have numerous valuable applications in schedule and budget planning cost estimation quality assurance testing software debugging software performance optimization and optimal personnel task assignments br br br Common software measurements br Common software measurements include br br ABC Software Metric br Balanced scorecard br Bugs per line of code br Code coverage br Cohesion br Comment density br Connascent software components br Constructive Cost Model br Coupling br Cyclomatic complexity McCabe s complexity br Cyclomatic complexity density br Defect density defects found in a component br Defect potential expected number of defects in a particular component br Defect removal rate br DSQI design structure quality index br Function Points and Automated Function Points an Object Management Group standard br Halstead Complexity br Instruction path length br Maintainability index br Source lines of code number of lines of code br Program execution time br Program load time br Program size binary br Weighted Micro Function Points br Cycle time software br First pass yield br Corrective Commit Probability br br br Limitations br As software development is a complex process with high variance on both methodologies and objectives it is difficult to define or measure software qualities and quantities and to determine a valid and concurrent measurement metric especially when making such a prediction prior to the detail design Another source of difficulty and debate is in determining which metrics matter and what they mean br The practical utility of software measurements has therefore been limited to the following domains br br Scheduling br Software sizing br Programming complexity br Software development effort estimation br Software quality br A specific measurement may target one or more of the above aspects or the balance between them for example as an indicator of team motivation or project performance br br Additionally metrics vary between static and dynamic program code as well as for object oriented software systems br br br Acceptance and public opinion br Some software development practitioners point out that simplistic measurements can cause more harm than good Others have noted that metrics have become an integral part of the software development process br Impact of measurement on programmer psychology have raised concerns for harmful effects to performance due to stress performance anxiety and attempts to cheat the metrics while others find it to have positive impact on developers value towards their own work and prevent them being undervalued Some argue that the definition of many measurement methodologies are imprecise and consequently it is often unclear how tools for computing them arrive at a particular result while others argue that imperfect quantification is better than none You can t control what you can t measure Evidence shows that software metrics are being widely used by government agencies the US military NASA IT consultants academic institutions and commercial and academic development estimation software br br br Further reading br J Smith Introduction to Linear Programming Acme Press An introductory text br Reijo M Savola Quality of security metrics and measurements Computers Security Volume September Pages br br br See also br Goal Question Metric br List of tools for static code analysis br Orthogonal Defect Classification br Software engineering br Software package metrics br br br br br br External links br Software Metrics SQA net br Software Engineering Metrics What do they measure and how do we know br NASA Standard NASA STD Software Assurance and Software Safety Standard br HIS Source Code Metrics outdated but for reference related see AUTOSAR br HIS Source Code Metrics version outdated but for reference related see AUTOSAR br A framework for source code metrics br NASA gov br SonarQube Metric Definitions br Metrics of Object Oriented Software
