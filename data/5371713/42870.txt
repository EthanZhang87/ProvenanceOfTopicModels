Java Platform Micro Edition or Java ME is a computing platform for development and deployment of portable code for embedded and mobile devices micro controllers sensors gateways mobile phones personal digital assistants TV set top boxes printers Java ME was formerly known as Java Platform Micro Edition or J ME br The platform uses the object oriented Java programming language and is part of the Java software platform family It was designed by Sun Microsystems now Oracle Corporation and replaced a similar technology PersonalJava br In with more than billion Java ME enabled mobile phones in the market the platform was in continued decline as smartphones have overtaken feature phones br br br History br The platform used to be popular in feature phones such as Nokia s Series models It was also supported on the Bada operating system and on Symbian OS along with native software Users of Windows CE Windows Mobile Maemo MeeGo and Android could download Java ME for their respective environments proof of concept for Android br Originally developed under the Java Community Process as JSR the different flavors of Java ME have evolved in separate JSRs Java ME devices implement a profile The most common of these are the Mobile Information Device Profile aimed at mobile devices such as cell phones and the Personal Profile aimed at consumer products and embedded devices like set top boxes and PDAs Profiles are subsets of configurations of which there are currently two the Connected Limited Device Configuration CLDC and the Connected Device Configuration CDC br In Java ME platforms were restricted to JRE features and use that version of the class file format internally known as version br br br Implementations br Oracle provides a reference implementation of the specification and some configurations and profiles for MIDP and CDC Starting with the JavaME SDK a NetBeans based IDE supported them in a single IDE br In contrast to the numerous binary implementations of the Java Platform built by Sun for servers and workstations Sun tended not to provide binaries for the platforms of Java ME targets and instead relied on third parties to provide their own br The exception was an MIDP JRE JVM for Palm OS Sun provides no J ME JRE for the Microsoft Windows Mobile Pocket PC based devices despite an open letter campaign to Sun to release a rumored internal implementation of PersonalJava known by the code name Captain America Third party implementations are widely used by Windows Mobile vendors br At some point Sun released a now abandoned reference implementation under the name phoneME br Operating systems targeting Java ME have been implemented by DoCoMo in the form of DoJa and by SavaJe as SavaJe OS The latter company was purchased by Sun in April and now forms the basis of Sun s JavaFX Mobile br The open source Mika VM aims to implement JavaME CDC FP but is not certified as such certified implementations are required to charge royalties which is impractical for an open source project Consequently devices which use this implementation are not allowed to claim JavaME CDC compatibility br The Linux based Android operating system uses a proprietary version of Java that is similar in intent but very different in many ways from Java ME br br br Connected Limited Device Configuration br br The Connected Limited Device Configuration CLDC contains a strict subset of the Java class libraries and is the minimum amount needed for a Java virtual machine to operate CLDC is basically used for classifying myriad devices into a fixed configuration br A configuration provides the most basic set of libraries and virtual machine features that must be present in each implementation of a J ME environment When coupled with one or more profiles the Connected Limited Device Configuration gives developers a solid Java platform for creating applications for consumer and embedded devices br The configuration is designed for devices with KB to KB total memory which has a minimum of KB of ROM and KB of RAM available for the Java platform br br br Mobile Information Device Profile br Designed for mobile phones the Mobile Information Device Profile includes a GUI and a data storage API and MIDP includes a basic D gaming API Applications written for this profile are called MIDlets br JSR Mobile Information Device Profile Final release on Dec specified the rd generation Mobile Information Device Profile MIDP expanding upon the functionality in all areas as well as improving interoperability across devices A key design goal of MIDP is backward compatibility with MIDP content br br br Information Module Profile br The Information Module Profile IMP is a profile for embedded headless devices such as vending machines industrial embedded applications security systems and similar devices with either simple or no display and with some limited network connectivity br Originally introduced by Siemens Mobile and Nokia as JSR IMP is a strict subset of MIDP except that it does not include user interface APIs in other words it does not include support for the Java package javax microedition lcdui JSR also known as IMP NG is IMP s next generation that is based on MIDP leveraging MIDP s new security and networking types and APIs and other APIs such as PushRegistry and platformRequest but again it does not include UI APIs nor the game API br br br Connected Device Configuration br br The Connected Device Configuration is a subset of Java SE containing almost all the libraries that are not GUI related It is richer than CLDC br br br Foundation Profile br The Foundation Profile is a Java ME Connected Device Configuration CDC profile This profile is intended to be used by devices requiring a complete implementation of the Java virtual machine up to and including the entire Java Platform Standard Edition API Typical implementations will use some subset of that API set depending on the additional profiles supported This specification was developed under the Java Community Process br br br Personal Basis Profile br The Personal Basis Profile extends the Foundation Profile to include lightweight GUI support in the form of an AWT subset This is the platform that BD J is built upon br br br JSRs Java Specification Requests br br br Foundation br br br Main extensions br br br Future br br br ESR br The ESR consortium is devoted to Standards for embedded Java Especially cost effective Standards br Typical applications domains are industrial control machine to machine medical e
