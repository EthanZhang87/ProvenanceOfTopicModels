A web service WS is either br br a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device communicating with each other via the Internet or br a server running on a computer device listening for requests at a particular port over a network serving web documents HTML JSON XML images br In a web service a web technology such as HTTP is used for transferring machine readable file formats such as XML and JSON br In practice a web service commonly provides an object oriented web based interface to a database server utilized for example by another web server or by a mobile app that provides a user interface to the end user Many organizations that provide data in formatted HTML pages will also provide that data on their server as XML or JSON often through a Web service to allow syndication Another application offered to the end user may be a mashup where a Web server consumes several Web services at different machines and compiles the content into one user interface br br br Web services generic br br br Asynchronous JavaScript And XML br br Asynchronous JavaScript And XML AJAX is a dominant technology for Web services Developing from the combination of HTTP servers JavaScript clients and Plain Old XML as distinct from SOAP and W C Web Services now it is frequently used with JSON as well as or instead of XML br br br REST br br Representational State Transfer REST is an architecture for well behaved Web services that can function at Internet scale br In a document the W C sets following REST as a key distinguishing feature of Web services br br We can identify two major classes of Web services br REST compliant Web services in which the primary purpose of the service is to manipulate XML representations of Web resources using a uniform set of stateless operations and br arbitrary Web services in which the service may expose an arbitrary set of operations br br br Web services that use markup languages br There are a number of Web services that use markup languages br br JSON RPC br JSON WSP br Representational state transfer REST versus remote procedure call RPC br Simple Object Access Protocol br Web Services Conversation Language WSCL br Web Services Description Language WSDL developed by the W C br Web Services Flow Language WSFL superseded by BPEL br Web template br WS MetadataExchange br XML Interface for Network Services XINS provides a POX style web service specification format br br br Web API br br A Web API is a development in Web services where emphasis has been moving to simpler representational state transfer REST based communications Restful APIs do not require XML based Web service protocols SOAP and WSDL to support their interfaces br br br W C Web services br In relation to W C Web services the W C defined a Web service as br br A web service is a software system designed to support interoperable machine to machine interaction over a network It has an interface described in a machine processable format specifically WSDL Other systems interact with the web service in a manner prescribed by its description using SOAP messages typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML serialization in conjunction with other web related standards br W C Web Services may use SOAP over HTTP protocol allowing less costly more efficient interactions over the Internet than via proprietary solutions like EDI B B Besides SOAP over HTTP Web services can also be implemented on other reliable transport mechanisms like FTP In a document the Web Services Architecture Working Group defined a Web services architecture requiring a standardized implementation of a Web service br br br Explanation br br The term Web service describes a standardized way of integrating Web based applications using the XML SOAP WSDL and UDDI open standards over an Internet Protocol backbone XML is the data format used to contain the data and provide metadata around it SOAP is used to transfer the data WSDL is used for describing the services available and UDDI lists what services are available br A Web service is a method of communication between two electronic devices over a network It is a software function provided at a network address over the Web with the service always on as in the concept of utility computing br Many organizations use multiple software systems for management Different software systems often need to exchange data with each other and a Web service is a method of communication that allows two software systems to exchange this data over the Internet The software system that requests data is called a service requester whereas the software system that would process the request and provide the data is called a service provider br Different software may use different programming languages and hence there is a need for a method of data exchange that doesn t depend upon a particular programming language Most types of software can however interpret XML tags Thus Web services can use XML files for data exchange br Rules for communication with different systems need to be defined such as br br How one system can request data from another system br Which specific parameters are needed in the data request br What would be the structure of the data produced Normally data is exchanged in XML files and the structure of the XML file is validated against a xsd file br What error messages to display when a certain rule for communication is not observed to make troubleshooting easier br All of these rules for communication are defined in a file called WSDL Web Services Description Language which has a wsdl extension Proposals for Autonomous Web Services AWS seek to develop more flexible Web services that do not rely on strict rules br A directory called UDDI Universal Description Discovery and Integration defines which software system should be contacted for which type of data So when one software system needs one particular report data it would go to the UDDI and find out which other systems it can contact for receiving that data Once the software system finds out which other systems it should contact it would then contact that system using a special protocol called SOAP Simple Object Access Protocol The service provider system would first validate the data request by referring to the WSDL file and then process the request and send the data under the SOAP protocol br br br Automated design methods br br Automated tools can aid in the creation of a Web service For services using WSDL it is possible to either automatically generate WSDL for existing classes a bottom up model or to generate a class skeleton given existing WSDL a top down model br br A developer using a bottom up model writes implementing classes first in some programming language and then uses a WSDL generating tool to expose methods from these classes as a Web service This is simpler to develop but may be harder to maintain if the original classes are subject to frequent change br A developer using a top down model writes the WSDL document first and then uses a code generating tool to produce the class skeleton to be completed as necessary This model is generally considered more difficult but can produce cleaner designs and is generally more resistant to change As long as the message formats between the sender and receiver do not change changes in the sender and receiver themselves do not affect the Web service The technique is also referred to as contract first since the WSDL or contract between sender and receiver is the starting point br A developer using a Subset WSDL SWSDL i e a WSDL with the subset operation in the original WSDL can perform Web service testing and top down development br br br Criticism br Critics of non RESTful Web services often complain that they are too complex and based upon large software vendors or integrators rather than typical open source implementations br There are also concerns about performance due to Web services use of XML as a message format and SOAP HTTP in enveloping and transporting br br br Regression testing of Web services br Functional and non functional testing of Web services is done with the help of WSDL parsing Regression testing is performed by identifying the changes made to upgrade software Web service regression testing needs can be categorized in three different ways namely changes in WSDL changes in the code and selective re testing of operations We can capture the above three needs in three intermediate forms of Subset WSDL namely Difference WSDL DWSDL Unit WSDL UWSDL and Reduced WSDL RWSDL respectively These three Subset WSDLs are then combined to form Combined WSDL CWSDL that is further used for regression testing of the Web service This will help in Automated Web Service Change Management AWSCM by performing the selection of the relevant test cases to construct a reduced test suite from the old test suite br br Web services testing can also be automated using several test automation tools like SoapUI Oracle Application Testing Suite OATS Unified Functional Testing Selenium etc br br br Web service change management br Work related to the capture and visualization of changes made to a Web service Visualization and computation of changes can be done in the form of intermediate artifacts Subset WSDL The insight on the computation of change impact is helpful in testing top down development and reduce regression testing AWSCM is a tool that can identify subset operations in a WSDL file to construct a subset WSDL br br br Discovering and Searching for Web Services br While UDDI was intended to serve as a service directory and become the means to discovering web services many vendors discontinued their UDDI solutions or repositories between including Microsoft SAP IBM among others A key study published in WWW Conference Beijing China presented the state of SOAP based web services and concluded that only of the available SOAP based web services at the time of the study were actually active or can be invoked The study also found that search engines were becoming an ideal source for searching for web services compared to that of service registries like the UDDI due its design complexity br br br See also br List of web service frameworks br List of web service protocols br List of web service
