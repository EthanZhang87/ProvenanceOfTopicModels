JavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications as well as rich web applications that can run across a wide variety of devices JavaFX has support for desktop computers and web browsers on Microsoft Windows Linux including Raspberry Pi and macOS as well as mobile devices running iOS and Android through Gluon Mobile br With the release of JDK in Oracle made JavaFX part of the OpenJDK under the OpenJFX project in order to increase the pace of its development br Open source JavaFXPorts works for iOS iPhone and iPad and Android The related commercial software created under the name Gluon supports the same mobile platforms with additional features plus desktop This allows a single source code base to create applications for the desktop iOS and Android devices br br br Features br br JavaFX was based on the concept of a common profile that is intended to span across all devices supported by JavaFX This approach makes it possible for developers to use a common programming model while building an application targeted for both desktop and mobile devices and to share much of the code graphics assets and content between desktop and mobile versions To address the need for tuning applications on a specific class of devices the JavaFX platform includes APIs that are desktop or mobile specific For example the JavaFX Desktop profile includes Swing and advanced visual effects br For the end user the Drag to Install feature enables them to drag a JavaFX widget an application residing in a website and drop it onto their desktop The application will not lose its state or context even after the browser is closed An application can also be re launched by clicking on a shortcut that gets created automatically on the user s desktop br This behavior is enabled out of the box by the Java applet mechanism since the Java u update and is leveraged by JavaFX from the underlying Java layer br Sun touts Drag to Install as opening up of a new distribution model and allowing developers to break away from the browser br JavaFX x included a set of plug ins for Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator that enable advanced graphics to be integrated directly into JavaFX applications The plug ins generate JavaFX Script code that preserves the layers and structure of the graphics Developers can then add animation or effects to the static graphics imported There is also an SVG graphics converter tool also known as Media Factory that allows for importing graphics and previewing assets after the conversion to JavaFX format br Before version of JavaFX developers used a statically typed declarative language called JavaFX Script to build JavaFX applications Because JavaFX Script was compiled to Java bytecode programmers could also use Java code instead JavaFX applications before could run on any desktop that could run Java SE just like it is with the current versions br JavaFX and later is implemented as a Java library and applications using JavaFX are written in normal Java code The scripting language was scrapped by Oracle however the development of it continued for a few years in the Visage project finally ending in br Sun Microsystems licensed a custom typeface called Amble for use on JavaFX powered devices The font family was designed by mobile user interface design specialist Punchcut and is available as part of the JavaFX SDK Release br br br WebView br WebView the embedded web browser component uses the WebKit browser engine It supports the usual HTML features such as canvas media meter progress details and summary tags as well as MathML SVG JavaScript and CSS WebAssembly support is not enabled br br br JavaFX Mobile br br JavaFX Mobile was the implementation of the JavaFX platform for rich web applications aimed at mobile devices JavaFX Mobile x applications can be developed in the same language JavaFX Script as JavaFX x applications for browser or desktop and using the same tools JavaFX SDK and the JavaFX Production Suite This concept makes it possible to share code base and graphics assets for desktop and mobile applications Through integration with Java ME the JavaFX applications have access to capabilities of the underlying handset such as the filesystem camera GPS bluetooth or accelerometer br An independent application platform built on Java JavaFX Mobile is capable of running on multiple mobile operating systems including Android Windows Mobile and proprietary real time operating systems br JavaFX Mobile was publicly available as part of the JavaFX release announced by Sun Microsystems on February br Sun planned to enable out of the box support of JavaFX on the devices by working with handset manufacturers and mobile operators to preload the JavaFX Mobile runtime on the handsets JavaFX Mobile running on an Android was demonstrated at JavaOne and selected partnerships incl LG Electronics Sony Ericsson were announced at the JavaFX Mobile launch in February br br br Components br The JavaFX platform includes the following components br br The JavaFX SDK Including among other things graphics media services rich text libraries and the web view br NetBeans IDE for JavaFX NetBeans with drag and drop palette to add objects with transformations effects and animations plus a set of samples and best practices For Eclipse users there is a community supported plugin hosted on e fx clipse br JavaFX Scene Builder This was introduced for JavaFX and later A user interface UI is created by dragging and dropping controls from a palette The layout is saved as an FXML file which is a special XML format br br br History br br br Releases after version bump br JavaFX is now part of the JRE JDK for Java released on March and has the same numbering i e

APIs are in Java and the requirement to have a callback interface and Java implementation class are no longer necessary In addition the scene graph has been designed to allow scenes to be constructed on background threads and then attached to live scenes in a threadsafe manner br On May Oracle released the JavaFX Beta The beta release was only made available for and bit versions of Microsoft Windows XP Windows Vista and Windows An Early Access version for Mac OS X was also available for members of the JavaFX Partner Program at the time while Linux support was planned for a future release
