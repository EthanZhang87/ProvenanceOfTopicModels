title: Free Java implementations
id: 1107856
Free Java implementations are software projects that implement Oracle s Java technologies and are distributed under free software licences making them free software Sun released most of its Java source code as free software in May so it can now almost be considered a free Java implementation Java implementations include compilers runtimes class libraries etc Advocates of free and open source software refer to free or open source Java virtual machine software as free runtimes or free Java runtimes br Some advocates in this movement prefer not to use the term Java as it has trademark issues associated with it Hence even though it is a free Java movement the term free Java runtimes is avoided by them br br br Mid s to br The first free project to offer substantial parts of Java platform functionality was likely guavac which began some time before November br Since then the free software movement developed other Java compilers most notably the GNU Compiler for Java Others include the Eclipse Java Compiler ECJ which is maintained by the Eclipse Foundation and Jikes which is no longer actively maintained Since the GNU Compiler Collection s release GCJ its Java compiler is using the ECJ parser front end for parsing Java br Examples of free runtime environments include Kaffe SableVM and gcj br GNU Classpath is the main free software class library for Java Most free runtimes use GNU Classpath as their class library br In May Apache Harmony was announced however the project chose the Apache License which was at the time incompatible with all existing free Java implementations br Another event in May was the announcement that OpenOffice org would depend on Java features which free software implementations couldn t provide Following controversy OpenOffice org adopted a guideline requiring it to work with free Java implementations br Notable applications that already worked with free software Java implementations before November include OpenOffice org and Vuze both of which work when compiled with GCJ br br br Sun s November announcement br On November Sun released its compiler javac under the GNU General Public License br As of September as well as javac Sun has released the code of HotSpot the virtual machine and almost all the Java Class Library as free software br Following their promise to release a fully buildable JDK based almost completely on free and open source code in the first half of Sun released the complete source code of the Class library under the GPL on May except some limited parts that were licensed by Sun from rd parties who did not want their code to be released under a free software licence Sun has stated that it aims to replace the parts that remain proprietary and closed source with alternative implementations and make the class library completely free and open source Since there s some encumbered code in the JDK Sun will continue to use that code in commercial releases until it s replaced by fully functional free and open source alternatives br br br After the May code release br br As of May the only part of the Class library that remains proprietary as of May for OpenJDK br br and less than as of May in OpenJDK br is the SNMP implementation br Since the first May release Sun Microsystems with the help of the community has released as free software or replaced with free software alternatives almost all the encumbered code br br All the audio engine code including the software synthesizer has been released as open source The closed source software synthesizer has been replaced by a new synthesizer developed specifically for OpenJDK called Gervill br All cryptography classes used in the Class library have been released as free software br FreeType has replaced the code that scales and rasterizes fonts br LittleCMS has replaced the native color management system There is a pluggable layer in the JDK so that the commercial version can use the old color management system and OpenJDK can use LittleCMS br The open sourced Pisces renderer used in the phoneME project has replaced the anti aliasing graphics rasterizer code This code is fully functional but still needs some performance enhancements br The JavaScript plugin has been open sourced the JavaScript engine itself was open sourced from the beginning br Because of these previously encumbered components it was not possible to build OpenJDK only with free software components In order to be able to do this before the whole class library is made free and to be able to bundle OpenJDK in Fedora Core and other free Linux distributions Red Hat has started a project called IcedTea It is basically an OpenJDK GNU Classpath hybrid that can be used to bootstrap OpenJDK using only free software br As of March the Fedora distribution has been released with OpenJDK instead of the IcedTea implementation of OpenJDK Some of the stated reasons for this change are br br Sun has replaced most of the encumbrances for which IcedTea was providing replacements less than of encumbered code remains in the class library and this code is not necessary to run OpenJDK br OpenJDK was a stable branch whereas OpenJDK was unstable and not expected to ship a stable release until br Sun has licensed the OpenJDK trademark for use in Fedora br In June it was announced that IcedTea as the packaged version of OpenJDK on Fedora had passed the Technology Compatibility Kit tests and can claim to be a fully compatible Java implementation br In September Azul Systems released Zulu a free open source build of OpenJDK for Windows Server and the Microsoft Azure Cloud Later releases added support for Mac OS X multiple versions of Linux and the Java Platform Standard Edition version Zulu is certified compliant with Java SE and using the OpenJDK Community Technology Compatibility Kit br Amazon have released Amazon Corretto a no cost multiplatform production ready distribution of the Open Java Development Kit It is released under GPL v with the Classpath Exception Long term support versions of Java and Java are available It was first publicly released on January br In the Eclipse Foundation released AdoptOpenJDK now named Adoptium whose main goal is to promote and support free and open source high quality runtimes and associated technology for use across the Java ecosystem br br br See also br br Java
