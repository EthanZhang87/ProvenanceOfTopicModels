Google Web Toolkit GWT or GWT Web Toolkit is an open source set of tools that allows web developers to create and maintain JavaScript front end applications in Java It is licensed under Apache License br GWT supports various web development tasks such as asynchronous remote procedure calls history management bookmarking UI abstraction internationalization and cross browser portability br br br History br GWT version RC was released on May Google announced GWT at the JavaOne conference in br br In August Google acquired Instantiations a company known for focusing on Eclipse Java developer tools including GWT Designer which is now bundled with Google Plugin for Eclipse br In with the introduction of the Dart programming language Google stated that GWT would continue to be supported for the foreseeable future while also hinting at a possible rapprochement between the two Google approaches to structured web programming However they also mentioned that several of the engineers previously working on GWT are now working on Dart br In at their annual I O conference Google announced that GWT would be transformed from a Google project to a fully open sourced project In July Google posted on its GWT blog that the transformation to an open source project was completed br br br Development with GWT br Using GWT developers have the ability to develop and debug Ajax applications in the Java language using the Java development tools of their choice When the application is deployed the GWT cross compiler translates the Java application to standalone JavaScript files that are optionally obfuscated and deeply optimized When needed JavaScript can also be embedded directly into Java code using Java comments br GWT does not revolve only around user interface programming it is a broad set of tools for building high performance client side JavaScript functionality Indeed many architectural decisions are left entirely to the developer The GWT mission statement clarifies the philosophical breakdown of GWT s role versus the developer s role History is an example of such although GWT manages history tokens as users click Back or Forward in the browser it does not detail how to map history tokens to an application state br GWT applications can be run in two modes br br Development mode formerly Hosted mode The application runs as Java bytecode within the Java Virtual Machine JVM This mode is typically used for development supporting the hot swapping of code and debugging In the classic implementation of Dev Mode was rendered unusable by browser updates until its replacement with the more compatible Super Dev Mode which became the default in GWT br Production mode formerly Web mode The application is run as pure JavaScript and HTML compiled from the Java source This mode is typically used for deployment br Several open source plugins are available for making GWT development easier with other IDEs including GWT NB for NetBeans Cypal Studio for GWT an Eclipse plugin and GWT Developer for JDeveloper The Google Plugin for Eclipse handles most GWT related tasks in the IDE including creating projects invoking the GWT compiler creating GWT launch configurations validation and syntax highlighting br br br Components br The major GWT components include br br GWT Java to JavaScript Compiler br Translates the Java programming language to the JavaScript programming language br GWT Development Mode br Allows the developers to run and execute GWT applications in development mode the app runs as Java in the JVM without compiling to JavaScript Prior to GWT hosted mode provided a special purpose hosted browser to debug your GWT code In the web page being debugged is viewed within a regular browser Development mode is supported by using a native code plugin called the Google Web Toolkit Developer Plugin for many popular browsers br JRE emulation library br JavaScript implementations of the commonly used classes in the Java standard class library such as most of the java lang package classes and a subset of the java util package classes br GWT Web UI class library br A set of custom interfaces and classes for creating widgets br br br Features br Dynamic and reusable UI components programmers can use built in classes to implement otherwise time consuming dynamic behaviors such as drag and drop or complex visual tree structures br Simple RPC mechanism br Browser history management br Support for full featured Java debugging br GWT handles some cross browser issues for the developer br Unit testing integration br Support for Internationalization and localization br HTML Canvas support subject to API changes br The developers can mix handwritten JavaScript in the Java source code using the JavaScript Native Interface JSNI br Support for using Google APIs in GWT applications initially support for Google Gears br Open source br The developers can design and develop their applications in a pure object oriented fashion since they re using Java instead of JavaScript Common JavaScript errors such as typos and type mismatches are caught at compile time br The JavaScript that the GWT compiler generates can be tailored to be either unobfuscated Source Mapped or Source Code and easier to understand or obfuscated and compressed br A number of libraries are available for GWT by Google and third parties These extend the toolkit s features br br br Available widgets br As of version September Google Web Toolkit offers several widgets and panels br br Many common widgets not found in the GWT have been implemented in third party libraries br br br Enterprise usage br GWT uses or supports Java Apache Tomcat or similar web container Eclipse IDE Internet Explorer and internationalization and localization Java based GWT rich web applications can be tested using JUnit testing framework and code coverage tools Because GWT allows compile time verification of images CSS and business logic many common development defects are automatically discovered without requiring the manual testing commonly required by RIAs br Google has noted that some of its products are GWT based Blogger AdWords Flights Wallet Offers Groups Inbox br br br GWT br On December Google launched Google Web Toolkit with Speed Tracer br Version of GWT offers a number of new features including br br In Browser Development Mode formerly known as Out Of Process Hosted Mode OOPHM prior to version the hosted mode was used to embed a modified browser to allow running the bytecode version of the application during development With version hosted mode renamed development mode allows using any supported browser to view the page being debugged through the use of a browser plugin The plugin communicates with the development mode shell using TCP IP which allows cross platform debugging for example debugging in Internet Explorer on Windows from a development mode shell running on a Linux machine br Code splitting with the developer providing split points in the source code the GWT compiler can split the JavaScript code into several small chunks instead of one big download This will lead to reduced application startup time as the size of the initial download is decreased br Declarative User Interface using an XML format the new feature known as UiBinder allows the creation of user interfaces through declaration rather than code This allows a clean separation of UI construction and behavior implementation br Resource bundling the ClientBundle interface will allow resources of any nature images CSS text binary to be bundled together and transferred in one download resulting in fewer round trips to the server and hence lower application latency br Since the new development mode removed most platform specific code the new version will be distributed as a unique archive instead of one per supported platform as was the case with previous versions br br br Mobile br As a general framework for making web apps Google Web Toolkit is also capable of being used as a framework for creating mobile and tablet apps either by making the needed widgets and animations from scratch or by using one of the mobile frameworks for GWT An HTML app written in GWT can have separate views for Tablets and Mobile phones br br br See also br br Dart programming
