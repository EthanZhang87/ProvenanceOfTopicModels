A Character Large OBject or CLOB is part of the SQL standard data types It is a collection of character data in a database management system usually stored in a separate location that is referenced in the table itself Oracle and IBM Db provide a construct explicitly named CLOB and the majority of other database systems support some form of the concept often labeled as text memo or long character fields br CLOBs usually have very high size limits of the order of gigabytes The tradeoff for the capacity is usually limited access methods In particular some database systems limit certain SQL clauses and or functions such as LIKE or SUBSTRING from being used on CLOBs Those that permit such operations may perform them very slowly br Alternative methods of accessing the data are often provided including means of extracting or inserting ranges of data from the CLOB br Database systems exhibit variations in their storage patterns for CLOBs Certain systems consistently store CLOBs as references to external data residing outside the table In contrast some systems initially store small CLOBs within the table itself but switch their storage approach when the data size surpasses a specific threshold Additionally certain systems offer configurable options to adapt their behavior br br br Implementations br PostgreSQL unsupported but it can be easily defined as a synonym to the text type with create domain CLOB as TEXT br MariaDB supported br MySQL support unknown There used to be a CLOB mentioned in the manual but the data type is no longer mentioned in later manuals br Mimer SQL supported br br br See also br Binary large object br Binary blob br br br
