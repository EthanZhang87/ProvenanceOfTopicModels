In computer security arbitrary code execution ACE is an attacker s ability to run any commands or code of the attacker s choice on a target machine or in a target process An arbitrary code execution vulnerability is a security flaw in software or hardware allowing arbitrary code execution A program that is designed to exploit such a vulnerability is called an arbitrary code execution exploit The ability to trigger arbitrary code execution over a network especially via a wide area network such as the Internet is often referred to as remote code execution RCE or RCX br Arbitrary code execution signifies that if someone sends a specially designed set of data to a computer they can make it do whatever they want Even though this particular weakness may not cause actual problems in the real world researchers have discussed whether it suggests a natural tendency for computers to have vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized code execution br br br Vulnerability types br There are a number of classes of vulnerability that can lead to an attacker s ability to execute arbitrary commands or code For example br br Memory safety vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows or over reads br Deserialization vulnerabilities br Type confusion vulnerabilities br GNU ldd arbitrary code execution br br br Methods br Arbitrary code execution is commonly achieved through control over the instruction pointer such as a jump or a branch of a running process The instruction pointer points to the next instruction in the process that will be executed Control over the value of the instruction pointer therefore gives control over which instruction is executed next In order to execute arbitrary code many exploits inject code into the process for example by sending input to it which gets stored in an input buffer in RAM and use a vulnerability to change the instruction pointer to have it point to the injected code The injected code will then automatically get executed This type of attack exploits the fact that most computers which use a Von Neumann architecture do not make a general distinction between code and data so that malicious code can be camouflaged as harmless input data Many newer CPUs have mechanisms to make this harder such as a no execute bit br br br Combining with privilege escalation br br On its own an arbitrary code execution exploit will give the attacker the same privileges as the target process that is vulnerable For example if exploiting a flaw in a web browser an attacker could act as the user performing actions such as modifying personal computer files or accessing banking information but would not be able to perform system level actions unless the user in question also had that access br To work around this once an attacker can execute arbitrary code on a target there is often an attempt at a privilege escalation exploit in order to gain additional control This may involve the kernel itself or an account such as Administrator SYSTEM or root With or without this enhanced control exploits have the potential to do severe damage or turn the computer into a zombie but privilege escalation helps with hiding the attack from the legitimate administrator of the system br br br Examples br Retrogaming hobbyists have managed to find vulnerabilities in classic video games that allow them to execute arbitrary code usually using a precise sequence of button inputs in a tool assisted superplay to cause a buffer overflow allowing them to write to protected memory At Awesome Games Done Quick a group of speedrunning enthusiasts managed to code and run versions of the games Pong and Snake in a copy of Super Mario World by utilizing an out of bounds read of a function pointer that points to a user controlled buffer to execute arbitrary code br On June Bosnian security researcher Jean Yves Avenard of Mozilla discovered an ACE vulnerability in Windows br On May a security researcher discovered an ACE vulnerability in the Zip file archiver br PHP has been the subject of numerous ACE vulnerabilities br On December a RCE vulnerability called Log Shell was discovered in popular logging framework Log j affecting many services including iCloud Minecraft Java Edition and Steam and characterized as the single biggest most critical vulnerability of the last decade br br br See also br Computer security br BlueKeep br Follina security vulnerability br br br
