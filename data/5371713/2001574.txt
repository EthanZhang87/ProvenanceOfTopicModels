title: Java Web Start
id: 2001574
In computing Java Web Start also known as JavaWS javaws or JAWS is a deprecated framework developed by Sun Microsystems now Oracle that allows users to start application software for the Java Platform directly from the Internet using a web browser The technology enables seamless version updating for globally distributed applications and greater control of memory allocation to the Java virtual machine br Java Web Start was distributed as part of the Java Platform until being removed in Java SE following its deprecation in Java SE The code for Java Web Start was not released by Oracle as part of OpenJDK and thus OpenJDK originally did not support it IcedTea Web provides an independent open source implementation of Java Web Start that is currently developed by the AdoptOpenJDK community RedHat and Karakun AG and which is bundled in some OpenJDK installers Next to this OpenWebStart provides an open source based implementation that is based on IcedTea Web but offers more features and commercial support options br br br Functionality br Unlike Java applets Web Start applications do not run inside the browser By default they run in the same sandbox as applets with several minor extensions like allowing to load and save the file that is explicitly selected by the user through the file selection dialog Only signed applications can be configured to have additional permissions br Web Start has an advantage over applets in that it overcomes many compatibility problems with browsers Java plugins and different JVM versions Web Start programs are no longer an integrated part of the web page they are independent applications that run in a separate frame br Web Start can also launch unmodified applets that are packaged inside jar files by writing the appropriate JNLP file This file can also pass the applet parameters Such applets also run in a separate frame Applet launcher may not support some specific cases like loading class as resource br Like applets Java Web Start is cross platform br br br Deprecation br With JDK several deployment technologies including applets and Java Web Start were deprecated by Oracle br In March Oracle announced it will not include Java Web Start in Java SE LTS and later Developers will need to transition to other deployment technologies A few stand alone alternatives have since arisen br br br Implementation br br The developer prepares a special XML file with JNLP extension This file describes the application requirements code location parameters and additional permissions if any The browser downloads this file as any other and following its MIME type application x java jnlp file opens it with Web Start tool Web Start tool downloads all necessary resources and launches the application br Java Web Start provides a series of classes in the javax jnlp package which provide various services to the application Sun designed most of these services with the aim of allowing carefully controlled access to resources such as files and the system clipboard while restricting the application to authorized operations br Sun introduced version of Web Start in March while bit Windows support was added only in Java later than bit Java was first available Since J SE Web Start comes as a default part of Java Runtime Environment JRE called javaws computer administrators no longer have to install it separately br br br Java Network Launching Protocol JNLP br Programmers often speak of the Java Network Launching Protocol JNLP interchangeably with the term Web Start The JNLP protocol defined with an XML schema specifies how to launch Java Web Start applications JNLP consists of a set of rules defining how exactly to implement the launching mechanism JNLP files include information such as the location of the jar package file and the name of the main class for the application in addition to any other parameters for the program A properly configured browser passes JNLP files to a Java Runtime Environment JRE which in turn downloads the application onto the user s machine and starts executing it The development of JNLP took place under the Java Community Process as JSR It includes the original release the subsequent maintenance release and as of the pending maintenance release br Important Web Start features include the ability to automatically download and install a JRE in the case where the user does not have Java installed and for programmers to specify which JRE version a given program needs in order to execute The user does not have to remain connected to the Internet to execute the downloaded programs because they execute from a locally maintained cache Updates of the software download from the Web and become available when the user has a connection to the Internet thus easing the burden of deployment br Any computer user can use JNLP simply by installing a JNLP client most commonly Java Web Start The installation can occur automatically such that the end user sees the client launcher downloading and installing the Java application when first executed br JNLP works in a similar fashion to how HTTP HTML works for the web For rendering an HTML webpage after the user clicks on a weblink the browser submits a URL to a webserver which replies with an HTML file The browser then requests the resources referred to by this file images css and finally renders the page once it has received enough information Page rendering usually starts before all resources have downloaded some resources not critical to the layout of the page such as images can follow on afterwards br JNLP mirrors this process in the same way that a Web browser renders a webpage a JNLP client renders a Java app After the user clicks on a weblink the browser submits a URL to a webserver which replies with a JNLP file instead of a HTML file for the application The JNLP client parses this file requests the resources specified jar files waits for the retrieval of all required resources and then launches the application The JNLP file can list resources as lazy which informs the JNLP client that the application does not need those resources to start but can retrieve them later on when if the application requests them br br br Example br br The example below gives a simple JNLP file to launch the applet specifying code base source main class and window size Such file contains all necessary references and is self sufficient to launch the application As no permissions are requested the code will run in a sandbox JNLP also states that this application can run offline if already cached and should be updated as a background process br br br Pack compression br To reduce the size of a Java Web Start application Sun Microsystems introduced a compression system called Pack in Java It can compress a large jar file to one ninth of its original size if it contains only Java classes br Java Web Start has supported Pack since it first appeared but initially this feature required server side cooperation and a certain amount of expertise to set up When Sun introduced Java SE u Pack support became available without the need for special server support Application designers can enable or disable this feature within JNLP files br On slow connections Pack gives a performance boost in application startup time and download time br br br Signed Web Start applications br By default Java Web Start applications run restricted which means that they do not have access to some system resources such as local files But publishers can remove these restrictions by signing their Web Start applications with the jarsigner tool that comes with the JDK br br br Alternatives br br The open source IcedTea project provides an alternative JNLP implementation in IcedTea Web As of version it also works on newer versions without official JWS support br To run Java Web Start based application after the release of Java the company Karakun AG has released the open source tool OpenWebStart based on IcedTea Web The tool includes all the functionality of IcedTea Web and adds extended features such as native installers for Mac OS Windows and Linux IcedTea Web was created with support from RedHat and AdoptOpenJDK br br br Notable applications br br ArgoUML an UML diagramming application br CrossFTP an FTP client and server br Elluminate Live a web conferencing
