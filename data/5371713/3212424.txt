RMI IIOP read as RMI over IIOP denotes the Java Remote Method Invocation RMI interface over the Internet Inter Orb Protocol IIOP which delivers Common Object Request Broker Architecture CORBA distributed computing capabilities to the Java platform It was initially based on two specifications the Java Language Mapping to OMG IDL and CORBA IIOP br With features inherited from CORBA software components that work together can be written in multiple computer languages and run on multiple computers In other words it supports multiple platforms and can make remote procedure calls to execute subroutines on another computer as defined by RMI br br br History br The Java RMI IIOP specification was created to simplify the development of CORBA applications while preserving all major benefits It was developed by Sun Microsystems and IBM combining features of Java RMI technology with features of CORBA technology br br br Specification br RMI IIOP uses generated code for remote objects and does not require supplementary classes for non trivial data unlike CORBA This results in less complexity and a smaller footprint Both CORBA and RMI IIOP utilize the General Inter ORB Protocol communication standard br RMI IIOP is largely based on the Object by Value concept that serves as a container or direct replacement for CORBA structures unions sequences arrays and strings No separate IDL is necessary Instead the data structure definitions are discovered automatically via reflection mechanisms However it is possible to generate the IDL definitions for the involved RMI IIOP data structures and use these definitions to exercise finer control between RMI IIOP and CORBA communicating partners br Recent versions of RMI IIOP derive their servants from the standard Servant class Hence it is possible to connect them to a CORBA ORB manually involving one or more of Portable Object Adapters Portable Interceptors CORBA naming services along with other standard CORBA features br br br br br br External links br ORACLE Java SE Documentation RMI IIOP
