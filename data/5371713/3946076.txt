title: Apache iBATIS
id: 3946076
iBATIS is a persistence framework which automates the mapping between SQL databases and objects in Java NET and Ruby on Rails In Java the objects are POJOs Plain Old Java Objects The mappings are decoupled from the application logic by packaging the SQL statements in XML configuration files The result is a significant reduction in the amount of code that a developer needs to access a relational database using lower level APIs like JDBC and ODBC br Other persistence frameworks such as Hibernate allow the creation of an object model in Java say by the user and create and maintain the relational database automatically iBATIS takes the reverse approach the developer starts with a SQL database and iBATIS automates the creation of the Java objects Both approaches have advantages and iBATIS is a good choice when the developer does not have full control over the SQL database schema For example an application may need to access an existing SQL database used by other software or access a new database whose schema is not fully under the application developer s control such as when a specialized database design team has created the schema and carefully optimized it for high performance br On May the development team forked the code creating a new project called MyBatis and making new releases there As a consequence the Apache iBATIS project became inactive and was moved to the Apache Attic in June br br br Usage br For example assume there is a database table PRODUCT PROD ID INTEGER PROD DESC VARCHAR and a Java class com example Product id int description String To read the product record having the key PROD ID into a new Product POJO the following mapping is added into an iBATIS XML mapping file br br A new Java Product object can then be retrieved from the database for product number as follows br br In the mapping file example value refers to the long integer value passed into the query If the parameter is a Java object then values from properties on that object can be inserted into the query using a similar notation For example if the parameter class is a com example Product which has a property called id then value can be replaced with id The sqlMapClient object is an instance of class com ibatis sqlmap client SqlMapClient br br br Availability br The founder of iBATIS has publicly stated his dismay with Java but has continued to release new versions of iBATIS for Java Versions and came out in April and in July br The framework is currently available in Java NET and Ruby RBatis versions The jBati project is a JavaScript ORM inspired by iBATIS br The Apache iBator tool is closely related it connects to your database and uses its metadata to generate iBATIS mapping files and Java classes br br br History br In a project called iBATIS was started by Clinton Begin Originally the focus was on the development of cryptographic software solutions The first product to be released by iBATIS was Secrets a personal data encryption and signing tool much like PGP Secrets was written entirely in Java and was released under an open source license br That year Microsoft published a paper to demonstrate that its recent NET framework was more productive than Java For that purpose Microsoft built its own version of Sun s Web Pet Store a Web project that Sun had used to show Java best practices Java BluePrints Microsoft claimed that NET was times faster and times more productive than Java br In Clinton developed an application called JPetStore to demonstrate that Java could be more productive than NET and could also do so while achieving a better architecture than was used in the Microsoft implementation br JPetStore had a big impact and the database layer that Clinton used attracted the attention of the community Soon iBATIS Database Layer project started composed of two components iBATIS DAO and iBATIS SQL Maps br iBATIS was released in June It was a complete redesign while keeping the same features Clinton donated the iBATIS name and code to Apache Software Foundation and the project stayed in the ASF for six years br Eventually iBATIS DAO was deprecated considering that better DAO frameworks were available such as Spring Framework br On May iBATIS was published and simultaneously the development team decided to continue the development of the framework at Google Code under a new project called MyBatis br On June Apache announced that iBATIS was retired and moved to the Apache Attic br br br See also br Java Persistence API br Hibernate br EclipseLink br Apache Cayenne br IBM PureQuery br nHydrate br OpenJPA br br br br br br Bibliography br br br External links br Official website
