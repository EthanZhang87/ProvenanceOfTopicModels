Oracle TopLink is a mapping and persistence framework for Java developers TopLink is produced by Oracle and is a part of Oracle s OracleAS WebLogic and OC J servers It is an object persistence and object transformation framework TopLink provides development tools and run time functionalities that ease the development process and help increase functionality Persistent object oriented data is stored in relational databases which helps build high performance applications Storing data in either XML Extensible Markup Language or relational databases is made possible by transforming it from object oriented data br A rich user interface is possible on TopLink with the help of TopLink Mapping Workbench This Mapping Workbench makes it possible to carry out the following with ease br br Graphical mapping of an object model to data model br Generation of data model from its object model and vice versa br Auto mapping of any existing data models and object models br Oracle s JDeveloper IDE provides easy integration of these functionalities provided by the Mapping Workbench br With the use of TopLink users can stay more focused on their primary cause and let TopLink handle the integration of persistence and object transformation into their application Designing implementing and deploying process is accelerated as TopLink supports a variety of data sources and formats such as Relational database Object relational database Enterprise information system EIS XML and many others br br br History br Toplink was originally developed by The Object People in Smalltalk It was ported to Java in and called TopLink for Java In TopLink was acquired by Oracle Corporation and was developed under the Oracle Fusion Middleware product The TopLink code was donated to the Eclipse Foundation and the EclipseLink project was born in The EclipseLink now provides the functionality of TopLink Sun Microsystems selected EclipseLink in March as the implementation for the JPA JSR reference A number of versions of TopLink have been released since and the latest version c is available for free Download br br br Key Features br Rapidly build high performance enterprise applications that are scalable and maintainable br Extensive mapping support using relational object relational data type and XML br Advanced query capability including native SQL Java Persistence Query Language JPQL and EclipseLink Expressions framework br RESTful Services br Just in time reading br Tenant Isolation br NoSQL br Various Optimistic and pessimistic locking policies and options br JSON br Integration with commonly used application servers and databases br External Metadata Sources br TopLink Grid br br br Key Components br br br EclipseLink Core and API br The runtime component of TopLink is provided by the EclipseLink Core This API provides direct access to the runtime which is embedded into the application Persistence behavior is enabled by making application calls that invoke EclipseLink API to perform these functionalities which provides safe access to shared databases br Import the following class to use extended functionality of EclipseLink br br br Object Relational JPA Component br The binding of Java classes to XML schemas is possible with the help of Object XML which is an EclipseLink component By implementing JAXB mapping information is provided through annotations It also provides manipulation of XML br br br SDO Component br The Service Data Objects SDO provides with the use of SDO API use dynamic objects to customize and manipulate XML use of static data objects and conversion of XML Schema br br br Database Web Services Component br Database Web Services DBWS facilitates access to relational databases with the help of web service A database access can be made without the need to write a Java code The XML SOAP Messages and the databases are connected by the runtime component of DBWS which uses EclipseLink br br br TopLink Grid br TopLink Grid is an integration mechanism that provides connection between Oracle Coherence and EclipseLink An application generally interacts with the relational database which is its primary database But with TopLink the application can store data on the Coherence grid called as JPA on the grid br TopLink Grid functionality can be used only if the user has license for Oracle Coherence This functionality is provided by br br toplink grid jar br br To get support for TopLink Grid and EclipseLink users also need to import the following package of classes br br org eclipse coherence br br br TopLink Operations Insert Update Delete br Database operations like Insert Update and Delete can also be performed in TopLink The changes made to the database are reflected in the Oracle Coherence cache In Java Persistence API an entity is a persistence class Using TopLink a number of performance features for writing large amounts of data can be implemented Batch writing stored procedure support parameter binding statement ordering and other features are offered to satisfy database constraints br The basic operations are br br br Insert br The EntityManager method persist Object entity is used to add an instance and marks it for insertion into the database br br On completion of the transaction the newEmployee data will be inserted into the database br br br Update br Updating an entity means simply reading the transaction and updating the properties of this entity Updating the Employee LastName can be done as follows br br br Delete br Deleting an entity is the opposite of Insertion and can be one using remove Object entity method of the EntityManager The EntityManager method flush deletes the entity on completion of the transaction br br br Development Tools br Users can use most of the tools in the market and use TopLink along with it But the following toots provide special integration with TopLink br br Oracle JDeveloper br Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse br Eclipse br NetBeans br br br Supported Database Platforms br br br See also br br EclipseLink br Hibernate framework br Apache Cayenne br IBATIS br br br br br br External links br
