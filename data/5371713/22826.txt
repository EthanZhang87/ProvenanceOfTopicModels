id: 22826
An object database or object oriented database is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object oriented programming Object databases are different from relational databases which are table oriented A third type object relational databases is a hybrid of both approaches br Object databases have been considered since the early s br br br Overview br Object oriented database management systems OODBMSs also called ODBMS Object Database Management System combine database capabilities with object oriented programming language capabilities br OODBMSs allow object oriented programmers to develop the product store them as objects and replicate or modify existing objects to make new objects within the OODBMS Because the database is integrated with the programming language the programmer can maintain consistency within one environment in that both the OODBMS and the programming language will use the same model of representation Relational DBMS projects by way of contrast maintain a clearer division between the database model and the application br As the usage of web based technology increases with the implementation of Intranets and extranets companies have a vested interest in OODBMSs to display their complex data Using a DBMS that has been specifically designed to store data as objects gives an advantage to those companies that are geared towards multimedia presentation or organizations that utilize computer aided design CAD br Some object oriented databases are designed to work well with object oriented programming languages such as Delphi Ruby Python JavaScript Perl Java C Visual Basic NET C Objective C and Smalltalk others such as JADE have their own programming languages OODBMSs use exactly the same model as object oriented programming languages br br br History br Object database management systems grew out of research during the early to mid s into having intrinsic database management support for graph structured objects The term object oriented database system first appeared around Notable research projects included Encore Ob Server Brown University EXODUS University of Wisconsin Madison IRIS Hewlett Packard ODE Bell Labs ORION Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation or MCC Vodak GMD IPSI and Zeitgeist Texas Instruments The ORION project had more published papers than any of the other efforts Won Kim of MCC compiled the best of those papers in a book published by The MIT Press br Early commercial products included Gemstone Servio Logic name changed to GemStone Systems Gbase Graphael and Vbase Ontologic Additional commercial products entered the market in the late s through the mid s These included ITASCA Itasca Systems Jasmine Fujitsu marketed by Computer Associates Matisse Matisse Software Objectivity DB Objectivity Inc ObjectStore Progress Software acquired from eXcelon which was originally Object Design Incorporated ONTOS Ontos Inc name changed from Ontologic O O Technology merged with several companies acquired by Informix which was in turn acquired by IBM POET now FastObjects from Versant which acquired Poet Software Versant Object Database Versant Corporation VOSS Logic Arts and JADE Jade Software Corporation Some of these products remain on the market and have been joined by new open source and commercial products such as InterSystems Cach br Object database management systems added the concept of persistence to object programming languages The early commercial products were integrated with various languages GemStone Smalltalk Gbase LISP Vbase COP and VOSS Virtual Object Storage System for Smalltalk For much of the s C dominated the commercial object database management market Vendors added Java in the late s and more recently C br Starting in object databases have seen a second growth period when open source object databases emerged that were widely affordable and easy to use because they are entirely written in

br Object databases based on persistent programming acquired a niche in application areas such as br engineering and spatial databases telecommunications and scientific areas such as high energy physics and molecular biology br Another group of object databases focuses on embedded use in devices packaged software and real time systems br br br Technical features br Most object databases also offer some kind of query language allowing objects to be found using a declarative programming approach It is in the area of object query languages and the integration of the query and navigational interfaces that the biggest differences between products are found An attempt at standardization was made by the ODMG with the Object Query Language OQL br Access to data can be faster because an object can be retrieved directly without a search by following pointers br Another area of variation between products is in the way that the schema of a database is defined A general characteristic however is that the programming language and the database schema use the same type definitions br Multimedia applications are facilitated because the class methods associated with the data are responsible for its correct interpretation br Many object databases for example Gemstone or VOSS offer support for versioning An object can be viewed as the set of all its versions Also object versions can be treated as objects in their own right Some object databases also provide systematic support for triggers and constraints which are the basis of active databases br The efficiency of such a database is also greatly improved in areas which demand massive amounts of data about one item For example a banking institution could get the user s account information and provide them efficiently with extensive information such as transactions account information entries etc br br br Standards br The Object Data Management Group was a consortium of object database and object relational mapping vendors members of the academic community and interested parties Its goal was to create a set of specifications that would allow for portable applications that store objects in database management systems It published several versions of its specification The last release was ODMG By most of the major object database and object relational mapping vendors claimed conformance to the ODMG Java Language Binding Compliance to the other components of the specification was mixed In the ODMG Java Language Binding was submitted to the Java Community Process as a basis for the Java Data Objects specification The ODMG member companies then decided to concentrate their efforts on the Java Data Objects specification As a result the ODMG disbanded in br Many object database ideas were also absorbed into SQL and have been implemented in varying degrees in object relational database products br In Cook Rai and Rosenberger proposed to drop all standardization efforts to introduce additional object oriented query APIs but rather use the OO programming language itself i e Java and NET to express queries As a result Native Queries emerged Similarly Microsoft announced Language Integrated Query LINQ and DLINQ an implementation of LINQ in September to provide close language integrated database query capabilities with its programming languages C and VB NET br In February the Object Management Group OMG announced that they had been granted the right to develop new specifications based on the ODMG specification and the formation of the Object Database Technology Working Group ODBT WG The ODBT WG planned to create a set of standards that would incorporate advances in object database technology e g replication data management e g spatial indexing and data formats e g XML and to include new features into these standards that support domains where object databases are being adopted e g real time systems The work of the ODBT WG was suspended in March when subsequent to the economic turmoil in late the ODB vendors involved in this effort decided to focus their resources elsewhere br In January the World Wide Web Consortium gave final recommendation status to the XQuery language XQuery uses XML as its data model Some of the ideas developed originally for object databases found their way into XQuery but XQuery is not intrinsically object oriented Because of the popularity of XML XQuery engines compete with object databases as a vehicle for storage of data that is too complex or variable to hold conveniently in a relational database XQuery also allows modules to be written to provide encapsulation features that have been provided by Object Oriented systems br XQuery v and XPath v and later are powerful and are available in both open source and libre FOSS software as well as in commercial systems They are easy to learn and use and very powerful and fast They are not relational and XQuery is not based on SQL although one of the people who designed XQuery also co invented SQL But they are also not object oriented in the programming sense XQuery does not use encapsulation with hiding implicit dispatch and classes and methods XQuery databases generally use XML and JSON as an interchange format although other formats are used br Since the early s JSON has gained community adoption and popularity in applications where developers are in control of the data format JSONiq a query analog of XQuery for JSON sharing XQuery s core expressions and operations demonstrated the functional equivalence of the JSON and XML formats for data oriented information In this context the main strategy of OODBMS maintainers was to retrofit JSON to their databases by using it as the internal data type br In January with the PostgreSQL release was the first FOSS OODBMS to offer an efficient JSON internal datatype JSONB with a complete set of functions and operations for all basic relational and non relational manipulations br br br Comparison with RDBMSs br An object database stores complex data and relationships between data directly without mapping to relational rows and columns and this makes them suitable for applications dealing with very complex data Objects have a many to many relationship and are accessed by the use of pointers Pointers are linked to objects to establish relationships Another benefit of an OODBMS is that it can be programmed with small procedural differences without affecting the entire system br br br See also br Comparison of object database management systems br Component oriented database br EDA database
