In computing a locale is a set of parameters that defines the user s language region and any special variant preferences that the user wants to see in their user interface Usually a locale identifier consists of at least a language code and a country region code br Locale is an important aspect of i n br br br General locale settings br These settings usually include the following display output format settings br br Number format setting LC NUMERIC C C br Character classification case conversion settings LC CTYPE C C br Date time format setting LC TIME C C br String collation setting LC COLLATE C C br Currency format setting LC MONETARY C C br Paper size setting LC PAPER ISO br Color setting br UI font setting especially for CJKV language br Location setting country or region br The locale settings are about formatting output given a locale So the time zone information and daylight saving time are not usually part of the locale settings br Less usual is the input format setting which is mostly defined on a per application basis br br br Programming and markup language support br In these environments br br and other nowadays Unicode based environments they are defined in a format similar to BCP They are usually defined with just ISO language and ISO alpha letter country codes br br br International standards br In standard C and C locale is defined in categories of LC COLLATE text collation LC CTYPE character class LC MONETARY currency format LC NUMERIC number format and LC TIME time format The special LC ALL category can be used to set all locale settings br There is no standard locale names associated with C and C standards besides a minimal locale name C although the POSIX format is a commonly used baseline br br br POSIX platforms br On POSIX platforms such as Unix Linux and others locale identifiers are defined in a way similar to the BCP definition of language tags but the locale variant modifier is defined differently and the character set is optionally included as a part of the identifier The POSIX or XPG format is language territory codeset modifier For example Australian English using the UTF encoding is en AU UTF Separately ISO IEC describes a different form language territory audience application sponsor version though it s highly dubious whether it is used at all br In the next example there is an output of command locale for Czech language cs Czech Republic CZ with explicit UTF encoding br br locale br LANG cs CZ UTF br LC CTYPE cs CZ UTF br LC NUMERIC cs CZ UTF br LC TIME cs CZ UTF br LC COLLATE cs CZ UTF br LC MONETARY cs CZ UTF br LC MESSAGES cs CZ UTF br LC PAPER cs CZ UTF br LC NAME cs CZ UTF br LC ADDRESS cs CZ UTF br LC TELEPHONE cs CZ UTF br LC MEASUREMENT cs CZ UTF br LC IDENTIFICATION cs CZ UTF br LC ALL br br br Specifics for Microsoft platforms br br Windows uses specific language and territory strings br The locale identifier LCID for unmanaged code on Microsoft Windows is a number such as for English United States or for English United Kingdom or for Japanese Japan These numbers consist of a language code lower bits and a culture code upper bits and are therefore often written in hexadecimal notation such as x x or x br Microsoft is starting to introduce managed code application programming interfaces APIs for NET that use this format One of the first to be generally released is a function to mitigate issues with internationalized domain names but more are in Windows Vista Beta br Starting with Windows Vista new functions that use BCP locale names have been introduced to replace nearly all LCID based APIs br A POSIX like locale name format of language country region code page is available in the UCRT Universal C Run Time of Windows and br br br See also br Internationalization and localization br ISO language codes br ISO alpha region codes br ISO script codes br IETF language tag br C localization functions br CCSID br Code page br Common Locale Data Repository br Date and time representation by country br AppLocale br br br br br br External links br br BCP br Language Subtag Registry br Common Locale Data Repository br java util Locale Javadoc API documentation br Locale and Language information from Microsoft br MS LCID Windows Language Code Identifier LCID Reference from Microsoft br Microsoft LCID list br Microsoft LCID chart with decimal equivalents br POSIX Environment Variables br Low Level Technical details on defining a POSIX locale br ICU Locale Explorer br Debian Wiki on Locales br Article The Standard C Locale by Nathan C Myers br locale Description of multi language support Linux man page br Apache C Standard Library Locale User s Guide br Sort order charts for various operating system locales and database collations br NATSPEC Library br Description of locale related UNIX environment variables in Debian Linux Reference Manual br Guides to locales and locale creation on various platforms
