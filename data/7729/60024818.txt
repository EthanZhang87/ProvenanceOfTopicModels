id: 60024818
On February a Nazi rally took place at Madison Square Garden organized by the German American Bund More than people attended and Fritz Julius Kuhn was a featured speaker The Bund billed the event which took place two days before George Washington s Birthday as a pro Americanism rally the stage at the event featured a huge Washington portrait with swastikas on each side br br br Background br The German American Bund was a pro Hitler organization in the United States before World War II The group promoted Nazi propaganda in the United States combining Nazi imagery with American patriotic imagery br The largely decentralized Bund was active in several regions still it attracted support only from a minority of German Americans The Bund was the most influential of several pro Nazi German groups in the United States in the s others included the Teutonia Society and Friends of New Germany also known as the Hitler Club Alongside allied groups such as the Christian Front these organizations were virulently antisemitic br The pro Nazi organizations in the U S were actively countered by anti Nazi organizations led by American Jews and others who opposed Hitlerism and supported a boycott of German goods The Joint Boycott Committee held a rally at Madison Square Garden in br br br Preparations for the rally br br Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia was aware of the dangers which were posed by this rally and he dispatched the highest number of police to a single event in the city s history uniformed police officers patrolled outside the venue as well as undercover detectives and non uniformed officers scattered throughout the hall and even firefighters armed with a heavy duty fire hose in preparation of a riot Bomb squads also combed the arena in response to a threat received a week earlier boasting of a series of time activated devices to explode during the event New York was ready for the influx of Nazi rally attendees and was prepared to protect their guaranteed rights at all costs Chief Inspector Louis F Costuma illustrated this commitment to safety telling the press We had enough police here to stop a revolution in an interview in preparation for the rally br While Madison Square Garden had prepared itself for the presence of the German Bund many around New York City considered the Nazi sect less welcome in their city About anti Nazi protesters gathered around the arena in protest of the Bund carrying signs stating Smash Anti Semitism and Drive the Nazis Out of New York A total of three attempts were made to break the arm linking lines of police the first of these a group of World War One Veterans wrapped in Stars and Stripes were held off by police on mounted horseback the next a burly man carrying an American flag and finally a Trotskyist group known as the Socialist Workers Party who like those before had their efforts halted by police Chief Inspector Costuma s Police force acting security was exposed to an odd form of protest as well characterized by the New York Times as br At p m a loudspeaker in a second floor window of a rooming house at Forty ninth Street and Eight Avenue began blaring a denunciation of Nazis and urging Be American Stay at home The voice came from a record which was timed to start playing automatically br Joseph Goldstein a former New York magistrate exited a taxi cab in front of the rally holding a summons for the arrest of Fritz Julius Kuhn concerning a criminal libel suit filed earlier Goldstein like all other opposing efforts to gain admittance to the Garden was stopped by police this time by Inspector Costuma himself denying the former magistrate entry based on the failure to present a ticket Outside Madison Square Garden thirteen people were arrested during protests of the rally br br br Rally br br The rally occurred when the German American Bund s membership was dropping Kuhn hoped that a provocative high profile event would reverse the group s declining fortunes The pro Nazi Bund was unpopular in New York City and some called for the event to be banned Mayor Fiorello La Guardia allowed the event to go forward correctly predicting that the Bund s highly publicized spectacle would further discredit them in the public eye br The event was highly choreographed in the fascist style with uniformed Bund members carrying American and Nazi flags the display of the Nazi salute but this was problematic because at that time the very similar Bellamy salute was used to salute the American flag which was marched down the aisle at this event and the playing of martial music and German folk songs br The rally began at pm with a rendition of The Star Spangled Banner sung by Margarete Rittershaush Next James Wheeler Hill national secretary of the Bund opened the night with the statement that if George Washington were alive today he would be friends with Adolf Hitler Calling upon his fellow Americans Wheller Hill challenged Bund members to restore America to the True Americans while condemning President Franklin D Roosevelt s Secretary of the Interior Harold L Ickes for attacking Nazi officials Midwestern Gau leader George Froboese was next to speak pushing themes of Jewish world domination blaming the oriental cunning of the Jew Karl Marx Mordecais for the class warfare felt across the country West Coast leader Hermann Schwinn chose to denounce the Jewish control of Hollywood and news industries claiming Everything inimical to those Nations which have freed themselves of alien domination is News to be played up and twisted to fan the flames of hate in the hearts of Americans whereas the Menace of Anti National God Hating Jewish Bolshevism is deliberately minimized br Last to speak the Bundesfuhrer himself Fritz Kuhn continued to push the anti Semitic theme going as far as calling President Roosevelt Rosenfeld and calling Fiorello La Guardia the man whom he promised to make no anti Semitic remarks about Fiorello Jew Lumpen LaGuardia Everything came to an immediate halt in the middle of Kuhn s final speech because a man who was dressed in blue broke through the lines of OD men ran onto the stage and charged at the speaker Quickly swarmed by the Ordnungsdienst the Bund s paramilitary he was subdued in an effective routine of punches and stomps which exemplified an uncanny replication of Nazi thuggery as a pack of uniformed men blast ed away with fists and boots on a lone Jewish victim Later identified as year old plumbing assistant Isadore Greenbaum the lone victim was pulled away by a team of police saving the young man from serious injury Attempting to control the riled up crowd Kuhn delivered his rousing finish advocating the establishment of an America which would be ruled by White Gentiles free from a Jewish Hollywood and news The Bund is open to you provided you are sincere of good character of White Gentile Stock and an American Citizen imbued with patriotic zeal Therefore Join As Kuhn exited the stage thousand Bund members chanted Free America Free America Free America in the biggest Nazi rally in United States history br At members of the Bund buttoned up their overcoats conveniently hiding their uniforms and they were escorted through police lines along Fifty Second amid the crowds of protesters who were waiting outside Ralliers were greeted with a roar of catcalls jeers and even with a few punches but by midnight all was quiet or it was as quiet as it could be in downtown New York br Isadore Greenbaum never intended to run onto the stage Greenbaum a former deck engineer and a former chief petty officer snuck into the rally but his anger quickly took hold of him as he listened to Kuhn s speech Speaking years later in Greenbaum characterized his actions by stating I went down to the Garden without any intention of interrupting but being that they talked so much against my religion and there was so much persecution I lost my head and I felt it was my duty to talk When he was asked about the cause of his actions Greenbaum quickly stated Gee what would you have done if you were in my place listening to that s o b hollering against the government and publicly kissing Adolf Hitler s behind while thousands cheered Well I did it For his actions which triggered a disturbance during the biggest Nazi rally in the United States Greenbaum was sentenced to serve days in jail but he was released after he paid a fine br br br Aftermath br Shortly after the rally the Bund rapidly declined Two months after the rally the film Confessions of a Nazi Spy was

States in November However Mexican authorities forced Kunze to return to the United States where he was sentenced to serve years in prison for espionage The Bund s final national leader was George Froboese who was in charge of the organization when Germany declared war on the United States Froboese committed suicide in after he received a federal grand jury subpoena br br br In popular culture
