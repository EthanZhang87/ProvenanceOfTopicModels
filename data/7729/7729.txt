than five thousand media formats Captain America is one of the most popular and recognized Marvel Comics characters and has been described as an icon of American popular culture Though Captain America

Cinematic Universe where he was portrayed by actor Chris Evans from the character s first appearance in Captain America The First Avenger to his final appearance in Avengers Endgame br br br Publication history br br br Creation and development br br In Timely Comics publisher Martin Goodman responded to the growing popularity of superhero comics particularly Superman at rival publisher National Comics Publications the corporate predecessor to DC Comics by hiring freelancer Joe Simon to create a new superhero for the company Simon began to develop the character by determining who their nemesis could be noting that the most successful superheroes were defined by their relationship with a compelling villain and eventually settled on Adolf Hitler He rationalized that Hitler was the best villain of them all as he was hated by everyone in the free world and that it would be a unique approach for a superhero to face a real life adversary rather than a fictional one br This approach was also intentionally political Simon was stridently opposed to the actions of Nazi Germany and supported U S intervention in World War II and intended the hero to be a response to the American non interventionism movement Simon initially considered Super American for the hero s name but felt there were already multiple comic book characters with super in their names He worked out the details of the character who was eventually named Captain America after he completed sketches in consultation with Goodman The hero s civilian name Steve Rogers was derived from the telegraphy term roger meaning message received br Goodman elected to launch Captain America with his own self titled comic book making him the first Timely character to debut with his own ongoing series without having first appeared in an anthology Simon sought to have Jack Kirby be the primary artist on the series the two developed a working relationship and friendship in the late s after working together at Fox Feature Syndicate and had previously developed characters for Timely together Kirby also shared Simon s pro intervention views and was particularly drawn to the character in this regard Goodman conversely wanted a team of artists on the series It was ultimately determined that Kirby would serve as penciller with Al Avison and Al Gabriele assisting as inkers Simon additionally negotiated for himself and Kirby to receive percent of the profits from the comic Simon regards Kirby as a co creator of Captain America stating that if Kirby hadn t drawn it it might not have been much of anything br br br Debut and early success early s br br Captain America Comics was published on December with a cover date of March While the front cover of the issue featured Captain America punching Hitler the comic itself established the Red Skull as Captain America s primary adversary and also introduced Bucky Barnes as Captain America s teenaged sidekick Simon stated that he personally regarded Captain America s origin story in which the frail Steve Rogers becomes a supersoldier after receiving an experimental serum as the weakest part of the character and that he and Kirby didn t put too much thought into the origin We just wanted to get to the action Kirby designed the series action scenes with an emphasis on a sense of continuity across panels saying that he choreographed the sequences as one would a ballet with a focus on exaggerated character movement Kirby s layouts in Captain America Comics are characterized by their distorted perspectives irregularly shaped panels and the heavy use of speed lines br The first issue of Captain America Comics sold out in a matter of days and the second issue s print run was set at over one million copies Captain America quickly became Timely s most popular character with the publisher creating an official Captain America fan club called the Sentinels of Liberty Circulation figures remained close to a million copies per month after the debut issue which outstripped even the circulation of news magazines such as Time during the same period Captain America Comics was additionally one of periodicals that the US Department of War deemed appropriate to distribute to its soldiers without prior screening The character would also make appearances in several of Timely s other comic titles including All Winners Comics Marvel Mystery Comics U S A Comics and All Select Comics br Though Captain America was not the first United States themed superhero a distinction that belongs to The Shield at MLJ Comics he would become the most popular patriotic American superhero of those created during World War II Captain America s popularity drew a complaint from MLJ that the character s triangular heater shield too closely resembled the chest symbol of The Shield This prompted Goodman to direct Simon and Kirby to change the design beginning with Captain America Comics The revised round shield went on to become an iconic element of the character its use as a discus like throwing weapon originated in a short prose story in Captain America Comics written by Stan Lee in his professional debut as a writer Timely s publication of Captain America Comics led the company to be targeted with threatening letters and phone calls from the German American Bund an American Nazi organization When members began loitering on the streets outside the company s office police protection was posted and New York mayor Fiorello La Guardia personally contacted Simon and Kirby to guarantee the safety of the publisher s employees br Simon wrote the first two issues of Captain America Comics before becoming the editor for the series they were the only Captain America stories he would ever directly write While Captain America generated acclaim and industry fame for Simon and Kirby the pair believed that Goodman was withholding the promised percentage of profits for the series prompting Simon to seek employment for himself and Kirby at National Comics Publications When Goodman learned of Simon and Kirby s intentions he effectively fired them from Timely Comics telling them they were to leave the company after they completed work on Captain America Comics The authorship of Captain America Comics was subsequently assumed by a variety of individuals including Otto Binder Bill Finger and Manly Wade Wellman as writers and Al Avison Vince Alascia and Syd Shores as pencilers br br br Decline in popularity mid s and s br Superhero comics began to decline in popularity in the post war period This prompted a variety of attempts to reposition Captain America including having the character fight gangsters rather than wartime enemies in Captain America Comics October appearing as a high school teacher in Captain America Comics August and joining Timely s first superhero team the All Winners Squad in All Winners Comics Fall The series nevertheless continued to face dwindling sales and Captain America Comics ended with its th issue in February Horror comics were ascendant as a popular comic genre during this period in keeping with the trend the final two issues of Captain America Comics were published under the title Captain America s Weird Tales br Timely s corporate successor Atlas Comics relaunched the character in in Young Men where Captain America appears alongside the wartime heroes Human Torch and Toro which was followed by a revival of Captain America Comics in written by Stan Lee and drawn by John Romita In the spirit of the Cold War and McCarthyism the character was billed as Captain America Commie Smasher and faced enemies associated with the Soviet Union The series was a commercial failure and was cancelled after just three issues Romita attributed the series failure to the changing political climate particularly the public opposition to the Korean War the character subsequently fell out of active publication for nearly a decade with Romita noting that for a while Captain America was a dirty word br br br Return to comics s br br Captain America made his ostensible return in the anthology Strange Tales November published by Atlas corporate successor Marvel Comics In an page story written by Lee and illustrated by Kirby Captain America reemerges following years of apparent retirement though he is revealed as an impostor who is defeated by Johnny Storm of the Fantastic Four A caption in the final panel indicates that the story was a test to gauge interest in a potential return for Captain America the reader response to the story was enthusiastic and the character was formally reintroduced in The Avengers March br The Avengers retroactively established that Captain America had fallen into the Atlantic Ocean in the final days of World War II where

series was relaunched in April with Lee as writer and Kirby as penciller Kirby later departed the series and was replaced by Gene Colan In writer and artist Jim Steranko authored a three issue run of Captain America Despite the brevity of Steranko s time on the series his contributions significantly influenced how Captain America was represented in post war comics reestablishing the character s secret identity and introducing a more experimental art style to the series br br br Political shifts s br br In contrast to the character s enthusiastic participation in World War II comics featuring Captain America rarely broached the topic of the Vietnam War though the subject of Captain America s potential participation was frequently debated by readers in the letters to the editor section in Captain America Marvel maintained a position of neutrality on Vietnam in Stan Lee wrote in an editorial that a poll indicated that a majority of readers did not want Captain America to be involved in Vietnam adding that he believed the character simply doesn t lend himself to the John Wayne type character he once was and that he could not see any of our characters taking on a role of super patriotism in the world as it is today br Captain America stories in the s began to increasingly focus on domestic American political issues such as poverty racism pollution and political corruption Captain America September introduced The Falcon as the first African American superhero in mainstream comic books and who would become Captain America s partner the series was cover titled as Captain America and the Falcon beginning February which it would maintain for the next seven and a half years These political shifts were significantly shaped by comics created by writer Steve Englehart and artist Sal Buscema who joined the series in In a storyline written by Englehart directly inspired by the Watergate scandal Captain America is framed for murder by the fascistic Secret Empire whose leader is ultimately revealed to be the president of the United States The incident causes a disillusioned Steve Rogers to briefly drop the moniker of Captain America to become Nomad the man without a country though he later vowed to reclaim the ideals of America which its leaders have trampled upon and again assumed the role of Captain America Englehart and Buscema s run was highly acclaimed bringing Captain America from one of Marvel s lowest selling titles to its top selling comic and the conflict between America as it idealizes itself to be and America in reality would recur frequently as a theme in Captain America comics in the subsequent decades br In Roy Thomas created the comic book series The Invaders Set during World War II the comic focuses on a superhero team composed of

Various artists illustrated the series over the course of Gruenwald s decade long run including Paul Neary from to and Kieron Dwyer from to In contrast to DeMatteis Gruenwald placed less emphasis on Steve Rogers life as a civilian wishing to show that Steve Rogers is Captain America first he has no greater needs than being Captain America Among the most significant storylines appearing in Gruenwald s run was The Choice in in which Steve Rogers renounces the identity of Captain America to briefly become simply The Captain after the United States government orders him to continue his superheroic activities directly under their control br After Gruenwald departed the series writer Mark Waid and artist Ron Garney began to author Captain America in Despite early acclaim including the reintroduction of Captain America s love interest Sharon Carter their run was terminated after ten issues as a result of Marvel s Heroes Reborn rebranding in The rebrand saw artists Jim Lee and Rob

Simon royalties for merchandising and licensing of the character br br br Modern era s to present br Writer and artist Dan Jurgens took over Captain America from Waid in positioning the character in a

John Ney Rieber with artwork by John Cassady was published under the Marvel Knights imprint from to The series received criticism for its depiction of Captain America fighting terrorists modelled after Al Qaeda though Cassady contended that the aim of the series was to depict the emotions this hero was going through in the wake of and the guilt and anger a man in his position would feel br In

to fight in the Second World War but is rejected after being deemed unfit for military service His resolve is nevertheless noticed by the military and he is recruited as the first test subject for Project Rebirth a secret government program that seeks to create super soldiers through the development of the Super Soldier Serum Though the serum successfully enhances Rogers to the peak to human physical perfection a Nazi spy posing as a military observer destroys the remaining supply of the serum and assassinates its inventor foiling plans to produce additional super soldiers Rogers is given a patriotic uniform and shield by the American government and becomes the costumed superhero Captain America He goes on to fight the villainous Red Skull and other members of the Axis powers both

able to return to the present He resumes his exploits as a superhero though his public identity is briefly supplanted by a sleeper agent from the terrorist organization Hydra br br br Personality and motivations br br Steve Rogers personality has shifted across his editorial history a fact that media scholar J Richard Stevens sees as a natural consequence of the character being written and re interpreted by many writers over the span of multiple decades However Stevens identifies two aspects of the character s personality that have remained consistent across expressions his uncompromising purity and his ability to judge the character in others Early Captain America stories typically paid little attention to Rogers civilian identity in his book The Steranko History of Comics Jim Steranko notes that the character was often criticized for being two dimensional as a result He argues that this was an intentional device writing that these critics failed to grasp the true implication of his being Steve Rogers never existed except perhaps as an abstract device for the convenience of storytelling Captain America was not an embodiment of human characteristics but a pure idea br Following the character s return to comics in the s many stories gave increased focus to Rogers civilian identity particularly his struggles as a man out of time attempting to adjust to the modern era Often stories depict a brooding or melancholic Rogers as he faces both a physical struggle as Captain America and an ideological struggle as Steve Rogers to reconcile his social values with modern times The character is frequently conflicted by his World War II era good war morality being challenged and made anachronistic by the compromising demands of the post war era br Prior to Bucky Barnes return to comics in the s many Captain America stories centered on Rogers sense of guilt over Barnes death Culture scholar Robert G Weiner argues that these stories mirror the post traumatic stress disorder and survivor guilt held by many war veterans and that this trauma distinguishes the character from other well known superheroes such as Batman and Spider Man while those characters became heroes because of a traumatic incident Rogers carries on as a hero in spite of a traumatic incident with Weiner asserting that this reinforces the nobility of the character br br br Political themes br Though Marvel has historically trended away from making overt partisan statements in the post war period writers have nevertheless used Captain America to comment on the state of American society and government at particular moments in history For example the conspiracy storyline of Secret Empire reflected what writer Steve Englehart saw as broad disillusionment with American institutions in the wake of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal the Streets of Poison storyline by Mark Gruenwald in the s was intended to address anxieties around the drug trade and debates on the war on drugs and Civil War by Mark Millar was widely interpreted as an allegory for the Patriot Act and post debates on the balance between national security and civil liberties While the ideological orientation of Captain America stories has shifted in response to changing social and political attitudes Stevens notes how a central component of Captain America s mythology is that the character himself does not change when the character s attitudes have shifted it is consistently framed as an evolution or a new understanding of his previously held ideals Stevens argues that the character s seeming paradoxical steadfastness is reflective of the language of comics where continuity is continually updated to fit the needs of the serialized present br Despite his status as patriotic superhero Captain America is rarely depicted as an overtly jingoistic figure Stevens writes that the character s patriotism is more focused on the universal rights of man as expressed through the American Dream rather than a position championing the specific cultural or political goals of the United States Weiner similarly concurs that the character embodies what America strives to be not what it sometimes is Dittmer agrees that while the character sees himself as the living embodiment of the American Dream rather than a tool of the state his status as a patriotic superhero nevertheless tethers him to American foreign policy and hegemony He argues that Captain America tends to skew away from interventionist actions at moments where the United States is undertaking policies that its critics deem imperialist specifically citing the character s non participation in the Vietnam and Iraq wars and argues that the character s inconsistent position on the use of deadly force across his editorial history is perhaps a tacit acknowledgment of the violence or the threat of violence at the heart of American hegemony br br br Powers abilities and equipment br br Captain America possesses no superpowers though the Super Soldier Serum has enhanced his body s strength speed agility endurance reflexes reaction time and natural self healing ability to the peak of human physical perfection He is additionally an expert tactician and field commander and has achieved mastery in a variety of hand to hand combat styles including boxing and judo The precise parameters of Captain America s physical prowess vary across stories due to editorial dictates and artistic license taken by authors Steve Englehart was given an editorial order to give the character superhuman strength in the s but the change did not remain permanent and was soon forgotten Steve Rogers is also a skilled visual artist having worked as a commercial illustrator prior to joining the military and several storylines have depicted the character working as a freelance artist br The basic design of Captain America s costume has remained largely consistent from its original incarnation in the s Designed by Joe Simon the costume is based on the United States flag with Simon likening the character s appearance to that of a modern day crusader chain mail armor and a helmet adorned with wings in reference to the Roman god Mercury Steve Rogers has worn other costumes when he has adopted alternate superhero alter egos as Nomad he wears a domino mask and a black and gold suit that is cut to expose his bare chest and stomach and as The Captain he wears a modified version of the Captain America suit with a red white and black design br br Captain America s shield is the character s primary piece of equipment It is a round shield with a design featuring a white star on a blue circle surrounded by red and white rings First appearing in Captain America Comics as a triangular heater shield beginning in Captain America Comics it was changed to its current circular design due to a complaint from MLJ Comics that the original design too closely resembled the chest symbol of their superhero The Shield The shield is depicted as constructed from an alloy of vibranium and adamantium two highly resilient fictional metals appearing in Marvel comic books It is portrayed as both a virtually indestructible defensive object and a highly aerodynamic offensive weapon when thrown it is capable of ricocheting off multiple surfaces and returning to the original thrower br br br Supporting cast br br br Sidekicks and partners br Captain America s first sidekick was Bucky Barnes introduced in Captain America Comics as the teenaged mascot of Steve Rogers regiment He is made Captain America s partner in that same issue after accidentally discovering the character s secret identity Joe Simon described Bucky s creation as being largely motivated by a need to give Captain America someone to talk to and avoid the overuse of dialogue delivered through internal monologue noting that Bucky was brought in as a way of eliminating too many thought balloons Bucky was retroactively established as having been killed in the same accident that left Captain America frozen in suspended animation the character remained deceased for many decades contrasting the typically ephemeral nature of comic book deaths until he returned in as the Winter Soldier Initially introduced as a brainwashed assassin and antagonist to Captain America Bucky s memories and personality were later restored and he was re established as an ally to Steve Rogers Rick Jones briefly assumed the role of Captain America s sidekick and the public identity of Bucky following Captain America s return to comics in the s br In Sam Wilson was introduced as the superhero Falcon and later became Captain America s sidekick making the characters the first interracial superhero duo in American comic books Possessing the power to communicate with birds Wilson is initially depicted as a former social worker living in Harlem though this identity is revealed to be the result of memories implanted by the Red Skull He later receives a winged suit from the superhero Black Panther that enables him to fly Other characters who have served as Rogers sidekick include Golden Girl Betsy Ross Demolition Man Dennis Dunphy Jack Flag Jack Harrison and Free Spirit Cathy Webster br br br Enemies br br Over the course of several decades writers and artists have established a rogues gallery of supervillains to face Captain America The character s primary archenemy is the Red Skull introduced from the character s origins as an apprentice to Adolf Hitler Just as Red Skull represents Nazism many of Captain America s villains represent specific ideologies or political formations for example the Serpent Society represents labor unionism and Flag Smasher represents anti nationalism The political character of Captain America s enemies has shifted over time the character fought enemies associated with communism during his brief revival in the s before shifting back to Nazi antagonists in the mid s while comics since have frequently depicted the character facing terrorist villains br br br Romantic interests br Steve Rogers first love interest was Betsy Ross introduced in his World War II era comics as a member of the Women s Army Corps who later became the costumed superhero Golden Girl Peggy Carter an American member of the French Resistance was retroactively established in comics published in the s as another of Rogers wartime lovers When Rogers is revived in the post war era he begins a partnership and on again off again relationship with S H I E L D agent Sharon Carter introduced as Peggy s younger sister she was later retconned as Peggy s grandniece to reflect Marvel s floating timeline In comics published in the s Rogers dated and became engaged to civilian Bernie Rosenthal though they ended their relationship amicably after Bernie left New York to attend law school In the s Rogers had a romantic entanglement with the alternately villainous and antiheroic Diamondback a member of the Serpent Society br br br Alternate versions of Captain America br br The title of Captain America has been used by other characters in the Marvel Universe in addition to Steve Rogers including William Naslund Jeffrey Mace and William Burnside John Walker also known as U S Agent was introduced as a villainous Captain America in and Isaiah Bradley was established in the limited series Truth Red White Black as an African American man who acquired superpowers after being used as a test subject for the Super Soldier Serum Rogers sidekicks Bucky Barnes and Sam Wilson have also alternately held the title of Captain America Barnes in following Rogers death in and Wilson following Marvel s rebranding campaign Marvel Now Within the multiverse of parallel universes that compose the Marvel Universe there are many variations of Steve Rogers and Captain America this includes Marvel s Ultimate Comics universe which possesses its own version of Steve Rogers that is more overtly politically conservative br br br Cultural influence and legacy br br Captain America is one of the most popular and widely recognized Marvel Comics characters and has been described as an icon of American
