id: 286348
Annie Get Your Gun is a musical with lyrics and music by Irving Berlin and a book by Dorothy Fields and her brother Herbert Fields The story is a fictionalized version of the life of Annie Oakley a sharpshooter who starred in Buffalo Bill s Wild West and her romance with sharpshooter Frank E Butler br The Broadway production was a hit and the musical had long runs in both New York performances and London spawning revivals a film version and television versions Songs that became hits include There s No Business Like Show Business Doin What Comes Natur lly You Can t Get a Man with a Gun They Say It s Wonderful and Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better br br br History and background br Dorothy Fields had the idea for a musical about Annie Oakley to star her friend Ethel Merman Producer Mike Todd turned the project down so Fields approached a new producing team Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II After the success of their first musical collaboration Oklahoma Rodgers and Hammerstein had decided to become producers of both their own theatrical ventures and those by other authors They agreed to produce the musical and asked Jerome Kern to compose the music Fields would write the lyrics and she and her brother Herbert would write the book Kern who had been composing for movie musicals in Hollywood returned to New York on November to begin work on the score to Annie Get Your Gun but three days later he collapsed on the street due to a cerebral hemorrhage Kern was hospitalized and he died on November The producers and Fields then asked Irving Berlin to write the musical s score Fields agreed to step down as lyricist knowing that Berlin preferred to write both music and lyrics to his songs Berlin initially declined to write the score worrying that he would be unable to write songs to fit specific scenes in a situation show Hammerstein persuaded him to study the script and try writing some songs based on it and within days Berlin returned with the songs Doin What Comes Naturally You Can t Get a Man With a Gun and There s No Business Like Show Business Berlin s songs suited the story and Ethel Merman s abilities and he readily composed the rest of the score to Annie Get Your Gun The show s eventual hit song There s No Business Like Show Business was almost left out of the show because Berlin mistakenly got the impression that Richard Rodgers did not like it In imitation of the structure of Oklahoma a secondary romance between two of the members of the Wild West Show was added to the musical during its development br According to some sources the role of Annie was originally offered to Mary Martin who turned it down This is not true Dorothy Fields went to the hospital after Merman gave birth to her son to ask her if she would do the show The show was conceived for Merman but when time came to send out the post Broadway national tour and Merman was unwilling to do it Martin jumped at the chance going on the road for approximately two years and belting out the songs which had the effect of lowering her voice from its normal lyric coloratura range to mezzo soprano alto br For the revival Peter Stone revised the libretto eliminating what were considered insensitive references to American Indians including the songs Colonel Buffalo Bill and I m An Indian Too Stone said The big challenge is taking a book that was wonderfully crafted for its time and make it wonderfully crafted for our time It was terribly insensitive to Indians But it had to be dealt with in a way that was heartfelt and not obvious In this case it was with the permission of the heirs They re terribly pleased with it Stone also altered the structure of the musical beginning it with There s No Business Like Show Business and presenting the musical as a show within a show br br br Plot summary br br br Act I br When the traveling Buffalo Bill s Wild West show visits Cincinnati Ohio Colonel Buffalo Bill Frank Butler the show s handsome womanizing star I m a Bad Bad Man challenges anyone in town to a shooting match Foster Wilson a local hotel owner doesn t appreciate the Wild West show taking over his hotel so Frank gives him a side bet of one hundred dollars on

Christopher Lee had the role of Sitting Bull br br br Reception br The original Broadway production opened to favorable reviews Critics unanimously praised Ethel Merman s performance as Annie Oakley though some thought the score and book were not particularly distinguished John Chapman of the Daily News declared that the production had good lyrics and tunes by Irving Berlin and the razzle dazzle atmosphere of a big time show but pronounced Merman the best part of the show stating She is a better comedienne than she ever was before stating that Annie is a good standard lavish big musical and I m sure it will be a huge success but it isn t the greatest show in the world Louis Kronenberger of PM stated that the show was in many ways routine but greatly praised Merman s performance opining For me Annie is mainly Miss Merman s show though the rest of it is competent enough of its kind Irving Berlin s score is musically not exciting of the real songs only one or two are tuneful br Ward Morehouse of The New York Sun declared The big news about Annie Get Your Gun is that it reveals Ethel Merman in her best form since Anything Goes She shouts the Berlin music with good effect She often comes to the aid of a sagging book He stated Irving Berlin s score is not a notable one but his tunes are singable and pleasant and his lyrics are particularly good The book It s on the flimsy side definitely And rather witless too Lewis Nichols of The New York Times said It has a pleasant score by Irving Berlin and it has Ethel Merman to roll her eyes and to shout down the rafters The colors are pretty the dancing is amiable and unaffected and Broadway by this time is well used to a book which doesn t get anywhere in particular br However the show itself was greatly lauded by some critics Vernon Rice of the New York Post proclaimed Irving Berlin has outdone himself this time No use trying to pick a hit tune for all the tunes are hits Ethel Merman is at her lusty free and easy best She is now able to develop a consistent characterization and stay with it to the show s end And when she opens her mouth to sing she sings William Hawkins of the New York World Telegram said that Merman was bright as a whip sure as her shooting and generously the foremost lady clown of her time and asserted that the show itself was comparable to those of Rodgers and Hammerstein proclaiming For verve and buoyancy unslackening there has seldom if ever been a show like it the girls in Annie have the beauty and character of looks one associates with a Rodgers and Hammerstein show And the production has in every way the distinction that has become their hallmark br Historians have viewed the show as inaccurate citing among other reasons its portrayal of Annie as a loud boisterous character when in reality she had a quiet personality and did needlepoint in her spare time br br br Redface br Native Americans have criticized the show s portrayal of Redface and promotion of cultural stereotypes The song I m an Indian Too is seen as particularly offensive Annie sings that song after the character Sitting Bull adopts her into the Sioux tribe br Native Americans did protest outside the New York theatre as well as movie theaters holding picket signs stating Don t See Annie Get Your Gun As a result of this reaction many contemporary productions have omitted the song from their revivals and the protests stopped br However the Native American comedy group The s used the song in one of their satirical videos posted on YouTube Directed and edited by Sterlin Harjo and starring Ryan Red Corn as Hipster in a Headdress Mascot the video plays with both the reality and the stereotypes of people who identify as Indian The video is set in Santa Fe New Mexico during the annual Indian Market held there the market itself features original art by highly praised Native artists but some vendors also sell extremely stereotyped kitsch with supposedly Native themes or patterns Part of the satire as well is that Ryan Red Corn does not look stereotypically Indian he is filmed dancing to the tune of I m an Indian Too in different places in the market wearing shorts and a traditional Plains Indian headdress with the word Hipster written in marker on his chest People have quite different reactions to him and his dancing with some who clearly get the joke that he is playing a stereotype while others clearly do not br br br Awards and nominations br Mary Martin received a Special Tony Award in for Spreading Theatre to the Country While the Originals Perform in New York US Tour br br br
