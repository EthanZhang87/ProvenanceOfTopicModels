The Heysel Stadium disaster Italian Strage dell Heysel stra d e dellei z l German Katastrophe von Heysel kata st o f f n ha zl French Drame du Heysel d am dy z l Dutch Heizeldrama iz l dra ma is a crowd disaster that occurred on May when Juventus fans were escaping from an attack by Liverpool fans while they were pressed against a wall in the Heysel Stadium in Brussels Belgium before the start of the European Cup final The stadium was poorly maintained and in desperate need of repair and had failed inspections prior to the disaster and the wall collapsed under the force Thirty nine people mostly Italians and Juventus fans were killed and were injured in the confrontation br Approximately an hour before the Juventus Liverpool final was due to kick off incidents of aggression between the two sets of supporters were taking place across the flimsy divide between the Liverpool section and what was intended to have been the neutral section populated by those who had purchased tickets in Belgium The throwing of objects back and forth led to larger scale physical aggression the chicken wire fence was ripped down and after initial fighting the fans in the neutral section began to run away from the Liverpool fans who had become involved and in the direction of the wall They charged at Juventus supporters and breached a fence that was separating them from a neutral area Fans already standing near the wall were crushed eventually the wall collapsed allowing others to escape but also leading to the majority of deaths Many people climbed over to safety but many others died or were badly injured The game was played despite the pre match incidents by authorities and organizers joint decision for public policy doctrine reasons after a state of siege was declared in the city with Juventus winning br The tragedy resulted in all English football clubs being placed under an indefinite ban by Union of European Football Associations UEFA from all European competitions lifted in with Liverpool being excluded for an additional two years later reduced to one and Liverpool fans were found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to six years imprisonment The disaster was later described as the darkest hour in the history of the UEFA competitions br br In May Liverpool were the defending European Champions Cup winners having won the competition after defeating Roma on penalties in the previous season s final Again they would face Italian opposition Juventus which had won unbeaten the Cup Winners Cup Juventus had a team of many of Italy s World Cup winning team which played for Juventus for many years and its playmaker Michel Platini was considered the best footballer in Europe and was named Footballer of The Year by the magazine France Football for the second year in a row in December Both teams were placed in the two first positions in the UEFA club ranking at the end of the previous season and were regarded by the specialist press as the two best teams on the continent Both teams had contested the European Super Cup four months earlier with a victory for the Italian team br Despite its status as Belgium s national stadium Heysel Stadium was in a poor state of repair by the European Cup final The year old stadium had not been sufficiently maintained for several years and large parts of the facility were literally crumbling For example the outer wall had been made of cinder block and Liverpool fans who did not have tickets were seen kicking holes in the wall to get in In some areas of the stadium there was only one turnstile and some fans attending the game claimed that they were never searched or asked for their tickets br Liverpool players and fans later said that they were shocked at Heysel s abject condition despite reports from Arsenal fans that the ground was a dump when Arsenal had played there a few years earlier They were also surprised that Heysel was chosen despite its poor condition especially since Barcelona s Camp Nou and Madrid s Santiago Bernab u were both available Juventus President Giampiero Boniperti and Liverpool CEO Peter Robinson urged the Union of European Football Associations UEFA to choose another venue and claimed that Heysel was not in any condition to host a European Cup final especially one involving two of the largest and most powerful clubs in Europe However UEFA refused to consider a move It was later discovered that UEFA s inspection of the stadium had lasted just thirty minutes br The stadium was crammed with to supporters with more than for each team The two ends behind the goals comprised all standing terraces each end split into three zones The Juventus end was O N and M and the Liverpool end was X Y and Z as deemed by the Belgian court after the disaster However the tickets for the Z section were reserved for neutral Belgian fans in addition to the rest of the stadium The idea of the large neutral area was opposed by both Liverpool and Juventus as it would provide an opportunity for fans of both clubs to obtain tickets from agencies or from ticket touts outside the ground and thereby create a dangerous mix of fans br At the time Belgium already had a large Italian community and many expatriate Juventus fans from Brussels Li ge and Charleroi bought Section Z tickets Also many tickets were bought up and sold by travel agents mainly to Juventus fans That meant the Juventus fans had more sections than the Liverpool fans with the Z section which was nominally reserved for neutrals Reportedly Liverpool fans were still smarting from being attacked by Roma ultras at the European Cup final and placed next to what amounted to another Juventus section heightened tensions before the match A small percentage of the tickets ended up in the hands of Liverpool fans br br At approximately p m local time an hour before kickoff the initial disturbance started The Liverpool and Juventus supporters in Sections X and Z stood merely yards apart The boundary between the two was marked by temporary chain link fencing and a central thinly policed no man s land Hooligans began to throw flares bottles and stones across the divide and picked up stones from the crumbling terraces beneath them br As kickoff approached the throwing became more intense Eventually angry Liverpool fans charged towards the Juventus fans the boundary between Section X and Z broke down and the few police persons stationed at the divide were overpowered As the Juventus fans started fleeing they ran towards the concrete wall at the perimeter of Section Z Fans standing near the wall were crushed and as the pressure mounted the entire lower portion of the wall collapsed burying fans underneath it as it fell Some fans managed to climb over to safety but many others died or were badly injured br In retaliation for the events in Section Z many Juventus fans advanced down the stadium running track to help other Juventus supporters but police intervention stopped the advance A large group of Juventus fans fought the police with rocks bottles and stones for two hours One Juventus fan was also seen firing a starting gun at Belgian police br br It was decided that the match should eventually start for public policy doctrine reasons because abandoning the match would have risked inciting further disturbances This decision was jointly made by UEFA officials the Italian English and Belgian national associations the country s Ministry of Interior led by local Premier Wilfried Martens Brussels Mayor Herv Brouhon and the city s police force despite the scale of the disaster the state of siege in the City of Brussels consequently declared by the Belgian government and Juventus explicit request that the match not be played After the captains of both sides spoke to the crowd and appealed for calm the players took the field knowing that people had died Years later Liverpool captain Phil Neal said that in hindsight it would have been a better decision to call off the game br Juventus won the match thanks to a penalty scored by Platini which was awarded by the Swiss referee Daina for a foul against Zbigniew Boniek br At the end of the game the trophy was given in front of the stadium s Honor Stand by UEFA President Jacques Georges to Juventus Captain Gaetano Scirea The chants of fans of both teams in the stands and the massive invasion of the pitch by journalists and fans at the end of the match generated the collective hysteria Some of the Italian club players celebrated the title in the middle of the pitch in front of their fans in the M section and some of the Liverpool players applauded their fans between the X and Z sections br Liverpool players only realised the extent of the tragedy when they boarded their bus at a Brussels hotel to go to the airport when a crowd of Juventus supporters surrounded the bus Police had to escort the bus out of the lot The police allowed Liverpool s bus to drive directly onto the tarmac at Brussels Airport in hopes of avoiding a confrontation at the terminal br br Of the people killed were Italian including two minors four Belgian two French and one from Northern Ireland br br The blame for the incident was laid on the fans of Liverpool On May official UEFA observer Gunter Schneider said Only the English fans were responsible Of that there is no doubt UEFA the organiser of the event the owners of Heysel Stadium and the Belgian police were investigated for culpability After an eighteen month investigation the dossier of leading Belgian judge Marina Coppieters was finally published It concluded that blame should rest solely with the Liverpool fans br br After Heysel English clubs began to impose stricter rules intended to make it easier to prevent troublemakers from attending domestic games with legal provision to exclude troublemakers for three months introduced in and the Football Disorder Act introduced in br Serious progress on legal banning orders preventing foreign travel to matches was arguably not made until the violence involving England fans allegedly mainly involving neo Nazi groups such as Combat at a match against Ireland on February and violent scenes at the FIFA World Cup Rioting at UEFA Euro saw the introduction of new legislation and wider use of police powers by banning orders were in place compared to fewer than before Euro br The main reforms to English stadiums came after the Taylor Report into the Hillsborough disaster in April which ultimately resulted in the death of Liverpool fans All seater stadiums became a requirement for clubs in the top two divisions while pitch side fencing was removed and closed circuit cameras became widespread Fans who misbehave can have their tickets revoked and be legally barred from attending games at any English stadium br The Heysel Stadium itself continued to be used for some matches of the Belgium national team until when UEFA banned Belgium from hosting a European final for a minimum of years In the stadium was almost completely rebuilt as the King Baudouin Stadium On August the new stadium welcomed the return of football to Heysel in the form of a friendly match between Belgium and Germany It then hosted a major European final again on May when Paris Saint Germain defeated Rapid Vienna to win the Cup Winners Cup br br British police undertook a thorough investigation to bring the perpetrators to justice Some seventeen minutes of film and many still photographs were examined TV Eye produced an hour long programme featuring the footage while British newspapers published the photographs br A total of people were arrested and questioned with Liverpool fans being charged with manslaughter the only extraditable offence applicable to events at Heysel An extradition hearing in London in February March ruled all were to be extradited to stand trial in Belgium for the death of Juventus fan Mario Ronchi In September they were extradited and formally charged with manslaughter applying to all deaths and further charges of assault Initially all were held at a Belgian prison but over the subsequent months judges permitted their release as the start of the trial was further delayed br The trial eventually began in October with three Belgians also standing trial for their role in the disaster Albert Roosens the head of the Belgian Football Association for allowing tickets for the Liverpool section of the stadium to be sold to Juventus fans and two police chiefs Michel Kensier and Johan Mahieu who were in charge of policing at the stadium that night Two of the Liverpool fans were in custody in Britain at the time and stood trial later In April fourteen fans were convicted and given three year sentences half of which were suspended for five years allowing them to return to the UK One man who was acquitted was Ronnie Jepson who would go on to make appearances over a thirteen year career in the English Football League br br Pressure mounted to ban English clubs from European competition On May British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher asked The Football Association the FA to withdraw English clubs from European competition before they were banned but two days later UEFA banned English clubs for an indeterminate period of time On June the International Federation of Association Football FIFA extended this ban to all worldwide matches but this was modified a week later to allow friendly matches outside of Europe to take place In December FIFA announced that English clubs were also free to play friendly games in Europe though the Belgian government banned any English clubs playing in their country br Though the England national team was not subjected to any bans English club sides were banned indefinitely from European club competitions with Liverpool being provisionally subject to a further three years suspension as well In April following years of campaigning from the English football authorities UEFA confirmed the reintroduction of English clubs with the exception of Liverpool into its competitions from the season onward effective July in April UEFA s executive committee voted to allow Liverpool back into European competition from the season onward a year later than their compatriots but two years earlier than initially foreseen In the end all English clubs served a five year ban while Liverpool were excluded for six years br According to former Liverpool striker Ian Rush who signed with Juventus a year later he saw pronounced improvement in the institutional relationships between both the clubs and their fans during his career in Italy br br Prior to the introduction of the ban England were ranked first in the UEFA coefficient ranking due to the performance of English clubs in European competition in the previous five seasons Throughout the ban England s points were kept in the ranking until they would have naturally been replaced br The places vacated by English clubs in the UEFA Cup were reallocated to the best countries who would usually only have two spots in the competition countries ranked between ninth and twenty first For the UEFA Cup the Soviet Union France Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands were granted an additional spot each while in Yugoslavia Czechoslovakia France and East Germany were the recipients The season saw Portugal Austria and Sweden gain an additional place with Sweden and Yugoslavia gaining the places for the competition The final year of the English ban saw Austria receive a spot while a play off round was played between a French and a Yugoslav side for the final space due to the two countries having the same number of points in the ranking br England was removed from the rankings in due to having no points England did not return to the top of the coefficient rankings until br br The following clubs were denied entry to European competitions during this period br br The number of places available to English clubs in the UEFA Cup would however have been reduced had English teams been eliminated early in the competition By the time of the re admittance of all English clubs except Liverpool in England was only granted one UEFA Cup entrant awarded to the league runners up prior to the ban they had four entry slots a number not awarded to England again under regular means br Welsh clubs playing in the English league system who could qualify for the European Cup Winners Cup via the Welsh Cup were unaffected by the ban Bangor City Wrexham Merthyr Tydfil Cardiff City and Swansea City all competed in the Cup Winners Cup during the ban on English clubs despite playing in the English league system br In the meantime many other clubs missed out on a place in the UEFA Cup due to the return of English clubs to European competitions only being gradual in the league had no UEFA coefficient points used to calculate the number of teams and even though Manchester United won the Cup Winners Cup in the first season of returning in it took several more years for England to build up the points to the previous level due to the coefficient being calculated over a five year period and there being a one year delay between the publication of the rankings and their impact on club allocation br Liverpool s additional year of exclusion from Europe meant that there was no English representation in the European Cup as they were Football League First Division champions br br Due to the weak coefficient Football League Cup winners Nottingham Forest also missed out on UEFA Cup places in along with Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal The teams who missed out on the UEFA Cup for the same reason were Sheffield Wednesday Crystal Palace and Leeds United Arsenal and Manchester City were unable to take part for the competition For Blackburn Rovers and Queens Park Rangers would have qualified br Leeds United missed out in and initially though they qualified for the latter via the new UEFA Fair Play ranking which at the time gave their three top ranking associations highest placed team who ve not already qualified for Europe a UEFA Cup spot Remaining outside the top three of the coefficient rankings England retained its three UEFA Cup berths instead of four Sixth placed Everton lost a Fair Play berth for by UEFA as punishment for the FA due to Tottenham Hotspur and Wimbledon fielding weakened teams in the UEFA Intertoto Cup br By this point while England s coefficient was no longer directly affected by the ban due to it being outside of the five year window their coefficient continued to be affected by years of under representation in the competition As a result Aston Villa missed out via their league position for and but qualified for both through Fair Play Restructuring of UEFA competitions for gave the top six associations of the coefficient ranking three UEFA Cup berths the top three gained four Champions League berths whilst got three which England now reached whilst associations ranked seventh and eighth were given four berths for the competition br br In a memorial was presented to the victims at the Juventus headquarters in Piazza Crimea Turin The monument includes an epitaph written by Torinese journalist Giovanni Arpino Since to it has been situated in front of the club s headquarters in Corso Galileo Ferraris and since then in Juventus Headquarter In another memorial monument for the victims of the disaster was inaugurated in Reggio Emilia the hometown of the victim Claudio Zavaroni in front of Stadio Mirabello every year the committee Per non dimenticare Heysel In order not to forget Heysel holds a ceremony on May with relatives of the victims representatives of Juventus survivors and various supporters clubs from various football clubs including Inter Milan Milan AC Reggiana and Torino During Euro members of the Italian team left flowers on the site in honour of the victims br On May a sculpture was unveiled at the new Heysel stadium to commemorate the disaster The monument is a sundial designed by French artist Patrick Rimoux and includes Italian and Belgian stone and the poem Funeral Blues by Englishman W H Auden to symbolise the sorrow of the three countries Thirty nine lights shine one for each who died that night br On Wednesday May a permanent plaque was unveiled on the Centenary Stand at Anfield to honour the Juventus fans who died years earlier This plaque is one of two permanent memorials to be found at Anfield along with one for the fans killed in the Hillsborough disaster in In May a Heysel Memorial was unveiled in the J Museum at Turin There is also a tribute to the disaster s victims in the club s Walk of Fame in front of the Juventus Stadium Two years later Juventus officials announced a memorial in the Continassa headquarter In February an exhibition in Turin was dedicated both to the Heysel tragedy and Superga air disaster The name of the exhibition was Settanta angeli in un unico cielo Superga e Heysel tragedie sorelle angels in the one same heaven Superga and Heysel sister tragedies and gathered material from May and May br On November the Italian Football Federation FIGC Juventus representatives led by Mariella Scirea and J Museum president Paolo Garimberti and members of the Italian victims association held a ceremony in front of the Heysel monument in King Baudouin Stadium for the th anniversary of the event The following day FIGC president Carlo Tavecchio announced the retirement of Squadra Azzurra s number shirt prior to the friendly match between Italy and Belgium br br A memorial service for those killed in the disaster was held before Liverpool s match with Arsenal at Anfield on August their first fixture after the disaster However according to The Sydney Morning Herald it was drowned out by chanting Juventus and Liverpool were drawn together in the quarter finals of the Champions League their first meeting since Heysel Before the first leg at Anfield Liverpool fans held up placards to form a banner saying amicizia friendship in Italian Most Juventus fans chose to turn their backs on it In the return leg in Turin Juventus fans displayed banners reading Easy to speak difficult to pardon Murders and Sheffield God exists the latter a reference to the Hillsborough disaster in which Liverpool fans were killed in a crush A number of Liverpool fans were attacked in the city by Juventus ultras br In May during a Serie A match between Juventus and Napoli at Turin Juventus fans held up placards to form a banner saying Rispetto respect in Italian including the names of the victims of the disaster br In an interview with Planet Football Liverpool footballer Mark Lawrenson spoke about his experience in the immediate
