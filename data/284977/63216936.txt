id: 63216936
The COVID pandemic in the United Kingdom is a part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease COVID caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV In the United Kingdom it has resulted in confirmed cases and is associated with deaths br The virus began circulating in the country in early arriving primarily from travel elsewhere in Europe Various sectors responded with more widespread public health measures incrementally introduced from March The first wave was at the time one of the world s largest outbreaks By mid April the peak had been passed and restrictions were gradually eased A second wave with a new variant that originated in the UK becoming dominant began in the autumn and peaked in mid January and was deadlier than the first The UK started a COVID vaccination programme in early December Generalised restrictions were gradually lifted and were mostly ended by August A third wave fuelled by the new Delta variant began in July but the rate of deaths and hospitalisations was lower than with the first two waves this being attributed to the mass vaccination programme By early December the Omicron variant had arrived and caused record infection levels br The UK government and each of the three devolved governments in Scotland Northern Ireland and Wales introduced public health and economic measures including new laws to mitigate its impact A national lockdown was introduced on March and lifted in May replaced with specific regional restrictions Further nationwide restrictions were introduced later in in response to a surge in cases Most restrictions were lifted during the Delta variant driven third wave in mid The winter plan reintroduced some rules in response to the Omicron variant in December and all restrictions were lifted in February and March as the Omicron wave continued br Economic support was given to struggling businesses including a furlough scheme for employees As well as the major strain on the UK s healthcare service the pandemic has had a severe impact on the UK s economy caused major disruptions to education and had far reaching impacts on society and politics br br br History br br br Origin br On January the World Health Organization WHO confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City Hubei China which was reported to the WHO on December The case fatality ratio for COVID has been much lower than SARS of but the transmission has been significantly greater with a significant total death toll br Scientists used statistical analysis of data from genetic sequencing combined with epidemiological and estimated travel data to estimate the source locations of the virus in the UK up to the beginning of March and following the initial importations which were likely from China or elsewhere in Asia From this analysis they estimated that about were from Spain from France from Italy and from elsewhere br br br First wave br br Though later reporting indicated that there may have been some cases dating from late COVID was confirmed to be present in the UK by the end of January with the first confirmed deaths in March Subsequent epidemiological analysis showed that over lineages of SARS CoV entered the UK in early from international travellers mostly from outbreaks elsewhere in Europe leading to numerous clusters that overwhelmed contact tracing efforts Limited testing and surveillance meant during the early weeks of the pandemic case numbers were underestimated obscuring the extent of the outbreak br A legally enforced Stay at Home Order or lockdown was introduced on March banning all non essential travel and contact with other people and shut schools businesses venues and gathering places People were told to keep apart in public Those with symptoms and their households were told to self isolate while those considered at highest risk were told to shield The health services worked to raise hospital capacity and established temporary critical care hospitals but initially faced some shortages of personal protective equipment By mid April it was reported that restrictions had flattened the curve of the epidemic and the UK had passed its peak after deaths The UK s overall death toll and by population surpassed that of Italy on May making the UK the worst affected country in Europe at the time Restrictions were steadily eased across the UK in late spring and early summer that year The UK s epidemic in early was at the time one of the largest worldwide br br br Second wave br br By the autumn COVID cases were again rising This led to the introduction of social distancing measures and some localised restrictions Larger lockdowns took place in all of Wales England and Northern Ireland later that season In both England and Scotland tiered restrictions were introduced in October and England went into a month long lockdown during November followed by new tiered restrictions in December Multi week circuit breaker lockdowns were imposed in Wales and Northern Ireland A new variant of the virus is thought to have originated in Kent around September Once restrictions were lifted the novel variant rapidly spread across the UK Its increased transmissibility contributed to a continued increase in daily infections that surpassed previous records The healthcare system had come under severe strain by late December Following a partial easing of restrictions for Christmas all of the UK went into a third lockdown The second wave peaked in mid January with over daily deaths before declining into the summer br The first COVID vaccine was approved and began being deployed across the UK in early December with a staggered rollout prioritising the most vulnerable and then moving to progressively younger age groups The UK was the first country to do so and in early its vaccination program was one of the fastest in the world By August more than of adults in the UK were fully vaccinated against COVID Quarantine rules for all incoming travellers were introduced for the first time in late January Restrictions began to ease from late February onwards and almost all had ended in Great Britain by August br br br Third wave br A third wave of daily infections began in July due to the arrival and rapid spread of the highly transmissible SARS CoV Delta variant However mass vaccination continued to keep deaths and hospitalisations at much lower levels than in previous waves Infection rates remained high and hospitalisations and deaths rose into the autumn In December the SARS CoV Omicron variant was confirmed to have arrived and begun spreading widely in the community particularly in London driving a further increase in cases that surpassed previous records although the true number of infections was thought to be higher It became mandatory for people to show proof of full vaccination or proof that they are not infected to enter certain indoor hospitality and entertainment venues On January the UK became the seventh country worldwide to pass reported COVID deaths br All remaining legally enforced COVID related restrictions concluded in Northern Ireland and England during February with that step being taken in Scotland partially extended into April and Wales by the end of March Cases rose following the relaxation of restrictions but began along with hospitalisations and deaths to fall shortly after br The UK Health Security Agency publishes a weekly national influenza and coronavirus COVID report which summarises COVID levels and other seasonal respiratory illnesses br br br Responses br br br Government br br br Other sectors br br br Impacts br There has been some disparity between the outbreak s severity in England Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland health care in the UK is devolved each constituent country having its own publicly funded healthcare system run by devolved governments br br br Health and life expectancy br The COVID pandemic led to the largest fall in life expectancy in England since records began in On average British COVID victims lost around a decade of life the last time deaths rose so sharply in the UK was during World War II In the disease was the leading cause of death among men and second leading cause among women br Research in suggests over million people in the UK have had Long COVID with the majority reporting substantial impacts on day to day life Professor Danny Altmann of Imperial College London said in March It s kind of an anathema to me that we ve kind of thrown in the towel on control of Omicron wave infections and have said it s endemic and we don t care any more because it s very benign he said It just isn t And there are new people joining the long Covid support groups all the time with their disabilities It s really not OK and it s heartbreaking The Office for National Statistics estimated that the number of people in the UK with continuing COVID symptoms like fatigue muscle pain and breathing problems has doubled in a year from one million in May to two million in May Treatment facilities for patients with long COVID are inadequate br The pandemic s major impact on the country s healthcare system leading to long waiting lists for medical procedures and ambulances also led to an indirect increase in deaths from other conditions It also had a major mental health impact br In August a report from Age UK found that of people over could not walk as far and were living in more physical pain earlier this year compared to the start of the pandemic of older people felt less confident attending a hospital appointment and of older people felt less confident going to a GP surgery br br br Education br br Research by The Sunday Times reported that in the proportion of private school pupils receiving A a mark for exceptional achievement was per cent rising from per cent in The highest record in terms of increase came from the North London Collegiate School where senior fees could surpass a year and the proportion of A grades rose from per cent in to per cent in the summer of At schools the number of A grades trebled or even quadrupled These and other findings led MPs to call for an inquiry into the manipulation of the exam system during the COVID crisis br br br Economy br br The pandemic was widely disruptive to the economy of the United Kingdom with most sectors and workforces adversely affected Some temporary shutdowns became permanent some people who were furloughed were later made redundant The economic disruption has had a significant impact on people s mental health with particular damage to the mental health of foreign born men whose work hours have been reduced eliminated br br br Society br br The pandemic has had far reaching consequences in the country that go beyond the spread of the disease itself and efforts to quarantine it including political cultural and social implications br br br Spread to other countries and territories br Sophie Gr goire Trudeau the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tested positive for COVID upon her return from WE Day events in the UK on March the Trudeau family entered two weeks of self isolation The first patient in Mauritius was a year old man who returned from the United Kingdom on March When he arrived in Mauritius the Mauritian had no symptoms Other cases of the novel coronavirus resulting from travel to the UK were subsequently reported in India and Nigeria br On June it was widely reported in British media that New Zealand s first COVID cases in days were diagnosed in two British women both of whom had travelled from the UK and were given special permission to visit a dying parent The women had entered the country on June after first flying into Doha and Brisbane br A study suggested that the SARS CoV Alpha variant which was first detected in Kent spread internationally via flights originating in London in late br br br Statistics br br br Mathematical modelling and government response br br Reports from the Medical Research Council s Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London have been providing mathematically calculated estimates of cases and case fatality rates In February the team at Imperial College led by epidemiologist Neil Ferguson estimated about two thirds of cases in travellers from China were not detected and that some of these may have begun chains of transmission within the countries they entered They forecast that the new type of coronavirus could infect up to of the UK s population in the worst case scenario br In a paper on March the Imperial College team provided detailed forecasts of the potential impacts of the epidemic in the UK and US It detailed the potential outcomes of an array of non pharmaceutical interventions Two potential overall strategies outlined were mitigation in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely and suppression where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately it would still lead to approximately deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed On March the Prime Minister announced changes to government advice extending self isolation to whole households advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future br A paper on March by the Imperial College group estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from to less than This paper and others relied on data from European countries including the UK to estimate that the combined non pharmaceutical interventions reduced the reproduction number of the virus by enough to stop infections from growing However followup work concluded that the effectiveness of interventions was lower in later waves of infections br In April biostatistician Professor Sheila Bird said the delay in the reporting of deaths from the virus meant there was a risk of underestimating the steepness of the rising epidemic trend br In December scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that Omicron could cause from to deaths in England over the five months to April unless there were more stringent restrictions and would probably become the dominant variant by the end of br br br International comparisons br br As of December there had been million confirmed cases the most in Europe and fourth highest worldwide By that date there had been deaths among people who had recently tested positive the world s seventh highest death toll and th highest death rate by population This is Europe s second highest death toll after Russia and the th highest death rate worldwide Since early the UK has had one of the world s highest testing rates br In March The Lancet published a study showing that compared to other western European countries with per population the UK had a lower excess deaths rate during the pandemic than the average and lower than Italy Portugal Spain Belgium and the Netherlands that the difference between the UK France and Germany was not statistically significant and that Ireland and the Scandinavian countries had a lower rate The UK rate is marginally more than the world average of The study was of excess mortality in countries over the years and during the pandemic the method that the chief medical officer of England Chris Whitty said is the best way to compare outcomes between countries The study found that compared to other countries the UK tended to attribute more deaths to COVID A Cambridge University epidemiologist Raghib Ali said that the study would correct widespread misconceptions about the way the UK had handled the pandemic and that there was no clear relationship between levels of excess mortality and different levels of restrictions across western Europe or indeed the whole of Europe Ali also said all the commentary to date as to how and why the UK or Sweden has done worse than its neighbours is clearly no longer valid br br br See also br COVID pandemic in England br COVID pandemic in London br COVID pandemic in
