Bundesliga is broadcast on television in over countries br The Bundesliga was founded in in Dortmund and the first season started in The structure and organisation of the Bundesliga along with Germany s other football leagues have undergone frequent changes The Bundesliga was founded by the Deutscher Fu ball Bund English German Football Association but is now operated by the Deutsche Fu ball Liga English German Football League br br The Bundesliga is composed of two divisions the Bundesliga although it is rarely referred to with the First prefix and below that the Bundesliga nd Bundesliga which has been the second tier of German football since The Bundesligen plural are professional leagues Since the Liga rd League in Germany has also been a professional league but may not be called Bundesliga because the league is run by the German Football Association DFB and not as are the two Bundesligen by the German Football League DFL br Below the level of the Liga leagues are generally subdivided on a regional basis For example the Regionalligen are currently made up of Nord North Nordost Northeast S d South S dwest Southwest and West divisions Below this are thirteen parallel divisions most of which are called Oberligen upper leagues which represent federal states or large urban and geographical areas The levels below the Oberligen differ between the local areas The league structure has changed frequently and typically reflects the degree of participation in the sport in various parts of the country In the early s changes were driven by the reunification of Germany and the subsequent integration of the national league of East Germany br Every team in the two Bundesligen must have a licence to play in the league or else they are relegated into the regional leagues To obtain a licence teams must be financially healthy and meet certain standards of conduct as organisations br As in other national leagues there are significant benefits to being in the top division br br A greater share of television broadcast licence revenues goes to Bundesliga sides br Bundesliga teams draw significantly greater levels of fan support Average attendance in the first league is per game more than twice the average of the Bundesliga br Greater exposure through television and higher attendance levels helps Bundesliga teams attract the most lucrative sponsorships br Bundesliga teams develop substantial financial muscle through the combination of television and gate revenues sponsorships and marketing of their team brands This allows them to attract and retain skilled players from domestic and international sources and to construct first class stadium facilities br The Bundesliga is financially strong and the Bundesliga has begun to evolve in a similar direction becoming more stable organizationally and financially and reflecting an increasingly higher standard of professional play br br No clubs have played continuously in the Bundesliga since its foundation on May Hamburger SV was the last founding club to be relegated for the first time br In the season the Bundesliga reinstated an earlier German system of promotion and relegation which had been in use from until br br The bottom two finishers in the Bundesliga are automatically relegated to the Bundesliga with the top two finishers in the Bundesliga taking their places br The third from bottom club in the Bundesliga will play a two legged tie with the third place team from the Bundesliga with the winner taking up the final place in the following season s Bundesliga br From until a different system was used in which the bottom three finishers of the Bundesliga were automatically relegated to be replaced by the top three finishers in the Bundesliga From until two or later three teams were relegated from the Bundesliga automatically while promotion was decided either completely or partially in promotion play offs br The season starts in early August and lasts until late May with a winter break of six weeks mid December through to the end of January Starting with the season opening matches were introduced to feature defending champions on Friday nights on the first match day Defending champions have not lost the opening matches since then winning of the matches up to the season Starting with the season kick off times were changed with Friday matches starting at pm Saturdays at pm and pm and Sundays at pm pm and pm br br Before the formation of the Bundesliga German football was played at an amateur level in a large number of sub regional leagues until in part time semi professionalism was introduced and only five regional Oberligen Premier Leagues remained Regional champions and runners up played a series of playoff matches for the right to compete in a final game for the national championship On January a national association the Deutscher Fu ball Bund DFB had been founded in Leipzig with member clubs The first recognized national championship team was VfB Leipzig who beat DFC Prague in a game played at Altona on May br Through the s there were continued calls for the formation of a central professional league especially as professional leagues in other countries began to draw Germany s best players away from the semi professional domestic leagues At the international level the German game began to falter as German teams often fared poorly against professional teams from other countries A key supporter of the central league concept was national team head coach Sepp Herberger who said If we want to remain competitive internationally we have to raise our expectations at the national level br Meanwhile in East Germany a separate league was established with the formation of the DS Oberliga Deutscher Sportausschuss Oberliga in The league was renamed the Football Oberliga DFV in and was generally referred to simply as the DDR Liga or DDR Oberliga The league fielded teams with two relegation spots br br br br The defeat of the national team by Yugoslavia in a World Cup quarter final game in Chile was one impetus of many towards the formation of a national league At the annual DFB convention under new DFB president Hermann G smann elected that very day the Bundesliga was created in Dortmund at the Westfalenhallen on July to begin play starting with the season br At the time there were five Oberligen premier leagues in place representing West Germany s North South West Southwest and Berlin East Germany behind the Iron Curtain maintained its separate league structure clubs applied for admission to the new league

second place clubs Meidericher SV and Eintracht Frankfurt br br Following German reunification in the East German leagues were merged into the West German system Dynamo Dresden and FC Hansa Rostock were seeded into the top tier Bundesliga division ahead of the Bundesliga with other clubs being sorted into lower tiers br br Gazprom became a major sponsor of Bundesliga football in with Gerhard Schr der s climb to the top of the company br br The German football champion is decided strictly by play in the Bundesliga Each club plays every other club once at home and once away Originally a victory was worth two points with one point for a draw and none for a loss Since the season a victory has been worth three points while a draw remains worth a single point and zero points are given for a loss The club with the most points at the end of the season becomes the German champion Currently the top four clubs in the table qualify automatically for the group phase of the UEFA Champions League The two teams at the bottom of the table are relegated into the Bundesliga while the top two teams in the Bundesliga are promoted The th placed team third last in the Bundesliga and the third placed team in the Bundesliga play a two leg play off match The winner of this match plays the next season in the Bundesliga and the losing side in the Bundesliga br If teams are level on points tie breakers are applied in the following order br br Goal difference for the entire season br Total goals scored for the entire season br Head to head results total points br Head to head goals scored br Head to head away goals scored br Total away goals scored for the entire season br If two clubs are still tied after all of these tie breakers have been applied a single match is held at a neutral

was maintained from the UEFA Cup The last Bundesliga team to gain entry to the UEFA Cup via the fair play rule was Mainz in br DFB Pokal German Cup winner Qualifies for the group stage of Europa League regardless of league position br Until if the Cup winner qualified for the Champions League or Europa League by more than one method the cup winner s place in the Europa League went to the losing cup finalist if it had not already qualified for European competition entering the competition a stage earlier than if it had won the Cup This rule was retained from the Europa League s predecessor the UEFA Cup From the runners up no longer qualified for the Europa League and the Europa League berth reserved for the DFB Pokal winners is transferred to the highest finisher below the european qualification places br Prior to the team that benefited from that rule did not necessarily have to be a Bundesliga member For example although Bundesliga sides Alemannia Aachen lost to Werder Bremen in the DFB Pokal Final Alemannia secured an entry in the UEFA Cup because Werder qualified for the Champions League as First Bundesliga champions br The number of German clubs which may participate in UEFA competitions is determined by UEFA coefficients which takes into account the results of a particular nation s clubs in UEFA competitions over the preceding five years br br History

group stage br UEFA Cup Europa League br From to UEFA member nations could send between one and four teams to the UEFA Cup Germany was always entitled to send at least three teams to the competition and often as many as four From the number of participants was determined by the DFB s UEFA coefficient standing prior to this the method for deciding the number of participants is unknown The best performing teams in the league other than the champion would qualify although if one of these teams was also winner of the DFB Pokal then they would enter the Cup Winners Cup instead and their UEFA Cup place would be taken by the next highest placed team in the league th or th place Briefly in the mid s the DFB decided to allocate the last UEFA Cup place to the DFB Pokal runner up instead of a third or fourth team qualified by performance in the league meaning that at this point the DFB Pokal qualified two teams for European competition winners for the Cup Winners Cup runners up for the UEFA Cup This policy was unique amongst UEFA member associations and was dropped after only a few seasons Starting with the season and the abolition of the Cup Winners Cup which was then folded into the UEFA Cup the DFB Pokal winner now automatically qualified for the UEFA Cup alongside depending on the DFB s UEFA coefficients standing between one and three extra participants if the DFB Pokal winner also qualified for the Champions League they were replaced by the DFB Pokal runner up if they were also qualified for the Champions League the UEFA Cup place went to the next best placed team in the league not otherwise qualified for European competition Since the DFB has always been entitled to enter a minimum of three clubs in the UEFA Cup Europa League and at times as many as four the maximum for any European federation Teams that entered via UEFA s Fair Play mechanism or those that entered through the now defunct Intertoto Cup did not count against the national quota From through the final Intertoto Cup in only one First Bundesliga side was eligible to enter the Intertoto Cup and possibly earn a UEFA Cup berth For the season the DFB earned an extra UEFA Cup place via the Fair Play draw this place went to Mainz as the highest ranked club in the Fair Play table of the First Bundesliga not already qualified for Europe br Cup Winners Cup abolished after br The winner of the DFB Pokal entered the Cup Winners Cup unless that team was also league champion and therefore competing in the European Cup Champions League in which case their place in the Cup Winners Cup was taken by the DFB Pokal runner up Today the DFB Pokal winner if not otherwise qualified for the Champions League enters the UEFA Europa League br br In the season the Bundesliga s turnover was bn broken down into match day revenue m sponsorship receipts m and broadcast income m That year it was the only European football league where clubs collectively made a profit Bundesliga clubs paid less than of revenue in players wages the lowest percentage out of the European leagues The Bundesliga has the lowest ticket prices and the highest average attendance among Europe s five major leagues br Bundesliga clubs tend to form close associations with local firms several of which have since grown into big global companies in a comparison of leading Bundesliga and Premiership clubs Bayern Munich received of its revenue from company sponsorship deals while Manchester United got br Bundesliga clubs are required to be majority owned by German club members known as the rule to discourage control by a single entity and operate under tight restrictions on the use of debt for acquisitions a team only receives an operating licence if it has solid financials as a result of the clubs were profitable after the season By contrast in the other major European leagues numerous high profile teams have come under ownership of foreign billionaires and a significant number of clubs have high levels of debt br Exceptions to the rule allow Bayer Leverkusen TSG Hoffenheim and VfL Wolfsburg to be owned by corporations or individual investors In the cases of Bayer Leverkusen and Wolfsburg the clubs were founded by major corporations respectively Bayer AG and Volkswagen as sports clubs for their employees while Hoffenheim has long received its primary support from SAP co founder Dietmar Hopp who played in the club s youth system br After the German Football Association and the Bundesliga required every club to run a youth academy with the aim of developing local talent for the club and the national team As of the Bundesliga and second Bundesliga spend m a year on these youth academies which train five thousand players aged This increased the percentage of under year olds in the Bundesliga from in to in This in turn allows more money to be spent on the smaller number of players that are bought br In the s the Bundesliga was regarded as competitive as five teams won the league title This contrasted with the English Premier League then dominated by a Big Four Manchester United Chelsea Liverpool and Arsenal as well as France s Ligue won seven consecutive years by Lyon Since then however a resurgent Bayern Munich has won each year from to br br For a number of years the clubs in the Bundesliga have been subject to regulations not unlike the UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations agreed upon in September br At the end of each season clubs in the Bundesliga must apply to the German Football Federation DFB for a licence to participate again the following year only when the DFB who have access to all transfer documents and accounts are satisfied that there is no threat of insolvency do they give approval The DFB have a system of fines and points deductions for clubs who flout rules and those who go into the red can only buy a player after selling one for at least the same amount In addition no individual is allowed to own more than per cent of any Bundesliga club the only exceptions being VfL Wolfsburg Bayer Leverkusen and current Regionalliga Nordost member FC Carl Zeiss Jena should they ever be promoted to the Bundesliga as they were each founded as factory teams br br Despite the good economic governance there have still been some instances of clubs getting into difficulties In Borussia Dortmund reported a debt of million million Having won the Champions League in and a number of Bundesliga titles Dortmund had gambled on maintaining their success with an expensive group of largely foreign players but failed narrowly escaping liquidation in In subsequent years the club went through extensive restructuring to return to financial health largely with young home grown players In Hertha BSC reported debts of million and were able to continue in the Bundesliga only after proving they had long term credit with their bank br The leading German club Bayern Munich made a net profit of just million in season group accounts while Schalke made a net loss of million in financial year Borussia Dortmund GmbH Co KGaA made a net loss of just million in season br br Based on its per game average the Bundesliga is the best attended association football league in the world out of all sports its average of fans per game during the season was the second highest of any professional sports league worldwide behind only the National Football League of the United States Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund has the highest average attendance of any football club in the world br Out of Europe s five major football leagues Premier League La Liga Ligue and Serie A the Bundesliga has the lowest ticket prices and the highest average attendance Many club stadia have large terraced areas for standing fans by comparison stadia in the English Premier League are all seaters due to the Taylor Report Teams limit the number of season tickets to ensure everyone has a chance to see the games live and the away club has the right to of the available capacity Match tickets often double as free rail passes which encourages supporters to travel and celebrate in a relaxed atmosphere According to Bundesliga chief executive Christian Seifert tickets are inexpensive especially for standing room as It is not in the clubs culture so much to raise prices They are very fan orientated Uli Hoene president of Bayern Munich was quoted as saying We do not think the fans are like cows to be milked Football has got to be for everybody br br The spectator figures for league for the last ten seasons br br The Bundesliga TV radio

Bundesliga titles stars br The former East German side BFC Dynamo laid claim to the three stars of a time champion The club asked for equal rights and petitioned the DFL and the DFB to have their DDR Oberliga titles recognized BFC Dynamo received support from SG Dynamo Dresden and FC Magdeburg in its attempts to achieve recognition for East German titles The DFL eventually answered that it was not the responsible body and pointed to the DFB but the DFB remained silent for long time BFC Dynamo eventually took matters into their own hands and emblazoned its jerseys with three stars while a decision was still pending This caused some debate because the club had been the favorite club of Erich Mielke during the East German era There were rumours that the ten titles won by the club were also due to alleged manipulation of the game by Erich Mielke while there is no proof that referees stood under direct instructions from the Stasi and no document has ever been found in the archives that gave the Stasi a mandate to bribe referees Critics in the DFB environment pointed to politically influenced championships in East Germany BFC Dynamo had been supported by the Stasi and had been advantaged The club had enjoyed privileged access to talents and access to a permanent training camp at Uckley in K nigs Wusterhausen However also other clubs in East Germany had enjoyed similar advantages which put the DFB in a difficult situation Additionally former East German referee and CDU parliamentarian Bernd Heynemann spoke out for recognition of all East German titles The issue of recognition for titles outside the Bundesliga also affected pre Bundesliga champions such as Hertha BSC The DFB finally decided in November to allow all former champions to display a single star
