title: Cardiac arrest
id: 60575
Cardiac arrest also known as sudden cardiac arrest is when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating As a result blood cannot properly circulate around the body and there is diminished blood flow to the brain and other organs When the brain does not receive enough blood this can cause a person to lose consciousness Coma and persistent vegetative state may result from cardiac arrest Cardiac arrest is also identified by a lack of central pulses and abnormal or absent breathing br Cardiac arrest and resultant hemodynamic collapse often occur due to arrhythmias irregular heart rhythms Ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia are most commonly recorded However as many incidents of cardiac arrest occur out of hospital or when a person is not having their cardiac activity monitored it is difficult to identify the specific mechanism in each case br Structural heart disease such as coronary artery disease is a common underlying condition in people who experience cardiac arrest The most common risk factors include age and cardiovascular disease Additional underlying cardiac conditions include heart failure and inherited arrhythmias Additional factors that may contribute to cardiac arrest include major blood loss lack of oxygen electrolyte disturbance such as very low potassium electrical injury and intense physical exercise br Cardiac arrest is diagnosed by the inability to find a pulse in an unresponsive patient The goal of treatment for cardiac arrest is to rapidly achieve return of spontaneous circulation using a variety of interventions including CPR defibrillation and or cardiac pacing Two protocols have been established for CPR basic life support BLS and advanced cardiac life support ACLS br If return of spontaneous circulation is achieved with these interventions then sudden cardiac arrest has occurred By contrast if the person does not survive the event this is referred to as sudden cardiac death Among those whose pulses are re established the care team may initiate measures to protect the person from brain injury and preserve neurological function Some methods may include airway management and mechanical ventilation maintenance of blood pressure and end organ perfusion via fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support correction of electrolyte imbalance EKG monitoring and management of reversible causes and temperature management Targeted temperature management may improve outcomes In post resuscitation care an implantable cardiac defibrillator may be considered to reduce the chance of death from recurrence br Per the American Heart Association Guidelines there were approximately incidents of cardiac arrest annually in the United States about per people Of these experience cardiac arrest outside of a hospital setting while occur within a hospital br Cardiac arrest becomes more common with age and affects males more often than females Twice as many black men die from a cardiac arrest as white men Asian and Hispanic people are not as frequently affected as white people br br br Signs and symptoms br Cardiac arrest is not preceded by any warning symptoms in approximately percent of people For individuals who do experience symptoms the symptoms are usually nonspecific to the cardiac arrest For example new or worsening chest pain fatigue blackouts dizziness shortness of breath weakness or vomiting br When cardiac arrest is suspected by a layperson due to signs of unconsciousness abnormal breathing and or no pulse it should be assumed that the victim is in cardiac arrest Bystanders should call emergency medical services such as or and initiate CPR br br br Risk factors br Major risk factors for cardiac arrest include age and underlying cardiovascular disease A prior episode of sudden cardiac arrest increases the likelihood of future episodes A meta analysis assessing the recurrence of cardiac arrest in out of hospital cardiac arrest survivors identified that of survivors experienced a second event most often in the first year Furthermore of those who experienced recurrence had a third episode br Additional significant risk factors include cigarette smoking high blood pressure high cholesterol history of arrhythmia lack of physical exercise obesity diabetes family history cardiomyopathy alcohol use and possibly caffeine intake Current cigarette smokers with coronary artery disease were found to have a two to threefold increase in the risk of sudden death between ages and Furthermore it was found that former smokers risk was closer to that of those who had never smoked A statistical analysis of many of these risk factors determined that approximately of all cardiac arrests occur in of the population perceived to be at greatest risk due to aggregate harm of multiple risk factors demonstrating that cumulative risk of multiple comorbidities exceeds the sum of each risk individually br As many autopsy studies have suggested mRNA covid vaccines are thought to cause cardiac deaths br br For the case study for Israel it was revealed that there exists a statistically significant correlation between the frequency of cardiac events and Covid vaccine rollout br br br Causes and mechanisms br br The underlying causes of sudden cardiac arrest can result from cardiac and non cardiac etiologies The most common underlying causes are different depending on the patient s age Common cardiac causes include coronary artery disease non atherosclerotic coronary artery abnormalities structural heart damage and inherited arrhythmias Common non cardiac causes include respiratory arrest diabetes medications and trauma br The most common mechanism underlying sudden cardiac arrest is an arrhythmia an irregular rhythm Without organized electrical activity in the heart muscle there is inconsistent contraction of the ventricles which prevents the heart from generating adequate cardiac output forward pumping of blood from the heart to the rest of the body This hemodynamic collapse results in poor blood flow to the brain and other organs which if prolonged causes persistent damage br There are many different types of arrhythmias but the ones most frequently recorded in sudden cardiac arrest are ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation Both ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation can prevent the heart from generating coordinated ventricular contractions thereby failing to sustain adequate blood circulation br Less common types of arrhythmias occurring in cardiac arrest include pulseless electrical activity bradycardia and asystole These rhythms are seen when there is prolonged cardiac arrest progression of ventricular fibrillation or efforts like defibrillation executed to resuscitate the person br br br Cardiac causes br br br Coronary artery disease br br Coronary artery disease CAD also known as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease involves the deposition of cholesterol and subsequent inflammation driven formation of atherosclerotic plaques in the arteries CAD involves the accumulation and remodeling of the coronary vessels along with other systemic blood vessels When an atherosclerotic plaque dislodges it can block the flow of blood and oxygen through small arteries such as the coronary arteries resulting in ischemic injury In the heart this results in myocardial tissue damage which can lead to structural and functional changes that disrupt normal conduction patterns and alter heart rate and contraction br CAD underlies percent of sudden cardiac deaths in the United States Indeed postmortem examinations have shown that the most common finding in cases of sudden cardiac death is chronic high grade stenosis of at least one segment of a major coronary artery br While CAD is a leading contributing factor this is an age dependent factor with CAD being a less common cause of sudden cardiac death in people under the age of br br br Non atherosclerotic coronary artery abnormalities br Abnormalities of the coronary arteries not related to atherosclerosis include inflammation known as coronary arteritis embolism vasospasm mechanical abnormalities related to connective tissue diseases or trauma and congenital coronary artery anomalies most commonly anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery These conditions account for of cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death br br Coronary arteritis commonly results from a pediatric febrile inflammatory condition known as Kawasaki disease Other types of vasculitis can also contribute to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death br Embolism or clotting of the coronary arteries most commonly occurs from septic emboli secondary to endocarditis with involvement of the aortic valve tricuspid valve or prosthetic valves br Coronary vasospasm may result in cardiac arrhythmias altering the heart s electrical conduction with a risk of complete cardiac arrest from severe or prolonged rhythm changes br Mechanical abnormalities with an associated risk of cardiac arrest may arise from coronary artery dissection which can be attributed to Marfan Syndrome or trauma br br br Structural heart disease br br Examples of structural heart diseases include cardiomyopathies hypertrophic dilated or arrhythmogenic cardiac rhythm disturbances myocarditis and congestive heart failure br br Left ventricular hypertrophy is a leading cause of sudden cardiac deaths in the adult population This is most commonly the result of longstanding high blood pressure or hypertension which has led to maladaptive overgrowth of muscular tissue of the left ventricle the heart s main pumping chamber This is because elevated blood pressure over the course of several years requires the heart to adapt to the requirement of pumping harder to adequately circulate blood throughout the body If the heart does this for a prolonged period of time the left ventricle can experience hypertrophy grow larger in a way that decreases the heart s effectiveness Left ventricular hypertrophy can be demonstrated on an echocardiogram and electrocardiogram EKG br Abnormalities of the cardiac conduction system notably the Atrioventricular Node and His Purkinje system may predispose an individual to arrhythmias with a risk of progressing to sudden cardiac arrest albeit this risk remains low Many of these conduction blocks can be treated with internal cardiac defibrillators for those determined to be at high risk due to severity of fibrosis or severe electrophysiologic disturbances br Structural heart diseases unrelated to coronary artery disease account for of all sudden cardiac deaths A review of sudden cardiac deaths in the United States found that structural heart diseases accounted for over of sudden cardiac arrests for those under years br br br Inherited arrhythmia syndromes br Arrhythmias not due to structural heart disease account for to of sudden cardiac arrests These are frequently caused by genetic disorders The genetic mutations often affect specialized proteins known as ion channels that conduct electrically charged particles across the cell membrane and this group of conditions is therefore often referred to as channelopathies Examples of these inherited arrhythmia syndromes include Long QT syndrome LQTS Brugada Syndrome Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and Short QT syndrome Many are also associated with environmental or neurogenic triggers such as response to loud sounds that can initiate lethal arrhythmias br LQTS a condition often mentioned in young people s deaths occurs in one of every to newborns and is estimated to be responsible for deaths annually compared to the approximately cardiac arrests seen by emergency services These conditions are a fraction of the overall deaths related to cardiac arrest but represent conditions that may be detected prior to arrest and may be treatable The symptomatic expression of LQTS is quite broad and more often presents with syncope rather than cardiac arrest The risk of cardiac arrest is still present and people with family histories of sudden cardiac arrests should be screened for LQTS and other treatable causes of lethal arrhythmia Higher levels of risk for cardiac arrest are associated with female sex more significant QT prolongation history of unexplained syncope fainting spells or premature sudden cardiac death Additionally individuals with LQTS should avoid certain medications that carry the risk of increasing the severity of this conduction abnormality such as certain anti arrhythmics anti depressants and quinolone or macrolide antibiotics br Another condition that promotes arrhythmias is Wolff Parkinson White syndrome in which an accessory conduction pathway bypassing the atrioventricular node is present and can cause abnormal conduction patterns leading to supraventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest br br br Non cardiac causes br Non cardiac causes account for to of cardiac arrests Common non cardiac causes include respiratory arrest diabetes certain medications and blunt trauma especially to the chest br br Respiratory arrest will be followed by cardiac arrest unless promptly treated Respiratory arrest can be caused by pulmonary embolus choking drowning trauma drug overdose and poisoning Pulmonary embolus carries a high mortality rate and may be the triggering cause for up to of cardiac arrests according to a retrospective study from an urban tertiary care emergency department br Diabetes related factors contributing to cardiac arrest include silent myocardial ischemia nervous system dysfunction and electrolyte disturbances leading to abnormal cardiac repolarization br Certain medications can worsen an existing arrhythmia Some examples include antibiotics like macrolides diuretics and heart medications such as anti arrhythmic medications br Additional non cardiac causes include hemorrhage aortic rupture hypovolemic shock pulmonary embolism poisoning such as from the stings of certain jellyfish and electrical injury br Circadian patterns are also recognized as triggering factors in cardiac arrest Per a systematic review throughout the day there are two main peak times in which cardiac arrest occurs The first is in the morning hours and the second is in the afternoon Moreover survival rates following cardiac arrest were lowest when occurring between midnight and am br Many of these non cardiac causes of cardiac arrest are reversible A common mnemonic used to recall the reversible causes of cardiac arrest is referred to as the Hs and Ts The Hs are hypovolemia hypoxia hydrogen cation excess acidosis hyperkalemia hypokalemia hypothermia and hypoglycemia The Ts are toxins cardiac tamponade tension pneumothorax thrombosis myocardial infarction thromboembolism and trauma br br br Mechanism br br The definitive electrical mechanisms of cardiac arrest which may arise from any of the functional structural or physiologic abnormalities mentioned above are characterized by arrhythmias Ventricular fibrillation and pulseless or sustained ventricular tachycardia are the most commonly recorded arrhythmias preceding cardiac arrest These are rapid and erratic arrhythmias that alter the circulatory pathway such that adequate blood flow cannot be sustained and is inadequate to meet the body s needs br The mechanism responsible for the majority of sudden cardiac deaths is ventricular fibrillation Ventricular fibrillation is a tachyarrhythmia characterized by turbulent electrical activity in the ventricular myocardium leading to a heart rate too disorganized and rapid to produce any meaningful cardiac output thus resulting in insufficient perfusion of the brain and essential organs Some of the electrophysiologic mechanisms underpinning ventricular fibrillations include ectopic automaticity re entry and triggered activity However structural changes in the diseased heart as a result of inherited factors mutations in ion channel coding genes for example cannot explain the sudden onset of cardiac arrest br In ventricular tachycardia the heart also beats faster than normal which may prevent the heart chambers from properly filling with blood Ventricular tachycardia is characterized by an altered QRS complex and a heart rate greater than beats per minute When V tach is sustained lasts for at least seconds inadequate blood flow to heart tissue can lead to cardiac arrest br Bradyarrhythmias occur following dissociation of spontaneous electrical conduction and the mechanical function of the heart resulting in pulseless electrical activity PEA or through complete absence of electrical activity of the heart resulting in asystole Similar to the result of tachyarrhythmias these conditions lead to an inability to sustain adequate blood flow as well though in the case of bradyarrhythmias the underlying cause is an absence of mechanical activity rather than rapid beats leading to disorganization br br br Diagnosis br br Cardiac arrest is synonymous with clinical death The physical examination to diagnose cardiac arrest focuses on the absence of a pulse In many cases lack of a central pulse carotid arteries or subclavian arteries is the gold standard Lack of a pulse in the periphery radial pedal may also result from other conditions e g shock or be the rescuer s misinterpretation br Obtaining a thorough history can help inform the potential cause and prognosis The provider taking the person s clinical history should try to learn whether the episode was observed by anyone else when it happened what the patient was doing in particular whether there was any trauma and whether drugs were involved br During resuscitation efforts continuous monitoring equipment including EKG leads should be attached to the patient so that providers can analyze the electrical activity of the cardiac cycle and use this information to guide the management efforts EKG readings will help to identify the arrhythmia present and allow the team to monitor any changes that occur with the administration of CPR and defibrillation Clinicians classify cardiac arrest into shockable versus non shockable as determined by the EKG rhythm This refers to whether a particular class of cardiac dysrhythmia is treatable using defibrillation The two shockable rhythms are ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia while the two non shockable rhythms are asystole and pulseless electrical activity Moreover in the post resuscitation patient a lead EKG can help identify some causes of cardiac arrest such as STEMI which may require specific treatments br Point of care ultrasound POCUS is a tool that can be used to examine the movement of the heart and its force of contraction at the patient s bedside POCUS can accurately diagnose cardiac arrest in hospital settings as well as visualize cardiac wall motion contractions Using POCUS clinicians can have limited two dimensional views of different parts of the heart during arrest These images can help clinicians determine whether electrical activity within the heart is pulseless or pseudo pulseless as well as help them diagnose the potentially reversible causes of an arrest Published guidelines from the American Society of Echocardiography American College of Emergency Physicians European Resuscitation Council and the American Heart Association as well as the preoperative Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines have recognized the potential benefits of using POCUS in diagnosing and managing cardiac arrest br POCUS can help predict outcomes in resuscitation efforts Specifically use of transthoracic ultrasound can be a helpful tool in predicting mortality in cases of cardiac arrest with a systematic review from finding that there is a significant positive correlation between presence of cardiac motion and short term survival with CPR br Owing to the inaccuracy diagnosis solely based on central pulse detection some bodies like the European Resuscitation Council have de emphasized its importance Instead the current guidelines prompt individuals to begin CPR on any unconscious person with absent or abnormal breathing The Resuscitation Council in the United Kingdom stands in line with the European Resuscitation Council s recommendations and those of the American Heart Association They have suggested that the technique to check carotid pulses should be used only by healthcare professionals with specific training and expertise and even then that it should be viewed in conjunction with other indicators like agonal respiration br Various other methods for detecting circulation and therefore diagnosing cardiac arrest have been proposed Guidelines following the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation recommendations were for rescuers to look for signs of circulation but not specifically the pulse These signs included coughing gasping color twitching and movement Per evidence that these guidelines were ineffective the current International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation recommendation is that cardiac arrest should be diagnosed in all casualties who are unconscious and not breathing normally a similar protocol to that which the European Resuscitation Council has adopted In a non acute setting where the patient is expired diagnosis of cardiac arrest can be done via molecular autopsy or postmortem molecular testing which uses a set of molecular techniques to find the ion channels that are cardiac defective This could help elucidate the cause of death in the patient br Other physical signs or symptoms can help determine the potential cause of the cardiac arrest Below is a chart of the clinical findings and signs symptoms a person may have and potential causes associated with them br br br Prevention br br br Primary prevention br With the lack of positive outcomes following cardiac arrest efforts have been spent finding effective strategies to prevent cardiac arrest events The approach to primary prevention promotes a healthy diet exercise limited alcohol consumption and smoking cessation br Exercise is an effective preventative measure for cardiac arrest in the general population but may be risky for those with pre existing conditions The risk of a transient catastrophic cardiac event increases in individuals with heart disease during and immediately after exercise The lifetime and acute risks of cardiac arrest are decreased in people with heart disease who perform regular exercise perhaps suggesting the benefits of exercise outweigh the risks br A study found that diet may be a modifiable risk factor for a lower incidence of sudden cardiac death The study found that those who fell under the category of having Southern diets representing those of added fats fried food eggs organ and processed meats and sugar sweetened beverages had a positive association with an increased risk of cardiac arrest while those deemed following the Mediterranean diets had an inverse relationship regarding the risk of cardiac arrest According to a review published omega PUFA supplementation is not associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac death br A Cochrane review published in found moderate quality evidence to show that blood pressure lowering drugs do not reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death br br br Secondary prevention br br An implantable cardioverter defibrillator ICD is a battery powered device that monitors electrical activity in the heart and when an arrhythmia is detected can deliver an electrical shock to terminate the abnormal rhythm ICDs are used to prevent sudden cardiac death SCD in those who have survived a prior episode of sudden cardiac arrest SCA due to ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia br Numerous studies have been conducted on the use of ICDs for the secondary prevention of SCD These studies have shown improved survival with ICDs compared to the use of anti arrhythmic drugs ICD therapy is associated with a relative risk reduction in death caused by an arrhythmia and a relative risk reduction in all cause mortality br Prevention of SCD with ICD therapy for high risk patient populations has similarly shown improved survival rates in several large studies The high risk patient populations in these studies were defined as those with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy determined by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction LVEF The LVEF criteria used in these trials ranged from less than or equal to in MADIT II to less than or equal to in MUSTT br In certain high risk patient populations such as patients with LQTS ICDs are also used to prevent sudden cardiac death primary prevention br br br Crash teams br In hospital a cardiac arrest is referred to as a crash or a code This typically refers to code blue on the hospital emergency codes A dramatic drop in vital sign measurements is referred to as coding or crashing though coding is usually used when it results in cardiac arrest while crashing might not Treatment for cardiac arrest is sometimes referred to as calling a code br Patients in general wards often deteriorate for several hours or even days before a cardiac arrest occurs This has been attributed to a lack of knowledge and skill amongst ward based staff in particular a failure to measure the respiratory rate which is often the major predictor of a deterioration and can often change up to hours prior to a cardiac arrest In response many hospitals now have increased training for ward based staff A number of early warning systems also exist that aim to quantify the person s risk of deterioration based on their vital signs and thus provide a guide to staff In addition specialist staff are being used more effectively to augment the work already being done at the ward level These include br br Crash teams or code teams These are designated staff members with particular expertise in resuscitation who are called to the scene of all arrests within the hospital This usually involves a specialized cart of equipment including a defibrillator and drugs called a crash cart or crash trolley br Medical emergency teams These teams respond to all emergencies with the aim of treating people in the acute phase of their illness in order to prevent a cardiac arrest These teams have been found to decrease the rates of in hospital cardiac arrest IHCA and improve survival br Critical care outreach In addition to providing the services of the other two types of teams these teams are responsible for educating non specialist staff In addition they help to facilitate transfers between intensive care high dependency units and the general hospital wards This is particularly important as many studies have shown that a significant percentage of patients discharged from critical care environments quickly deteriorate and are re admitted the outreach team offers support to ward staff to prevent this from happening br br br Management br Sudden cardiac arrest may be treated via attempts at resuscitation This is usually carried out based on basic life support advanced cardiac life support ACLS pediatric advanced life support PALS or neonatal resuscitation program NRP guidelines br br br Cardiopulmonary resuscitation br br Early cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR is essential to surviving cardiac arrest with good neurological function It is recommended that it be started as soon as possible with minimal interruptions once begun The components of CPR that make the greatest difference in survival are chest compressions and defibrillating shockable rhythms After defibrillation chest compressions should be continued for two minutes before another rhythm check This is based on a compression rate of compressions per minute a compression depth of centimeters into the chest full chest recoil and a ventilation rate of breath ventilations per minute Mechanical chest compressions as performed by a machine are no better than chest compressions performed by hand It is unclear if a few minutes of CPR before defibrillation results in different outcomes than immediate defibrillation br Correctly performed bystander CPR has been shown to increase survival however it is performed in fewer than of out of hospital cardiac arrests OHCAs as of A meta analysis found that use of dispatcher assisted CPR improved outcomes including survival when compared with undirected bystander CPR Likewise a systematic review on exercise related cardiac arrests supported early intervention of bystander CPR and AED use for shockable rhythms as they improve survival outcomes br If high quality CPR has not resulted in return of spontaneous circulation and the person s heart rhythm is in asystole stopping CPR and pronouncing the person s death is generally reasonable after minutes Exceptions to this include certain cases with hypothermia or drowning victims Some of these cases should have longer and more sustained CPR until they are nearly normothermic br If cardiac arrest occurs after weeks of pregnancy the uterus should be pulled or pushed to the left during CPR If a pulse has not returned by four minutes an emergency Cesarean section is recommended br br br Airway management br High levels of oxygen are generally given during CPR Either a bag valve mask or an advanced airway may be used to help with breathing particularly since vomiting and regurgitation are common especially in OHCA If this occurs then modification to existing oropharyngeal suction may be required such as using suction assisted airway management br Tracheal intubation has not been found to improve survival rates or neurological outcomes in cardiac arrest and in the prehospital environment may worsen it Endotracheal tubes and supraglottic airways appear equally useful br Mouth to mouth as a means of providing respirations to the person has been phased out due to the risk of contracting infectious diseases from the affected person br When done by emergency medical personnel compressions followed by two breaths appear to be better than continuous chest compressions and breaths being given while compressions are ongoing For bystanders CPR that involves only chest compressions results in better outcomes as compared to standard CPR for those who have gone into cardiac arrest due to heart issues br br br Defibrillation br br Defibrillation is indicated if an electric shockable heart rhythm is present The two shockable rhythms are ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia These shockable rhythms have a likelihood of survival compared with a significantly lower rate less than in non shockable rhythms The non shockable rhythms include asystole and pulseless electrical activity br Ventricular fibrillation involves the ventricles of the heart lower chambers responsible for pumping blood rapidly contracting in an disorganized pattern and thereby limiting blood flow from the heart This can be due to uncoordinated electrical activity The electrocardiogram ECG generally shows irregular QRS complexes without P waves By contrast the ECG for ventricular tachycardia will generally show a wide complex QRS with more than beats occurring per minute If sustained ventricular tachycardia can also lead hemodynamic instability and compromise resulting in pulselessness and poor perfusion to vital organs br br A defibrillator will deliver an electrical current through a pair of electrodes placed on the person s chest This is thought to depolarize myocardial tissue thereby stopping the arrhythmia Defibrillators can deliver energy as monophasic or biphasic waveforms although biphasic defibrillators are the most common br For ventricular fibrillation defibrillation techniques may utilized either monophasic or biphasic waveforms Prior studies suggest that biphasic shock is more likely to produce successful defibrillation after a single shock however rate of survival is comparable between the methods br In out of hospital arrests the defibrillation is made by an automated external defibrillator AED a portable machine that can be used by any user The AED provides voice instructions that guide the process automatically checks the person s condition and applies the appropriate electric shocks Some defibrillators even provide feedback on the quality of CPR compressions encouraging the lay rescuer to press the person s chest hard enough to circulate blood br In addition there is increasing use of public access defibrillation This involves placing AEDs in public places and training staff in these areas on how to use them This allows defibrillation to occur prior to the arrival of emergency services which has been shown to increase chances of survival People who have cardiac arrests in remote locations have worse outcomes following cardiac arrest br Defibrillation is applied to certain arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia Defibrillation cannot be applied to asystole and CPR must be initiated first in this case Moreover defibrillation is different than synchronized cardioversion In synchronized cardioversion a similar approach is utilized in that electrical current is applied to correct an arrhythmia however this is used in cases where a pulse is present but the patient is hemodynamically unstable such as supraventricular tachycardia br Defibrillators may also be used as part of post cardiac arrest management These defibrillators include wearable defibrillator such as LifeVest subcutaneous cardiac defibrillator and implantable cardiac defibrillator br br br Medications br Medications recommended in the ACLS protocol include epinephrine amiodarone and lidocaine The timing and administration of these medications depends on the underlying arrhythmia of the arrest br Epinephrine acts on the alpha receptor which in turn increases the blood flow that supplies the heart Epinephrine in adults improves survival but does not appear to improve neurologically normal survival In ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia mg of epinephrine is given every minutes following an initial round of CPR and defibrillation Doses higher than mg of epinephrine are not recommended for routine use in cardiac arrest If the person has a non shockable rhythm such as asystole following an initial round of CPR mg of epinephrine should be given every minutes with the goal of obtaining a shockable rhythm br Amiodarone and lidocaine are anti arrhythmic medications Amiodarone is a class III anti arrhythmic Amiodarone may be used in cases of ventricular fibrillation pulseless ventricular tachycardia and wide complex tachycardia Lidocaine is a class Ib anti arrhythmic also used to manage acute arrhythmias Anti arrhythmic medications may be used after an unsuccessful defibrillation attempt However neither lidocaine nor amiodarone in those who continue in ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation despite defibrillation improves survival to hospital discharge despite both equally improving survival to hospital admission Following an additional round of CPR and defibrillation amiodarone can also be administered The first dose is given as a mg bolus The second dose is given as a mg bolus br br br Additional medications br Bicarbonate given as sodium bicarbonate works to stabilize acidosis and hyperkalemia both of which can contribute to and exacerbate cardiac arrest If acid base or electrolyte disturbance is evident bicarbonate may be used However if there is little suspicion that these imbalances are occurring and contributing to the arrest routine use of bicarbonate is not recommended as it does not provide additional benefit br Calcium given as calcium chloride works as an inotrope and vasopressor Calcium is used in specific circumstances such as electrolyte disturbances hyperkalemia and calcium channel blocker toxicity Overall calcium is not routinely used during cardiac arrest as it does not provide additional benefit compared to non use and may even cause harm poor neurologic outcomes br Vasopressin overall does not improve or worsen outcomes compared to epinephrine The combination of epinephrine vasopressin and methylprednisolone appears to improve outcomes br The use of atropine lidocaine and amiodarone have not been shown to improve survival from cardiac arrest br Atropine is used for symptomatic bradycardia It is given at a does of mg iv and additional mg iv doses can be given every minutes for a total of mg However the guidelines from the American Heart Association removed the recommendation for atropine use in pulseless electrical activity and asystole for lack of evidence supporting its use br br br Special considerations br Hemodialysis patients carry a greater risk of cardiac arrest events Multiple factors contribute including increased cardiovascular risk factors electrolyte disturbances calcium and potassium caused by accumulation and aggressive removal and acid base disturbances Calcium levels are considered a key factor contributing to cardiac arrests in this population br Tricyclic antidepressant TCA overdose can lead to cardiac arrest with typical ECG findings including wide QRS and prolonged QTc Treatment for this condition includes activated charcoal and sodium bicarbonate br Magnesium can be given at a does of g iv or oral bolus to manage torsades de points However without specific indication magnesium is not generally given in cardiac arrest In people with a confirmed pulmonary embolism as the cause of arrest thrombolytics may be of benefit Evidence for use of naloxone in those with cardiac arrest due to opioids is unclear but it may still be used In people with cardiac arrest due to a local anesthetic lipid emulsion may be used br br br Targeted temperature management br Current international guidelines suggest cooling adults after cardiac arrest using targeted temperature management TTM with the goal of improving neurological outcomes The process involves cooling for a hour period with a target temperature of C F followed by gradual rewarming over the next to hrs There are several methods used to lower the body temperature such as applying ice packs or cold water circulating pads directly to the body or infusing cold saline br The effectiveness of TTM after OHCA is an area of ongoing study Several recent reviews have found that patients treated with TTM have more favorable neurological outcomes However pre hospital TTM after OHCA has been shown to increase the risk of adverse outcomes The rates of re arrest may be higher in people who were treated with pre hospital TTM Moreover TTM may have adverse neurological effects in people who survive post cardiac arrest Osborn waves on ECG are frequent during TTM particularly in patients treated with C Osborn waves are not associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia and may be considered a benign physiological phenomenon associated with lower mortality in univariable analyses br br br Do not resuscitate br Some people choose to avoid aggressive measures at the end of life A do not resuscitate order DNR in the form of an advance health care directive makes it clear that in the event of cardiac arrest the person does not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation Other directives may be made to stipulate the desire for intubation in the event of respiratory failure or if comfort measures are all that are desired by stipulating that healthcare providers should allow natural death br br br Chain of survival br Several organizations promote the idea of a chain of survival The chain consists of the following links br br Early recognition If possible recognition of illness before the person develops a cardiac arrest will allow the rescuer to prevent its occurrence Early recognition that a cardiac arrest has occurred is key to survival for every minute a patient stays in cardiac arrest their chances of survival drop by roughly br Early CPR improves the flow of blood and of oxygen to vital organs an essential component of treating a cardiac arrest In particular by keeping the brain supplied with oxygenated blood the chances of neurological damage are decreased br Early defibrillation is effective for the management of ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia br Early advanced care br Early post resuscitation care which may include percutaneous coronary intervention br If one or more links in the chain are missing or delayed then the chances of survival drop significantly br These protocols are often initiated by a code blue which usually denotes impending or acute onset of cardiac arrest or respiratory failure br br br Other br Resuscitation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation devices has been attempted with better results for in hospital cardiac arrest survival than OHCA survival in populations selected to benefit most br Cardiac catheterization in those who have survived an OHCA appears to improve outcomes although high quality evidence is lacking It is recommended to be done as soon as possible in those who have had a cardiac arrest with ST elevation due to underlying heart problems br The precordial thump may be considered in those with witnessed monitored unstable ventricular tachycardia including pulseless VT if a defibrillator is not immediately ready for use but it should not delay CPR and shock delivery or be used in those with unwitnessed OHCA br br br Prognosis br The overall rate of survival among those who have OHCA is Among those who have an OHCA occur at home and their survival rate is For those who have an in hospital cardiac arrest IHCA the survival rate one year from at least the occurrence of cardiac arrest is estimated to be For IHCA survival to discharge is around Those who survive to return of spontaneous circulation and hospital admission frequently present with post cardiac arrest syndrome which usually presents with neurological injury that can range from mild memory problems to coma One year survival is estimated to be higher in people with cardiac admission diagnoses when compared to those with non cardiac admission diagnoses br A review found rates of survival to discharge of although different studies varied from to In those over the age of who have a cardiac arrest while in hospital survival to hospital discharge is less than How well these individuals manage after leaving the hospital is not clear br The global rate of people who were able to recover from OHCA after receiving CPR has been found to be approximately and the rate of survival to discharge from the hospital has been estimated at Survival to discharge from the hospital is more likely among people whose cardiac arrest was witnessed by a bystander or emergency medical services who received bystander CPR and who live in Europe and North America Relatively lower survival to hospital discharge rates have been observed in Asian countries br Prognosis is typically assessed hours or more after cardiac arrest Rates of survival are better in those who had someone witness their collapse received bystander CPR and or had either V fib or V tach when assessed Survival among those with V fib or V tach is to Women are more likely to survive cardiac arrest and leave the hospital than men Hypoxic ischemic brain injury is a concerning outcome for people suffering a cardiac arrest Most improvements in cognition occur during the first three months following cardiac arrest with some individuals reporting improvement up to one year post cardiac arrest of cardiac arrest survivors report fatigue as a symptom br br br Epidemiology br br br North America br The risk of cardiac arrest varies with geographical region age and gender The lifetime risk is three times greater in men than women based on analysis of the Framingham Heart Study This gender difference disappeared beyond years of age Around half of these individuals are younger than years of age br Based on death certificates sudden cardiac death accounts for about of all deaths in the United States In the United States approximately cases of out of hospital and cases of IHCA occur among adults annually which works out to be an incidence of approximately per adults per year br In the United States during pregnancy cardiac arrest occurs in about one in twelve thousand deliveries or per live births Rates are lower in Canada br br br Other regions br Non Western regions of the world have differing incidences The incidence of sudden cardiac death in China is per and in South India is per br br br Society and culture br br br Names br In many publications the stated or implicit meaning of sudden cardiac death is sudden death from cardiac causes Some physicians call cardiac arrest sudden cardiac death even if the person survives Thus one can hear mentions of prior episodes of sudden cardiac death in a living person br In the American Heart Association clarified that heart attack is often mistakenly used to describe cardiac arrest While a heart attack refers to death of heart muscle tissue as a result of blood supply loss cardiac arrest is caused when the heart s electrical system malfunctions Furthermore the American Heart Association explains that if corrective measures are not taken rapidly this condition progresses to sudden death Cardiac arrest should be used to signify an event as described above that is reversed usually by CPR and or defibrillation or cardioversion or cardiac pacing Sudden cardiac death should not be used to describe events that are not fatal br br br Slow code br A slow code is a slang term for the practice of deceptively delivering sub optimal CPR to a person in cardiac arrest when CPR is considered to have no medical benefit A show code is the practice of faking the response altogether for the sake of the person s family br Such practices are ethically controversial and are banned in some jurisdictions The European Resuscitation Council Guidelines released a statement in that clinicians are not suggested to participate take part in slow codes According to the American College of Physicians half hearted resuscitation efforts are deceptive and should not be performed by physicians or nurses br br br Children br In children the most common cause of cardiac arrest is shock or respiratory failure that has not been treated Cardiac arrhythmias are another possible cause Arrhythmias such as asystole or bradycardia are more likely in children in contrast to ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia as seen in adults br Additional causes of sudden unexplained cardiac arrest in children include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and coronary artery abnormalities In childhood hypertrophic cardiomyopathy previous adverse cardiac events non sustained ventricular tachycardia syncope and left ventricular hypertrophy have been shown to predict sudden cardiac death Other causes can include drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine or overdose of medications such as antidepressants br For management of pediatric cardiac arrest CPR should be initiated if suspected Guidelines provide algorithms for pediatric cardiac arrest management Recommended medications during pediatric resuscitation include epinephrine lidocaine and amiodarone However the use of sodium bicarbonate or calcium is not recommended The use of calcium in children has been associated with poor neurological function as well as decreased survival Correct dosing of medications in children is dependent on weight and to minimize time spent calculating medication doses the use of a Broselow tape is recommended br Rates of survival in children with cardiac arrest are to in North America br br br See also br Heart block br Arrhythmia br Angina br Chain of survival br Post cardiac arrest
