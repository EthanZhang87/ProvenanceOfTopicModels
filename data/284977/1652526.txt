Always on My Mind saw no completion until late Songwriter guitarist Wayne Carson had about two verses done with the working title You Were Always on My Mind He had been occupied in Memphis on a project that required him to stay ten days longer and he phoned his wife in Springfield Missouri to apologize for the delay She was angry and he replied Well I know I ve been gone a lot but I ve been thinking about you all the time This idea struck him as potential song material and he quickly ended the call so he could capture it on paper He brought the song back to the recording studio of Chips Moman and worked on it for a few days but it did not gel Carson asked for help from his colleague Johnny Christopher the two had already written the hit song No Love at All in and they composed more of it in Moman s office Feeling stuck they appealed for assistance from songwriter Mark James who was walking through the studio James was exhausted from non stop music projects but he ran through the song with Carson and Christopher By the fourth run through the song was finished br Music critic Robert Hilburn said that it was commonly thought in Nashville and Memphis that Elvis Presley s marital troubles were the inspiration of the song and that it was tailored to fit his musical style Fueling this conjecture was the fact that James had already written a hit song Suspicious Minds for Presley Carson responded that the song was not written for Presley but for every man He said that it was one long apology It s sort of like all guys who screw up and would love nothing better than to pick up the phone and call their wives and say Listen honey I could have done better but I want you to know that you were always on my mind br br br Elvis Presley version br br Elvis Presley recorded Always
