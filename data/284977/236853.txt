became a successful British brand in the s and s and was eventually replaced by the newly created EMI Records as part of a label consolidation This in turn was absorbed by the Parlophone Records unit

service of Edison phonographs and phonograph cylinders in Washington D C Maryland and Delaware It also made its own compatible cylinder recordings In Columbia began selling disc records invented and patented by Emile Berliner of the Victor Talking Machine Company and phonographs For a decade Columbia competed with both the Edison Phonograph Company cylinders and the Victor discs Edison discs and Columbia s acoustic records both had a nominal playback speed of rpm br From about until the US parent company managed a UK subsidiary the Columbia Graphophone Manufacturing Company Its headquarters and studios were established in Victorian warehouses at Clerkenwell Road shortly before the First World War and the buildings were a key location in the development of the British recording industry until the s In the Columbia Graphophone Company was registered as a British company with the shares being held by the American firm br A general market downturn in affected the whole entertainment industry Profits turned to losses and in late the creditors of the US parent company filed a petition for involuntary bankruptcy Columbia went into receivership Seeking to raise cash Columbia sold the British branch in December to a group of investors led by Columbia s General Manager in Britain the American born Louis Sterling br Columbia in the US emerged from receivership in February as the Columbia Phonograph Company Inc but was immediately faced with another crisis as booming radio sales reduced the firm s profitability The same year Bell Labs Western Electric had developed a new electrical recording system to replace the old acoustic recording methods and was offering exclusive rights to Victor although its Chairman s illness had led to delays Louis Sterling as Managing Director had turned around the fortunes of UK Columbia and persuaded Western Electric that granting a monopoly would be a grave mistake Columbia had been making test electrical recordings since at least August with the Western Electrical system Although the Columbia Phonograph Company of New York could not afford the royalty payments Sterling was in a position to buy out the US operation and as an American company to purchase the licence for the new Western Electric patents Satisfied with the progress of the test recordings in March Louis Sterling backed by J P Morgan Co acquired a controlling interest in the parent company Columbia US for million about in order to take advantage of Western Electric s patents The firm continued in business as the Columbia Graphophone Company in many countries as a British company Sterling originally from New York became chairman of the US operation br On February Columbia began recording with the licensed Western Electric recording process and was using it on a regular basis by April The royalty payments were considerable and in Columbia hired the English electronics engineer Alan Blumlein to work on an alternative By late he had developed a recording system including a moving coil microphone and a cutting head with linear characteristics which circumvented Western Electric s patents Columbia continued to use acoustic recording methods for the cheaper labels and to release discs made with old acoustic masters on the Harmony and Velvet Tone labels until around br The repercussions of the stock market Crash of led to huge losses in the recording industry and in March J P Morgan the major shareholder steered the Columbia Graphophone Company along with Odeon Records and Parlophone which it had owned since into a merger with the Gramophone Company HMV to form Electric and Musical Industries Ltd EMI By the time of the merger the Gramophone Company had not fully developed an alternative to Western Electric s process and was still paying royalty fees so it was a technically advantageous move br Since the Gramophone Company HMV was a wholly owned subsidiary of Victor and Columbia in America was a subsidiary of UK Columbia Victor now technically owned its largest rival in the US To avoid antitrust legislation EMI had to sell off its US Columbia operation which continued to release pressings of matrices made in the UK The American company was eventually absorbed by Columbia Broadcasting System CBS another of its former offshoots in br br br As an EMI label br EMI continued to operate the Columbia

continued to distribute American Columbia sister labels Okeh and Epic until when American Columbia s then parent CBS moved distribution of all its labels to the new CBS Records created from the purchase of Oriole Records UK in late The loss of American Columbia product had forced UK Columbia to groom its own talent such as Russ Conway John Barry Cliff Richard the Shadows Helen Shapiro Frank

its remaining interest in the Columbia name in to Sony Music Entertainment formerly CBS Records Group which already owned Columbia Records in the U S and Canada The formal reassignment of British registered trade marks from EMI including the magic notes logo took place in br For the Columbia Records trade mark in the UK and elsewhere Sony Music now prefers the walking eye logo previously used by the old CBS Records which is based on the Columbia Records logo introduced in the US and Canada in However the magic notes logo is occasionally used usually to give a retro feel such as on the vinyl reissues of Pink Floyd s Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets and on Bob Dylan s Time Out of Mind br The Columbia name was still on some EMI releases between and such as
