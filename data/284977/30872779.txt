Genoa Cricket and Football Club is an Italian professional football club based in Genoa Liguria The team competes in the Serie A the top division of the Italian football league system br Established in Genoa is Italy s oldest existent football team The club has won the Italian Championship nine times with their first being Italy s inaugural national championship in and their most recent coming after the season They also hold one Coppa Italia title Overall Genoa are the fourth most successful Italian club in terms of championships won Il Grifone have played their home games at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris since which they share with local rivals UC Sampdoria The fixture between the two teams known as the Derby della Lanterna was first contested in br In Genoa was included in the International Bureau of Cultural Capitals a sort of historical sporting heritage of humanity in line with that of UNESCO at the request of President Xavier Tudela The club was admitted to the Club of Pioneers an association comprising the world s oldest football clubs in other members include Sheffield F C and Recreativo de Huelva br br The club was founded on September as Genoa Cricket Athletic Club In its earliest years it principally competed in athletics and cricket Association football was only a secondary concern Since the club was set up to represent England abroad the original shirts worn by the organisation were white the same colour as the England national team shirt At first Italians were not permitted to join as it was a British sporting club abroad Genoa s activities took place in the north west of the city in the Campasso area at the Piazza d Armi The men who initially handled the management of the club were br br On April the footballing section of the club already in existence since became predominant thanks to James Richardson Spensley It was among the oldest in Italian football at the time only four other clubs all in Turin had been founded Italians were allowed to join and found a new ground in the form of Ponte Carrega br The first friendly match took place at home against a mixed team of Internazionale Torino and F B C Torinese Genoa lost Not long after Genoa recorded its first victory away against UPS Alessandria winning Friendly games also took place against various British sailors such as those from HMS Revenge br br Football in Italy stepped up a level with the creation of the Italian Football Federation and the Italian Football Championship Genoa competed in the first Italian Championship in at Velodrome Humbert I in Turin They defeated Ginnastica Torino in their first official game on May before winning the first championship later that day by beating Internazionale Torino after extra time br Genoa returned for the following season this time with a few changes the name of the club was altered to Genoa Cricket Football Club dropping the Athletic from its name A change in shirt colour was also in order as they changed to white and blue vertical stripes known in Italy as biancobl Genoa won their second title in a one day tournament which took place on April by beating Internazionale Torino for the second time On their way to winning their third consecutive title in they also beat local rivals Sampierdarenese a winning margin which would not be bettered by any team in the league until The final was secured with a win over F B C Torinese br The club strip was changed again in Genoa adopted its famous red navy halves and therefore became known as the rossobl these are the colours used even to this day as with many other Italian clubs such as Cagliari Bologna Crotone Cosenza and an endless list of minor clubs After a season of finishing runners up to Milan Cricket and Football Club things were back on track in with their fourth title Juventus emerged as serious contenders to Genoa s throne from onwards when for two seasons in a row Genoa beat the Old Lady in the national final br Notably Genoa became the first Italian football team to play an international match when they visited France on April to play FVC Nice winning the fixture As well as winning the Italian championship in the year was also notable for Genoa reserves winning the first ever II Categoria league season a proto Serie B under the top level From onwards when they were runners up Genoa lost their foothold on the Italian championship other clubs such as Juventus Milan and Pro Vercelli stepped up br The fall in part during this period can be traced back to when FIGC agreed to Federal Gymnastics protests forbidding the use of foreign players Since Genoa s birth they had always had a strong English contingent They disagreed as did several other prominent clubs such as Milan Torino and Firenze as thus they withdrew from official FIGC competitions that year The following season the federation reversed the decision and Genoa was rebuilt with players such as Luigi Ferraris and some from Switzerland such as Daniel Hug who came from FC Basel The rebuilding of the squad also saw the creation of a new ground in the Marassi area of Genoa when built it had a capacity of and was comparable to British stadiums of the time it was officially opened on January br br With the introduction of the Italy national football team Genoa played an important part with the likes of Renzo De Vecchi who was azzurri captain for some time Edoardo Mariani and Enrico Sardi earning call ups Englishman William Garbutt was brought in as head coach to help revive the club Garbutt was the first professional manager in Italy and was renowned for being highly charismatic and also for constantly smoking his tobacco pipe He was dubbed Mister by the players since then Italians have referred to coaches in general by the term br Finally by Genoa had restored themselves as the top club from Northern Italy winning the final round of the Northern section However this particular year the national final could not be played because of the outbreak of World War I the finals of the Southern Italian section could not be decided and thus Genoa did not have a team to play Genoa would be awarded the title in after the end of the war it would be their first for eleven seasons The war took a harsh toll on Genoa as players Luigi Ferraris Adolfo Gnecco Carlo Marassi Alberto Sussone and Claudio Casanova all died while on military duty in Italy while footballing founder James Richardson Spensley was killed in Germany br br In the early part of the next decade Genoa remained strong contenders in the Northern section Garbutt led Genoa to championship success in beating Lazio in the final over the course of two legs The following season Genoa made their way past Bologna in the Northern finals but not without controversy after riots in the second leg during the game in Bologna the game was called off and FIGC awarded Genoa a victory In the national final that season Genoa beat Savoia over the course of two legs this would be their ninth and to date final Italian championship br The squad during these two championship victories included Giovanni De Pr Ottavio Barbieri Luigi Burlando and Renzo De Vecchi With Genoa s championship victory in came the introduction of the scudetto patch which means following the season within which a club wins an Italian league championship they are allowed to wear a shield shaped patch on their shirt which features the colours of the Italian flag For the rest of the s the club s highest finish was in second place the season when Genoa finished runners up to Torino with striker Felice Levratto scoring goals in games br br Due to the strongly British connotations attached to the name Genoa were forced to change it by the fascist government to Genova Circolo del Calcio in The club competed in a proto European Cup in the form of the Mitropa Cup where they went out in the quarter finals after losing heavily to Rapid Vienna They followed this with a runners up position back at home in the league they finished behind Ambrosiana in the season this would be their last top level championship runners up spot to date br br The club s league form became highly erratic during the early s with varying league positions it was during the season that Genova suffered their first ever relegation to Serie B the second league of Italian football Thankfully for the club they were able to bounce back under the management of Vittorio Faroppa winning promotion by finishing top of their group ahead of Novara In the ambitious Juan Culiolo took over as chairman of the club in they achieved a th place finish and also won the Coppa Italia by beating Roma with a goal from Mario Torti br During the following season Genova finished in third place this was a particularly tight season with winners Ambrosiana Inter finishing only three points ahead of the club That summer Italy competed in the FIFA World Cup and won three Genova players formed part of the triumphant squad in the form of Sergio Bertoni Mario Genta and Mario Perazzolo The club finished the decade on a high maintaining a top five foothold in the top level of the Italian football league system br World War II affected dramatically the entire Italian football movement but Genova did not recover as well as other clubs In the club chose to revert their name to Genoa Cricket and Foot Ball Club the one which they had used in the very early days of the Italian championship In the years just after the war the club were still popular with the fans with people previously associated with the club such as Ottavio Barbieri and William Garbutt returning for managerial spells Genoa also had a new rival in the form of Sampdoria who were founded by a merger of Associazione Calcio Andrea Doria and Sampierdarenese in and would groundshare at Stadio Luigi Ferraris br br After the Second World War the ability of Genoa to finish in the upper ranks of Serie A declined in a significant manner throughout the rest of the s the club were middle table finishers The season saw three highly significant results Genoa beat Inter the famous Grande Torino side and Padova The s started in poor fashion for the club they had bought Argentine Mario Boy from Boca Juniors but he stayed only one season and the club were relegated after finishing bottom of the table but after two seasons they achieved their return after winning Serie B ahead of Legnano Ragnar Nikolay Larsen was a notable player for the club during this period and they sustained mid table finishes for the rest of the decade br Despite suffering a relegation in and then a promotion back up to Serie A in Genoa had a respectable amount of cup success in the first half of the s The club won the Coppa delle Alpi in it was the first time the competition had been competed between club teams instead of international ones the final was played at home while Genoa beat French club Grenoble Foot by with a goal from Nizza Genoa won the same competition again two years later the final was held at the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern Switzerland Genoa defeated Catania with both goals from Giampaolo Piaceri to take the trophy br br The celebrations for the club did not last long however as the year following their last cup success they were relegated down to Serie B again This time their stay in the second tier of the Italian football league system would be far longer than previous relegations the club was unstable as it changed manager each season Genoa even experienced their first relegation to Serie C in financially the club fell into difficulties and had several ownership changes br br Throughout the s Genoa would mostly play in the second tier Under the management of Arturo Silvestri the club made its way back to Serie A for the season but they were relegated straight back down For the return of Il Grifone to Serie A a couple of seasons later the squad featured the likes of Roberto Rosato Bruno Conti and a young Roberto Pruzzo This time they stuck it out in the top division for two seasons before succumbing to relegation in the relegation was particularly cruel as the side above them Fiorentina survived on goal difference of just a single goal the two teams had played each other on the final day of the season ending in a draw br br The relegation was bad for the club in more ways than one they lost some of their top players who could have offered them a swift return such as Roberto Pruzzo s move to Roma where he would go on to have great success After a couple of middle table finishes in Serie B Genoa earned promotion during the season under manager Luigi Simoni the club finished as runners up behind only AC Milan who had been relegated the previous season for their part in the Totonero betting scandal br Still with Simoni at the helm as manager Genoa were able to survive in Serie A for their returning season finishing just one point ahead of the relegated AC Milan In a dramatic last day of the season Genoa were trailing to Napoli with five minutes left until on the th minute Mario Faccenda scored the goal that secured the point needed by Genoa starting an owing friendship between the two club s fans br A couple of seasons later in Genoa would not be so lucky despite beating champions Juventus on the final day of the season the club were relegated even though they finished the season with the same number of points as surviving Lazio this was because Lazio had recorded better results in matches against Genoa br br The club was purchased by Calabrese entrepreneur Aldo Spinelli in and despite no longer having Simoni as manager Genoa were finishing in the top half of Serie B After a slip in form during failing to be promoted by a mere point in then having to struggle not to be retroceded the following season being spared that fate again by a mere point Genoa refocused their energy and were able to achieve promotion back into Serie A in finishing as champions ahead of Bari Genoa with an experienced trainer as Osvaldo Bagnoli who knew how to get the best out of underdog teams he managed to win a championship at the helm of Hellas Verona in the eighties and with a team sporting the talents of Carlos Aguilera and Tom Skuhrav among others achieved highs during the season where they finished fourth remaining undefeated at home for the entire campaign winning games against all the big sides including Juventus Inter Milan Roma Lazio Fiorentina Napoli as well as their local rivals Sampdoria who won the title that season br Subsequently the club gained entry to the UEFA Cup in the season Genoa had a good run making it to the semi finals before being knocked out by Ajax that season s winners of the competition notably Genoa did the double over Liverpool in the quarter finals becoming the first Italian side to beat the Reds at Anfield Unfortunately for Genoa this success was soon followed by a Dark Age following the departure of Osvaldo Bagnoli who chose to move away from Genoa to spend more time with his daughter whose health was rapidly declining and the failure of the management to replace key players as they grew old or were ceded to other teams Noted Genoa players during this period included Gianluca Signorini Carlos Aguilera Stefano Eranio Roberto Onorati and John van t Schip br Chairman Spinelli had a very different management approach from that of most businessmen turned football club owners br While his colleagues saw football as a marketing and public relation investment and were quite ready to siphon funds out of their main business to keep their teams afloat and replenish their player roster Spinelli saw Genoa as another business whose main aim was that of generating revenue for its owner namely himself and so was more than happy to sell esteemed players for hefty revenues of which just a minimal fraction was then re invested in the team often for the acquisition of lesser valued replacements or virtual unknowns Thus he proved all too eager to sell Uruguayan striker Carlos Aguilera and to replace him with the markedly inferior Kazuyoshi Miura from Japanese side Yomiuri Verdy a deal that especially pleased him since the Japanese sponsors were actually paying him to let Miura play in Serie A br The same season as their UEFA Cup run they finished just one place above the relegation zone in the seasons following Genoa remained in the lower half of the table br During the season Genoa were narrowly relegated they finished level on points with Padova after the normal season period This meant a relegation play out was to be played between the two in Florence The game was tied at full time and went to a penalty shoot out Genoa eventually lost the shoot out While back down in Serie B the club had another taste of international cup success when they became the final winners of the Anglo Italian Cup by beating Port Vale with Gennaro Ruotolo scoring a hat trick Chairman Spinelli sold Genoa in moving onto other clubs Alessandria and then Livorno The late s and early s would be the most trying time in the history of the club with constant managerial changes a poor financial situation and little hope of gaining promotion outside of a decent th place finish in From until Genoa had a total of three different owners and four different chairmen before the club was passed on to the toys and games tycoon from Irpinia Enrico Preziosi already chairman of Como a football club he previously owned br br Preziosi took over in when Genoa should have been relegated to C series after a dismal season but was instead saved along with Catania and Salernitana by the football federation s controversial decision to extend Serie B to teams Things started to look up for Genoa they won Serie B in However allegations were raised that the club had fixed a match on the last day of the season between themselves and Venezia The victory in the match saw Genoa win the league with a draw having been good enough to maintain its position in the end The Disciplinary Committee of FIGC saw fit to instead place Genoa bottom of the league and relegate them down to Serie C with a three point deduction on July br For their season in Serie C for Genoa were hit with a six point penalty from the previous season After leading for much of the season they eventually finished as runners up and were entered into the play offs beating Monza on aggregate to achieve promotion back into Serie B During the summer break Gian Piero Gasperini was brought in as the new manager he helped the club to gain promotion during the season it was ensured on the last day of the season where they drew a with Napoli both clubs were happily promoted back into Serie A br The season the first Serie A championship played by Genoa in years saw it finishing in a respectable tenth place right after the big ones of Italian football br A careful summer market session saw chairman Preziosi strengthening the core of the team while parting from some players on favourable economical terms for example selling striker Marco Borriello to AC Milan for a hefty sum Genoa s aims for the season were set on a UEFA Cup spot This was achieved after a strong season which saw the team finish th in Serie A besting traditional powerhouses like Juventus Roma and Milan and winning both Genoa derbies against Sampdoria with Diego Milito finishing among the top scorers of the championship Genoa subsequently lost Milito and midfielder Thiago Motta to Internazionale but were able to bring in striker Hern n Crespo Things however did not go as planned with the injury plagued team eliminated in the early stages of the Europa League and Coppa Italia and falling to a ninth place finish in Serie A in br In the season Genoa whose ranks had been revolutionised once again save for some long serving players struggled along in the mid positions of the league a slew of questionable results early in the season led chairman Preziosi to fire trainer Gian Piero Gasperini who had led the team since the season and to select Davide Ballardini as his successor The newcomers despite not securing memorable successes kept the team steadily afloat in the left part of the ranking managing to win two consecutive derby matches against rivals Sampdoria in December and May br The and seasons saw Genoa place in th both times one spot away from relegation to Serie B br In the season Genoa in sixth place and set to qualify for the UEFA Europa League qualifying round were denied a UEFA license because they filed paperwork late and because the Stadio Luigi Ferraris was not currently up to standard for UEFA competition The spot was passed on to th placed Sampdoria br This damaged Genoa s momentum and Genoa coasted to an th place finish in the season In Genoa avoided relegation in th place and once again finished mid table in the season In the season Genoa mathematically avoided relegation from Serie A They were tied on points with Empoli but Empoli went down due to Genoa s superior head to head record br In the season Genoa finished th in the league table to be relegated after fifteen years in top division In the season the club finished second in Serie B to promote back to Serie A after one season In the season Genoa Football Club maintains its position in Serie A and is not facing relegation The club continues to compete in Italy s top football league demonstrating resilience and determination to stay at the highest level of Italian football br br As of July br br Note Flags indicate

many managers and trainers some seasons they have had co managers running the team here is a chronological list of them from when they became a football club onwards br br As Genoa was a British run club the first ever colours were those of the England national football team Not long into the club s footballing history the kit was changed to white and blue stripes in the blue was chosen to represent the sea as Genoa is a port city In the club finally settled for their most famous red and blue halves shirt this gained them the nickname of rossobl br One of the nicknames of Genoa is Il Grifone which means the griffin this is derived from the coat of arms belonging to the city of Genoa The coat of arms features two golden griffins either side of the Saint George s Cross As well as being present on both the flag and coat of arms of the city of Genoa the cross is evocative of the club s English founders St George was also the patron saint of the former Republic of Genoa The actual club badge of Genoa Cricket and Football Club is heavily derived from the city coat of arms but also incorporated the club s red and blue colours br br Genoa CFC has the bulk of its fans in Liguria however they are also popular in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley The seafaring traditions of the Genoese and the presence of Genoese communities in distant countries did much to spread the appeal of Genoa some further than just Italy and immigrants founded fan clubs in Buenos Aires Amsterdam Tokyo Toronto New York San Francisco Barcelona Iceland and other places br br The most significant and traditional rivalry for Genoa is the inner city one with the club with whom they share a ground Sampdoria The two clubs compete together in the heated Derby della Lanterna Derby of the Lantern a reference to the Lighthouse of Genoa Genoa s supporters also have a strong distaste for AC Milan A clash between opposing supporters in January resulted in the death of Genoese Vincenzo Spagnolo who was stabbed to death by Milanese Simone Barbaglia The assailant was a member of an informal group of football hooligans dubbed The Barbour Ones who used to routinely carry bladed weapons to matches a practice made possible by the lax security measures of the time br Conversely the fans of Genoa have long standing friendships with Napoli which goes back to the last match of the season On the last day of the season Genoa and Napoli drew a practical ensuring both were promoted back into Serie A Genoa ultras could be seen holding up banners saying Benvenuto fratello napoletano meaning Welcome Neapolitan brother and the two sets of fans celebrated together in a warm and ever co operating manner br On the other hand the amicable relationship with the red and yellow supporters of Roma fostered by the cession of striker Roberto Pruzzo in and lasting for most of the s has in recent years cooled up a bit while another strong fraternity which saw Genoese football fans on friendly terms with Torino since the exchange of Gigi Meroni between the two clubs at the end of the season and his untimely death on October has perhaps broken down for good after the Torino Genoa match of season br Starved for points and risking a humiliating relegation one of many in a troubled recent history the Turinese fans expected a friendly treatment from Genoa which in the heat of a pitched battle with Fiorentina for the fourth place which could have won a Champions League spot for the team did not comply soundly beating Torino and to many effects sealing its fate When during early August Genoa scheduled a friendly match with Nice in southern Piedmont many Turinese hooligans travelled to the match location with the precise intention of starting trouble and disorder to get even with Genoa and its fans br br On September it was announced that Genoa had been acquired by Partners a US based private investment firm founded by Steven W Pasko and Josh Wander While terms were not publicly released sources close to the deal revealed that the team was acquired for its enterprise value of million Despite being relegated to Serie B in their very first season under Partners ownership Genoa
