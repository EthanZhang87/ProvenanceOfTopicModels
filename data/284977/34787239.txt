br The Recording Industry Association of America RIAA began to certify gold albums and singles in and Elvis Presley s first RIAA award a gold single for Hard Headed Woman was certified on August In August he was awarded with gold platinum and multi platinum albums and singles the largest presentation of gold and platinum record awards in history According to Presley s record label RCA he is the best selling artist of all time with sales over billion records worldwide in all formats million in the United States alone br The RIAA does not certify sales of less than units for albums and singles Elvis has had numerous albums and singles which have sold hundreds of thousands of units each but have not reached the threshold Taken together these could add up to millions in total sales that are not recognized by the RIAA br RIAA sales certifications are not automatic The record company must pay a fee and request an audit from the RIAA in order to certify sales During Elvis life RCA submitted few of Elvis recordings for RIAA certification Instead of paying for RIAA certification RCA and other companies would simply award their own Gold Record to artists based on their internal sales figures As a consequence some of Elvis early sales information has been lost RCA and BMG have researched archives and old files in an effort to reconstruct Elvis sales figures This has led to Elvis receiving numerous RIAA certifications posthumously br br br Notes br br br See also br List of songs recorded by Elvis Presley br Elvis Presley albums discography br br br br br br Further reading br
