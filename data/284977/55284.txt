A coat of arms is a heraldic visual design on an escutcheon i e shield surcoat or tabard the last two being outer garments The coat of arms on an escutcheon forms the central element of the full heraldic achievement which in its whole consists of a shield supporters a crest and a motto A coat of arms is traditionally unique to the armiger e g an individual person family state organization school or corporation The term coat of arms itself describing in modern times just the heraldic design originates from the description of the entire medieval chainmail surcoat garment used in combat or preparation for the latter br Rolls of arms are collections of many coats of arms and since the early Modern Age centuries they have been a source of information for public showing and tracing the membership of a noble family and therefore its genealogy across time br br br History br br Heraldic designs came into general use among European nobility in the th century br Systematic heritable heraldry had developed by the beginning of the th century br Exactly who had a right to use arms by law or social convention varied to some degree between countries br Early heraldic designs were personal used by individual noblemen who might also alter their chosen design over time br Arms become hereditary by the end of the th century in England by King Richard I during the Third Crusade br Burgher arms were used in Northern Italy in the second half of the th century and in the Holy Roman Empire br by the mid th century br In the late medieval period use of arms spread to the clergy to towns as civic identifiers and to royally chartered organizations such as universities and trading companies br The arts of vexillology and heraldry are closely related br The term coat of arms itself in origin refers to the surcoat with heraldic designs worn by combatants especially in the knightly tournament in Old French cote a armer The sense is transferred to the heraldic design itself in Middle English in the mid th century br Despite no common enforceable widespread regulation heraldry has remained consistent across Europe where tradition alone has governed the design and use of arms Some nations such as England and Scotland still maintain the same heraldic authorities which have traditionally granted and regulated arms for centuries and continue to do so in the present day In England for example the granting of arms is and has been controlled by the College of Arms Unlike seals and other general emblems heraldic achievements have a formal description called a blazon which uses vocabulary that allows for consistency in heraldic depictions In the present day coats of arms are still in use by a variety of institutions and individuals for example many European cities and universities have guidelines on how their coats of arms may be used and protect their use as trademarks as any other unique identifier might be Many societies exist that also aid in the design and registration of personal arms br br Heraldry has been compared to modern corporate logos br br br Regional traditions br br br French heraldry br br The French system of heraldry greatly influenced the British and Western European systems Much of the terminology and classifications are taken from it However with the fall of the French monarchy and later Empire there is not currently a Fons Honorum power to dispense and control honors to strictly enforce heraldic law The French Republics that followed have either merely affirmed pre existing titles and honors or vigorously opposed noble privilege Coats of arms are considered an intellectual property of a family or municipal body Assumed arms arms invented and used by the holder rather than granted by an authority are considered valid unless they can be proved in court to copy that of an earlier holder br br br British heraldry br br In the heraldic traditions of England and Scotland an individual rather than a family had a coat of arms In those traditions coats of arms are legal property transmitted from father to son wives and daughters could also bear arms modified to indicate their relation to the current holder of the arms Undifferenced arms are used only by one person at any given time Other descendants of the original bearer could bear the ancestral arms only with some difference usually a colour change or the addition of a distinguishing charge One such charge is the label which in British usage outside the Royal Family is now always the mark of an heir apparent or in Scotland an heir presumptive Because of their importance in identification particularly in seals on legal documents the use of arms was strictly regulated few countries continue in this today This has been carried out by heralds and the study of coats of arms is therefore called heraldry In time the use of arms spread from military entities to educational institutes and other establishments br In Scotland the Lord Lyon King of Arms has criminal jurisdiction to control the use of arms In England Northern Ireland and Wales the use of arms is a matter of civil law and regulated by the College of Arms and the High Court of Chivalry br In reference to a dispute over the exercise of authority over the Officers of Arms in England Arthur Annesley st Earl of Anglesey Lord Privy Seal declared on June that the powers of the Earl Marshal were to order judge and determine all matters touching arms ensigns of nobility honour and chivalry to make laws ordinances and statutes for the good government of the Officers of Arms to nominate Officers to fill vacancies in the College of Arms to punish and correct Officers of Arms for misbehaviour in the execution of their places It was further declared that no patents of arms or any ensigns of nobility should be granted and no augmentation alteration or addition should be made to arms without the consent of the Earl Marshal br br br Irish heraldry br br In Ireland the usage and granting of coats of arms was strictly regulated by the Ulster King of Arms from the office s creation in After Irish independence in the office was still functioning and working out of Dublin

Sadleir the Deputy Ulster King of Arms then became the Acting Ulster King of Arms He served until the office was merged with that of Norroy King of Arms in and stayed on until to clear up the backlog An earlier Ireland King of Arms was created by King Richard II in and discontinued by King Henry VII in It did not grant many coats of arms the few it did grant were annulled by the other Kings of Arms because they encroached upon their jurisdictions Its purpose was supposedly to marshal an expedition to fully conquer Ireland that never materialized Since April the authority has been split between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland Heraldry in the Republic of Ireland is regulated by the Government of Ireland by the Genealogical Office through the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland Heraldry in Northern Ireland is regulated by the British Government by the College of Arms through the Norroy and Ulster King of Arms br br br German heraldry br br The heraldic tradition and style of modern and historic Germany and the Holy Roman Empire including national and civic arms noble and burgher arms ecclesiastical heraldry heraldic displays and heraldic descriptions stand in contrast to Gallo British Latin and Eastern heraldry and strongly influenced the styles and customs of heraldry in the Nordic countries which developed comparatively late br br br Scandinavian heraldry br In the Nordic countries provinces regions cities and municipalities have coats of arms These are posted at the borders and on buildings containing official offices as well as used in official documents and on the uniforms of municipal officers Arms may also be used on souvenirs or other effects given that an application has been granted by the municipal council br br br Other national traditions br br At a national level coats of arms were generally retained by European states with constitutional continuity of more than a few centuries including constitutional monarchies like Denmark as well as old republics like San Marino and Switzerland br In Italy the use of coats of arms was only loosely regulated by the states existing before the unification of Since the Consulta Araldica the college of arms of the Kingdom of Italy was abolished in personal coats of arms and titles of nobility though not outlawed are not recognised br Coats of arms in Spain were generally left up to the owner themselves but the design was based on military service and the heritage of their grandparents In France the coat of arms is based on the Fleur de lys and the Rule of

the armorial bearings were adopted by the Continental Congress on June and is a shield divided palewise into thirteen pieces with a blue chief which is displayed upon the breast of an American bald eagle The crest is thirteen stars breaking through a glory and clouds displayed with no helm torse or mantling unlike most European precedents Only a few of the American states have adopted a coat of arms which is usually designed as part of the respective state s seal Vermont has both a state seal and a state coat of arms that are independent of one another though both contain a pine tree a cow and sheaves of grain the seal is used to authenticate documents whilst the heraldic device represents the state itself br br br Ecclesiastic heraldry br br The Vatican City State and the Holy See each have their own coat of arms As the papacy is not hereditary its occupants display their personal arms combined with those of their office Some popes came from armigerous noble families others adopted coats of arms during their career in the Church The latter typically allude to their ideal of life or to specific pontifical programmes A well known and widely displayed example in recent times was Pope John Paul II s arms His selection of a large letter M for the Virgin Mary was intended to express the message of his strong Marian devotion Roman Catholic dioceses are also each assigned a coat of arms as are basilicas or papal churches the latter usually displaying these on the building These may be used in countries which otherwise do not use heraldic devices In countries like Scotland with a strong statutory heraldic authority arms will need to be officially granted and recorded br br br Flags and banners br br Flags are used to identify ships where they are called ensigns embassies and such and they use the same colors and designs found in heraldry but they are not usually considered to be heraldic A country may have both a national flag and a national coat of arms and

gold or field br br br Modern national emblems br br Among the states ruled by communist regimes emblems resembling those of the Soviet states were adopted in all the Warsaw Pact states except
