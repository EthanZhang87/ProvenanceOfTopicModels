Baroque pop sometimes called baroque rock is a fusion genre that combines rock music with particular elements of classical music It emerged in the mid s as artists pursued a majestic orchestral sound and is identifiable for its appropriation of Baroque compositional styles contrapuntal melodies and functional harmony patterns and dramatic or melancholic gestures Harpsichords figure prominently while oboes French horns and string quartets are also common br Although harpsichords had been deployed for a number of pop hits since the s some record producers in the s increasingly placed the instrument in the foreground of their arrangements Inspired partly by the Beatles song In My Life various groups were incorporating baroque and classical instrumentation by early The term baroque rock was coined in promotional material for the Left Banke who used harpsichords and violins in their arrangements and whose song Walk Away Ren e exemplified the style br Baroque pop s mainstream popularity faded by the s partially because punk rock disco and hard rock took over nonetheless music was still produced within the genre s tradition Philadelphia soul in the s and chamber pop in the s both reflected the spirit of baroque pop while the latter incorporated much of the period s low fidelity musical aesthetic br br br Characteristics br br In classical music the term Baroque is used to describe the art music of Europe approximately between the years and with some of its most prominent composers including J S Bach and Antonio Vivaldi Much of the instrumentation of baroque pop is akin to that of the late Baroque period or the early Classical period chronologically defined as the period of European music from to and stylistically defined by balanced phrases clarity and beauty br Baroque pop stylistically fuses elements of rock with classical music often incorporating layered harmonies strings and horns to achieve a majestic orchestral sound Its prominent characteristics are the use of contrapuntal melodies and functional harmony patterns It was intended to be a more serious and mature outgrowth of rock music Journalist Bob Stanley uses the term English baroque to describe a subset that existed between and after the genre s more widespread presence in rock and pop Baroque rock may be invoked as a synonym of baroque pop or as its own distinct term br br br History br br br Precursors early s br The Boston Globe s Matthew Guerrieri credits the origins of baroque pop to American pop musicians and record producers like Phil Spector and the Beach Boys Brian Wilson placing the harpsichord in the foreground of their arrangements Harpsichords were widely available in recording studios and had been used in popular music since as early as the s but the instrument did not gain prominence until the s One of the first pop rock hits to use a harpsichord was the Jamies Summertime Summertime Later examples cited by Guerrieri range from the Beach Boys I Get Around and When I Grow Up To Be a Man to the Righteous Brothers You ve Lost That Lovin Feelin and the Mamas the Papas Monday Monday Guerrieri speculates that the harpsichord may have been desirable for its buzzing stinging timbre which suited the treble heavy pop soundscape of the time br The single She s Not There by the English band the Zombies marked a starting point for baroque pop according to Stanley He writes that the song didn t feature any oboes but stuck out rather dramatically in the year of You Really Got Me and Little Red Rooster that its arrangement was comparably restrained and almost medieval and that its refined qualities were emphasised by singer Colin Blunstone having an enunciation that was pure St Albans grammar br br Along with Burt Bacharach Spector melded pop music with classical elements before they were combined with rock Music historian Andrew Grant Jackson states that the era of baroque pop in which rock melded with classical elements began with the Rolling Stones Play with Fire February and Brian Wilson s work on The Beach Boys Today March In Jackson s view baroque pop and chamber pop were one and the same Slate s Forrest Wickman credits the Beatles producer George Martin along with Paul McCartney and Wilson as some of the men most responsible for the move into baroque pop br Author Bernard Gendron says that further to American composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein s public approval of the band s music the Beatles were feted in the art music world in the summer of through the arrival of Beatles la Baroque or more generically baroque rock He also writes that since this phenomenon preceded the release of Beatles recordings such as Yesterday which used a classical string quartet it is likely that the band did not instigate the link between their music and its classical components but were in fact responding to classical and baroque readings of their work These readings also included the album The Baroque Beatles Book where their songs were reimagined in a tongue in cheek Baroque setting br A classically trained musician Martin played what sounded like a baroque harpsichord solo on the Beatles In My Life released on their December album Rubber Soul Author Joe Harrington comments that due to the Beatles influence in all areas of pop music s development In My Life led to the arrival of baroque rock Producer Tommy LiPuma recalled that Once the Beatles featured that harpsichord sound on In My Life pop producers began working it in br br br Emergence mid to late s br br The genre originated in the United Kingdom and the United States By early further to Rubber Soul various groups began using baroque and classical instrumentation described as a baroque rock movement by Gendron Among these recordings was the Rolling Stones Lady Jane The popularity of harpsichords in pop rock and soul arrangements at this time reflected a desire for unusual sounds and in the case of many American producers a sought for association with the retrospective focus that informed London s fashion scene and the psychedelic music scene there br br The Zombies She s Not There together with a predilection for all things British through the Beatles international success inspired New York musician Michael Brown to form the Left Banke Stanley considers the band s Walk Away Ren e to be the first recognizable baroque pop single Baroque rock was the label devised by the Left Banke s publicists and the music press According to music critic Richie Unterberger the sobriquet may have been ham fisted but certainly there were many Baroque elements in the Left Banke s pop the stately arrangements the brilliant use of keyboards and harpsichords the soaring violins and the beautiful group harmonies The band s follow up single Pretty Ballerina continued their absorption in the genre Guitarist Rick Brand later described their lyrics as rather self consciously beautiful musical whimsy as you find in the latter th century Romantic music pre Beethoven br Although the Beach Boys Pet Sounds has been advanced in later years as baroque pop or even the first example of the genre no contemporary press material referred to the album as baroque and instead commentators focused on the album s progressive traits The album s baroque pop aesthetics were limited to one track God Only Knows a song that The Record s Jim Beckerman deemed baroque rock in the same retro instrumentation and elegant harmonies vein as the Beatles Eleanor Rigby and Procol Harum s A Whiter Shade of Pale br Gendron s baroque rock examples include Walk Away Ren e with Spanky and Our Gang s Sunday Will Never Be the Same and the Stone Poneys Different Drum all of which used harpsichord and strings and the Rolling Stones Lady Jane harpsichord and dulcimer and the Lovin Spoonful s Rain on the Roof harpsichord sounding guitars Music journalist Steve Smith highlights the Moody Blues and Procol Harum as major practitioners of baroque pop He recognizes For No One She s Leaving Home and Piggies as other examples of the Beatles forays in the genre and Ride On Baby and Ruby Tuesday as further examples of the Rolling Stones baroque pop br According to Stanley the period of sustained commercial success for pop and rock recordings with harpsichords and string quartets climaxed with the Beatles album Sgt Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band which mixed everyday lyrics with music hall and Edwardiana to create lysergically enhanced parlour music At this time the development in musical arrangements presented by baroque pop was challenged by the breakthrough of psychedelic rock bands from the San Francisco scene In a climate equally informed by political radicalism in Stanley writes English baroque continued as a combined simulacrum of the Zombies album Odessey and Oracle McCartney s contributions to The Beatles Honeybus single I Can t Let Maggie Go Scott Walker s chamber pop and Crosby Stills Nash vocal harmonies English baroque survived into the early s as record labels sought to capitalize on the singer songwriter phenomenon by offering lavish string arrangements to unknowns Among these
