in Newark New Jersey The two never met br Bates wrote the words as a poem originally titled Pikes Peak It was first published in the Fourth of July edition of the church periodical The Congregationalist At that time the poem was titled America br Ward had initially composed the song s melody in to accompany lyrics to Materna basis of the hymn O Mother dear Jerusalem though the hymn was not first published until The combination of Ward s melody and Bates s poem was first entitled America the Beautiful in The song is one of the most popular of the many American patriotic songs br br br History br br In at the age of Bates an English professor at Wellesley College had taken a train trip to Colorado Springs Colorado to teach at Colorado College Several of the sights on her trip inspired her and they found their way into her poem including the World s Columbian Exposition in Chicago the White City with its promise of the future contained within its gleaming white buildings the wheat fields of North America s heartland Kansas through which her train was riding on July and the majestic view of the Great Plains from high atop Pikes Peak br On the pinnacle of that mountain the words of the poem started to come to her and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original Antlers Hotel The poem was initially published two years later in The Congregationalist to commemorate the Fourth of July It quickly caught the public s fancy An amended version was published in br br The first known melody written for the song was sent in by Silas Pratt when the poem was published in The Congregationalist By at least different melodies had been written A hymn tune composed in by Samuel A Ward the organist and choir director at Grace Church Newark was generally considered the best music as early as and is still the popular tune today Just as Bates had been inspired to write her poem Ward too was inspired The tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from Coney Island back to his home in New York City after a leisurely summer day and he immediately wrote it down He composed the tune for the old hymn O Mother Dear Jerusalem retitling the work Materna Ward s music combined with Bates s poem were first published together in and titled America the Beautiful br Ward died in not knowing the national stature his music would attain The song s popularity was well established by the time of Bates s death in It is included in songbooks in many religious congregations in the United States br At various times in the more than one hundred years that have elapsed since the song was written particularly during the John F Kennedy administration there have been efforts to give America the Beautiful legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to or in place of The Star Spangled Banner but so far this has not succeeded Proponents prefer America the Beautiful for various reasons saying it is easier to sing more melodic and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as The Star Spangled Banner Some prefer America the Beautiful over The Star Spangled Banner due to the latter s war oriented imagery while others object to the implicit support of slavery and racism in its third verse others prefer The Star Spangled Banner because of its war themes While that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem America the Beautiful continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of Americans and was even being considered before as a candidate to become the national anthem of the United States br br br Lyrics br br br Notable performances br br Elvis Presley performed it many times in concerts starting
