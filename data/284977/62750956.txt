id: 62750956
The COVID pandemic also known as the coronavirus pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV began with an outbreak of COVID in Wuhan China in December It spread to other areas of Asia and then worldwide in early The World Health Organization WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern PHEIC on January and assessed the outbreak had become a pandemic on March br COVID symptoms range from asymptomatic to deadly but most commonly include fever sore throat nocturnal cough and fatigue Transmission of the virus is often through airborne particles Mutations have produced many strains variants with varying degrees of infectivity and virulence COVID vaccines were developed rapidly and deployed to the general public beginning in December made available through government and international programs such as COVAX aiming to provide vaccine equity Treatments include novel antiviral drugs and symptom control Common mitigation measures during the public health emergency included travel restrictions lockdowns business restrictions and closures workplace hazard controls mask mandates quarantines testing systems and contact tracing of the infected br The pandemic caused severe social and economic disruption around the world including the largest global recession since the Great Depression Widespread supply shortages including food shortages were caused by supply chain disruptions and panic buying Reduced human activity led to an unprecedented temporary decrease in pollution Educational institutions and public areas were partially or fully closed in many jurisdictions and many events were cancelled or postponed during and Telework became much more common for white collar workers as the pandemic evolved Misinformation circulated through social media and mass media and political tensions intensified The pandemic raised issues of racial and geographic discrimination health equity and the balance between public health imperatives and individual rights br The WHO ended the PHEIC for COVID on May The disease has continued to circulate but as of experts were uncertain as to whether it was still a pandemic Pandemics and their ends are not well defined and whether or not one has ended differs according to the definition used As of July COVID has caused confirmed deaths The COVID pandemic ranks as the fifth deadliest pandemic or epidemic in history br br br Terminology br br br Pandemic br In epidemiology a pandemic is defined as an epidemic occurring over a very wide area crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people During the COVID pandemic as with other pandemics the meaning of this term has been challenged br The end of a pandemic or other epidemic only rarely involves the total disappearance of a disease and historically much less attention has been given to defining the ends of epidemics than their beginnings The ends of particular epidemics have been defined in a variety of ways differing according to academic field and differently based on location and social group An epidemic s end can be considered a social phenomenon not just a biological one This means that it is possible for the pandemic to have ended according to one definition e g according to a definition based on how people behave and still be ongoing according to another definition e g according to a definition based on the number of infections br br br Virus names br During the initial outbreak in Wuhan the virus and disease were commonly referred to as coronavirus Wuhan coronavirus the coronavirus outbreak and the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak with the disease sometimes called Wuhan pneumonia In January the WHO recommended nCoV and nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease per international guidelines against using geographical locations e g Wuhan China animal species or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma WHO finalized the official names COVID and SARS CoV on February Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained CO for corona VI for virus D for disease and for when the outbreak was first identified December WHO additionally uses the COVID virus and the virus responsible for COVID in public communications br WHO named variants of concern and variants of interest using Greek letters The initial practice of naming them according to where the variants were identified e g Delta began as the Indian variant is no longer common A more systematic naming scheme reflects the variant s PANGO lineage e g Omicron s lineage is B and is used for other variants br br br Epidemiology br br br Background br br SARS CoV is a virus closely related to bat coronaviruses pangolin coronaviruses and SARS CoV The first known outbreak the COVID outbreak in mainland China started in Wuhan Hubei China in December Many early cases were linked to people who had visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market there but it is possible that human to human transmission began earlier Molecular clock analysis suggests that the first cases were likely to have been between October and November br The scientific consensus is that the virus is most likely of a zoonotic origin from bats or another closely related mammal While other explanations such as speculations that SARS CoV was accidentally released from a laboratory have been proposed as of these were not supported by evidence br br br Cases br br Official case counts refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols whether or not they experienced symptomatic disease Due to the effect of sampling bias studies which obtain a more accurate number by extrapolating from a random sample have consistently found that total infections considerably exceed the reported case counts Many countries early on had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms The strongest risk factors for severe illness are obesity complications of diabetes anxiety disorders and the total number of conditions br During the start of the COVID pandemic it was not clear whether young people were less likely to be infected or less likely to develop symptoms and be tested A retrospective cohort study in China found that children and adults were just as likely to be infected br Among more thorough studies preliminary results from April found that in Gangelt the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany percent of a population sample tested positive for antibodies Screening for COVID in pregnant women in New York City and blood donors in the Netherlands found rates of positive antibody tests that indicated more infections than reported Seroprevalence based estimates are conservative as some studies show that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies br Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number R for COVID in January were between and but a subsequent analysis claimed that it may be about with a percent confidence interval of to br In December the number of cases continued to climb due to several factors including new COVID variants As of that December individuals worldwide had been confirmed as infected As of April over million cases were confirmed globally Most cases are unconfirmed with the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimating the true number of cases as of early to be in the billions br br br Deaths br br As of March more than million deaths had been attributed to COVID The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January These numbers vary by region and over time influenced by testing volume healthcare system quality treatment options government response time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age sex and overall health br Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality Official death counts typically include people who died after testing positive Such counts exclude deaths without a test Conversely deaths of people who died from underlying conditions following a positive test may be included Countries such as Belgium include deaths from suspected cases including those without a test thereby increasing counts br Official death counts have been claimed to underreport the actual death toll because excess mortality the number of deaths in a period compared to a long term average data show an increase in deaths that is not explained by COVID deaths alone Using such data estimates of the true number of deaths from COVID worldwide have included a range from to million million by November by The Economist as well as over million by April by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and million earlier deaths between January and December by a comprehensive international study Such deaths include deaths due to healthcare capacity constraints and priorities as well as reluctance to seek care to avoid possible infection Further research may help distinguish the proportions directly caused by COVID from those caused by indirect consequences of the pandemic br In May the WHO estimated the number of excess deaths by the end of to be million compared to million reported COVID deaths with the majority of the unreported million deaths believed to be direct deaths due the virus rather than indirect deaths Some deaths were because people with other conditions could not access medical services br A December WHO study estimated excess deaths from the pandemic during and again concluding million excess early deaths occurred reaffirming and detailing their prior calculations from May as well as updating them addressing criticisms These numbers do not include measures like years of potential life lost and may make the pandemic s leading cause of death br The time between symptom onset and death ranges from to days typically about days Mortality rates increase as a function of age People at the greatest mortality risk are the elderly and those with underlying conditions br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br br Infection fatality ratio IFR br br The infection fatality ratio IFR is the cumulative number of deaths attributed to the disease divided by the cumulative number of infected individuals including asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections and excluding vaccinated infected individuals It is expressed in percentage points Other studies refer to this metric as the infection fatality risk br In November a review article in Nature reported estimates of population weighted IFRs for various countries excluding deaths in elderly care facilities and found a median range of to IFRs rise as a function of age from at age and at age to at age at age at age and at age These rates vary by a factor of across the age groups For comparison the IFR for middle aged adults is two orders of magnitude higher than the annualised risk of a fatal automobile accident and much higher than the risk of dying from seasonal influenza br In December a systematic review and meta analysis estimated that population weighted IFR was to in some countries France Netherlands New Zealand and Portugal to in other countries Australia England Lithuania and Spain and about in Italy This study reported that most of the differences reflected corresponding differences in the population s age structure and the age specific pattern of infections There have also been reviews that have compared the fatality rate of this pandemic with prior pandemics such as MERS CoV br For comparison the infection mortality rate of seasonal flu in the United States is which is times lower than COVID br br br Case fatality ratio CFR br Another metric in assessing death rate is the case fatality ratio CFR which is the ratio of deaths to diagnoses This metric can be misleading because of the delay between symptom onset and death and because testing focuses on symptomatic individuals br Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics the global CFR is percent deaths for cases as of March The number varies by region and has generally declined over time br br br Disease br br br Variants br br Several variants have been named by WHO and labelled as a variant of concern VoC or a variant of interest VoI Many of these variants have shared the more infectious D G As of May the WHO had downgraded all variants of concern to previously circulating as these were no longer detected in new infections Sub lineages of the Omicron variant BA BA were considered separate VoCs by the WHO until they were downgraded in March as no longer widely circulating br br br Signs and symptoms br br Symptoms of COVID are variable ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness Common symptoms include headache loss of smell and taste nasal congestion and runny nose cough muscle pain sore throat fever diarrhoea and breathing difficulties People with the same infection may have different symptoms and their symptoms may change over time Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified one respiratory symptom cluster with cough sputum shortness of breath and fever a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain headache and fatigue a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain vomiting and diarrhoea In people without prior ear nose and throat disorders loss of taste combined with loss of smell is associated with COVID and is reported in as many as of cases br br br Transmission br br The disease is mainly transmitted via the respiratory route when people inhale droplets and small airborne particles that form an aerosol that infected people exhale as they breathe talk cough sneeze or sing Infected people are more likely to transmit COVID when they are physically close to other non infected individuals However infection can occur over longer distances particularly indoors br br br Cause br br SARS CoV belongs to the broad family of viruses known as coronaviruses It is a positive sense single stranded RNA ssRNA virus with a single linear RNA segment Coronaviruses infect humans other mammals including livestock and companion animals and avian species br Human coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS fatality rate SARS CoV is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people after E NL OC HKU MERS CoV and the original SARS CoV br br br Diagnosis br br The standard method of testing for presence of SARS CoV is a nucleic acid test which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab however a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease br br br Prevention br br Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated staying at home or spending more time outdoors avoiding crowded places keeping distance from others wearing a mask in public ventilating indoor spaces managing potential exposure durations washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes nose or mouth with unwashed hands br Those diagnosed with COVID or who believe they may be infected are advised by healthcare authorities to stay home except to get medical care call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider s office and when in any room or vehicle with another person cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items br br br Vaccines br br A COVID vaccine is intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV the virus that causes coronavirus disease COVID Prior to the COVID pandemic an established body of knowledge existed about the structure and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS This knowledge accelerated the development of various vaccine platforms during early The initial focus of SARS CoV vaccines was on preventing symptomatic and severe illness The COVID vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the severity and death caused by COVID br As of March more than billion people had received one or more doses billion in total in over countries The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine was the most widely used According to a June study COVID vaccines prevented an additional million to million deaths in countries and territories from December to December br On November the first recombinant protein based COVID vaccine Novavax s booster Nuvaxovid was authorized for use in adults in the United Kingdom It has subsequently received endorsement authorization from the WHO US European Union and Australia br On November the WHO released its Global Vaccine Market Report The report indicated that inequitable distribution is not unique to COVID vaccines countries that are not economically strong struggle to obtain vaccines br On November the first inhalable vaccine was introduced developed by Chinese biopharmaceutical company CanSino Biologics in the city of Shanghai China br br br Treatment br br For the first two years of the pandemic no specific and effective treatment or cure was available In the European Medicines Agency s EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use CHMP approved the oral antiviral protease inhibitor Paxlovid nirmatrelvir plus the HIV antiviral ritonavir to treat adult patients FDA later gave it an EUA br Most cases of COVID are mild In these supportive care includes medication such as paracetamol or NSAIDs to relieve symptoms fever body aches cough adequate intake of oral fluids and rest Good personal hygiene and a healthy diet are also recommended br Supportive care in severe cases includes treatment to relieve symptoms fluid therapy oxygen support and prone positioning and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs More severe cases may need treatment in hospital In those with low oxygen levels use of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone is recommended to reduce mortality Noninvasive ventilation and ultimately admission to an intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation may be required to support breathing Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure br Existing drugs such as hydroxychloroquine lopinavir ritonavir and ivermectin are not recommended by US or European health authorities as there is no good evidence they have any useful effect The antiviral remdesivir is available in the US Canada Australia and several other countries with varying restrictions however it is not recommended for use with mechanical ventilation and is discouraged altogether by the World Health Organization WHO due to limited evidence of its efficacy br br br Prognosis br br The severity of COVID varies It may take a mild course with few or no symptoms resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold In of cases for those over age symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalization Mild cases typically recover within two weeks while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover Among those who have died the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID and with a transfer to intensive care units ICU br Between and of COVID patients experience long COVID a condition characterized by long term consequences persisting after the typical convalescence period of the disease The most commonly reported clinical presentations are fatigue and memory problems as well as malaise headaches shortness of breath loss of smell muscle weakness low fever and cognitive dysfunction br br br Strategies br br Many countries attempted to slow or stop the spread of COVID by recommending mandating or prohibiting behaviour changes while others relied primarily on providing information Measures ranged from public advisories to stringent lockdowns Outbreak control strategies are divided into elimination and mitigation Experts differentiate between elimination strategies known as zero COVID that aim to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community and mitigation strategies commonly known as flattening the curve that attempt to lessen the effects of the virus on society but which still tolerate some level of transmission within the community These initial strategies can be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the acquired immunity phase through natural and vaccine induced immunity br Nature reported in that percent of researchers who responded to a survey think that the coronavirus will become endemic br br br Containment br br Containment is undertaken to stop an outbreak from spreading into the general population Infected individuals are isolated while they are infectious The people they have interacted with are contacted and isolated for long enough to ensure that they are either not infected or no longer contagious Screening is the starting point for containment Screening is done by checking for symptoms to identify infected individuals who can then be isolated or offered treatment The zero COVID strategy involves using public health measures such as contact tracing mass testing border quarantine lockdowns and mitigation software to stop community transmission of COVID as soon as it is detected with the goal of getting the area back to zero detected infections and resuming normal economic and social activities Successful containment or suppression reduces Rt to less than br br br Mitigation br br Should containment fail efforts focus on mitigation measures taken to slow the spread and limit its effects on the healthcare system and society br Successful mitigation delays and decreases the epidemic peak known as flattening the epidemic curve This decreases the risk of overwhelming health services and provides more time for developing vaccines and treatments Individual behaviour changed in many jurisdictions Many people worked from home instead of at their traditional workplaces br br br Non pharmaceutical interventions br br Non pharmaceutical interventions that may reduce spread include personal actions such as wearing face masks self quarantine and hand hygiene community measures aimed at reducing interpersonal contacts such as closing workplaces and schools and cancelling large gatherings community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning br br br Other measures br More drastic actions such as quarantining entire populations and strict travel bans have been attempted in various jurisdictions The Chinese and Australian government approaches have included many lockdowns and are widely considered the most strict The New Zealand government response included the most severe travel restrictions As part of its K Quarantine program South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals The Singaporean government s response included so called circuit breaker lockdowns and financial support for those affected while also imposing large fines for those who broke quarantine br br br Contact tracing br br Contact tracing attempts to identify recent contacts of newly infected individuals and to screen them for infection the traditional approach is to request a list of contacts from infectees and then telephone or visit the contacts Contact tracing was widely used during the Western African Ebola virus epidemic in br Another approach is to collect location data from mobile devices to identify those who have come in significant contact with infectees which prompted privacy concerns On April Google and Apple announced an initiative for privacy preserving contact tracing In Europe and in the US Palantir Technologies initially provided COVID tracking services br br br Health care br br WHO described increasing capacity and adapting healthcare as a fundamental mitigation The ECDC and WHO s European regional office issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting resources at multiple levels including focusing laboratory services towards testing cancelling elective procedures separating and isolating patients and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing ventilators and beds The pandemic drove widespread adoption of telehealth br br br Improvised manufacturing br br Due to supply chain capacity limitations some manufacturers began D printing material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts In one example an Italian startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse engineering and printing one hundred requested ventilator valves overnight Individuals and groups of makers created and shared open source designs and manufacturing devices using locally sourced materials sewing and D printing Millions of face shields protective gowns and masks were made Other ad hoc medical supplies included shoe covers surgical caps powered air purifying respirators and hand sanitizer Novel devices were created such as ear savers non invasive ventilation helmets and ventilator splitters br br br Herd immunity br In July several experts expressed concern that achieving herd immunity may not be possible because Delta can transmit among vaccinated individuals CDC published data showing that vaccinated people could transmit Delta something officials believed was less likely with other variants Consequently WHO and CDC encouraged vaccinated people to continue with non pharmaceutical interventions such as masking social distancing and quarantining if exposed br br br History br br br br br The outbreak was discovered in Wuhan in November It is possible that human to human transmission was happening before the discovery Based on a retrospective analysis starting from December the number of cases in Hubei gradually increased reaching by December and at least by December br A pneumonia cluster was observed on December and treated by Chinese pulmonologist Zhang Jixian She informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December After analyzing pneumonia patient samples a genetic sequencing company named Vision Medicals reported the discovery of a novel coronavirus to the China CDC CCDC on December br On December a test report from CapitalBio Medlab addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital reported an erroneous positive result for SARS causing doctors there to alert authorities Eight of those doctors including Li Wenliang who was also punished on January were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours Director of the Emergency Department at the Central Hospital of Wuhan Ai Fen was also reprimanded That evening Wuhan Municipal Health Commission WMHC issued a notice about the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause The next day WMHC made the announcement public confirming cases enough to trigger an investigation br On December the WHO office in China was notified about the cluster of unknown pneumonia cases and immediately launched an investigation br Official Chinese sources claimed that the early cases were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market which also sold live animals In May CCDC director George Gao initially ruled out the market as a possible origin as animal samples collected there had tested negative br br br br br On January WHO was notified by the Chinese National Health Commission that the outbreak was associated with exposures in the market and that China had identified a new type of coronavirus which it isolated on January br Initially the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days In early and mid January the virus spread to other Chinese provinces helped by the Chinese New Year migration Wuhan was a transport hub and major rail interchange On January the virus genome was shared publicly A retrospective study published in March found that people had reported symptoms by January A January report indicated human transmission was likely occurring and recommended personal protective equipment for health workers It also advocated testing given the outbreak s pandemic potential On January the first published modelling study warned of inevitable independent self sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally and called for large scale public health interventions br On January infections had been confirmed leading WHO to declare the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern PHEIC On March WHO announced its assessment that the situation could be characterized as a pandemic br By January Italy indicated its first confirmed infections had occurred in two tourists from China On March Italy overtook China as the country with the most reported deaths By March the United States had overtaken China and Italy as the country with the highest number of confirmed infections Genomic analysis indicated that the majority of New York s confirmed infections came from Europe rather than directly from Asia Testing of prior samples revealed a person who was infected in France on December and a person in the United States who died from the disease on February br br In October WHO reported that one in ten people around the world may have been infected or million people while only million infections had been confirmed br On November Pfizer released trial results for a candidate vaccine showing a percent effectiveness in preventing infection That day Novavax submitted an FDA Fast Track application for their vaccine br On December Public Health England reported that a variant had been discovered in the UK s southeast predominantly in Kent The variant later named Alpha showed changes to the spike protein that could make the virus more infectious As of December infections had been confirmed in the UK br On February US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar waived liability for vaccine manufacturers in all cases except those involving willful misconduct br br br br br On January the Alpha variant first discovered in the UK had been identified in countries On January the Gamma variant was first identified in Japanese travellers returning from Brazil On January it was reported that the Novavax vaccine was percent effective against the Beta variant in a clinical trial in South Africa The CoronaVac vaccine was reported to be percent effective in a Brazil clinical trial br br On March several countries stopped using the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID vaccine due to blood clotting problems specifically cerebral venous sinus thrombosis CVST On March the WHO and European Medicines Agency found no link to thrombosis leading several countries to resume administering the vaccine In March WHO reported that an animal host was the most likely origin without ruling out other possibilities The Delta variant was first identified in India In mid April the variant was first detected in the UK and two months later it had become a full fledged third wave in the country forcing the government to delay reopening that was originally scheduled for June br br On November Germany advised against the Moderna vaccine for people under due to a possible association with myocarditis On November the Omicron variant was detected in South Africa a few days later the World Health Organization declared it a VoC variant of concern The new variant is more infectious than the Delta variant br br br br br On January Europe passed million cases amidst a surge in the Omicron variant Later that month the WHO recommended the rheumatoid arthritis drug Baricitinib for severe or critical patients It also recommended the monoclonal antibody Sotrovimab in patients with non severe disease but only those who are at highest risk of hospitalization br On January the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimated that about of the world s population had been infected by COVID By March it was reported that the total worldwide death count had surpassed million people By July Omicron subvariants BA and BA had spread worldwide WHO Director General Tedros Ghebreyesus stated on September that The world has never been in a better position to end the pandemic citing the lowest number of weekly reported deaths since March He continued We are not there yet But the end is in sight we can see the finish line br On October the United States surpassed million cases of COVID the most cases of any country By October the worldwide daily death toll was the lowest since deaths were reported on March November marked the three year anniversary since health officials in China first detected COVID br On November the WHO reported that deaths since the month of February had dropped percent Director General Tedros said this was cause for optimism On December the WHO indicated that at least of the world s population has some level of immunity to Sars CoV In early December China began lifting some of its most stringent lockdown measures Subsequent data from China s health authorities revealed that million people nearly percent of its population had been infected in the first days of that month On December the US joined Italy Japan Taiwan and India in requiring negative COVID test results from all people traveling from China due to the new surge in cases The EU refused similar measures stating that the BF omicron variant had already spread throughout Europe without becoming dominant br br br br br On January the World Health Organization said the information shared by China during the recent surge in infections lacked data such as hospitalization rates On January the WHO s Europe office said the recent viral surge in China posed no immediate threat On January the WHO recommended that China monitor excess mortality to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of COVID br On January the three year anniversary of the original declaration the World Health Organization determined that COVID still met the criteria for a public health emergency of international concern PHEIC br On March WHO Director General Tedros indicated he was confident the COVID pandemic would cease to be a public health emergency by the end of the year On May the WHO downgraded COVID from being a global health emergency though it continued to refer to it as a pandemic The WHO does not make official declarations of when pandemics end The decision came after Tedros convened with the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee wherein the Committee noted that due to the decrease in deaths and hospitalisations and the prevalence of vaccinations and the level of general immunity it was time to remove the emergency designation and transition to long term management Tedros agreed and the WHO reduced the classification to an established and ongoing health issue In a press conference Tedros remarked that the diminishing threat from COVID had allowed most countries to return to life as we knew it before COVID br In September the WHO said it had observed concerning trends in COVID case numbers and hospitalisations although analysis was hampered because many countries were no longer recording COVID case statistics br In November in response to viral mutations and changing characteristics of infection the WHO adjusted its treatment guidelines Among other changes remdesivir and molnupiravir were now recommended only for the most severe cases and deuremidevir and ivermectin were recommended against br br br Responses br br National reactions ranged from strict lockdowns to public education campaigns WHO recommended that curfews and lockdowns should be short term measures to reorganise regroup rebalance resources and protect the health care system As of March billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown This increased to billion people by the first week of April more than half the world s population br In several countries protests rose against restrictions such as lockdowns A February study found that protests against restrictions were likely to directly increase the spread of the virus br br br Asia br br As of the end of Asia s peak had come at the same time and at the same level as the world as a whole in May However cumulatively they had experienced only half of the global average in cases br br China opted for containment instituting strict lockdowns to eliminate viral spread The vaccines distributed in China included the BIBP WIBP and CoronaVac It was reported on December that China had vaccinated billion of its citizens or of the total population of the country against COVID China s large scale adoption of zero COVID had largely contained the first waves of infections of the disease When the waves of infections due to the Omicron variant followed China was almost alone in pursuing the strategy of zero Covid to combat the spread of the virus in Lockdown continued to be employed in November to combat a new wave of cases however protests erupted in cities across China over the country s stringent measures and in December that year the country relaxed its zero COVID policy On December the Chinese State Council narrowed its definition of what would be counted as a COVID death to include solely respiratory failure which led to skepticism by health experts of the government s total death count at a time when hospitals reported being overwhelmed with cases following the abrupt discontinuation of zero COVID br The first case in India was reported on January India ordered a nationwide lockdown starting March with a phased unlock beginning June Six cities accounted for around half of reported cases Mumbai Delhi Ahmedabad Chennai Pune and Kolkata Post lockdown the Government of India introduced a contact tracking app called Aarogya Setu to help authorities manage contact tracing and vaccine distribution India s vaccination program was considered to be the world s largest and most successful with over of citizens getting the first dose and another getting the second dose A second wave hit India in April straining healthcare services On October it was reported that the country had surpassed billion vaccinations br br Iran reported its first confirmed cases on February in Qom Early measures included the cancellation closure of concerts and other cultural events Friday prayers and school and university campuses Iran became a centre of the pandemic in February More than ten countries had traced their outbreaks to Iran by February indicating a more severe outbreak than the reported cases The Iranian Parliament closed after of its members tested positive on March At least twelve sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died by March By August the pandemic s fifth wave peaked with more than deaths in day br COVID was confirmed in South Korea on January Military bases were quarantined after tests showed three infected soldiers South Korea introduced what was then considered the world s largest and best organised screening programme isolating infected people and tracing and quarantining contacts Screening methods included mandatory self reporting by new international arrivals through mobile application combined with drive through testing and increasing testing capability to people day Despite some early criticisms South Korea s programme was considered a success in controlling the outbreak without quarantining entire cities br br br Europe br br The COVID pandemic arrived in Europe with its first confirmed case in Bordeaux France on January and subsequently spread widely across the continent By March every country in Europe had confirmed a case and all had reported at least one death with the exception of Vatican City Italy was the first European nation to experience a major outbreak in early becoming the first country worldwide to introduce a national lockdown By March the World Health Organization WHO declared Europe the epicentre of the pandemic and it remained so until the WHO announced it had been overtaken by South America on May By March more than million people were in lockdown in Europe Despite deployment of COVID vaccines Europe became the pandemic s epicentre once again in late br The Italian outbreak began on January when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS CoV in Rome Cases began to rise sharply which prompted the government to suspend flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency On February the Council of Ministers announced a new decree law to contain the outbreak which quarantined more than people in northern Italy On March the Italian government ordered schools and universities closed as Italy reached a hundred deaths Sport was suspended completely for at least one month On March Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte closed down nearly all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmacies On April the first wave ebbed as day deaths declined to On October the Italian government again issued restrictive rules to contain the second wave On November Italy surpassed million confirmed infections On November it was reported that the second wave of the virus had led some hospitals to stop accepting patients br br The virus was first confirmed to have spread to Spain on January when a German tourist tested positive for SARS CoV on La Gomera in the Canary Islands Post hoc genetic analysis has shown that at least strains of the virus had been imported and community transmission began by mid February On March it was announced that beginning the following day all non essential workers were ordered to remain at home for the next days The number of cases increased again in July in a number of cities including Barcelona Zaragoza and Madrid which led to reimposition of some restrictions but no national lockdown By September Spain was one of the countries with the highest percentage of its population vaccinated fully vaccinated and with the first dose Italy is ranked second at br Sweden differed from most other European countries in that it mostly remained open Per the Swedish constitution the Public Health Agency of Sweden has autonomy that prevents political interference and the agency favoured remaining open The Swedish strategy focused on longer term measures based on the assumption that after lockdown the virus would resume spreading with the same result By the end of June Sweden no longer had excess mortality br Devolution in the United Kingdom meant that each of its four countries developed its own response England s restrictions were shorter lived than the others The UK government started enforcing social distancing and quarantine measures on March On March Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised against non essential travel and social contact praising work from home and avoiding venues such as pubs restaurants and theatres On March the government ordered all leisure establishments to close and promised to prevent unemployment On March Johnson banned gatherings and restricted non essential travel and outdoor activity Unlike previous measures these restrictions were enforceable by police through fines and dispersal of gatherings Most non essential businesses were ordered to close On April it was reported that a promising vaccine trial had begun in England the government pledged more than million towards research On April it was reported that the UK would have first access to the Oxford vaccine due to a prior contract should the trial be successful some million doses would be available On December the UK became the first developed country to approve the Pfizer vaccine doses were immediately available for use In August it was reported that viral infection cases had declined in the UK br br br North America br br The virus arrived in the United States on January Cases were reported in all North American countries after Saint Kitts and Nevis confirmed a case on March and in all North American territories after Bonaire confirmed a case on April br br Per Our World in Data confirmed cases have been reported in the United States with deaths the most of any country and the nineteenth highest per capita worldwide COVID is the deadliest pandemic in US history it was the third leading cause of death in the US in behind heart disease and cancer From to US life expectancy dropped by years for Hispanic Americans years for African Americans and years for white Americans These effects have persisted as US deaths due to COVID in exceeded those in In the United States COVID vaccines became available under emergency use in December beginning the national vaccination program The first COVID vaccine was officially approved by the Food and Drug Administration on August By November while cases in the U S had declined COVID variants BQ BQ had become dominant in the country br In March as cases of community transmission were confirmed across Canada all of its provinces and territories declared states of emergency Provinces and territories to varying degrees implemented school and daycare closures prohibitions on gatherings closures of non essential businesses and restrictions on entry Canada severely restricted its border access barring travellers from all countries with some exceptions Cases surged across Canada notably in the provinces of British Columbia Alberta Quebec and Ontario with the formation of the Atlantic Bubble a travel restricted area of the country formed of the four Atlantic provinces Vaccine passports were adopted in all provinces and two of the territories Per a report on November Canadian health authorities saw a surge in influenza while COVID was expected to rise during winter br br br South America br br The COVID pandemic was confirmed to have reached South America on February when Brazil confirmed a case in S o Paulo By April all countries and territories in South America had recorded at least one case On May it was reported that Latin America and the Caribbean had reported over cases of COVID infection with deaths On May citing the rapid increase of infections in Brazil the World Health Organization WHO declared South America the epicentre of the pandemic As of July South America had recorded confirmed cases and deaths from COVID Due to a shortage of testing and medical facilities it is believed that the outbreak is far larger than the official numbers show br The virus was confirmed to have spread to Brazil on February when a man from S o Paulo who had traveled to Italy tested positive for the virus The disease had spread to every federative unit of Brazil by March On June the country reported its one millionth case and nearly reported deaths One estimate of under reporting was of total reported COVID mortality in As of July Brazil with confirmed cases and deaths has the third highest number of confirmed cases and second highest death toll from COVID in the world behind only those of the United States and India br br br Africa br br The COVID pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Africa on February with the first confirmed case announced in Egypt The first confirmed case in sub Saharan Africa was announced in Nigeria at the end of February Within three months the virus had spread throughout the continent Lesotho the last African sovereign state to have remained free of the virus reported its first case on May By May it appeared that most African countries were experiencing community transmission although testing capacity was limited Most of the identified imported cases arrived from Europe and the United States rather than from China where the virus originated Many preventive measures were implemented by different countries in Africa including travel restrictions flight cancellations and event cancellations Despite fears Africa reported lower death rates than other more economically developed regions br In early June Africa faced a third wave of COVID infections with cases rising in countries By July the continent recorded more than new COVID cases a increase from the prior week and a increase from the January peak More than sixteen African countries including Malawi and Senegal recorded an uptick in new cases The World Health Organization labelled it Africa s Worst Pandemic Week Ever In October WHO reported that most countries on the African continent will miss the goal of percent vaccination by the end of br br br Oceania br br The COVID pandemic was confirmed to have reached Oceania on January with the first confirmed case reported in Melbourne Australia It has since spread elsewhere in the region Australia and New Zealand were praised for their handling of the pandemic in comparison to other Western nations with New Zealand and each state in Australia wiping out all community transmission of the virus several times even after re introduction into the community br As a result of the high transmissibility of the Delta variant however by August the Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria had conceded defeat in their eradication efforts In early October New Zealand also abandoned its elimination strategy In November and December following vaccination efforts the remaining states of Australia excluding Western Australia voluntarily gave up COVID Zero to open up state and international borders The open borders allowed the Omicron variant of COVID to enter quickly and cases subsequently exceeded a day By early March with cases exceeding a day Western Australia conceded defeat in its eradication strategy and opened its borders Despite record cases Australian jurisdictions slowly removed restrictions such as close contact isolation mask wearing and density limits by April br On September restrictions were significantly relaxed The aircraft mask mandate was scrapped nationwide and daily reporting transitioned to weekly reporting On September COVID disaster payment for isolating persons was extended for mandatory isolation By September all states had ended mask mandates on public transport including in Victoria where the mandate had lasted for approximately days On September all Australian leaders declared the emergency response finished and announced the end of isolation requirements These changes were due in part to high levels of hybrid immunity and low case numbers br br br Antarctica br br Due to its remoteness and sparse population Antarctica was the last continent to have confirmed cases of COVID The first cases were reported in December almost a year after the first cases of COVID were detected in China At least people were infected in the first outbreak in with several other outbreaks taking place in and br br br United Nations br br The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development UNSC was criticised for its slow response especially regarding the UN s global ceasefire which aimed to open up humanitarian access to conflict zones The United Nations Security Council was criticized due to the inadequate manner in which it dealt with the COVID pandemic namely the poor ability to create international collaboration during this crisis br On March United Nations Secretary General Ant nio Manuel de Oliveira Guterres appealed for a global ceasefire UN member states and observers signed a non binding supporting statement in June and the UN Security Council passed a resolution supporting it in July br On September Guterres urged the International Monetary Fund to help certain countries via debt relief and also call for countries to increase contributions to develop vaccines br br br WHO br br The WHO spearheaded initiatives such as the COVID Solidarity Response Fund to raise money for the pandemic response the UN COVID Supply Chain Task Force and the solidarity trial for investigating potential treatment options for the disease The COVAX program co led by the WHO GAVI and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations CEPI aimed to accelerate the development manufacture and distribution of COVID vaccines and to guarantee fair and equitable access across the world br br br Restrictions br br The pandemic shook the world s economy with especially severe economic damage in the United States Europe and Latin America A consensus report by American intelligence agencies in April concluded Efforts to contain and manage the virus have reinforced nationalist trends globally as some states turned inward to protect their citizens and sometimes cast blame on marginalized groups COVID inflamed partisanship and polarisation around the world as bitter arguments exploded over how to respond International trade was disrupted amid the formation of no entry enclaves br br br Travel restrictions br br The pandemic led many countries and regions to impose quarantines entry bans or other restrictions either for citizens recent travellers to affected areas or for all travellers Travel collapsed worldwide damaging the travel sector The effectiveness of travel restrictions was questioned as the virus spread across the world One study found that travel restrictions only modestly affected the initial spread unless combined with other infection prevention and control measures Researchers concluded that travel restrictions are most useful in the early and late phase of an epidemic and restrictions of travel from Wuhan unfortunately came too late The European Union rejected the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel zone br br br Repatriation of foreign citizens br br Several countries repatriated their citizens and diplomatic staff from Wuhan and surrounding areas primarily through charter flights Canada the United States Japan India Sri Lanka Australia France Argentina Germany and Thailand were among the first to do so Brazil and New Zealand evacuated their own nationals and others On March South Africa repatriated South Africans who tested negative while four who showed symptoms were left behind Pakistan declined to evacuate its citizens br On February the US announced it would evacuate Americans aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship and on February Canada evacuated Canadians from the ship In early March the Indian government began repatriating its citizens from Iran On March the United States began to withdraw some troops from Iraq br br br Impact br br br Economics br br The pandemic and responses to it damaged the global economy On February worries about the outbreak crushed US stock indexes which posted their sharpest falls since br Tourism collapsed due to travel restrictions closing of public places including travel attractions and advice of governments against travel Airlines cancelled flights while British regional airline Flybe collapsed The cruise line industry was hard hit and train stations and ferry ports closed International mail stopped or was delayed br The retail sector faced reductions in store hours or closures Retailers in Europe and Latin America faced traffic declines of percent North America and Middle East retailers saw a percent drop Shopping centres faced a percent drop in foot traffic in March compared to February Mall operators around the world coped by increasing sanitation installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers and cancelling events br Hundreds of millions of jobs were lost including more than million jobs in the US According to a report by Yelp about of US businesses that closed will stay shut permanently The International Labour Organization ILO reported that the income generated in the first nine months of from work across the world dropped by percent or trillion br br br Supply shortages br br Pandemic fears led to panic buying emptying groceries of essentials such as food toilet paper and bottled water Panic buying stemmed from perceived threat perceived scarcity fear of the unknown coping behaviour and social psychological factors e g social influence and trust br Supply shortages were due to disruption to factory and logistic operations shortages were worsened by supply chain disruptions from factory and port shutdowns and labour shortages br Shortages continued as managers underestimated the speed of economic recovery after the initial economic crash The technology industry in particular warned of delays from underestimates of semiconductor demand for vehicles and other products br According to WHO Secretary General Tedros Ghebreyesus demand for personal protective equipment PPE rose one hundredfold pushing prices up twentyfold PPE stocks were exhausted everywhere br In September the World Bank reported that food prices remained generally stable and the supply outlook remained positive However the poorest countries witnessed a sharp increase in food prices reaching the highest level since the pandemic began The Agricultural Commodity Price Index stabilized in the third quarter but remained higher than in January br By contrast petroleum products were in surplus at the beginning of the pandemic as demand for gasoline and other products collapsed due to reduced commuting and other trips The global energy crisis was driven by a global surge in demand as the world economy recovered Energy demand was particularly strong in Asia br br br Arts and cultural heritage br br The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were profoundly affected by the pandemic Both organisations and individuals operations have been impacted globally By March across the world and to varying degrees museums libraries performance venues and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions events and performances cancelled or postponed A UNESCO report estimated ten million job losses worldwide in the culture and creative industries Some services continued through digital platforms such as live streaming concerts or web based arts festivals br br br Politics br br The pandemic affected political systems causing suspensions of legislative activities isolations or deaths of politicians and rescheduled elections Although they developed broad support among epidemiologists NPIs non pharmaceutical interventions were controversial in many countries Intellectual opposition came primarily from other fields along with heterodox epidemiologists br br br Brazil br The pandemic and the response of Brazilian politicians to it led to widespread panic confusion and pessimism in Brazil When questioned regarding record deaths in the country in April Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said So what I m sorry What do you want me to do about it Bolsonaro disregarded WHO recommended mitigation techniques and instead downplayed the risks of the virus promoted increased economic activity spread misinformation about the efficacy of masks vaccines and public health measures and distributed unproven treatments including hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin A series of federal health ministers resigned or were dismissed after they refused to implement Bolsonaro s policies br Disagreements between federal and state governments led to a chaotic and delayed response to the rapid spread of the virus exacerbated by preexisting social and economic disparities in the country Employment investment and valuation of the Brazilian real plummeted to record lows Brazil was also heavily affected by the Delta and Omicron variants At the height of the outbreak in the spring of Brazilians were dying per day Bolsonaro s loss to Lula da Silva in the presidential election is widely credited to the former s mishandling of the pandemic br br br China br br Multiple provincial level administrators of the Chinese Communist Party CCP were dismissed over their handling of quarantine measures Some commentators claimed this move was intended to protect CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping The US intelligence community claimed that China intentionally under reported its COVID caseload The Chinese government maintained that it acted swiftly and transparently Journalists and activists in China who reported on the pandemic were detained by authorities including Zhang Zhan who was arrested and tortured br br br Italy br br In early March the Italian government criticised the EU s lack of solidarity with Italy On March after a phone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military medics disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy In early April Norway and EU states like Romania and Austria started to offer help by sending medical personnel and disinfectant and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen offered an official apology to the country br br br United States br br Beginning in mid April protestors objected to government imposed business closures and restrictions on personal movement and assembly Simultaneously essential workers protested unsafe conditions and low wages by participating in a brief general strike Some political analysts claimed that the pandemic contributed to President Donald Trump s defeat br The COVID pandemic in the United States prompted calls for the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries including universal health care universal child care paid sick leave and higher levels of funding for public health The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that preventable hospitalizations of unvaccinated Americans in the second half of cost US billion br There were also protest in regards to vaccine mandates in the United States In January the US Supreme Court struck down an OSHA rule that mandated vaccination or a testing regimen for all companies with greater than employees br br br Other countries br The number of journalists imprisoned or detained increased worldwide some detentions were related to the pandemic The planned NATO Defender military exercise in Germany Poland and the Baltic states the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War was held on a reduced scale br The Iranian government was heavily affected by the virus which infected some two dozen parliament members and political figures Iran President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on March due to a lack of access to international markets Saudi Arabia which had launched a military intervention in Yemen in March declared a ceasefire br Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened South Korea criticised Japan s ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced travellers from South Korea must quarantine for two weeks South Korean society was initially polarised on President Moon Jae in s response to the crisis many Koreans signed petitions calling for Moon s impeachment or praising his response br Some countries passed emergency legislation Some commentators expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power In Hungary the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orb n to rule by decree indefinitely suspend parliament and elections and punish those deemed to have spread false information In countries such as Egypt Turkey and Thailand opposition activists and government critics were arrested for allegedly spreading fake news In India journalists criticising the government s response were arrested or issued warnings by police and authorities br br br Food systems br br The pandemic disrupted food systems worldwide hitting at a time when hunger and undernourishment were rising an estimated million people lacked food security in Food access fell driven by falling incomes lost remittances and disruptions to food production In some cases food prices rose The pandemic and its accompanying lockdowns and travel restrictions slowed movement of food aid According to the WHO million people were undernourished in likely related to the fallout of COVID br br br Education br br The pandemic impacted educational systems in many countries Many governments temporarily closed educational institutions often replaced by online education Other countries such as Sweden kept their schools open As of September approximately billion learners were affected due to school closures School closures impacted students teachers and families with far reaching economic and societal consequences They shed light on social and economic issues including student debt digital learning food insecurity and homelessness as well as access to childcare health care housing internet and disability services The impact was more severe for disadvantaged children The Higher Education Policy Institute reported that around of students claimed worsened mental health as a result of the pandemic br br br Health br br The pandemic impacted global health for many conditions Hospital visits fell Visits for heart attack symptoms declined by in the US and in Spain The head of cardiology at the University of Arizona said My worry is some of these people are dying at home because they re too scared to go to the hospital People with strokes and appendicitis were less likely to seek treatment Medical supply shortages impacted many people The pandemic impacted mental health increasing anxiety depression and post traumatic stress disorder affecting healthcare workers patients and quarantined individuals br In late during the first northern hemisphere autumn and winter seasons following the widespread relaxation of global public health measures North America and Europe experienced a surge in respiratory viruses and coinfections in both adults and children This formed the beginning of the pediatric care crisis and what some experts termed a tripledemic of seasonal influenza respiratory syncytial virus RSV and SARS CoV throughout North America In the United Kingdom pediatric infections also began to spike beyond pre pandemic levels albeit with different illnesses such as Group A streptococcal infection and resultant scarlet fever As of mid December children in the UK had died due to Strep A and the wave of infections had begun to spread into North America and Mainland Europe br The B Yamagata lineage of influenza B might have become extinct in due to COVID pandemic measures There have been no naturally occurring cases confirmed since March In the World Health Organization concluded that protection against the Yamagata lineage was no longer necessary in the seasonal flu vaccine reducing the number of lineages targeted by the vaccine from four to three br br br Environment br br The pandemic and the reaction to it positively affected the environment and climate as a result of reduced human activity During the anthropause fossil fuel use decreased resource consumption declined and waste disposal improved generating less pollution Planned air travel and vehicle transportation declined In China lockdowns and other measures resulted in a decrease in coal consumption and a reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions br In a worldwide study on mammalian wildlife responses to human presence during COVID lockdowns found complex patterns of animal behavior Carnivores were generally less active when humans were around while herbivores in developed areas were more active Among other findings this suggested that herbivores may view humans as a shield against predators highlighting the importance of location and human presence history in understanding wildlife responses to changes in human activity in a given area br A wide variety of largely mammalian species both captive and wild have been shown to be susceptible to SARS CoV with some encountering a particularly high degree of fatal outcomes In particular both farmed and wild mink have developed highly symptomatic and severe COVID infections with a mortality rate as high as according to one study White tailed deer on the other hand have largely avoided severe outcomes but have effectively become natural reservoirs of the virus with large numbers of free ranging deer infected throughout the US and Canada including approximately of Iowa s wild deer herd An August study appeared to confirm the status of white tailed deer as a disease reservoir noting that the viral evolution of SARS CoV in deer occurs at triple the rate of its evolution in humans and that infection rates remained high even in areas rarely frequented by humans br br br Discrimination and prejudice br br Heightened prejudice xenophobia and racism toward people of Chinese and East Asian descent were documented around the world Reports from February when most confirmed cases were confined to China cited racist sentiments about Chinese people deserving the virus Individuals of Asian descent in Europe and North America reported increasing instances of racially motivated abuse and assaults as a result of the pandemic US President Donald Trump was criticised for referring to SARS CoV as the Chinese Virus and Kung Flu terms which were condemned as being racist and xenophobic br Age based discrimination against older adults increased during the pandemic This was attributed to their perceived vulnerability and subsequent physical and social isolation measures which coupled with their reduced social activity increased dependency on others Similarly limited digital literacy left the elderly more vulnerable to isolation depression and loneliness br In a correspondence published in The Lancet in German epidemiologist G nter Kampf described the harmful effects of inappropriate stigmatisation of unvaccinated people who include our patients colleagues and other fellow citizens noting the evidence that vaccinated individuals play a large role in transmission American bioethicist Arthur Caplan responded to Kampf writing Criticising the unvaccinated who wind up in hospitals and morgues in huge numbers put stress on finite resources and prolong the pandemic is not stigmatising it is deserved moral condemnation br In January Amnesty International urged Italy to change their anti COVID restrictions to avoid discrimination against unvaccinated people saying that the government must continue to ensure that the entire population can enjoy its fundamental rights The restrictions included mandatory vaccination over the age of and mandatory vaccination to use public transport br br br Lifestyle changes br br The pandemic triggered massive changes in behaviour from increased Internet commerce to cultural changes in the workplace Online retailers in the US posted billion in sales in an increase of from billion the year before Home delivery orders increased while indoor restaurant dining shut down due to lockdown orders or low sales Hackers cybercriminals and scammers took advantage of the changes to launch new online attacks br Education in some countries temporarily shifted from physical attendance to video conferencing Massive layoffs shrank the airline travel hospitality and other industries Despite most corporations implementing measures to address COVID in the workplace a poll from Catalyst found that as many as of employees around the world felt that these policies were only performative and not genuine br The pandemic led to a surge in remote work According to a Gallup poll only of US employees were fully remote before the pandemic compared to in May Among white collar workers that shift was more pronounced with increasing to in the same period That trend continued in later stages of the pandemic with many workers choosing to remain remote even after workplaces reopened Many Nordic European and Asian companies increased their recruitment of international remote workers even as the pandemic waned partially to save on labor costs This also led to a talent drain in the global south and in remote areas in the global north High cost of living and dense urban areas also lost office real estate value due to remote worker exodus By May due to increasing layoffs and concerns over productivity some white collar workplaces in the US had resorted to performance review penalties and indirect incentives e g donations to charity to encourage workers to return to the office br br br Historiography br A study noted that the COVID pandemic had increased interest in epidemics and infectious diseases among both historians and the general public Prior to the pandemic these topics were usually overlooked by general history and only received attention in the history of medicine Many comparisons were made between the COVID and influenza pandemics including the development of anti mask movements the widespread promotion of misinformation and the impact of socioeconomic disparities br br br Religion br br In some areas religious groups exacerbated the spread of the virus through large gatherings and the dissemination of misinformation Some religious leaders decried what they saw as violations of religious freedom In other cases religious identity was a beneficial factor for health increasing compliance with public health measures and protecting against the negative effects of isolation on mental wellbeing br br br Information dissemination br br Some news organizations removed their online paywalls for some or all of their pandemic related articles and posts Many scientific publishers provided pandemic related journal articles to the public free of charge as part of the National Institutes of Health s COVID Public Health Emergency Initiative According to one estimate from researchers at the University of Rome of COVID related papers were open access compared to an average of for the ten most deadly human diseases The share of papers published on preprint servers prior to peer review increased dramatically br br br Misinformation br br Misinformation and conspiracy theories about the pandemic have been widespread they travel through mass media social media and text messaging In March WHO declared an infodemic of incorrect information Cognitive biases such as confirmation bias are linked to conspiracy beliefs including COVID vaccine hesitancy br br br Culture and society br br The COVID pandemic had a major impact on popular culture It was included in the narratives of ongoing pre pandemic television series and become a central narrative in new ones with mixed results Writing for The New York Times about the then upcoming BBC sitcom Pandemonium on December David Segal asked Are we ready to laugh about Covid Or rather is there anything amusing or recognizable in a humorous way about life during a plague with all of its indignities and setbacks not to mention its rituals and rules br The pandemic had driven some people to seek peaceful escapism in media while others were drawn towards fictional pandemics e g zombie apocalypses as an alternate form of escapism Common themes have included contagion isolation and loss of control Many drew comparisons to the fictional film Contagion praising its accuracies while noting some differences such as the lack of an orderly vaccine rollout br As people turned to music to relieve emotions evoked by the pandemic Spotify listenership showed that classical ambient and children s genres grew while pop country and dance remained relatively stable br br br Transition to later phases br On May the WHO declared that the pandemic was no longer a public health emergency of international concern This led several media outlets to incorrectly report that this meant the pandemic was over The WHO commented to Full Fact that it was unlikely to declare the pandemic over in the near future and mentioned cholera which it considers to have been a pandemic since i e continuously for the last years The WHO does not have an official category for pandemics or make declarations of when pandemics start or end br In June Hans Kluge director of the WHO in Europe commented that While the international public health emergency may have ended the pandemic certainly has not The WHO in Europe launched a transition plan to manage the public health response to COVID in the coming years and prepare for possible future emergencies br Epidemics and pandemics usually end when the disease becomes endemic and when the disease becomes an accepted manageable part of normal life in a given society As of March there was no widely agreed definition of when a disease is or is not a pandemic though efforts at a formal definition were underway Experts asked by Time that month noted that COVID continued to circulate and cause disease but expressed uncertainty as to whether it should still be described as a pandemic br br br Future endemic phase br br In June an article in Human Genomics said that the pandemic was still raging but that now is the time to explore the transition from the pandemic to the endemic phase br A March review declared the transition to endemic status to be inevitable A June review predicted that the virus that causes COVID would become the fifth endemic seasonal coronavirus alongside four other human coronaviruses A February review of the four common cold coronaviruses concluded that the virus would become seasonal and like the common cold cause less severe disease for most people As of the transition to endemic COVID may take years or decades br br br Long term effects br br br Economic br Despite strong economic rebounds following the initial lockdowns in early towards the latter phases of the pandemic many countries began to experience long term economic effects Several countries saw high inflation rates which had global impacts particularly in developing countries Some economic impacts such as supply chain and trade operations were seen as more permanent as the pandemic exposed major weaknesses in these systems br In Australia the pandemic caused an increase in occupational burnout in br During the pandemic a large percentage of workers in Canada came to prefer working from home which had an impact on the traditional work model Some corporations made efforts to force workers to return to work on site while some embraced the idea br br br Travel br There was a travel boom causing air travel to recover at rates faster than anticipated and the aviation industry became profitable in for the first time since before the pandemic However economic issues meant some predicted that the boom would begin to slow down Business travel on airlines was still below pre pandemic levels and is predicted not to recover br br br Health br An increase in excess deaths from underlying causes not related to COVID has been largely blamed on systematic issues causing delays in health care and screening during the pandemic which has resulted in an increase of non COVID related deaths br br br Immunizations br During the pandemic millions of children missed out on vaccinations as countries focused efforts on combating COVID Efforts were made to increase vaccination rates among children in low income countries These efforts were successful in increasing vaccination rates for some diseases though the UN noted that post pandemic measles vaccinations were still falling behind br Some of the decrease in immunization was driven by an increase in mistrust of public health officials This was seen in both low income and high income countries Several African countries saw a decline in vaccinations due to misinformation around the pandemic flowing into other areas Immunization rates have yet to recover in the United States and the
