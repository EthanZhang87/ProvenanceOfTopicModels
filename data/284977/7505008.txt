Praise in br br br Origin br Boberg wrote the poem O Store Gud O Great God with nine stanzas It was first published in br br br Inspiration br The inspiration for the poem came when Boberg was walking home from church near Kronob ck Sweden and listening to church bells A sudden storm got Boberg s attention and then just as suddenly as it had made its appearance it subsided to a peaceful calm which Boberg observed over M nster s Bay According to J Irving Erickson br br Carl Boberg and some friends were returning home to M nster s from Kronob ck where they had participated in an afternoon service Presently a thundercloud appeared on the horizon and soon lightning flashed across the sky Strong winds swept over the meadows and billowing fields of grain The thunder pealed in loud claps Then rain came in cool fresh showers In a little while the storm was over and a rainbow appeared br When Boberg arrived home he opened the window and saw the bay of M nster s like a mirror before him From the woods on the other side of the bay he heard the song of a thrush the church bells were tolling in the quiet evening It was this series of sights sounds and experiences that inspired the writing of the song br According to Boberg s great nephew Bud Boberg My dad s story of its origin was that it was a paraphrase of Psalm and was used in the underground church in Sweden in the late s when the Baptists and Mission Friends were persecuted The author Carl Boberg himself gave the following information about the inspiration behind his poem br br It was that time of year when everything seemed to be in its richest colouring the birds were singing in trees and everywhere It was very warm a thunderstorm appeared on the horizon and soon there was thunder and lightning We had to hurry to shelter But the storm was soon over and the clear sky appeared br When I came home I opened my window toward the sea There evidently had been a funeral and the bells were playing the tune of When eternity s clock calls my saved soul to its Sabbath rest That evening I wrote the song O Store Gud br br br Publication and music br br Boberg first published O Store Gud in the M nster s Tidningen M nster s News on March br The poem became matched to an old Swedish folk tune and sung in public for the first known occasion in a church in the Swedish province of V rmland in Eight verses appeared with the music in the hymnal Sions Harpan br In Boberg became the editor of Sanningsvittnet Witness to the Truth The words and music were published for the first time in the April edition of Sanningsvittnet Instrumentation for both piano and guitar was provided by Adolph Edgren born died in Washington D C a music teacher and organist who later migrated to the United States br Boberg later sold the rights to the Svenska Missionsf rbundet Mission Covenant Church of Sweden In all nine verses were published in the Covenant songbook Sanningsvittnet These versions were all in time In the Svenska Missionsf rbundet s ngbok published O Store Gud in time as it has been sung ever since br In the Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant of America published four verses of O store Gud in their hymnal De Ungas S ngbok utgiven f r S ndagsskolan Ungdomsm tet och hemmet The Swedish version that appeared in this edition was br br br English translations br br br E Gustav Johnson br The first literal English translation of O store Gud was written by E Gustav Johnson then a professor of North Park College Illinois His translation of verses and was published in the United States in the Covenant Hymnal as O Mighty God in br The first three Covenant hymnals in English used Johnson s translation with The Covenant Hymnal including all nine verses of Boberg s original poem There was a desire to replace Johnson s version with the more popular version of British missionary Stuart K Hine s How Great Thou Art Wiberg explains br br Given the popularity of Stuart Hine s translation of How Great Thou Art in the late s and early s the Hymnal Commission struggled with whether to go with the more popular version or retain E Gustav Johnson s translation However economics settled the issue inasmuch as we were unable to pay the exorbitant price requested by the publishing house that owned the copyright despite the fact that the original belonged to the Covenant br The version that appeared in the edition of The Covenant Hymnbook was br br In Johnson s translation was replaced in The Covenant Hymnal A Worshipbook because E Gustav Johnson s version while closer to the original uses a more archaic language However according to Glen V Wiberg br br While there was sympathy on the commission for retaining this older version a compromise led to preserving it in printed form on the opposite page of How Great Thou Art hymn The new version with fresher language and some striking metaphors seems uneven and incomplete br br br Stuart K Hine version br Plymouth Brethren missionary Stuart Wesley Keene Hine July March was dedicated to Jesus Christ in The Salvation Army by his parents Hine was led to Christ by Madame Annie Ryall on February and was baptised shortly thereafter Hine was influenced greatly by the teachings of British Baptist evangelist Charles Spurgeon br Hine first heard the Russian translation of the German version of the song while on an evangelistic mission to the Carpathian Mountains then of the Soviet s Ukrainian SSR in Upon hearing it Hine was inspired to create his English paraphrase known as How Great Thou Art According to Michael Ireland Hine and his wife Mercy learned the Russian translation and started using it in their evangelistic services Hine also started re writing some of the verses and writing new verses all in Russian as events inspired him br br br Verse br One of the verses Hine added was the current third verse br br Michael Ireland explains the origin of this original verse written by Hine br br It was typical of the Hines to ask if there were any Christians in the villages they visited In one case they found out that the only Christians that their host knew about were a man named Dmitri and his wife Lyudmila Dmitri s wife knew how to read evidently a fairly rare thing at that time and in that place She taught herself how to read because a Russian soldier had left a Bible behind several years earlier and she started slowly learning by reading that Bible When the Hines arrived in the village and approached Dmitri s house they heard a strange and wonderful sound Dmitri s wife was reading from the gospel of John about the crucifixion of Christ to a houseful of guests and those visitors were in the very act of repenting In Ukraine as I know first hand this act of repenting is done very much out loud So the Hines heard people calling out to God saying how unbelievable it was that Christ would die for their own sins and praising Him for His love and mercy They just couldn t barge in and disrupt this obvious work of the Holy Spirit so they stayed outside and listened Stuart wrote down the phrases he heard the Repenters use and even though this was all in Russian it became the third verse that we know today And when I think that God His Son not sparing Sent Him to die I scarce can take it in br The Hines had to leave Ukraine during the Holodomor or Famine Genocide perpetrated on Ukraine by Joseph Stalin during the winter of and they also left Eastern Europe at the outbreak of the Second World War in returning to Britain where they settled in Somerset Hine continued his evangelistic ministry in Britain working among the displaced Polish refugee community br br br Verse br The fourth verse was another innovation of Stuart Hine which was added after the Second World War His concern for the exiled Polish community in Britain who were anxious to return home provided part of the inspiration for Hine s final verse Hine and David Griffiths visited a camp in Sussex England in where displaced Russians were being held but where only two were professing Christians The testimony of one of these refugees and his anticipation of the second coming of Christ inspired Hine to write the fourth stanza of his English version of the hymn According to Ireland br br One man to whom they were ministering told them an amazing story he had been separated from his wife at the very end of the war and had not seen her since At the time they were separated his wife was a Christian but he was not but he had since been converted His deep desire was to find his wife so they could at last share their faith together But he told the Hines that he did not think he would ever see his wife on earth again Instead he was longing for the day when they would meet in heaven and could share in the Life Eternal there These words again inspired Hine and they became the basis for his fourth and final verse to How Great Thou Art When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation to take me home what joy shall fill my heart Then we shall bow in humble adoration and there proclaim My God How Great Thou Art br br br Optional verses by Hine br In Hine s book Not You but God A Testimony to God s Faithfulness Hine presents two additional optional verses that he copyrighted in as a translation of the Russian version that are generally omitted from hymnals published in the United States br br br Subsequent history br In Hine finished composing the final verse Hine finalised his English translation in and published the final four verse version in his own Russian gospel magazine Grace and Peace that same year As Grace and Peace was circulated among refugees in fifteen countries around the world including North and South America Hine s version of O store Gud How Great Thou Art became popular in each country it reached British missionaries began to spread the song around the world to former British colonies in Africa and India in approximately its current English version br According to Hine James Caldwell a missionary from Central Africa introduced Hine s version to the United States when he sang it at a Bible conference of the Stony Brook Assembly in Stony Brook New York on Long Island in the summer of br Hine published hymns and evangelical literature in various languages including Eastern Melodies Hymns of other Lands br and The Story of How Great Thou art How it came to be written With complete album of hymns of other lands Russian melodies Eastern melodies etc Hine died on March his last place of residence being Seagull Cottage Walton on the Naze Essex His memorial service was held at the Gospel Hall in that town on March br br br Manna Music version br A program note from a Gustavus Adolphus College Minnesota concert tells listeners that J Edwin Orr January April of Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena California discovered the song being sung in a small village near Deolali India by a choir of the Naga tribe from Assam near Burma The tribesmen had arranged the harmony themselves and a Mennonite missionary had transcribed it br br Orr was so impressed with the song that he introduced it at the Forest Home Christian Conference Center in the San Bernardino Mountains of southern California founded in by Henrietta Mears October March in the summer of Mears publishing company Gospel Light Press published Hine s version of the song in However according to Manna Music s website br Dr Orr s theme for the week of the conference was Think not what great things you can do for God but think first of whatever you can do for a great God And so he introduced the song at the start of the conference and it was sung each day Attending the Forest Home college age conference were Hal Spencer and his sister Loretta son and daughter of Tim Spencer who was a songwriter and publisher of Christian music Hal and Loretta borrowed the song sheet from Dr Orr and brought it home and gave it to their father br Their father was Vernon Tim Spencer July April a converted cowboy and former member of The Sons of the Pioneers who had founded the newly established Manna Music of Burbank California in Spencer negotiated with Hine for the purchase of the song br The Manna Music editors changed works and mighty in Hine s original translation to worlds and rolling respectively According to Manna Music Presently it is considered and has been for several years to be the most popular Gospel song in the world br The first time How Great Thou Art was sung in the United States was at the aforementioned Forest Home conference in led by Dr Orr In honor of this event Forest Home had the words to the song carved on a polished Redwood plaque This plaque hangs on the wall of Hormel Hall at Forest Home to this day enabling people to sing it at any time and to help in learning the song br The first major American recording of How Great Thou Art was by Bill Carle in a Sacred Records album of the same name LP He reprised the song on his album Who Hath Measured the Waters In the Hollow of His Hand Sacred Records LP later that year br br br Billy Graham Evangelistic Crusades br The Manna Music version of the song was popularised as the signature song of the s Billy Graham Crusades It was popularized by George Beverly Shea and Cliff Barrows during Billy Graham crusades According to Ireland br br As the story goes when the Billy Graham team went to London in for the Harringay Arena Crusade in Haringey they were given a pamphlet containing Hine s work At first they ignored it but fortunately not for long said Bud Boberg They worked closely with Hine to prepare the song for use in their campaigns They sang it in the Toronto campaign but it didn t really catch on until they took it to Madison Square Garden in According to Cliff Barrows Dr Graham s longtime associate they sang it one hundred times during that campaign because the people wouldn t let them stop br The pamphlet had been given to Shea by his friend Andrew Gray who worked with the Pickering and Inglis publishing firm on Oxford Street in London in Barrows who also had been given a copy had Paul Mickelson died October arrange the song for use in the Toronto Crusade George Beverly Shea s recording of the hymn ranks number on the top recordings of the th century according to the Recording Industry Association of America br Evangelist Billy Graham said The reason I like How Great Thou Art is because it glorifies God It turns Christian s eyes toward God rather than upon themselves I use it as often as possible because it is such a God honoring song br br br Christiansen translation br A translation exists by Avis B Christiansen retaining the O Store Gud melody with an arrangement by Robert J Hughes This version titled Lord I Adore Thee appears in the hymnal Songs for Worship br br br Bayly translation br The hymn was translated in for InterVarsity Christian Fellowship by Joseph T Bayly April July and set to the music of Josephine Carradine Dixon According to Bud Boberg the grandson of the younger brother of the original author of the poem br It s a quite literal translation from Boberg but I suspect that he had the Hine work at hand because he uses the phrase how great Thou art Also the music by Josephine Carradine Dixon is similar to Hine s He added two verses of his own br br br Other translations br br br German translation br The song was first translated from Swedish to German by a wealthy Baltic German Baptist nobleman Manfred von Glehn born in Jelgimaggi Estonia died in Brazil who had heard the hymn in Estonia where there was a Swedish speaking minority It was first published in Blankenburger Lieder The song became popular in Germany where Wie gro bist Du is the common title the first line is Du gro er Gott Most German hymnals contain only the first four verses of von Glehn s translation so the last two are not well known in Germany br br br Russian

Routley br The eminent British hymnologist Erik Routley born October died so disliked both the hymn and its melody he wrote a new text O Mighty God and re harmonised the Swedish tune in This was one of his last works before his death His translation was included as hymn in Rejoice in the Lord A Hymn Companion to the Scriptures Wibeg incorrectly refers to Routley as Eric Rowley br In English the first line is O Lord my God and the hymn may appear with that heading especially in British hymnals where first line citation is the dominant practice English language hymnals prevailingly indicate the tune title as the Swedish first line O STORE GUD br br br M ori version br In New Zealand the hymn tune is most widely known through a different hymn called Whakaaria Mai The M ori verses were composed by Canon Wiremu Te Tau Huata who served as a chaplain during WWII for the th M ori Battalion and composed many famous waiata While set to the music of How Great Thou Art and often combined
