Burning Bright is a novella by John Steinbeck written as an experiment with producing a play in novel format Rather than providing only the dialogue and brief stage directions as would be expected in a play Steinbeck fleshes out the scenes with details of both the characters and the environment The intention was to allow the play to be read by the non theatrical reader while still allowing the dialogue to be lifted and performed with little adaptation by acting companies While Steinbeck could see that providing little information in the way of physical description or stage direction allowed the director and actors greater freedom and scope for imaginative interpretation he weighed this against the benefit of making the players aware of the author s intent and making the play accessible to the general reader br br br Plot br The story is a simple morality play concerning Joe Saul an aging man desperate for a child His young wife Mordeen who loves him suspects that he is sterile and in order to please him by bearing him a child she becomes pregnant by Saul s cocky young assistant Victor The fourth character in the story is Friend Ed a long time friend of Saul and Mordeen who helps the couple through the ordeal after Joe discovers that he is indeed infertile and the child can not be his The story is meant to be that of an everyman early in its development Steinbeck had thought of calling the play Everyman so the setting for each of the three acts recasts the four characters in different situations the first act is set in a circus Saul and Victor are trapeze artists and Friend Ed a clown in the second act Saul and Friend Ed become neighbouring farmers and Victor appears as Saul s farmhand In the final act Saul is the captain of a ship Mr Victor his mate and Friend Ed a seaman about to put out on a different ship Act three is divided into two scenes the final scene is set in a hospital where the child is delivered it makes no reference to any of the settings of the three acts and so serves equally as a conclusion for any of the stories br br br Development br Burning Bright was Steinbeck s third attempt at writing what he called a play novelette He had tried something similar with Of Mice and Men in and The Moon Is Down in but of the three Burning Bright was the most complete attempt at the form Steinbeck believed that he may have been the first person to attempt the style At the time of writing the introduction in which he explained his intentions he believed it was a form that would bear further experimentation In a continuation of the experiment a stage production was planned to open at the same time the book was published The original title of the book In the Forests of the Night was a line from The Tyger by William Blake but complaints that it was too long and too literary by the producers of the play led to the change to the shorter excerpt from the same poem Burning Bright br Friend Ed has been pointed out as one in a line of characters inspired by Steinbeck s best friend Ed Ricketts At the time Steinbeck wrote Burning Bright Ricketts had recently been killed in a car accident and as well as reflecting his friend s character in that of Friend Ed it is thought that the settings of the circus and the sea may have had significance for Steinbeck he had apparently been at the circus when he learnt of Ricketts death and Ricketts burial had been beside the sea br br br Adaptation br The stage production in had Rodgers and Hammerstein as producers Guthrie McClintic as director Kent Smith as Joe Saul Barbara Bel Geddes as Mordeen Howard Da Silva as Friend Ed and Martin E Brooks as Victor The production had a short run at New Haven during which Steinbeck tightened up the second act but despite his work on the play confidence in it was fading When the production moved to Boston for the main run the critical reviews were terrible and the play closed after only thirteen performances One of the co producers admitted that he had known the production was doomed after the first night Steinbeck was later upbeat about the failure of the play and stated he was still keen to continue working in the theatre br br I m just determined I m going to learn something about the theatre Last time we were kicked around like dogs but I still want to do it This shows a truly pure quality of stupidity Just nuts I m so fascinated by everything about the theatre I don t really care if the show s a flop br Despite his apparent continued enthusiasm after the failure of Burning Bright Steinbeck never made another attempt at producing anything for the theatre br In NTA Film Network in The Play of the Week broadcast Burning Bright with Myron McCormick as Joe Saul Colleen Dewhurst as Mordeen Dana Elcar as friend Ed and Donald Madden as Victor The play can be seen on the streaming service BroadwayHD br In Burning Bright was turned into an opera by American composer Frank Lewin br br br Critical reception br The reviews of the book were as poor as the reviews of the stage production While some critics acknowledged it for the experiment that Steinbeck had intended it was seen as peculiar and at best moderately effective The artificial use of language while necessary to allow the characters development on the stage jarred with the critics reviewing the novelization as did Steinbeck s overemphasis of the message of the play br br br Sources br Steinbeck John Burning Bright Penguin Classics p ISBN br Benson Jackson J John Steinbeck Writer A Biography Penguin p ISBN X br Tamm Eric Enno Beyond the
