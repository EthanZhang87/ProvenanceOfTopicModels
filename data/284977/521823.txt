The Eishockey Bundesliga was formed in as the elite hockey competition in the Federal Republic of Germany replacing the Oberliga in this position It was in turn replaced by the Deutsche Eishockey Liga which now also carries the name st Bundesliga in its logo br br The DEL was founded in the season consisting of teams from the Eishockey Bundesliga s st and nd divisions The condition of these earlier leagues had become intolerable Many st and nd division teams were heavily in debt The nd division attracted few sponsors and spectators As a result many clubs were forced to fold or withdraw to the lower leagues Fans and corporate sponsors focused on the st Bundesliga teams forcing the elite teams to invest heavily in players to avoid relegation This increased budgets percent over the previous two years br In the final Bundesliga season only teams wanted to play in the nd Bundesliga Furthermore two teams folded during and after the season Ice hockey s reputation in Germany was heavily tarnished This made it difficult to attract serious sponsorship In January out of the remaining st and nd Bundesliga teams voted for creating a new entity the DEL br Upon founding the DEL Betriebsgesellschaft mbH was the first German professional sports league managed by an organization whose members were incorporated as well The goal behind the DEL was to create a league based on the model of the North American NHL in which teams could play consistently without relegation concerns and create a stable league Clubs in the DEL were required to conform to rules which were designed to ensure long term viability Twelve clubs from the old st Bundesliga and six from the nd Bundesliga came together as founding members The new league immediately attracted corporate sponsorship with the Krombacher Brewery which was prominently featured on the new league logo br The hope of avoiding the troubles of the old Bundesliga by stricter financial controls did not materialize During DEL s initial season on December the Bundesliga s final champion the renamed EC Hedos M nchen folded This was controversial as DEL s president Franz Hofherr had approved their license and certified their finances Hofherr was Mad Dogs former president and it was alleged that he must have known about their desperate financial situation br The Bosman ruling a decision of the European Court of Justice regarding the movement of labor in soccer had profound influence on the league The old Bundesliga had national character with German clubs competing for the German title using mostly German players After the ruling European Union players were excluded from the foreign player quota In the season following the decision the DEL teams employed EU players This lowered costs significantly enabling smaller teams to compete more effectively However frequent player moves were not viewed positively by the fans resulting in smaller attendance numbers br Following an agreement with the DEB the league renamed itself as DEL Die Bundesliga in the season while reintroducing relegation and promotion to from the nd Ice Hockey Bundesliga br The season was significant due to the NHL lockout NHL players came to play the season in the DEL including Jamie Langenbrunner Erik Cole St phane Robidas Doug Weight Mike York and several German national team players Jochen Hecht Olaf K lzig and Marco Sturm br

status through non compliance with the leagues regulations see above br The ESBG guarantees to admit any DEL team wishing to step down to the lower nd Bundesliga or Oberliga The team however has to purchase a license licensing fees for the nd Bundesliga are currently set at br To regulate the relationship between the DEL the DEB and the ESBG nd Bundesliga a so called Kooperationsvertrag exists This cooperation contract was signed in December and was valid until This contract ended years of dispute between the three organizations over competencies and financial issues br In November the DEL announced another change in policy The league expanded to allow teams beginning in the season resulting in direct promotion for the nd Bundesliga league champions should they fulfill all requirements and be interested in joining the DEL Should this not be the case or a current DEL team resigns from the league a selection process would determine the club or clubs who would be eligible to join in order required to achieve teams Note F chse Duisburg resigned before the season and was not replaced until the following season br For that season it was also mandated that each DEL club would be allowed to have no more than ten non EC players under contract br Additionally a new format for the game schedule will limit the number of regular season games to for each team This is achieved by each team playing four games against eleven others and two games against the remaining four To determine which teams play the final standings of the previous season are used br The DEL would also reintroduce promotion once more The first and second lowest ranked teams will play a best of seven series to determine which team faces the nd Bundesliga champion for a place in the league There is however an ongoing dispute about those games as second division teams may only have five foreign players on contract and therefore face a handicap in comparison to the DEL teams with twelve import players each For now the ESBG has declared that no team from the nd Bundesliga would take part in these matches and therefore no promotion relegation with the DEL will take place br br br Teams br
