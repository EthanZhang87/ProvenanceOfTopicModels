The Dutch Top Dutch Nederlandse Top is a weekly music chart compiled by Stichting Nederlandse Top It started as a radio program titled Veronica Top on the offshore station Radio Veronica in It remained The Veronica Top until when the station was forced to stop broadcasting Joost den Draaijer initiated the Top in the Netherlands The show currently airs on Fridays from to PM on Qmusic br br br History br On January the first Top was compiled with its first hit I Feel Fine by The Beatles In September the Stichting Nederlandse Top bought the Top and named it De Nederlandse Top The Dutch Top is one of the four official charts in the Netherlands the other three being the B B Single Top which is based entirely on pure sales and streaming the Mega Top from NPO FM which like the Dutch Top also includes airplay data br From October until May the Top was broadcast by TROS on the pop radio station Hilversum presented by Dutch famous DJ Ferry Maat From May until November the Top was broadcast by Veronica on Hilversum As of December after the rename of the station name to Radio the Top continued to be broadcast by Veronica on Radio br In and Stichting Nederlandse Top ran several trade fairs in both the Netherlands and Belgium br In January Radio decided that the broadcasting of two hit lists the other one was the Nationale Top on one radio station must come to an end and therefore as from February Radio started to broadcast a new hitlist the Mega Top and wanted to terminate the broadcasting of the Top Due to a lawsuit of the Stichting Nederlandse Top Veronica had to continue broadcasting the Dutch Top on Radio until December br Meanwhile the Dutch Top was also broadcast on the Dutch commercial radiostation Radio since June The list continued to be broadcast on this radiostation until December when Radio discontinued the broadcasting of the Dutch Top As from January the Top is broadcast by the Dutch commercial radiostation Qmusic br br br Compilation br br br Composition br For most of its history the Top was based on sales figures of record stores These were collected through telephone surveys As of the airplay of a limited number of radio stations was included Between and download figures were added to the mix They were removed again because supposedly download sales could be easily manipulated by record companies or artists br As of February the chart is a combination of airplay streaming and social media trends The more often a song gets played on the radio the higher its ranking in the Top br To compute year end chart positions the weekly positions get points the positions get points etc These weekly scores are then added up and sorted by single to determine the ranking br br br Tipparade br The Tipparade a bubbling under chart for the Top is based on sales streaming airplay and recommendations from both the general public and the music industry br br br Rules br br There is a set of rules of which some have existed since that has been maintained up until Some of these have been criticized as a hindrance br br Since late singles had to remain at least two weeks in the charts If a single officially no longer belongs in the Top these are placed at br Example Missy Elliott s Lose Control Remained for two weeks at in the chart because it did not sell enough and also wasn t played enough on the radio br There have been two exceptions to this though In October Pet Shop Boys Yesterday When I Was Mad stayed in the charts for only one week due to an error in the compilation and in late September Kus s meiden just didn t sell enough to stay in the charts for two weeks br Since singles that move up in the chart by a large number of positions are assigned superstip super bullet status These singles were not allowed to fall down in chart position in the following week If a superstip single had comparatively lower sales airplay statistics a week later it would remain stuck on the same chart position until the second week of drop by which time it may appear as if it dropped hard in chart positions br Example Guus Meeuwis s Ik wil dat ons land juicht The song entered the chart at superstip and rose up to superstip again in its second week The following week it was meant to drop in chart position but it remained in the position The following two weeks it went from to Because of this rule this single was the biggest fall down in the Top However this was not always the case Sometimes singles with a superstip status did drop for example if there s no room br Up until there were no clear rules on when a single could re enter the Top Apparently a song had to re enter at least in the top portions of the chart to be allowed back which happened occasionally In the case of re issued singles there were no rules whatsoever these singles could re enter anyway Since the mid s new rules were implemented meaning that only songs from recently deceased artists could return to the Top such as Michael Jackson s Billie Jean after the artist s death in Since normal re entries have started to occur again During the Christmas season however re entries of older Christmas classics e g Wham s Last Christmas or Mariah Carey s All I Want for Christmas Is You are barred from re entering the Top even though their streaming and airplay activity should earn them a Top position br Singles with double A side are listed separately in the Top due to the possible different amount of airplay the two songs get br Example Robbie Williams first single off his album Intensive Care was Tripping with the B side being Make Me Pure While Tripping topped the chart by peaking at Make Me Pure peaked at in the Top br br br Records milestones and achievements br This is a listing of significant achievements and
