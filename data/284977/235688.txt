daily print circulation of in December dropping to the following year Its Sunday sister paper is the Sunday Mirror Unlike other major British tabloids such as The Sun and the Daily Mail the Mirror has no separate Scottish edition this function is performed by the Daily Record and the Sunday Mail which incorporate certain stories from the Mirror that are of Scottish significance br Originally pitched to the middle class reader it was converted into a working class newspaper after in order to reach a larger audience It was founded by Alfred Harmsworth who sold it to his brother Harold Harmsworth from Lord Rothermere in In a restructuring of the media interests of the Harmsworth family led to the Mirror becoming a part of International Publishing Corporation During the mid s daily

period of crisis after his death before merging with the regional newspaper group Trinity in to form Trinity Mirror br br br History br br br br br The Daily Mirror was launched on November by Alfred Harmsworth later Lord Northcliffe as a newspaper for women run by women About the name he said I intend it to be really a mirror of feminine life as well on its grave as on its lighter sides to be entertaining without being frivolous and serious without being dull It cost one penny equivalent to p in br It was not an immediate success and in Harmsworth decided to turn it into a pictorial newspaper with a broader focus Harmsworth appointed Hamilton Fyfe as editor and all of the paper s female journalists were fired The masthead was changed to The Daily Illustrated Mirror which ran from January to April issues to when it reverted to The Daily Mirror The first issue of the relaunched paper did not have advertisements on the front page as previously but instead news text and engraved pictures of a traitor and an actress with the promise of photographs inside Two days later the price was dropped to one halfpenny and to the masthead was added A paper for men and women This combination was more successful by issue the guaranteed circulation was copies and by issue it had grown to by then the name had reverted and the front page was mainly photographs Circulation grew to making it the second largest morning newspaper br Alfred Harmsworth sold the newspaper to his brother Harold Harmsworth from Lord Rothermere in In the price was increased to one penny Circulation continued to grow in some issues sold more than a million copies a day making it the largest daily picture paper In the newspaper sponsored the Women s Olympiad held at Stamford Bridge in London br br Lord Rothermere was a friend of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler and directed the Mirror s editorial stance towards them in the early s On Monday January the Daily Mirror ran the headline Give the Blackshirts a helping hand urging readers to join Sir Oswald Mosley s British Union of Fascists and giving the address to which to send membership applications By the mid s the Mirror was struggling it and the Mail were the main casualties of the early s circulation war that saw the Daily Herald and the Daily Express establish circulations of more than two million and Rothermere decided to sell his shares in it br In Rothermere sold the paper to Harry Guy Bartholomew and Hugh Cudlipp With Cecil King Rothermere s nephew in charge of the paper s finances and Guy Bartholomew as editor during the late s the Mirror was transformed from a conservative middle class newspaper into a left wing paper for the working class Partly on the advice of the American advertising agency J Walter Thompson the Mirror became the first British paper to adopt the appearance of the New York tabloids The headlines became bigger the stories shorter and the illustrations more abundant By the publication was selling million copies a day In Hugh McClelland introduced his wild Western comic strip Beelzebub Jones in the Daily Mirror After taking over as cartoon chief at the Mirror in he dropped Beelzebub Jones and moved on to a variety of new strips br During the Second World War the Mirror positioned itself as the paper of the ordinary soldier and civilian and was critical of the political leadership and the established parties At one stage the paper was threatened with closure following the publication of a Philip Zec cartoon captioned by William Connor which was misinterpreted by Winston Churchill and Herbert Morrison In the UK general election the paper strongly supported the Labour Party in its eventual landslide victory In doing so the paper supported Herbert Morrison who co ordinated Labour s campaign and recruited his former antagonist Philip Zec to reproduce on the front page a popular VE Day cartoon on the morning of the election suggesting that Labour were the only party who could maintain peace in post war Britain By the late s it was selling million copies a day outstripping the Express for some years afterwards it dominated the British daily newspaper market selling more than million copies a day at its peak in the mid s br The Mirror was an influential model for German tabloid Bild which was founded in and became Europe s biggest selling newspaper br br In the Mirror and its stablemate the Sunday Pictorial later to become the Sunday Mirror began printing a northern edition in Manchester In it introduced the Andy Capp cartoon created by Reg Smythe from Hartlepool in the northern editions br The Mirror s mass working class readership had made it the United Kingdom s best selling daily tabloid newspaper In it acquired the Daily Herald the popular daily of the labour movement when it bought Odhams in one of a series of takeovers which created the International Publishing Corporation IPC The Mirror management did not want the Herald competing with the Mirror for readers and in relaunched it as a mid market paper now named The Sun When it failed to win readers The Sun was sold to Rupert Murdoch who immediately relaunched it as a more populist and sensationalist tabloid and a direct competitor to the Mirror br In an attempt to cater to a different kind of reader the Mirror launched the Mirrorscope pull out section on January The Press Gazette commented The Daily Mirror launched its revolutionary four page supplement Mirrorscope The ambitious brief for the supplement which ran on Wednesdays and Fridays was to deal with international affairs politics industry science the arts and business The British Journalism Review said in that Mirrorscope was a game attempt to provide serious analysis in the rough and tumble of the tabloids It failed to attract significant numbers of new readers and the pull out section was abandoned its final issue appearing on August br In The Sun overtook the Mirror in circulation and in the Mirror was sold to Robert Maxwell The first Mirror using colour appeared on the st August edition Following Maxwell s death in David Montgomery became Mirror Group s CEO and a period of cost cutting and production changes ensued The Mirror went through a protracted period of crisis before merging with the regional newspaper group Trinity to form Trinity Mirror in Printing of the Daily and Sunday Mirror moved to Trinity Mirror s facilities in Watford and Oldham br br br br br Under the editorship of Piers Morgan from October to May the paper saw a number of controversies Morgan was widely criticised and forced to apologise for the headline ACHTUNG SURRENDER For you Fritz ze Euro Championship is over a day before England met Germany in a semi final of the Euro football championships br In Morgan was the subject of an investigation after Suzy Jagger wrote a story in The Daily Telegraph revealing that he had bought worth of shares in the computer company Viglen soon before the Mirror s City Slickers column tipped Viglen as a good buy Morgan was found by the Press Complaints Commission to have breached the Code of Conduct on financial journalism but kept his job The City Slickers columnists Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell were both found to have committed further breaches of the Code and were sacked before the inquiry In further enquiry by the Department of Trade and Industry cleared Morgan from any charges On December Bhoyrul and Hipwell were convicted of conspiracy to breach the Financial Services Act During the trial it emerged that Morgan had bought worth of Viglen shares emptying his bank account and investing under his wife s name too br In the Mirror attempted to move mid market claiming to eschew the more trivial stories of show business and gossip The paper changed its masthead logo from red to black and occasionally blue in an attempt to dissociate itself from the term red top a term for a sensationalist mass market tabloid On April the red top came back Under then editor Piers Morgan the newspaper s editorial stance opposed the invasion of Iraq and ran many front pages critical of the war It also gave financial support to the February anti war protest paying for a large screen and providing thousands of placards Morgan re hired John Pilger who had been sacked during Robert Maxwell s ownership of the Mirror titles Despite such changes Morgan was unable to halt the paper s decline in circulation a decline shared by its direct tabloid rivals The Sun and the Daily Star br Morgan was fired from the Mirror on May after authorising the newspaper s publication of photographs allegedly showing Iraqi prisoners being abused by British Army soldiers from the Queen s Lancashire Regiment Within days the photographs were shown to be fakes Under the headline SORRY WE WERE HOAXED the Mirror responded that it had fallen victim to a calculated and malicious hoax and apologised for the publication of the photographs br br br present br The Mirror s front page on November after the re election of George W Bush as U S president read How can people be so DUMB It provided a list of states and their alleged average IQ showing the Bush states all below average intelligence except for Virginia and all John Kerry states at or above average intelligence The source for this table was The Economist although it was a hoax Richard Wallace became editor in br On May Trinity Mirror announced the merger of the Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror into a single seven day a week title Richard Wallace and Tina Weaver the respective editors of the Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror were simultaneously dismissed and Lloyd Embley editor of The People appointed as editor of the combined title with immediate effect In Reach plc acquired the Northern Shell titles including the Daily Express which led to a number of editor moves across the stable Lloyd Embley was then promoted to editor in chief across the entire group and Alison Phillips previously deputy editor in chief for the Trinity Mirror titles was appointed editor of the Daily Mirror br br br Political allegiance br The Mirror has consistently supported the Labour Party since the UK general election On the day of the UK general election the Daily Mirror urged its readers to vote for the governing Labour Party led by James Callaghan As widely predicted by the opinion polls Labour lost this election and Conservative Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister The Mirror s continued support of the Labour government was in spite of its falling popularity over the previous few months which had been the result of the Winter of Discontent where the country was crippled by numerous public sector strikes br By the time of the UK general election Labour support was at a postwar low partly due to the strong challenge by the recently formed SDP Liberal Alliance Despite this the Daily Mirror remained loyal to Labour and urged its readers to vote for the party then led by Michael Foot condemning the Thatcher led Tory government for its waste of our nation as well as the rise in unemployment that Thatcher s Conservative government had seen in its first term in power largely due to monetarist economic policies to reduce inflation although the government s previously low popularity had dramatically improved since the success of the Falklands conflict a year earlier However the Conservatives were re elected and Labour suffered its worst postwar general election result only narrowly bettering the SDP Liberal Alliance in terms of votes whilst winning considerably more seats br At the UK general election the Daily Mirror remained loyal to Labour led by Neil Kinnock and urged its readers with the slogan You know he s right chuck her out By this stage unemployment was falling and inflation had remained low for several years As a result the Tories were re elected for a third successive term although Labour did cut the Tory majority slightly For the UK general election the Daily Mirror continued to support Labour still led by Neil Kinnock By this stage Thatcher had stepped down and the Tory government was now led by John Major The election was won by the Conservatives although Labour managed to significantly cut the Tory majority to seats compared to the triple digit figure of the previous two elections which led to a difficult term for Major The outcome of this election had been far less predictable than any of the previous three elections as opinion polls over the previous three years had shown both parties in the lead although any Labour lead in the polls had been relatively narrow since the Conservative government s change of leader from Thatcher to Major in November in spite of the onset of the early s recession which had pushed unemployment up again after several years of decline Labour s credibility was helped by plans including extra National Health Service NHS funding and moving away from firm commitments on re nationalisation to reverse the Conservative policy of privatisation but its decision to be up front about tax increases was seen as a key factor in its failure to win br By the time of the UK general election support for the Labour Party by then led by Tony Blair in the opinion polls had exceeded that of support for the Conservative government led by John Major since late whose reduced popularity largely blamed on the failings of Black Wednesday in September of that year and it had failed to recover popularity in spite of a strong economic recovery and fall in unemployment A reinvented New Labour had further improved its credibility under Blair by promising traditional Labour essentials including more funding for healthcare and education but also promising not to increase income tax and ending its commitment to the nationalisation of leading industries The Daily Mirror urged its readers that their country needed Blair and to vote Labour br The election produced a Labour landslide that ended the party s year exile from power followed by two further wins in the and UK general elections On May the newspaper printed a picture of Conservative leader David Cameron with a giant red cross through his face The headline read How to stop him in reference to the UK general election two days later confirming the Daily Mirror s Labour allegiance The election ended in Britain s first hung parliament since but Cameron still became prime minister within days as the Conservatives formed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats The Daily Mirror was the only leading national newspaper to remain loyal to Labour and Gordon Brown at a time when opinion polls showed the party on course for their worst election result since br The newspaper was critical of the Liberal Democrats for forming the coalition which enabled the Conservatives to form a new government in and branded leader Nick Clegg as Pinickio alluding to the lying fictional character Pinocchio for going back on numerous pre election pledges It has frequently referred to the party as the Fib Dems or Lib Dumbs The Daily Mirror endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run up for the U S presidential election Also in the newspaper asked for Jeremy Corbyn s resignation for the good of the party and of the country Despite this critical position the Daily Mirror endorsed the Labour Party in the UK general election For the UK general election the newspaper again endorsed Labour to protect NHS end poverty and for a kinder Britain The Daily Mirror threw its support behind the Labour Party for the UK general election stating that a Labour government is more crucial than ever for the new generation br br br Famous features br Cartoon strips Pip Squeak and Wilfred Jane Garth

Scottish politician George Galloway won libel damages from the Daily Mirror and its Scottish sister the Daily Record who had falsely accused him of making malicious allegations about their foreign editor Nicholas Davies Galloway had used parliamentary privilege to call for an independent investigation into allegations about Davies made in the book The Samson Option br In May the Daily Mirror published what it claimed were photos of British soldiers abusing Iraqi prisoners at an unspecified location in Iraq The decision to publish the photos subsequently shown to be hoaxes led to Piers Morgan s sacking as editor of the paper on May The Daily Mirror then stated that it was the subject of a calculated and malicious hoax The newspaper issued a statement apologising for the printing of the pictures The paper s deputy editor Des Kelly took over as acting editor during the crisis The tabloid s rival The Sun offered a reward for the arrest and conviction of those accused of faking the Mirror photographs br In June American model Caprice Bourret won a libel case against the Daily Mirror for an article in April that year which falsely claimed that her acting career had failed br In

departure from Mock the Week The Mirror had argued he was forced to quit but this was found to be libellous by the court br On March the Mirror painted the traditional Russian pancake celebration Maslenitsa as a Hooligan training ground One of the centuries old tradition in this Russian festival is wall to wall stenka na stenku Ru which is sparring between men dressed in traditional folk clothes This tradition was wrongly represented by the Mirror in the pictures and text labelled as violent acts and living in fear without giving context or any information about this Russian traditional festival at all The Mirror article was titled Russia s Ultra yobs infiltrated amid warnings England fans could be KILLED at World Cup and received negative receptions from Russian media also being described as fake news Representatives of the Daily Mirror acknowledged that the original material of the publication about Russian Hooligans was incorrectly illustrated with images of the

perceived double standard of how attacks conducted by Islamists are portrayed more negatively than those by white supremacists These criticisms typically contrasted the Daily Mirror s coverage of Tarrant with its coverage of Orlando nightclub shooting perpetrator Omar Mateen three years earlier who was covered with the headline ISIS Maniac Kills in Gay Nightclub br br br Significant staff
