of Fame s Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll ranked at in the iteration of Rolling Stone s Greatest Songs of All Time and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in February br Hound Dog has been recorded more than times The best known version is the July recording by Elvis Presley which ranked number on Rolling Stone s list of the Greatest Songs of All Time in but was excluded from the revised list in in favor of Thornton s version it is also one of the best selling singles of all time Presley s version which sold about million copies globally was his best selling song and an emblem

inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in and it is listed as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame s Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll br Hound Dog has been at the center of controversies and several lawsuits including disputes over authorship royalties and copyright infringement by the many answer songs released by such artists as Rufus Thomas and Roy Brown From the s onward the song has been featured in numerous films br br br Background and composition br On August R B bandleader Johnny Otis asked year old songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller to his home to meet blues singer Willie Mae Big Mama Thornton Thornton had been signed by Diamond Don Robey s Houston based Peacock Records the year before and after two failed singles Robey had enlisted Otis to reverse her fortunes After hearing Thornton rehearse several songs Leiber and Stoller forged a tune to suit her personality brusque and badass In an interview in Rolling Stone in April Stoller said She was a wonderful blues singer with a great moaning style But it was as much her appearance as her blues style that influenced the writing of Hound Dog and the idea that we wanted her to growl it Leiber recalled We saw Big Mama and she knocked me cold She looked like the biggest baddest saltiest chick you would ever see And she was mean a lady bear as they used to call em She must have been pounds and she had all these scars all over her face conveying words which could not be sung But how to do it without actually saying it And how to do it telling a story I couldn t just have a song full of expletives In Leiber said I was trying to get something like the Furry Lewis phrase Dirty Mother Furya I was looking for something closer to that but I couldn t find it because everything I went for was too coarse and would not have been playable on the air Using a black slang expression referring to a man who sought a woman to take care of him the song s opening line You ain t nothin but a hound dog was a euphemism said Leiber The song a Southern blues lament is the tale of a woman throwing a gigolo out of her house and her life br br The song was written for a woman to sing in which she berates her selfish exploitative man and in it she expresses a woman s rejection of a man the metaphorical dog in the title According to Iain Thomas Hound Dog embodies the Thornton persona she had crafted as a comedienne prior to entering the music business by parading the classic puns extended metaphors and sexual double entendres so popular with the bawdy genre R B expert George A Moonoogian concurs calling it a biting and scathing satire in the double entendre genre of s rhythm and blues br Leiber and Stoller wrote the song Hound Dog in to minutes with Leiber scribbling the lyrics in pencil on ordinary paper and without musical notation in the car on the way to Stoller s apartment Said Leiber Hound Dog took like twelve minutes That s not a complicated piece of work But the rhyme scheme was difficult Also the metric structure of the music was not easy According to Leiber as soon as they reached the parking lot and Stoller s Plymouth I was beating out a rhythm we called the buck dance on the roof of the car We got to Johnny Otis s house and Mike went right to the piano didn t even bother to sit down He had a cigarette in his mouth that was burning his left eye and he started to play the song br Leiber and Stoller along with Johnny Otis also wrote a different version to the Hound Dog song structure on behalf of Big Mama Thornton recorded with an alternative lyric entitled Tom Cat br br br Big Mama Thornton s version br Thornton s recording of Hound Dog is credited with helping to spur the evolution of black R B into rock music Brandeis University professor Stephen J Whitefield in his book In Search of American Jewish Culture regards Hound Dog as a marker of the success of race mixing in music a year before the desegregation of public schools was mandated in Brown v Board of Education Leiber regarded the original recording by the pound blues belter Big Mama Thornton as his favorite version while Stoller said If I had to name my favorite recordings I d say they are Big Mama Thornton s Hound Dog and Peggy Lee s Is That All There Is br In Leiber and Stoller recalled that during the rehearsal Thornton sang the song as a ballad Leiber said that this was not the way they planned and sang it for her with Stoller on piano as an example of the concept Thornton agreed to try their recommendation br According to Maureen Mahon a music professor at New York University Thornton s version is an important part of the beginning of rock and roll especially in its use of the guitar as the key instrument br br br Recording br Thornton recorded Hound Dog at Radio Recorders Annex in Los Angeles on August the day after its composition It subsequently became her biggest hit According to Hound Dog The Leiber and Stoller Autobiography Thornton s Hound Dog was the first record that Leiber and Stoller produced themselves taking over from bandleader Johnny Otis Said Stoller br br We were worried because the drummer wasn t getting the feel that Johnny had created in rehearsal Johnny Jerry said can t you play drums on the record No one can nail that groove like you Who s gonna run the session he asked Silence You two he asked The kids are gonna run a recording session Sure I said The kids wrote it Let the kids do it br Johnny smiled and said Why not br Otis played drums on the recording replacing Ledard Kansas City Bell As Otis was still signed exclusively to Federal Records a subsidiary of Syd Nathan s King Records as Kansas City Bill or perhaps with Mercury Records at this time Otis used the pseudonym Kansas City Bill after his drummer Kansas City Bell on this record Therefore Otis Louisiana blues guitarist Pete Guitar Lewis and Puerto Rican bass player Mario Delagarde some sources say erroneously it was Albert Winston are listed as Kansas City Bill Orchestra on the Peacock record labels br During the rehearsal Leiber objected to Thornton s vocal approach as she was crooning the lyrics rather than belting them out Although intimidated by her size and facial scarring Leiber protested to which Thornton responded with an icy glare and told him White boy don t you be tellin me how to sing the blues After this exchange Leiber sang the song himself to demonstrate how they wanted it done After that according to Stoller s later recollection Thornton understood the bawdy style they were looking for br Speaking to music writer Ralph J Gleason Thornton recalled that she added a few interjections of her own played around with the rhythm some of the choruses have thirteen rather than twelve bars and had the band bark and howl like hound dogs at the end of the song I started to sing the words and join in some of my own All that talkin and hollerin that s my own Thornton interacts constantly in a call and response fashion during a one minute long guitar solo by Lewis These verbal interjections sometimes called blues talk are common in blues music Years later Thornton helped launch a controversy over Hound Dog claiming to have written it When questioned further on the matter Thornton explained that while the song had been composed by Leiber and Stoller she had transformed it They gave me the words but I changed it around and did it my way In his book Race Rock and Elvis Michael T Bertrand says that Thornton s explanation ingenuously stresses artist interpretation as the sole yardstick with which to measure authenticity br Thornton recorded two takes of the song and the second take was released Habanera and mambo elements can be found in this recording Puerto Rican bass player Mario Delagarde is credited with adding a jazz based rhythm Influenced by African American musical cultures its sounds range from the gravelly beginning of several phrases to her spoken and howled interpolations and the ending with dog sounds from the band According to musicologist Robert Fink Thornton s delivery has flexible phrasing making use of micro inflections and syncopations Each has a focal accent which is never repeated According to Maureen Mahon br br Thornton s Hound Dog differed from most of the rhythm and blues records of the era in its spare arrangement There are none of the honking saxophone solos or pounding piano flourishes that marked the R B sound Instead supported by guitar bass and drums her resonant vocals dominate the foreground conveying her haughty relief at being through with a trifling man Thornton maintains a confident attitude bringing the blues tradition of outspoken women into the R B context and helping to set the style for rock and roll by putting sexuality and play with gender expectations in the foreground br On September the copyright application for Hound Dog was lodged On the application the words and music are attributed to Thornton and recording executive Don Robey with the copyright claimants listed as Murphy L Robey W Willie Mae Thornton A It was renewed subsequently on May with the same details br br br Release and reception br In late February Hound Dog was released by Peacock Peacock with the song credited erroneously on the label to Leiber Stroller sic Otis Thornton recalled later that she learned her record was in circulation while she was on her way to a performance with the Johnny Otis Orchestra during this tour in Dayton Ohio I was going to the theater and I just turned the radio on in the car and the man said Here s a record that s going nationwide Hound Dog by Willie Mae Thornton I said That s me laughs I hadn t heard the record in so long So when we get to the theater they was blasting it You could hear it from the theater from the loudspeaker They were just playing Hound Dog all over the theater So I goes up in the operating room I say Do you mind playing that again Cause I hadn t heard the record in so long I forgot the words myself So I stood there while he was playing it listening to it So that evening I sang it on the show and everybody went for it Hound Dog just took off like a jet br On March Hound Dog was advertised in Billboard and reviewed positively on March as a new record to watch described as a wild and exciting rhumba blues with infectious backing that rocks all the way According to Johnny Ace biographer James M Salem The rawness of the sound combined with the overt sexuality of the lyric made Hound Dog an immediate smash hit in urban black America from late March to the middle of July Hound Dog takes off immediately and looks like a national hit record Rufus Thomas quickly records an answer song called Bear Cat on Sun Thornton s record is such a big seller that Peacock Records has three new pressing plants running full time to try and keep up with demand Debuting in the charts on March it spent fourteen weeks on the Billboard Rhythm and Blues charts seven of them at number one By April Cash Box magazine listed the song as the nation s top selling blues record and it topped the charts in New York Chicago New Orleans San Francisco Newark Memphis Dallas Cincinnati St Louis and Los Angeles By mid summer it is obvious that Hound Dog will be the biggest seller in the history of Peacock Records The song was named as the Best Rhythm and Blues song of by Cash Box magazine and was ranked number three on Billboard s Best Selling Rhythm Blues Chart for br Don Robey estimated that Thornton s version of Hound Dog sold between and copies and would have sold more had its sales not been diluted by an abundance of cover versions and answer songs The success of Hound Dog secured Peacock Record s place as a major independent label However despite its success neither the composers nor artist were compensated well for their efforts According to Stoller Big Mama s Hound Dog went to number one sold a million copies and did nothing for our bank statements We were getting screwed After suing Robey We were given an advance check for said Stoller but the check bounced As a result Leiber and Stoller started their own label Spark Records and publishing company Quintet Music Those ventures were successful but Leiber and Stoller would only earn substantial royalties from Hound Dog when it was covered by Elvis Presley RCA in July Similarly Thornton stated That song sold over two million records I got one check for and never saw another In she told Rolling Stone Didn t get no money from them at all Everybody livin in a house but me I m just livin br br br Re releases br By July the rock n roll age was upon the world and as the new sensation Elvis Presley recorded Hound Dog to international acclaim Peacock re released Willa Mae Thornton s original by August backing it with Rock a Bye Baby Peacock but it failed to chart In Australia and New Zealand Prestige Records founded in Auckland by year old Phil Warren and Bruce Henderson released the same record on licence in Prestige PSP but the composition is credited to Robey Thornton Leiber Stoller By early Willa Mae Thornton is seen as one who is out of the rock pop mainstream and so her affiliation with Peacock Records ends Thornton continues to make personal appearances and is always remembered for her original version of Hound Dog which gets a spate of airplay during the summer of which leads to another re release of the original On October Thornton s live performance of Hound Dog with Eddie Boyd and Buddy Guy at American Folk Blues Festival in Hamburg Germany is recorded and released subsequently by Fontana Records on an album American Folk Blues Festival Fontana TL with other artists br br br Awards and accolades br In February Thornton s recording of Hound Dog was inducted into Grammy Hall of

His Comets in the fall of told of performing the song when given the spotlight at live performances I used to do Hound Dog Haley would get mad at me if I d do that This was even before Presley did it Haley didn t like those guys from Philadelphia that wrote the song As Leiber and Stoller were not from Philadelphia and Haley recorded other Leiber and Stoller songs Haley was probably referring to Freddie Bell and Bernie Lowe of Philadelphia s Teen Records br In later years Big Mama Thornton s version was covered by such artists as the Dirty Blues Band on their album Dirty Blues Band Etta James Robert Palmer and Macy Gray br br br Answers and parodies br By the end of at least six answer songs that responded to Big Mama Thornton s original version of Hound Dog were released According to Peacock s Don Robey these songs were bastardizations of the original and reduced its sales potential br br br Bear Cat br The first and most popular answer song to Hound Dog was Bear Cat The Answer To Hound Dog Sun recorded at Sun Studios at Union Avenue Memphis Tennessee on March just two weeks after Thornton s original version was released and even before a review of Hound Dog had been published in Billboard Bear Cat had new lyrics written by Sun Records founder Sam Phillips in which he altered the gender of the singer who bemoaned that his woman was a bear cat a Jazz Age slang term for a hot blooded or fiery girl According to Phillips biographer Peter Guralnick br br Sam was knocked out by Big Mama Thornton s Hound Dog the first time he heard it Performed with ripsaw gusto by the singer and modified by a delicate Latin flavored rhumba boogie beat the record struck a communal chord somewhere between low comedy and bedrock truth It totally tickled Sam on both levels I said my God it s so true You ain t nothing but a hound dog You ain t met your responsibilities You didn t go to work like you should And it gave him an immediate idea for a follow up from the man s point of view Bear Cat i n the time honored tradition of answer songs was a virtual carbon copy of Hound Dog with lyrics chord progressions and rhythmic structure all patterned directly on the original br Looking for a suitable man to record this song Phillips selected part time local WDIA disk jockey Rufus Thomas who adopted the nickname Rufus Hound Dog Thomas for this recording With his gruff Louis Armstrong influenced voice quick wit and eye popping antics he was the perfect candidate to reply to the harsh accusations Big Mama Thornton had thrown out in her song this time leveling them at a bossy woman Despite his reluctance to record the song and his reservations about the band assembled by Phillips Thomas threw himself into the song with the same brash charm that he brought to all his performances complete with yowls growls and fervent imprecations The record s spare electric guitar work by Memphis bluesman Joe Hill Louis was greatly influenced by that of Pete Lewis on the original According to James M Salem br br I nstead of barking and howling there is meowing and hissing in the background In true answer form the gender of the participants was reversed This time the protagonist is male directly challenging the worthless female of the original song correcting her previous insults and re directing them at her You know what you said about me woman says the man in open confrontation Well You ain t nothin but a bear cat scratchin at my door All the irony and sarcasm of the original is captured in the answer even the sexuality You can purr pretty kitty but I ain t gonna rub you no more br While the result was peppier than Big Mama s version with a more straight ahead beat Phillips was under no illusions about surpassing the original Hell we didn t come close to being as good as Big Mama She could have done that song a cappella and convinced me that by God you ain t nothing but a damned hound dog Thomas was dissatisfied with the result especially Joe Hill Louis s country style blues guitar playing In Robert Palmer wrote Even today Rufus takes perverse delight in pointing out the wrong notes in Louis s solo br Within two weeks Bear Cat Sun was in stores prompting Billboard to describe it on March as the fastest answer song to hit the market It became both Thomas and Sun Records first hit More than copies were ordered in the first days by distributors and by mid April it had charted nationally eventually reaching number three on the R B charts However as Phillips claimed a writing credit for the song a copyright infringement suit ensued that nearly bankrupted Phillips record label br br br Other answer records br In the months after the release of Hound Dog and Bear Cat a spate of answer records followed br br On March Blues shouter Roy Brown recorded Mr Hound Dog s in Town for King Records While it had the same melody and many of the same lyrics as the original Brown is credited as the sole writer Despite the threat of legal action Brown s Mr Hound Dog s in Town was still being advertised in Billboard on June br Vocalist Charlie Gore and guitarist Louis Innis recorded You Ain t Nothin But A Female Hound Dog King for King Records on March This song was credited to Innis Lois Mann a pseudonym of King Records owner Syd Nathan the latter his wife s maiden name and Johnny Otis br At the request of Leonard Chess Blues guitarist John Brim wrote an answer song called Rattlesnake for Chess Records Checker subsidiary In March Brim and his His Gary Kings recorded Rattlesnake Checker at Universal Recording in Chicago Rattlesnake and It Was a Dream were backed by Little Walter on blues harp Willie Dixon on string bass Fred Below on drums and Louis and Dave Myers on guitar However when Don Robey threatened an injunction against Sun Records for the similar Bear Cat Leonard and Phil Chess decided to not to release Rattlesnake at that time In these songs were released officially on Whose Muddy Shoes Chess LP with songs by both Brim and Elmore James and the backing musicians credited as his Stompers br Jake Porter s Combo Records released Real Gone Hound Dog Combo an obscure answer record to Hound Dog by Chuck Higgins and His Mellotones with a vocal by Higgins brother Daddy Cleanhead The composition was credited to Higgins and Porter as V Haven br Call Me a Hound Dog written by Bob Geddins in which the hound dog states his case was recorded by Blues singer Jimmy Wilson as Jimmie Wilson and His All Stars with Hal King Solomon on piano and released by Geddins Big Town Records in May Big Town Records The review in the May edition of Billboard describes this song as the latest and possibly the last in the long line of answers to Hound Dog featuring Jimmy Wilson singing the tune okay style Ork backs him in a blues manner but they could have added a stronger beat br Former Our Gang child actor Eugene Jackson and actress Juanita Moore backed by the Eugene Jackson Trio and All Stars also recorded You Call Me a Hound Dog about this time which was released on John Dolphin s Recorded In Hollywood label A br New Hound Dog Big Town by Frank Dual Trumpeter Motley and His Motley Crew with vocals provided by Curley Bridges was recorded in October for Big Town Records a subsidiary of Star Records owned by Bob Geddins Motley is credited as the sole composer and King Herbert Whitaker plays tenor saxophone This song is described as the first rocking rearrangement of Hound Dog It was re released in Canada in by Quality Records Quality K br When the dust settled the publishing for Hound Dog in all variations remained with Lion and writing credit with Leiber and Stoller In April Billboard s Rolontz summed up the events thusly The year saw an important precedent set in regard to answer tunes since the Hound Dog decision few record firms have attempted to answer smash hits by other companies by using same tune with different lyrics br br br Rip offs br Two records were released that were neither cover versions of nor answers to Thornton s release yet used a similar melody without any attribution to Leiber and Stoller The first was Smiley Lewis s Play Girl credited to D Bartholomew and released by the Imperial Records label Imperial by the end of March Described as a stomping uptempo boogie rocker it began You ain t nothin but a Play Girl Staying out all night long In April female impersonator Jesse Big Tiny Kennedy recorded Country Boy accompanied by His Orchestra that was released by RCA s Groove Records Groove G by May While credited solely to Kennedy this song has a similar melody to Hound Dog Country Boy has a deceptively slouching flip on the Hound Dog motif this time with Tiny proclaiming proudly that he ain t nothing but a country boy br In the early s Robert Loers owner of Dutch label Redita Records found a song with the same melody as Hound Dog called You Ain t Nuttin But a Juicehead on an anonymous acetate at Select o Hits the Memphis distributorship owned by Sam Phillips brother Tom where Sun artifacts were stored br br When Juice Head first appeared on a Redita Records LP in it was credited to Rosco Gordon But it s not Rosco It simply is not him Really Even Rosco confirmed that It might not even be a Memphis Recording Service demo Just substitute the words Hound Dog for Juice Head and what have you got Of course the inspiration for this song came from Big Mama Thornton s Hound Dog or perhaps even from Rufus Thomas Bear Cat But the song s other parent is Eddie Vinson s slowed down Juicehead Blues which harks to the previous decade If indeed this originated from Sam Phillips studio it was nothing that Phillips needed to touch because it was another lawsuit waiting to happen br Philip H Ennis sees Two Hound Dogs which was recorded on May by Bill Haley His Comets Decca as a response to Thornton s recording While not an answer record in the traditional sense the lyric characterized Rhythm and Blues as the titular Two Hound Dogs an apparent testament to the stature of Hound Dog br br br Freddie Bell and the Bellboys versions br br By Philadelphia based Teen Records co founder Bernie Lowe suspected that Hound Dog could potentially have greater appeal but knew it had to be sanitized for mainstream acceptance and so asked popular Las Vegas lounge act Freddie Bell of Freddie Bell and the Bellboys who had been performing songs with tongue in cheek humour as the band in residence at The Silver Queen Bar and Cocktail Lounge at The Sands Hotel and Casino soon after its opening in December to rewrite the lyrics for their first release on his label br Bell removed innuendoes like You can wag your tail but I ain t gonna feed you no more and replaced them with sanitized lyrics changing a racy song about a disappointing lover into a song that was literally about a dog Musically he gave the song a rock and roll rhythm Jerry Leiber the original lyricist found these changes irritating saying that the rewritten words made no sense Described as one of their trademark spoofs the Bellboys version became a staple of their Las Vegas act br In early this version of Hound Dog became the first record released on Teen Records TEEN a subsidiary of the equally obscure Sound Records that was owned by Lowe jazz impresario Nat Segal who owned Downbeat the first integrated nightclub in Philadelphia and partially by American Bandstand s creator and first host Bob Horn Their version of Hound Dog which includes arf arf dog sounds made by the band throughout the song also included the most overused rhythmic pattern of the s the three beat Latin bass riff pioneered by Dave Bartholomew that was also used in Rufus Thomas Bear Cat a answer song to Thornton s original recording and subsequently in Presley s recording In June music researcher and historian George A Moonoogian also found a stylistic similarity between Frank Dual Trumpeter Motley His Crew s number New Hound Dog Big Town and Bell s Teen Records release of Hound Dog On the single s label authorship is credited to Leibler sic and Stoller No credit is given to Bell or anyone else for the revised lyrics Their recording of Hound Dog was a local hit in the Philadelphia area and received lots of radio play on the east coast and Bell found himself with a regional hit that included Philadelphia Cleveland and New York Despite Hound Dog spending weeks at number one on the pre Dick Clark Bandstand it attracted no national attention However the regional popularity of this release along with the group s showmanship yielded a tour an appearance in the seminal pioneer Rock and Roll musical film Rock Around the Clock in January and eventually a recording contract with Mercury Records Wing Records subsidiary by February br In May two months before Presley recorded his version Bell and the Bell Boys recorded a more up tempo version of the song for Mercury that was over seconds shorter and that also omitted the comedic arf arf dog sounds of their Teen Records version However Mercury did not release this new version until after the success of Presley s version Initially released in France in late on an EP Rock n Roll Barclay it was released subsequently in in Australia July Mercury Records Sweden Rock n Roll Vol Mercury EP and Norway Mercury EP MN As the legal dispute about its composition had not been resolved authorship of the Mercury Records version is attributed to Leiber Stoller Otis Mercury finally released Freddie Bell and the Bellboys new version of Hound Dog in the USA on their debut album Rock Roll All Flavors Mercury MG in January but now crediting Leiber Stoller only Both the Teen Records and the Mercury Records versions of Hound Dog are included in the compilation album Rockin Is Our Business Germany Bear Family Records BCD br br br Elvis Presley s version br br Elvis Presley and his band first encountered Hound Dog at the Sands Casino in Las Vegas Nevada in Presley had been booked from April through May to appear at the Venus Room of the New Frontier Hotel and Casino as an extra added attraction third on the bill to the Freddy Martin Orchestra and comedian Shecky Greene br It was his first appearance in Las Vegas However because of audience dissatisfaction low attendance and unsavory behavior by underage fans the booking was reduced to one week Freddie Bell and the Bellboys were still the resident act at the Silver Queen Bar in the Sands and Hound Dog remained a staple for them Presley and his band attended a performance and loved their burlesque reworking of Hound Dog According to Paul W Papa From the first time Elvis heard this song he was hooked He went back over and over again until he learned the chords and lyrics When asked about Hound Dog Presley s guitarist Scotty Moore and his drummer D J Fontana agreed that Elvis had borrowed the Bellboys version after seeing them perform the song live br In Leiber and Stoller confirmed that Presley was familiar with Thornton s record of the song but he didn t do her version he had learned the song from Freddie Bell The Bellboys Presley first added Hound Dog to his live performances at the New Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas Ace Collins indicates that Far from being the frenetic hard driving song that he would eventually record Elvis early live renditions of Hound Dog usually moved pretty slowly with an almost burlesque feel Presley modelled his performance particularly his hip gyrations on the Bellboys version which was a Las Vegas style comic burlesque br Just weeks after they had seen Bell and the Bellboys perform Hound Dog became Elvis and Scotty and Bill s closing number for the first time on May at Ellis Auditorium in Memphis during the Memphis Cotton Festival before an audience of The song remained his standard closer until the late s By the spring of Presley was fast becoming a national phenomenon and teenagers came to his concerts in unprecedented numbers with the enthusiastic reaction particularly to Hound Dog causing riots at some performances Presley researcher Guillermo F Perez Arg ello contends that br br Whatever Presley got from hearing Freddy Bell s version which was sometime in April of lasted a couple of months only In fact he sang it times live at concerts and on television using Bell s vocal arrangement but which also included his own blues version at half speed and only at the end until he recorded it with what was undeniably his own arrangement based not just on Scotty Moore s tremendously modern guitar work but his own rage and disgust at what had taken place the night before at Steve Allen s Tonight show when he was forced to sing the song to a basset hound and dressed in tails while simultaneously facing an audience of million And once he recorded it it was his version which he chose to deliver although by the end of he d added inflections from the Thornton version as well br br br Response br Larry Birnbaum described Elvis Presley s rendition of Hound Dog as an emblem of the rock n roll revolution George Plasketes argues that Elvis Presley s version of Hound Dog should not be considered a cover since most listeners were innocent of Willie Mae Thornton s original release Michael Coyle asserts that Hound Dog like almost all of Presley s covers were all of material whose brief moment in the limelight was over without the songs having become standards While because of its popularity Presley s recording arguably usurped the original Plasketes concludes anyone who s ever heard the Big Mama Thornton original would probably argue otherwise Presley was aware of and appreciated Big Mama Thornton s original recording of Hound Dog and had a copy in his personal record collection Ron Smith a schoolfriend of Presley s says he remembers Elvis singing along to a version by Tommy Duncan lead singer for the classic lineup of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys According to another schoolmate Elvis favorite r n b song was Bear Cat the Answer to Hound Dog by Rufus Thomas a hero of Presley s br Agreeing with Robert Fink who claims that Hound Dog as performed by Presley was intended as a burlesque troping off white overreactions to a black sexual innuendo Freya Jarman Ivens asserts that Presley s version of Hound Dog started its life as a blackface comedy in the manner of Al Jolson but more especially African American performers with a penchant for clowning Louis Armstrong Dizzy Gillespie and Louis Jordan It was Freddie Bell and the Bellboys performance of the song with Bell s amended lyrics that influenced Presley s decision to perform and later record and release his own version Elvis s version of Hound Dog came about not as an attempt to cover Thornton s record but as an imitation of a parody of her record performed by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys The words the tempo and the arrangement of Elvis Hound Dog come not from Thornton s version of the song but from the Bellboys According to Rick Coleman the Bellboys version featured Dave Bartholomew s three beat Latin riff which had been heard in Bill Haley s Shake Rattle and Roll Just as Haley had borrowed the riff from Bartholomew Presley borrowed it from Bell and the Bellboys The Latin riff form that was used in Presley s Hound Dog was known as Habanera rhythm which is a Spanish and African American musical beat form After the release of Hound Dog by Presley the Habanera rhythm gained much popularity in American popular music br When asked if Bell had any objections to Presley recording his own version Bell gave Colonel Tom Parker Presley s manager a copy of his Teen Records recording hoping that if Presley recorded it he might reap some benefit when his own version was released on an album According to Bell Parker promised me that if I gave him the song the next time Elvis went on tour I would be the opening act for him which never happened In another interview Bell said I hope my career is more than giving Hound Dog to Elvis In May two months before Presley s release Bell re recorded a more frantic version of the song for the Mercury label however it was not released as a single until It was later included on Bell s album Rock Roll All Flavors Mercury Records MG br br br Television performances br Presley first performed Hound Dog for a nationwide television audience on The Milton Berle Show on June It was his second appearance on Berle s program At Berle s request Presley appeared without his guitar the first time he had done so on national television By this time Presley s band had added instrumental flourishes to the song Scotty Moore had added a guitar solo and D J Fontana had added a drum roll between verses The performance started in an upbeat tempo in the style of the Bellboys but dropped to a half tempo for the dramatic finish Presley s movements during the performance were energetic and sexually charged especially his hip gyrations and the reactions of young women in the studio audience were enthusiastic as shown on the broadcast According to Robert Fink Hound Dog as performed by Presley on Berle s show was intended to be humorous troping off white overreactions to a black sexual innuendo Over people saw the performance br Unfortunately for Presley the mainstream public did not find the sexually charged performance amusing and controversy erupted It was the first major controversy of Presley s career Letters of protest poured into the NBC mailroom critics called the performance vulgar moral watchdogs raised concerns about juvenile delinquency and even the Catholic Church published an opinion piece entitled Beware Elvis Presley The performance earned Presley the sobriquet Elvis the Pelvis Ed Sullivan host of a popular televised variety show publicly stated that he would never feature Presley Steve Allen who had already booked Presley for The Steve Allen Show on NBC faced pressure from network executives to cancel the performance Allen refused insisting he would control the performance so it would not offend the public s sensibilities br Presley appeared on The Steve Allen Show on July that year Steve Allen who was notoriously contemptuous of rock n roll music and especially songs such as Hound Dog ensured that the performance had a comedic bent cracking jokes and presenting Presley with a signed prop toilet paper roll as a play on the name of the genre Presley performed in a tuxedo while singing an abbreviated version of Hound Dog to an actual top hat wearing Basset Hound Presley was reportedly a good sport about the silliness while on the show but Presley would later recall it as an extremely embarrassing moment Scotty Moore later suggested that Presley s anger about the way Allen orchestrated the performance drove the aggressive style that he recorded Hound Dog in the very next day br Although Ed Sullivan had publicly stated he would never invite Presley onto his show the ratings success of Presley s appearance on The Steve Allen Show convinced him to reconsider Sullivan wound up paying for Presley to appear on the Ed Sullivan Show three times Hound Dog was performed during each appearance On September with the song topping several U S charts Presley s set featured an abbreviated version of Hound Dog During his second appearance on October Presley jokingly introduced the song as one of the saddest songs we ve ever heard before playing it in full In the third and final appearance on January Presley performed seven songs including Hound Dog This proved to be Presley s last live performance on American television br br br Recording br For hours from pm on July the day after the Steve Allen Show performance Presley recorded Hound Dog along with Don t Be Cruel and Any Way You Want Me for RCA Victor at RCA s New York City studio with his regular band of Scotty Moore on lead guitar Bill Black on bass D J Fontana on drums and backing vocals from the Jordanaires Despite its popularity in his live shows Presley had neither planned nor prepared to record Hound Dog but agreed to do so at the insistence of RCA s assigned producer Stephen H Sholes who argued that Hound Dog was so identified with Elvis that fans would demand a record of the concert standard According to Ace Collins Elvis may not have wanted to record Hound Dog but he had a definite idea of how he wanted the finished product to sound Though he usually slowed it down and treated it like a blues number in concert in the studio Elvis wanted the song to come off as fast and dynamic While the producing credit was given to Sholes the studio recordings reveal that Presley produced the songs himself which is verified by the band members Gordon Stoker First Tenor of the Jordanaires who were chosen to provide backup vocals recalls They had demos on almost everything that Elvis recorded and we d take it from the demo We d listen to the demo most of the time and we d take it from the demo We had Big Mama Thornton s record on Hound Dog since she had a record on that After listening to it we actually thought it was awful and couldn t figure out why Elvis wanted to do that However what Stoker did not realize was that Presley wanted to record the version he saw in Las Vegas by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys that he had been performing since May As session pianist Emidio Shorty Long Vagnoni left to work on a rehearsal for a stage show Stoker plays piano on this recording of Hound Dog As Stoker was unable to also sing first tenor the Jordanaires try to come up with a combined sound as best they can to cover it and Gordon laughs as he states That s one of the worst sounds we ever got on any record However Elvis insists on doing the song and the results albeit without Gordon singing tenor will still do more than please the masses Gordon also related that Elvis very much knew in his mind what he wanted the final results to be so they didn t spend a lot of time working out tempos br In response to journalist Dave Schwensen who said I remember reading an interview a few years ago with Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones He was talking about the second guitar break on the recording of Hound Dog and said it sounded like you just took off your guitar dropped it on the floor and it got the perfect sound He said he s never been able to figure out how you did that in Scotty Moore indicated br br I don t know either Ahh I was actually pissed off to tell ya the truth It was just Sometimes in the studio you do it too many times and you go past that peak Like three takes before was really the one you should use That was it We had done the thing Hound Dog I think it was printed somewhere that we did it about forty or sixty I don t know give or take But if someone was counting it off just a couple notes and we stop that s a take You know Take Two But I was frustrated for some reason and in the second solo I just went BLAH br Musicologist Robert Fink asserts that Elvis drove the band through thirty one takes slowly fashioning a menacing rough trade version quite different than the one they had been performing on the stage The result of Presley s efforts was an angry hopped up version of Hound Dog Citing Presley s anger at his treatment on the Steve Allen Show the previous evening Peter Nazareth sees this recording as revenge on Steve you ain t no friend of mine Allen and as a protest at being censored on national TV In analyzing Presley s recording Fink asserts that br br Hound Dog is notable for an unremitting level of what can only be called rock and roll dissonance Elvis just shouts leaving behind almost completely the rich vocal timbres romantic lyricism and mannerist rhythmic play on added syllables boogification that Richard Middleton identifies as the cornerstones of his art Scotty Moore s guitar is feral playing rhythm he stays in the lowest register slashing away at open fifths and hammering the strong beats with bent and distorted pitches his repetitive breaks are stinging and even when he begins one chorus in the wrong key quite literally atonal And the Jordanaires a gospel quartet who would provide wonderfully subtle rhythmic backup on the next song Elvis recorded at the session Don t Be Cruel are just hanging on for the ride during this one while drummer D J Fontana just goes plumb crazy Fontana s machine gun drumming on this record has become deservedly famous the only part of his kit consistently audible in the mix is the snare played so loud and insistently that the RCA engineers just gave up and let his riffs distort into splatters of clipped noise The overall effect could not be more different from the amused relaxed contempt of Big Mama Thornton it is reminiscent of nothing so much as late s white punk rage the Ramones Iggy Pop the Sex Pistols br In the end Presley chose version declaring This is the one During the day Presley s manager Colonel Tom Parker told RCA vice president Larry Kananga that Hound Dog may become such a big hit that RCA may have to change its corporate symbol from the Victor Dog to the Hound Dog After this recording Presley performed this angry hopped up version of Hound Dog in his concerts and also on his performances on The Ed Sullivan Show on September and October br br br Release and reception br Hound Dog G WW was initially released as the B side to the single Don t Be Cruel G WW on July Soon after the single was re released with Hound Dog first and in larger print than Don t Be Cruel on the record sleeve Both sides of the record topped Billboard s Best Sellers in Stores and Most Played in Jukeboxes charts alongside Don t Be Cruel while Hound Dog on its own merit topped the country western and rhythm blues charts and peaked at number one on Billboard s main pop chart the Top Later reissues of the single by RCA in the s designated the pair as double A sided By August Peacock Records had re released Big Mama Thornton s original recording of Hound Dog backing it with Rock a Bye Baby Peacock but it failed to chart br Stoller learned of the Presley cover from Leiber after returning from vacation in Europe He expressed some disappointment in the success of the cover It just sounded terribly nervous too fast too white But you know after it sold seven or eight million records it started to sound better Leiber and Stoller tired of explaining that Presley had dropped most of their lyrics For example Leiber complained about Presley adding the line You ain t never caught a rabbit and you ain t no friend of mine calling it inane It doesn t mean anything to me Forty years later Leiber told music journalist Rikky Rooksby that Presley had stamped the hit with his own identity A white singer from Memphis who s a hell of a singer he does have some black attitudes takes the song over But here s the thing we didn t make it His version is like a combination of country and skiffle It s not black He sounds like Hank Snow In most cases where we are attributed with rock and roll it s misleading because what we did is usually the original record which is R B and some other producer and a lot of them are great covered our original record br In September Democratic congressman Emanuel Celler expressed disgusted at the bad taste that is exemplified by Elvis Presley s Hound Dog music with his animal gyrations In October Melody Maker critic Steve Race reacted negatively to Presley s rendition of Hound Dog saying that for sheer repulsiveness coupled with the monotony of incoherence Hound Dog hit a new low in my experience Race later stated it is a thoroughly bad record lacking in tone intelligibility musicianship taste and subtlety and defying the decent limits of guitar amplification br In Frank Sinatra supported US Senator George Smathers crusade against inferior music including Hound Dog which Sinatra sarcastically referred to as a masterpiece Oscar Hammerstein II had a particular loathing of Hound Dog In Perry Como told The Saturday Evening Post When I hear Hound Dog I have to vomit a little but in it will probably be a slightly ancient classic Albin J Zak III Professor of Music at the State University of New York Albany in his inaugural American Musicological Society Rock Roll Hall of Fame lecture A Thoroughly Bad Record Elvis Presley s Hound Dog as Rock and Roll Manifesto in October asserted In retrospect we can recognize defining moments of crystallization The record was widely scorned by music industry veterans and high pop aficionados yet in its rude enthusiasm it represents an emphatic assertion of aesthetic principle at the dawn of rock and roll In Bob Dylan indicated that Presley s record influenced his decision to get into music What got me into the whole thing in the beginning wasn t songwriting When Hound Dog came across the radio there was nothing in my mind that said Wow what a great song I wonder who wrote that It was just it was just there br Presley s Hound Dog sold over million copies in the United States on its first release It was his best selling single and starting in July it spent eleven weeks at number one a record not eclipsed until Boyz II Men s End of the Road held at the top for weeks in It stayed in the number one spot until it was replaced by Love Me Tender also recorded by Elvis Billboard ranked it as the number two song for Hound Dog would go on to sell million copies worldwide including million in the United States alone In the Hound Dog Don t Be Cruel single became just the third record to sell more than three million copies following Bing Crosby s White Christmas and Gene Autry s Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer br Despite its commercial success Elvis used to say that Hound Dog was the silliest song he d ever sung and thought it might sell ten or twelve records right around his folks neighborhood By the end of summer after Presley s recording of the song was a million seller Freddie Bell who had introduced the song to Presley in April told an interviewer I didn t feel bad about that at all In fact I encouraged him to record it However after the success of Presley s recording Bell sued to get some of the composer royalties because he had changed the words and indeed the song and he would have made millions as the songwriter of Elvis s version but he lost because he did not ask Leiber Stoller for permission to make the changes and thereby add his name as songwriter br br br Later notable performances br Presley s final performance on stage for almost years was a benefit concert for the USS Arizona Memorial on Sunday March at the Bloch Arena in Pearl Harbor During this concert which raised nearly for the USS Arizona Memorial building fund Presley closed the concert singing Hound Dog Presley performed a high energy version of Hound Dog in his legendary Comeback Special that aired on December on the NBC television network After the ratings success of this program on July Presley returned to perform in Las Vegas for the first time since his unsuccessful performances in April and May Booked for a four week fifty seven show engagement at the International Hotel which has just been built and has the largest showroom in the city this engagement breaks all existing Las Vegas attendance records and attracts rave reviews from the public and the critics It is a triumph Elvis first live album Elvis in Person at the International Hotel Las Vegas Nevada is recorded during this engagement and is soon released During this concert Presley introduced Hound Dog as his special song Never one to take himself too seriously Elvis joked with the crowd about the old days and the old songs At one point he decided to dedicate his next number to the audience and the staff at the International This is the only song I could think of that really expresses my feeling toward the audience he said in all earnestness before bursting into Hound Dog br Presley performed Hound Dog in his historic Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite concert that was the first entertainment special to be broadcast live around the world on January Beamed via Globecam Satellite to Australia South Korea Japan Thailand the Philippines South Vietnam and other countries it was also seen on a delayed basis in around thirty European countries An expanded version was broadcast on NBC in the USA on April on NBC attracting of the television

including such lines as You look like an Airedale with the air let out Several parodies emphasized the cross cultural appeal of Presley s record Lalo Pancho Lopez Guerrero the father of Chicano music released a parody version in entitled Pound Dog L M LM about a chihuahua In January Jewish American satirist Mickey Katz released a Yinglish novelty song version You re a Doity Dog Capitol F singing with a Yiddish accent and having a klezmer break between verses In this freilach rock song Katz sang You ain t nothin but a paskudnick By March veteran country singer Cliff Johnson responded to the popularity of Presley s Hound Dog by recording his self penned Go Way Hound Dog Let Me Sing My Blues Columbia Australia Coronet Records KW described in Billboard as rockabilly that professes satiation with rockabilly music In Elvis translator El Vez backed by The Memphis Mariachis released You Ain t Nothin But A Chihuahua a Chicano Power parody that opens with You ain t nothin but a Chihuahua Yapping all the time br Encouraged by the decision of the U S Supreme Court in Campbell v Acuff Rose Music Inc that ruled that musicians do not have to obtain permission from the original artists to perform and record parodies of those compositions other parodies of Hound Dog emerged subsequently These include Found God a self acknowledged parody of Presley s version by popular Christian band ApologetiX which using the original tune opens with I ain t nothin but I found God It took quite a long time br br br Litigation br Over the years Hound Dog has been the subject of an inordinate number of lawsuits and would eventually become one of the most litigated songs in recorded music history br br br Lion Music Publishing Company v Sun Records br br br Background br On September the copyright application for Hound Dog was lodged On the application the words music are attributed to Don Deadric Robey Willie Mae Thornton with the copyright claimants listed as Murphy L Robey W Willie Mae Thornton A It was renewed subsequently on May with the same details br By the end of at least six answer songs that responded to Big Mama Thornton s original version of Hound Dog were released According to Peacock Records s Don Robey these songs were bastardizations of the original and reduced its sales potential These included br br Mr Hound Dog s in Town recorded on March by Blues shouter Roy Brown for King Records While it had the same melody and many of the same lyrics as the original Brown is credited as the sole writer br You Ain t Nothin But A Female Hound Dog King recorded by Vocalist Charlie Gore and guitarist Louis Innis on March for King Records on March This song was credited to Innis Lois Mann a pseudonym of King Records owner Syd Nathan the latter his wife s maiden name and Johnny Otis br Rattlesnake recorded by blues guitarist John Brim for Chess Records Checker subsidiary with Little Walter on blues harp br Real Gone Hound Dog Combo an obscure answer record to Hound Dog recorded by Chuck Higgins and His Mellotones with a vocal by Higgins brother Daddy Cleanhead for Jake Porter s Combo Records The composition was credited to Higgins and Porter as V Haven br However the most popular of the answer songs to Hound Dog was Bear Cat The Answer To Hound Dog Sun recorded by Memphis disc jockey Rufus Thomas adopting the nickname Rufus Hound Dog Thomas at Sun Studios at Union Avenue Memphis on March just two weeks after Thornton s original version was released and even before a review of Hound Dog had been published in Billboard While retaining the same melody as Hound Dog Sun founder Sam Phillips wrote new lyrics in which he altered the gender of the singer who bemoaned that his woman was a bear cat a Jazz Age slang term for a hot blooded or fiery girl The record s spare electric guitar work by Memphis bluesman Joe Hill Louis was greatly influenced by that of Pete Lewis on the original According to James M Salem br br I nstead of barking and howling there is meowing and hissing in the background In true answer form the gender of the participants was reversed This time the protagonist is male directly challenging the worthless female of the original song correcting her previous insults and re directing them at her You know what you said about me woman says the man in open confrontation Well You ain t nothin but a bear cat scratchin at my door All the irony and sarcasm of the original is captured in the answer even the sexuality You can purr pretty kitty but I ain t gonna rub you no more br By the end of March Bear Cat was in stores prompting Billboard to describe it as the fastest answer song to hit the market It became both Thomas and Sun Records first hit eventually reaching number three on the R B charts However as Phillips claimed a writing credit for the song a copyright infringement suit ensued that nearly bankrupted Phillips record label br On March Billboard reported that In an effort to combat what has become a rampant practice by small labels the rushing out of answers which are similar in melody and or theme to ditties which have become smash hits many pubbers are now retaining attorneys Common practice of course is to regard the answer as an original Currently publishers are putting up a fight to protect their originals from unauthorised or infringing answers In that same issue Robey told Billboard he had notified the Harry Fox publishing agency to issue Sun a license on Bear Cat in order that Robey might collect a royalty br On April Robey wrote to Phillips that unless contracts are signed and in the office of Mr Harris Fox by Wednesday April I will be forced to take immediate steps with Court Actions hoping this will not cause any unfriendly relations but please remember that I have to pay when I intrude upon the rights of others and certainly must protect my own rights On April Bob Rolontz reported in Billboard The answers to r b tunes which have become prolific with the many replies to such smash hits as I Don t Know Mama and Hound Dog are being given a serious scrutiny by the original copyright holders of the tunes on the original hit waxings It appears they do not think too highly of writing an answer to a hit unless a license is obtained and permission to write a parody is given by the publisher On the prior page Peacock Records placed an advertisement promoting Thornton s release as The Original Version of Hound Dog warning Beware of Imitations Follow the Leader for Good Results before reminding the reader The Original The Best Two pages later Intro Records touted the version by Tommy Duncan and the Miller Bros as Best of them all br br br Proceedings br Their requests for payment having been ignored Robey and two other music publishers initiated unprecedented legal proceedings in April against the record companies that released these competing songs alleging copyright infringement As a result Chess Records withdrew Brim s Rattlesnake from sale In the Memphis courts Lion Publishing Co sought royalties and treble damages claiming Bear Cat was a dead steal In May Phillips responded There s a lot of difference in the words As for the tune there s practically no melody but a rhythm pattern adding that it is hard to differentiate between any two bar blues songs By June in a precedent setting decision the Court ruled against Phillips and upheld the charges of plagiarism finding the tune and some of the lyrics of Bear Cat to be identical to those of Hound Dog Phillips was ordered to pay of all of the profits of Bear Cat plus court costs As this amounted to compensation Phillips was reduced to near bankruptcy ultimately forcing him to sell Elvis Presley s Sun contract to RCA for to raise the funds to settle his debts On June Jet reported that br br The Sun Record Company of Memphis agreed to pay to a Texas Recording firm because its blues tune Bear Cat is too similar to Hound Dog Lion Publishing Company of Houston Tex won the out of court settlement after contending in a court suit that Bear Cat was a conscious imitation of their own recording with only minor variations Sam C Phillips of Sun Record agreed to pay Hound Dog owners two cents per record for waxings of Bear Cat already sold and two cents a record for future sales br On July Robey wrote to Phillips again thanking him kindly for your co operation in this matter but Phillips still refused to purchase a mechanical license for Thomas Bear Cat Robey then instructed his company lawyer Irving Marcus to sue Phillips and Sun Records hoping to use this as a test case to determine the legal status of all answer songs While earlier pressings of Sun bore the caption The Answer To Hound Dog above the A side title as a result of the legal action this was removed from all later pressings In the s Sam Phillips conceded I should have known better The melody was exactly the same as theirs but we claimed the credit for writing the damn thing br br br King Records vs Lion Publishing Co and Lion Publishing Co vs King Records Valjo Music br In late July Syd Nathan president of King Records took Robey and his Lion Publishing Company to court The August BillBoard reported Lion Music itself was in court defending the contention of Syd Nathan Records sic in Cincinnati that he had an interest in the song Hound Dog and should have a fifty per cent share of its success Nathan claimed that Valjo Music one of King Records publishing affiliates had legal rights to the song as Johnny Otis who claimed to be a co author was under exclusive contract to them at the time An article entitled New Howl Goes Up Over Hound Dog Infringement in The Pittsburgh Courier of August reported br br You ain t nothin but a hound dog is becoming a battle cry faster than a pup can clean a bone Hound Dog has been howling on the juke boxes for several months and all this time the record has been hounded by imitations and sundry other misfortunes One thing is sure this is the most profitable hound dog since Eliza slid across the ice This is the latest episode King Records joined the pack this week in the legal hassle over who s gonna get the profits from the current rhythm Dog Valjo meanwhile is complaining that one of the writers of the tune Johnny Otis was under exclusive contract to them when he wrote the tune in collaboration with others and they are claiming per cent of the publisher s share of the tune At any rate on it goes and the big problem now seems to be how much Is that Hound Dog In the juke box worth br In response Robey counter sued both King Records and Valjo Music over Roy Brown s answer record and also over Little Esther s cover record King When the dust settled the publishing for Hound Dog in all variations remained with Lion and writing credit with Leiber and Stoller In April Billboard s Rolontz summed up the events thusly The year saw an important precedent set in regard to answer tunes since the Hound Dog decision few record firms have attempted to answer smash hits by other companies by using same tune with different lyrics br br br Valjo Music Publishing Corporation v Elvis Presley Music br The most protracted lawsuit involving Hound Dog was Valjo Music Publishing Corporation v Elvis Presley Music that was initiated in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in October after the commercial success of Elvis Presley s version of the song and concluded in December It would be the first legal spat for Presley s publishing company Elvis Presley Music br br br Background br Leiber and Stoller were introduced to Otis in July by Federal Records Ralph Bass when Otis needed songs for artists he was recording for Federal including Little Esther Little Willie Littlefield and Bobby Nunn of The Robins In exchange for Otis using their songs Leiber and Stoller gave Otis a one third interest in those songs and assigned the publishing to Otis company Valjo Music Publishing Company Similarly on August Leiber and Stoller signed a contract with Spin Music Inc another publishing company in which Otis held an interest assigning it certain rights to Hound Dog and some other songs in exchange for royalties to be divided equally between Leiber Stoller and Otis When the song was copyrighted initially on September words and music were credited to Don Deadric Robey and Willie Mae Thornton with Lion Publishing Co identified as the registered publisher However on March it was credited to Leiber Stoller and Otis and Valjo Music not Spin was the registered publisher br According to the findings of the court in Valjo Music Publishing Corporation v Elvis Presley Music Thereafter Otis in apparent disregard of the contracts both with Spin Music Inc and plaintiff arranged to have Hound Dog published by Lion Music Publishing Company of Houston Texas and released by its affiliate Peacock Records Otis executed a writer publisher contract on October with Lion Music Publishing Company in which Leiber Otis and Stoller were described as the writers of Hound Dog Thus Otis received a co writing credit with Leiber and Stoller on Thornton s Peacock Records release and on all of the cover versions The court also noted Otis signed not only his name but also signed or perhaps forged the names of Stoller and Leiber to it The president or proprietor of Lion Music Publishing Company noted the similarity of the handwriting of the signatures and made contact with Leiber and Stoller who advised him that Otis had no authority to sign their names to the agreement and that Otis was not a co author of the song although he was entitled to receive one third of the royalties Lion then arranged for a contract with Leiber and Stoller alone for the publishing rights In order for Leiber and Stoller to execute the contract with Lion which because we were underage had to be signed by our mothers a court appointed Mary Stein for Leiber and Adelyn Stoller for Stoller as their legal guardians in late April The contract assigned the publishing for Hound Dog to Lion Otis credit was omitted from all subsequent records Following on the popularity of Elvis live and televised performances of Hound Dog Elvis Presley Music made the acquisition of half the publishing for the song from Lion Music a precondition to issuing a recording to which Robey assented br br br Proceedings br In October the success of Presley s version sales at that time exceeded million copies prompted Valjo to sue Leiber and Stoller and Elvis Presley Music an affiliate of Hill Range Songs for an accounting of profits and for damages and to have Otis restored as co writer and recover damages for lost royalties In Valjo Music Publishing Corporation v Elvis Presley Music Otis as plaintiff alleged that he was the co author of Hound Dog along with two defendants Leiber and Stoller The defendants denied that Otis wrote any part of the song On August Otis signed a release of any claims to the song in exchange for In court Otis claimed that he had done so because he had learned that the defendants were legally infants at the time of the original contracts in and would therefore disaffirm any contract that they had with him This made no sense to the United States Southern District of Court of New York Otis was a man who had many years experience in the music business He must have realized that even though Leiber and Stoller were infants they could not disaffirm his co authorship of a song if in fact he had been a co author Further while Leiber and Stoller acknowledged that they had given Otis one third of the mechanical rights for the original Thornton recording they denied giving him one third authorship credit On December Federal Court Judge Archie O Dawson dismissed Valjo s claim in the New York Federal Court on the basis that Otis was unworthy of belief that he admitted forging Leiber and Stoller s signatures on a declaration to third party publisher Lion Music that Leiber and Stoller were underage at the time and that Otis had signed a release to any claims for As the evidence would not sustain Valjo s contention that Otis had collaborated in the writing of Hound Dog the Court voided Leiber and Stoller s contract ordered Otis to pay the legal costs of the defendants and awarded of the song to Leiber and Stoller with Lion Music receiving and Elvis Presley Music receiving the final br Despite the Court s findings Otis continued to claim that he wrote the third verse and rewrote some of the lyrics in the second verse including adding You made me feel so bad You make me weep and moan You ain t looking for a woman You re looking for a home and edited out what he described later as derogatory crap In Otis claimed Leiber and Stoller brought me the song Hound Dog Otis recalls of the time he produced Big Mama Thornton s recording of what was to become an R B and then rock n roll classic Parts of it weren t really acceptable I didn t like that reference to chicken and watermelon said Let s get that crap out of there This came out and was a big smash and everything was all right I had half the publishing rights and one third of the song writing Then Elvis Presley made it a mega hit and they got greedy They sued me in court They won they beat me out of it I could have sent my kids to college like they sent theirs Otis said But oh well if I dwell on that I get quite unhappy so we try to move on However Leiber and Stoller maintained consistently and emphatically that Otis was not a writer of the song emphasis theirs br As he had provided lyrics for the version of Hound Dog recorded by Presley Freddie Bell sued to get some of the composer royalties because he had changed the words and indeed the song and he would have made millions as the songwriter of Elvis version but he lost because he did not ask Leiber Stoller for permission to make those changes br Broadcast Music Incorporated BMI is
