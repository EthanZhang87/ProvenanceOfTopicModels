 O Come All Ye Faithful also known as Adeste Fideles is a Christmas carol that has been attributed to various authors including John Francis Wade John Reading King John IV of Portugal and anonymous Cistercian monks The earliest printed version is in a book published by Wade A manuscript by Wade dating to is held by Stonyhurst College in Lancashire br The original four verses of the hymn were extended to a total of eight and these have been translated into many languages In the English Catholic priest Frederick Oakeley translated the hymn into English as O Come All Ye Faithful which became widespread in English speaking countries br br br History br br br Text br The original text of the hymn has been from time to time attributed to various groups and individuals including St Bonaventure in the th century or King John IV of Portugal in the th though it was more commonly believed that the text was written by Cistercian monks the German Portuguese or Spanish provinces of that order having at various times been credited br In modern English hymnals the text is usually credited to John Francis Wade whose name appears on the earliest printed versions Wade an English Catholic lived in exile in France and made a living as a copyist of musical manuscripts which he found in libraries He often signed his copies possibly because his calligraphy was so beautiful that his clients requested this In he published a printed compilation of his manuscript copies Cantus Diversi pro Dominicis et Festis per annum This is the first printed source for Adeste Fideles br The version published by Wade consisted of four Latin verses Later in the th century the French Catholic priest Jean Fran ois tienne Borderies wrote an additional three verses in Latin Another anonymous Latin verse is rarely printed br The text has been translated innumerable times into English The most common version today is a combination of one of Frederick Oakeley s translations of the original four verses and William Thomas Brooke s translation of the three additional verses It was first published in Murray s Hymnal in Oakeley originally titled the song Ye Faithful approach ye when it was sung at his Margaret Chapel in Marylebone London before it was altered to its current form The song was sometimes referred to as the Portuguese Hymn after the Duke of Leeds in heard a version of it sung at the Portuguese embassy in London now Our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory Warwick Street McKim and Randell nonetheless argue for Wade s authorship of the most popular English language version Bennett Zon offers limited support for that argument although he also suggests that the author may instead have been someone known to Wade br br br Tune br Besides John Francis Wade the tune has been attributed to several musicians from John Reading and his son to Handel and even the German composer Gluck The Portuguese composer Marcos Portugal as well as King John IV of Portugal have also been credited Thomas Arne whom Wade knew is another possible composer There are several similar musical themes written around that time though it can be hard to determine whether these were written in imitation of the hymn whether the hymn was based on them or whether they are totally unconnected br br br Published versions br br The hymn was first published by John Francis Wade in his collection Cantus Diversi with four Latin verses and music set in the traditional square notation used for medieval liturgical music This version is in triple meter contrary to modern versions It was published again in the edition of Evening Offices of the Church It also appeared in Samuel Webbe s An Essay on the Church Plain Chant br The hymn tune also made its way to the Sacred Harp tradition appearing as Hither Ye Faithful Haste with Songs of Triumph in an collection br With Herbei o ihr Gl ub gen a German translation of the Latin text was published in by Friedrich Heinrich Ranke br br br Lyrics br These are the original four Latin verses as published by Wade along with their English translation by Frederick Oakeley br br These are the additional Latin verses composed in the th century The first three verses have translations by William Thomas Brooke while the others have English prose translations br br br Claims of Jacobite connections br Although as previously stated the hymn s exact sources and origins remain unproven there is universal agreement among musicologists that it was through the efforts of Catholic layman and music copyist John Francis Wade that it first appeared in print Wade himself fled to France after the Jacobite rising of was crushed and his liturgical books were often decorated with Jacobite imagery for context the aim of the rebellion had been to restore a Catholic monarch Charles Edward Stuart popularly known as Bonnie Prince Charlie to the throne of England These aspects of Wade s life and political leanings have given rise to speculation that he might have intended for Adeste Fideles to be a ciphered birth ode to the Jacobite s Young Pretender br This theory regarding the hymn s meaning has been most recently proposed by Professor Bennett Zon head of music at Durham University It essentially holds that the song s original Latin version was actually a coded rallying cry for the Stewart cause Elements of this theory include br br The as yet unproven but popular claim that Bethlehem was a common Jacobite cipher for England br The claim also currently unproven that Wade deliberately meant for the title Regem Angelorum which is found in the hymn s original Latin lyrics and translates literally to King of Angels to refer to the king of England via a pun on the Latin words Angelorum of the angels and Anglorum of the English br The fact that during the mid th century some English Roman Catholic liturgical books would place Adeste Fideles physically close to prayers for the would be king in exile br Proponents of this theory interpret the notions and circumstances described above as evidence that the lyrics of Adeste Fideles are meant to be a call to arms for faithful Jacobites to return with triumphant joy to England Bethlehem and venerate the king of angels that is the English king Bonnie Prince Charlie However certain historical circumstances would seem to disprove or at least problematize the Jacobite ode theory Namely br br The absence of any textual evidence that can conclusively prove that Wade explicitly composed Adeste Fideles as a piece of political propaganda In the absence of such evidence the Jacobite imagery found in Wade s books might be merely an expression of the author s idiosyncratic blend of political and religious thought which in turn might have reflected the sentiments of Catholic Jacobites as a group br Sources that credit the hymn s composition to Wade overlook the fact that the exact origins of Adeste Fideles are uncertain It is not known whether Wade might have simply copied the hymn from other sources for instance it could have been composed by Cistercian monks and eventually sung at the Portuguese embassy chapel in London or to what extent he might have innovated on the contributions of the hymn s other plausible authors br Most of the hymn s original lyrics are an almost verbatim expression of Roman Catholic dogmas regarding the person of Jesus Christ As stated elsewhere in this article the hymn takes almost all its contents from Bible verses and the Nicene Creed To Irish musicologist William H Grattan Flood it is so readily evident that the hymn is merely an artistic expression of the Catholic spiritual and intellectual tradition that he concludes that the words and music of the song are to be attributed to a Catholic source and for Catholic worship br br br Performance br In performance verses are often omitted either because the hymn is too long in its entirety or because the words are unsuitable for the day on which they are sung For example the eighth anonymous verse is only sung on Epiphany if at all while the last verse of the original is normally reserved for Christmas Midnight Mass Mass at Dawn or Mass during the Day br In the United Kingdom and United States it is often sung today in an arrangement by Sir David Willcocks which was originally published in by Oxford University Press in the first book in the Carols for Choirs series This arrangement makes use of the basic harmonisation from The English Hymnal but adds a soprano descant in verse six verse three in the original with its reharmonised organ accompaniment and a last verse harmonisation in verse seven verse four in the original which is sung in unison br This carol has served as the penultimate hymn sung at the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols by the Choir of King s College Cambridge after the last lesson from Chapter of the Gospel of John br Adeste Fideles is traditionally the final anthem during Midnight Mass at St Peter s Basilica
