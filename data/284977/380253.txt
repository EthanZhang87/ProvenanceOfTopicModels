id: 380253
A football chant or terrace chant is a form of vocalisation performed by supporters of association football typically during football matches Football chanting is an expression of collective identity most often used by fans to express their pride in the team they support or to encourage them and to celebrate a particular player or manager Fans may also use football chants to slight the opposition and many fans sing songs about their club rivals even when they are not playing them Sometimes the chants are spontaneous reactions to events on the pitch br Football chants can be simple consisting of a few loud shouts or spoken words but more often they are short lines of lyrics and sometimes longer songs They are typically performed repetitively sometimes accompanied by handclapping but occasionally they may be more elaborate involving musical instruments props or choreographed routines They are often adaptations of popular songs using their tunes as the basis of the chants but some are original br Football chants are known to have been used by fans from the late th century onwards but developed into the current popular forms in the s Football chants can be historic dating back as early as the formation of the club popularly sung down the years and considered the anthems for these clubs They may also be popular for only a relatively short time with new chants being constantly created and discarded The tradition of football chants vary from country to country and team to team but some chants are common to many clubs and popular internationally Football chants may be considered one of the last remaining sources of an oral folk song tradition br br Football chants may be considered modern examples of traditional storytelling and folk songs According to folk singer Martin Carthy football chants are the one surviving embodiment of an organic living folk tradition It is also a unique public expression of collective identity and football chants may be seen as modern examples of the folk tradition blason populaire where a group vocalise their identity as well as their rivalry against another group br br Football fans vocalisations came in the forms of cries chants and songs in the th century War cries were known to have been used by football fans from the s onwards with the earliest recorded in Scotland after the Scottish Cup final of The first known song that references football The Dooley Fitba Club later known as Fitba Crazy was also written in the s by James Curran although it was intended for the music hall rather than the terrace It was also recorded in the s that Sheffield United fans had adopted a music hall song the Rowdy Dowdy Boys while Southampton fans sang a Yi Yi Yi chant based on a war cry Blackburn Rovers fans were reported to have chanted We ve won the cup before many a time before their FA Cup Final match against Notts County Composer Sir Edward Elgar wrote a football song in honour of the Wolverhampton Wanderers striker Billy Malpass after watching a match in February between Wolves and Stoke City However the anthem he wrote He Banged The Leather For Goal never caught on among fans on the terrace br The oldest football song in the world that is still in use today may be On the Ball City a song believed to have been composed in the s by Albert T Smith who became a director of Norwich City in The song was adopted by fans of the club and it is still sung by Norwich s fans Such club song may have its origin in the public school system while others have links with working class music hall Other early football chants still sung today include Pompey Chimes or Play up Pompey sung by Portsmouth fans since the s a form of the chant is believed to have been sung at Fratton Park in therefore it is arguably older than On the Ball City and Blaydon Races a Geordie folk song from which was adopted by Newcastle United fans in the s Some of the songs sung at football ground by the s were modified from popular music hall songs for example Kick Kick Kick Kick Kick it from Chick Chick Chick Chick Chicken and Keep the Forwards Scoring from Keep the Home Fires Burning Chants that referenced players were also heard on the terrace for example Give it to Ballie chanted by Swansea fans in reference to a player name Billy Ball who played for the club in br Football chants in the early years were club specific and they were generally friendly or jocular in tone Songs with sectarian overtones however had been sung at matches between Rangers and Celtic in the s which became more overtly confrontational in later decades raising the possibility that sectarianism may have been the origin of oppositional chanting and singing at football matches Fans of the early period also had a limited repertoire of chants which become more varied as singing was encouraged by the use of brass bands before games and the community singing movement that arose in the s the tradition of singing Abide with Me at FA Cup finals started in this period br br While various elements of football chants were already present in the early period it was in the s that the nature of football chants started to change and modern football chants emerged to become an integral part of fan culture and experience The catalyst for the change may be due to a number of factors one suggestion is the growth and evolution of youth culture in this period which together with popular music started being played over the public announcement system at matches instead of brass bands encouraged fans to start their own singing based on popular tunes Another suggestion is the mixing of fan cultures from different countries through international football matches that started to be broadcast such as the England s tour of South America and the World Cup The exposure to intense chanting by South American and Italian fans during the and World Cups may have encouraged British fans who were previously more reserved to do the same They also picked up different type of chants from other countries Liverpool fans for example may have used a Brazilian chant Brazil cha cha cha and turned it into the Li ver pool clap clap clap chant br Chants became more extensive in the s and popular songs became increasingly common as the basis of chants as fans adapted these songs to reflect situations and events relevant to them Chanting the name of the team chants for players and managers started to become prevalent Liverpool supporters particularly those on the Kop were known for modifying songs in the early s to suit their own purposes and this practice quickly spread to fans of other clubs who created their own versions after hearing these chants Repertoire of chants credited to Liverpool fans included the rhythmic clapping based on Let s Go by The Routers the chorus from We Shall Not Be Moved and When the Saints Go Marching In used to honour Ian St John chants which were then also adopted by fans of other clubs Fans of many clubs now have a large and constantly evolving repertoire of chants in addition to a smaller number of songs closely associated with their club br A more controversial aspect of this period of change was that abusive chants targeted at rival team or fans also became widespread These may be taunts and insults aimed at the opposition teams or players to unnerve them or obscene or slanderous chants targeted at individuals A sampling of English football chants in the late s found these types of chants to be the most numerous Threats of violence may also be made to their rivals in chants although such threats were rarely carried out fights did occur which together with increasing level of hooliganism in that period gave these threats a real edge Some abuses are racial in nature for example anti Semitic chants directed at Tottenham Hotspur began in the s also against the Argentine club Atlanta commonly heard in the s but may have begun as early as the s and against the Dutch club Ajax in the s Racist insults directed at black players began to be heard in the s and s in England and Spain when black players started appearing in their leagues in increasing numbers Concerns over the abusive nature of some of these chants later led to measures in various countries to control them for example the British government made racist and indecent chants an offence in the UK in In Italy the Mancino law was used to prosecute fans for inciting racism Despite efforts to stop them some chants remain an issue around the world such as the Eh puto chant used by Mexican fans and racist chants in many countries br br As the sport of football spread to other countries so did its associated fan culture of football chants Many countries however have developed their own tradition of football songs and chants for example most Italian clubs have their own official hymns often written specially for the club by a prominent singer or composer who is a fan of the club Many countries also have football chants dating from the early part of the th century and clubs such as Real Madrid may have an official club song as early as Football chants created in different countries may be specific to the local culture Hand clapping chants were popular in South American countries such as Brazil before it spread to other countries Some chants originated from other sports for example the two four six eight chant that was used for sports in the United States from the early th century was adopted by football fans in the UK in the s The Ol chant from bullfighting is believed to be first used in Brazil for Garrincha in and one version of the Ol Ol Ol chant was first heard at a league game in Spain in while another version quickly spread around Europe in and became widely popular around the world br As football fans travel to other countries on away international matches and international broadcasts of football matches are common fans from around the world often picked up chants from other clubs and countries and some chants spread in an organic manner and become popular internationally An example is the chant based on Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes it was first adopted by fans of Belgian Club Brugge KV in their chant was then picked by Italian fans and it was made an unofficial anthem for the Italy national football team in the FIFA World Cup

chanting in Argentina allows participants to create value around and give meaning to the idea of aguante which is central in the construction of an ideal masculinity Aguante translates to endurance or stamina in English In practice aguante is part of a masculine discourse that divides the world between real men and not men Garriga Zucal and Daniel Salerno have identified three main signs of aguante The first is alentar siempre which means to show support for the team throughout the entire match by jumping or chanting even through bad weather or poor performance by the team Secondly to show aguante a man must show up to all the matches including away games that require long uncomfortable trips Thirdly a fan must withstand confrontation to demonstrate aguante either through chanting at opposing fans or through physical fights br Participating in chanting or cantitos is a major way the barras bravas or the most important militant groups of fans can demonstrate aguante The barras bravas who are also known as the hinchada militante stand throughout the game behind the goal and chant the entire time These groups bring instruments to the matches in order to synchronize the chanting The most prominent instrument is the bombo con platillo which is a large bass drum with a diameter of inches The bombos con platillo are often decorated with the team s colors and name and the name of the barra group which is distinct from the team name Along with these drums other types of drums include Brazilian surdo drums redoblantes snare drums and repiques The barras often have other percussion instruments including scrappers tambourines cowbells and agogo bells In addition to percussion most barras have at least three trumpet players and many teams might add trombones or euphoniums While the bombo players are always from the barras bravas itself because of the advanced skill it takes to play the brass instruments the barras sometimes hire outside brass players to play during a match br In the ensemble one bombo player serves as the leader of the group where he leads with exaggerated arm movements that are easy for the players to follow but the leader of the chanting is often falls to another leader of the barras They might lead by giving verbal or visual cues to the head bombo player or they might just independently start a chant and expect the ensemble to follow br br Entrance music br Music at sporting events br List of UK hit singles by footballers br Sea shanty br Tomahawk Chop br br Dirty Northern Bastards And Other Tales from the Terraces The
