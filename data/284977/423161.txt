The Billboard Hot is the music industry standard record chart in the United States for songs published weekly by Billboard magazine Chart rankings are based on sales physical and digital online streaming and radio airplay in the U S br A new chart is compiled and released online to the public by Billboard s website on Tuesdays but post dated to the following Saturday when the printed magazine first reaches newsstands The weekly tracking period for sales is currently Friday Thursday after being changed in July It was initially Monday Sunday when Nielsen started tracking sales in This tracking period also applies to compiling online streaming data Radio airplay is readily available on a real time basis unlike sales figures and streaming but is also tracked on the same Friday Thursday cycle effective with the chart dated July Previously radio was tracked Monday Sunday and before July Wednesday Tuesday br The first number one song of the Billboard Hot was Poor Little Fool by Ricky Nelson on August As of the issue for the week ending on July the Billboard Hot has had different number one entries The current number one song on the chart is A Bar Song Tipsy by Shaboozey br br The first chart published by Billboard was Last Week s Ten Best Sellers Among the Popular Songs a list of best selling sheet music in July Other charts listed popular song performances in theatres and recitals In Popular Numbers Featured by Famous Singers and Leaders appeared which added radio performances to in person performances On January Billboard magazine published Ten Best Records for Week Ending which recorded the top selling records of three leading record companies as reported by the companies themselves In October a review list The Week s Best Records was retitled The Billboard Record Buying Guide by incorporating airplay and sheet music sales which would eventually become the first trade survey of record popularity This led to the full page Billboard Music Popularity Chart for the week ending July and published in the July issue with lists covering jukebox play retail sales sheet music sales and radio play Listed were songs of the national Best Selling Retail Records which was the fore runner of today s pop chart with I ll Never Smile Again by Tommy Dorsey its first number one br Starting on March Billboard s lead popularity chart was the Honor Roll of Hits This chart ranked the most popular songs regardless of performer it combined different versions of the same song by different artists based on record and sheet sales disk jockey and jukebox performances as determined by Billboard s weekly nationwide survey At the start of the rock era in there were three charts that measured songs by individual metrics br br Best Sellers in Stores was the best seller chart first established in July This chart ranked the biggest selling singles in retail stores as reported by merchants surveyed throughout the country to positions br Most Played by Jockeys was Billboard s original airplay chart It ranked the most played songs on United States radio stations as reported by radio DJs and radio stations to positions br Most Played in Jukeboxes ranked the most played songs in jukeboxes across the United States positions This was one of the main outlets of measuring song popularity with the younger generation of music listeners as many radio stations resisted adding rock and roll music to their playlists for many years br Although officially all three charts had equal weight in terms of their importance Billboard retrospectively considers the Best Sellers in Stores chart when referencing a song s performance before the creation of the Hot In its issue of November Billboard published The Top for the first time for the survey weeks ending October and November The Top combined all aspects of a single s performance sales airplay and jukebox activity based on a point system that typically gave sales purchases more weight than radio airplay The first No in that chart was Love Is a Many Splendored Thing by The Four Aces The Best Sellers in Stores Most Played by Jockeys and Most Played in Jukeboxes charts continued to be published concurrently with the new Top chart br On June Billboard discontinued the Most Played in Jukeboxes chart as the popularity of jukeboxes waned and radio stations incorporated more and more rock oriented music into their playlists The week of July had the final Most Played by Jockeys and Top charts both of which had Perez Prado s instrumental version of Patricia ascending to the top br On August Billboard premiered one main all genre singles chart the Hot with Poor Little Fool by Ricky Nelson its first No The Hot quickly became the industry standard and Billboard discontinued the Best Sellers In Stores chart on October br The Hot was created by journalists Tom Noonan Paul Ackerman and Seymour Stein Stein did not recall who chose the name br The Billboard Hot is still the standard by which a song s popularity is measured in the United States The Hot is ranked by radio airplay audience impressions as measured by Nielsen BDS sales data compiled by Nielsen Soundscan both at retail and digitally and streaming activity provided by online music sources br There are several component charts that contribute to the overall calculation of the Hot The most significant ones are br br Radio Songs per Billboard approximately stations composed of adult contemporary R B hip hop country rock gospel Latin and Christian formats digitally monitored twenty four hours a day seven days a week Charts are ranked by number of gross audience impressions computed by cross referencing exact times of radio airplay with Arbitron listener data br Digital Songs Digital sales are tracked by Nielsen SoundScan and are included as part of a title s sales points br Streaming Songs a collaboration between Billboard Nielsen SoundScan and National Association of Recording Merchandisers which measures the top streamed radio songs on demand songs and videos on leading online music services br br The tracking week for sales streaming and airplay begins on Friday and ends on Thursday airplay used to have a tracking week from Monday to Sunday but effective with the chart dated July the week was adjusted to align with the other two metrics A new chart is compiled and officially released to the public by Billboard on Tuesday Each chart is post dated with the week ending issue date four days after the charts are refreshed online i e the following Saturday For example br br Friday January tracking week begins for sales streaming and airplay br Thursday January tracking week ends for sales streaming and airplay br Tuesday January new chart released with issue post dated Saturday January br br The methods and policies by which this data is obtained and compiled have changed many times throughout the chart s history br Although the advent of a singles music chart spawned chart historians and chart watchers and greatly affected pop culture and produced countless bits of trivia the main purpose of the Hot is to aid those within the music industry to reflect the popularity of the product the singles the albums etc and to track the trends of the buying public Billboard has many times changed its methodology and policies to give the most precise and accurate reflection of what is popular A very basic example of this would be the ratio given to sales and airplay During the Hot s early history singles were the leading way by which people bought music At times when singles sales were robust more weight was given to a song s retail points than to its radio airplay br As the decades passed the recording industry concentrated more on album sales than singles sales Musicians eventually expressed their creative output in the form of full length albums rather than singles and by the s many record companies stopped releasing singles altogether see Album Cuts below Eventually a song s airplay points were weighted more so than its sales Billboard has adjusted the sales airplay ratio many times to more accurately reflect the true popularity of songs br br Billboard has also changed its Hot policy regarding two sided singles several times The pre Hot chart Best Sellers in Stores listed popular A and B sides together with the side that was played most often based on its other charts listed first One of the most notable of these but far from the only one was Elvis Presley s Don t Be Cruel Hound Dog During the Presley single s chart run top billing was switched back and forth between the two sides several times But on the concurrent Most Played in Juke Boxes Most Played by Jockeys and the Top the two songs were listed separately as was true of all songs With the initiation of the Hot in A and B sides charted separately as they had on the former Top br Starting with the Hot chart for the week ending November this rule was altered if both sides received significant airplay they were listed together This started to become a moot point by as most major record labels solidified a trend they had started in the s by putting the same song on both sides of the singles provided to radio br More complex issues began to arise as the typical A and B side format of singles gave way to inch singles and maxi singles many of which contained more than one B side Further problems arose when in several cases a B side would eventually overtake the A side in popularity thus prompting record labels to release a new single featuring the former B side as the A side along with a new B side br The inclusion of album cuts on the Hot put the double sided hit issues to rest permanently br br As many Hot chart policies have been modified over the years one rule always remained constant songs were not eligible to enter the Hot unless they were available to purchase as a single However on December the Hot changed from being a singles chart to a songs chart During the s a growing trend in the music industry was to promote songs to radio without ever releasing them as singles It was claimed by major record labels that singles were cannibalizing album sales so they were slowly phased out During this period accusations began to fly of chart manipulation as labels would hold off on releasing a single until airplay was at its absolute peak thus prompting a top ten or in some cases a number one debut In many cases a label would delete a single from its catalog after only one week thus allowing the song to enter the Hot make a high debut and then slowly decline in position as the one time production of the retail single sold out br It was during this period that several popular mainstream hits never charted on the Hot or charted well after their airplay had declined During the period that they were not released as singles the songs were not eligible to chart Many of these songs dominated the Hot Airplay chart for extended periods of time br br The Rembrandts I ll Be There for You number one for eight weeks br No Doubt Don t Speak number one for weeks br Sugar Ray featuring Super Cat Fly number one for six weeks br Will Smith Men in Black number one for four weeks br The Cardigans Lovefool number two for eight weeks br Natalie Imbruglia Torn number one for weeks br Goo Goo Dolls Iris number one for weeks br As debate and conflicts occurred more and more often Billboard finally answered the requests of music industry artists and insiders to include airplay only songs or album cuts in the Hot while the retail component was reduced from to br br Extended play EP releases were listed by Billboard on the Hot and in pre Hot charts Top until the mid to late s With the growing popularity of albums it was decided to move EPs which typically contain four to six tracks from the Hot to the Billboard where they are included to this day br br Since February the Billboard Hot tracks paid digital downloads from such internet services as iTunes Musicmatch and Rhapsody Billboard initially started tracking downloads in with the Hot Digital Tracks chart However these downloads did not count towards the Hot and that chart as opposed to Hot Digital Songs counted each version of a song separately This was the first major overhaul of the Hot s chart formula since December br The change in methodology has shaken up the chart considerably with some songs debuting on the chart strictly with robust online sales and others making drastic leaps In recent years several songs have been able to achieve to position jumps in a single week as their digital components were made available at online music stores Since the all time record for the biggest single week upward movement was broken nine times br In the issue dated August Billboard began incorporating weekly data from streaming media and on demand services into the Hot The first two major companies to provide their statistics to Nielsen BDS on a weekly basis were AOL Music and Yahoo Music On March Billboard premiered its On Demand Songs chart which ranks web radio streams from services such as Spotify as well as on demand audio titles Its data was then incorporated into the equation that compiles the Hot and this was expanded to a broader Streaming Songs chart in January In February U S views for a song on YouTube were added to the Hot formula Harlem Shake was the first song to reach number one after the changes were made br In July Billboard announced that they would no longer allow sales of physical digital bundles to be reported as digital sales This refers to songs being bought along with merchandise either from an artists website or through another vendor The magazine stated that this was a tactic generally used by certain artists to boost their chart positions Instead such physical releases are now only counted when they are shipped to the consumer rendering the tactic ineffectual br br A growing trend early in the first decade of the st century was to issue a song as a remix that was so drastically different in structure and lyrical content from its original version that it was essentially a whole new song Under normal circumstances airplay points from a song s album version radio mix and or dance music remix etc were all combined and factored into the song s performance on the Hot as the structure lyrics and melody remained intact Criticisms began when songs were being completely re recorded to the point that they no longer resembled the original recording The first such example of this scenario is Jennifer Lopez s I m Real Originally entering the Hot in its album version a remix was issued in the midst of its chart run that featured rapper Ja Rule This new version proved to be far more popular than the album version and the track was propelled to number one br To address this issue Billboard now separates airplay points from a song s original version and its remix if the remix is determined to be a new song Since administering this new chart rule several songs have charted twice normally credited as Part and Part The remix rule is still in place br br Billboard in an effort to allow the chart to remain as current as possible and to give representation to new and developing artists and tracks has since removed titles that have reached certain criteria regarding its current rank and number of weeks on the chart Recurrent criteria have been modified several times and currently as of a song is permanently moved to recurrent status if it has spent weeks on the Hot and fallen below position number Additionally descending songs are removed from the chart if ranking below number after weeks Exceptions are made to re releases and sudden resurgence in popularity of tracks that have taken a very long time to gain mainstream success These rare cases are handled on a case by case basis and ultimately determined by Billboard s chart managers and staff Older songs are allowed to re enter to the Hot provided they chart higher than number Christmas songs have been a regular presence on the Hot each December since the relaxation of recurrent rules culminating in Mariah Carey s recording All I Want for Christmas Is You reaching No on the chart in December br br Billboard altered its tracking week for sales streaming and radio airplay in order to conform to a new Global Release Date which now falls on Fridays in all major market territories United States product was formerly released on Tuesdays before June This modified tracking schedule took effect in the issue dated July br br Billboard s chart year runs from the first week of December to the final week in November This altered calendar allows for Billboard to calculate year end charts and release them in time for its final print issue in the last week of December br Before Nielsen SoundScan year end singles charts were calculated by an inverse point system based solely on a song s performance on the Hot for example a song would be given one point for a week spent at position two points for a week spent at position and so forth up to points for each week spent at number one Other factors including the total weeks a song spent on the chart and at its peak position were calculated into its year end total br After Billboard began obtaining sales and airplay information from Nielsen SoundScan the year end charts are now calculated by a very straightforward cumulative total of yearlong sales streaming and airplay points This gives a more accurate picture of any given year s most popular tracks as the points accrued by one song during its week at number one in March might be less than those accrued by another song reaching number three in January Songs at the peak of their popularity at the time of the November December chart year cutoff many times end up ranked on the following year s chart as well as their cumulative points are split between the two chart years but often are ranked lower than they would have been had the peak occurred in a single year br br The Hot served for many years as the data source for the weekly radio countdown show American Top This relationship ended on November as American Top started using the airplay only side of the Hot then called Top Radio Monitor The ongoing splintering of Top radio in the early s led stations to lean into specific formats meaning that practically no station would play the wide array of genres that typically composed each weekly Hot chart br An artist or band s ability to have hits in the Hot across multiple decades is recognized as a sign of longevity and being able to adapt to changing musical styles Only five artists had a Hot Top hit in each of the four decades from the s through the s Michael Jackson Madonna Weird Al Yankovic U and Kenny G Mariah Carey is the first artist to have a number one single in four different decades br SiriusXM Pop K uses the Hot charts for the s for the Pop Kountdown where radio personal Rich Davis plays the top songs on the Hot from that specific week in a specific year from the s s on also does a similar countdown show called the Back in the Day Replay Countdown hosted by Downtown Julie Brown however this focuses on the Hot charts from the s br br A new chart the Pop was created by Billboard in February to answer criticism that the Hot at the time was too dominated by hip hop and R B It was discontinued in June due to the charts becoming increasingly similar br The Canadian Hot was launched June Like the Hot chart it uses sales and airplay tracking compiled by Nielsen SoundScan and BDS br The Billboard Japan Hot was launched in the issue dated May using the same methodologies as the Hot charts for the U S and Canada using sales and airplay data from SoundScan Japan and radio tracking service Plantech br The Vietnamese edition of Hot Billboard Vietnam Hot was launched on January br br Official website
